            "Klan Speaker Is Coming" proclaimed the headline of a brief article on the back
                    page of the September 22, 1922, 
                        Tipton
                    
                    Daily Tribune. Dr. Lester Brown, "a speaker of force… not
                    radical in his views," would deliver a free lecture from the public square bandstand, and
                    all residents were invited. "Much has been heard of this order by our people," the
                    article noted, "but locally they have not come in contact with it." The next
                    evening 
                        Brown
                    , who described himself as an ordained minister from 
                  Atlanta, Georgia
               , addressed an
                    assemblage of townspeople the Tribune called "not large, but
                    attentive" and distributed cards for interested persons to sign, with about one hundred
                    reportedly responding. He portrayed the Klan as an American Christian organization, consisting of
                    "native born, white Gentile, Protestant" citizens, that stood for charity, the
                    Constitution, pure womanhood, the Bible, public schools, and racial purity. In conjunction with 
                        Brown
                    's address, copies of the Klan weekly, The Fiery Cross, were
                    distributed throughout the town that weekend, containing articles that denied that the Klan was
                    anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic, or "anti-negro," yet raised fears about
                    miscegenation, Catholic intrusion in American politics, and Jewish business practices.1
            
            Within a relatively short period of time, the Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
                    would attain a very visible presence in 
                        Tipton
                    , a small town located some thirty miles north of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . In 1925 the 
                        Tipton County
                     Klan would claim 1,622 members among the county's 16,000 residents, making the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan one of the strongest in Indiana, where the organization came to enjoy its greatest
                    influence, claiming over 165,000 Hoosier members in 1925.2
            
            Although considerable attention has been given to the Klan movement of the 1920s, the circumstances
                    and meaning of the rise of the Invisible Empire continue to be disputed. "Nearly seventy

                            1925," typescript, 34 (Indiana Historical Society, 
                                Indianapolis
                            ).
               
                     after it spread across the nation like a prairie
                    wildfire," one writer has observed, "the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s largely remains
                    a historical enigma."3 Over the past eight decades analysts of the
                    movement have offered widely varying assessments and explanations. Early studies tended to portray
                    the Klan as a reactionary movement based on ignorance and fear, centered in rural or small-town
                    America, and pursuing a nativist or racist agenda aimed against blacks, Catholics, Jews, and
                    foreigners. Similar views continued to prevail in the 1950s; such historians as John Higham, Richard
                    Hofstadter, and William Leuchtenburg stressed the Klan's violence and vigilantism, aimed at
                    white Protestant moral slackers as well as minorities, and depicted its members as economically
                        marginal.4
            
            By the 1960s, however, one could discern a shift from this orthodox position. Kenneth
                    Jackson's 1967 study, The Ku Klux Klan in the City, pointed to the
                    Klan's substantial urban following. Although his account acknowledged some Klan
                    vigilantism, he contended that the "most distinguishing characteristic of urban Klansmen
                    was a preoccupation with politics." During the 1970s and 1980s there appeared a substantial
                    number of works that so challenged previous portrayals of the Klan that one could begin to speak of
                    a revisionist school of thought. Although their conclusions were not uniform, revisionists generally
                    stressed that there were significant variations in the Klan movement depending on locality and that
                    the focus of study should be on regional or local Klans. They questioned traditional assertions that
                    Klan members came primarily from marginal economic groups and that they were especially prone to
                    violence or irrational behavior. Instead, they argued, klansmen fell mostly within the economic and
                    social mainstream. Revisionists concluded that genuine local problems such as political corruption,
                    vice, and the violation of Prohibition played more of a role in generating local Klan movements than
                    did ethnic, racial, or religious prejudice, although often such prejudice was interwoven with these
                    other concerns.5

            Perhaps the most avowedly revisionist work is Leonard Moore's Citizen Klansmen:
                        The Ku Klux Klan in Indiana, 1921-1928. Moore demonstrated that members represented a wide
                    occupational cross section of white Protestants but with few supporters from either the economic
                    elite or the poor. He maintained that in Indiana the Klan movement was "essentially
                    decentralized and community-oriented." Moore's thesis was that the Indiana Klan of
                    the 1920s, although nativist in tone, could best be understood as a populist organization that
                    "concerned itself primarily not with persecuting ethnic minorities but with promoting the
                    ability of average citizens to influence the workings of society and government." Disturbed
                    by crime, political corruption, and lax Prohibition enforcement, Klan members "sought to
                    revitalize a sense of social and civic unity in community life and uphold traditional religious and
                    moral values." He suggested that the extreme rhetoric directed against Catholics and aliens
                    was largely hyperbole; that the Klan's anti-Catholicism and xenophobia were commonly
                    accepted parts of white Protestant culture in Indiana; that boycotts against Catholic and Jewish
                    merchants were generally ineffective; and that there were few if any documented instances of Indiana
                    Klan members using direct physical violence against individuals from minority groups. Instead, the
                    Klan's primary targets were the political and economic elites who had become locally
                    dominant by the 1920s and whom the Klan saw as hostile or apathetic toward moral and political
                    reform. Moore contended that the Klan movement could be described as a "white Protestant
                    nationalism" with a "capacity to arouse a sense of solidarity… to unite
                    disparate groups… to assert a powerful populist influence in community life."6

                        of view. Kathleen Blee emphasizes the violent, racist, nativist, anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic
                        dimensions of the movement, and Nancy MacLean regards the Nan as a petit-bourgeois,

                            document stems from a request made by Grand Dragon Walter Bossert to local klaverns to
                            report current membership levels in the aftermath of the D. C. Stephenson scandals that had
                            tarnished the organization, including his conviction for second-degree homicide in the death
                            of Madge Oberholtzer and revelations of political corruption. It has generally been regarded
                            as a fairly accurate count at a time when Klan membership in Indiana had already passed its
                            peak of some two to three hundred thousand. See Moore, Citizen Klansmen,
                            47; Richard K. Tucker, The Dragon and the Cross: The Rise and Fall of the

                     8 Forty individuals were interviewed for this study; of these forty,
                            twenty-five were old enough to have had personal recollections concerning the Klan in 
                                Tipton
                            . Three persons who were interviewed acknowledged Klan membership during the
                            1920s. Of these individuals, one's name appears on the available lists of 
                                Tipton
                             Klan members at the Indiana Historical Society, and one indicated that he had
                            been a member of the 
                                Kokomo
                             klavern. The name of a fourth interviewee, who claimed not to have been a
                            member, does appear on the Klan membership list. Due to the delicate nature of the 
                                Tipton
                             Klan membership lists, no systematic effort was made to contact those whose
                            names appeared on the lists who might still be alive and residing in 
                                Tipton
                            . Instead, through contacts made in 
                                Tipton
                             an effort was made to interview individuals, including Catholics, who might
                            have had general recollections concerning the 1920s and the Klan. Interviewees were never
                            directly asked if they had joined the Klan, although they were asked what they remembered
                            about the Klan and what they knew about those who did join. The information conveyed in the
                            interviews must be regarded with caution. They were conducted in 1988 and 1989, some fifty
                            years after the Klan had reached its peak in 
                                Tipton
                            . Most of the twenty-five persons who had direct pesonal recollections of the
                            Klan would have been rather young in the 1920s, although thirteen of them would have been at
                            least in their twenties or thirties during the middle 1920s when the 
                                Tipton
                             Klan was most active.

                     contained only a few industries in the 1920s, although a
                    substantial number of men worked in the yards of the Nickel Plate Railroad.10
                    Its population ranked among the most homogeneous in the state. Of its 16,152 residents in 1920, only
                    125 were foreign born, the largest number (49) coming from 
                        Germany
                    , the next largest (34) coming from 
                        Ireland
                    . The census listed only five nonwhites in the county—four Negroes and one
                    Indian. The town of 
                        Tipton
                     also reflected this homogeneity. Of its population of 4,507 in 1920, native-born whites
                    constituted 99.1 percent, the highest percentage in Indiana for communities with at least 2,500
                        residents.11
            
            The only significant diversity within the county was in religion. While Protestants comprised the
                    overwhelming majority of church members, Catholics had been present since the county was first
                    organized in the 1840s. In the 1870s St. John's Catholic Church was built, and during the
                    early 1890s the Sisters of 
                        St. Joseph
                     erected a convent and in 1903 established an academy. With the influx of German and
                    Irish immigrants in the late nineteenth century, the Catholic population grew. By 1926 the census
                    showed 830 Catholics in the county; they represented the third largest religious group after the
                    Methodists (2,503) and the Disciples of Christ (2,195). The Jewish population consisted of just
                    three families.12
            
            Thus 
                        Tipton
                     was not very different demographically from other rural Indiana counties in which the
                    Man flourished. Situated in the north central region of the state, where the Hoosier Klan drew its
                    strongest support,

                            Officers of the Ku Klux Klan." Moore points out that in 1925 although half of the
                            state's reported 165,641 klansmen lived in the fifteen largest urban counties, the
                            Hoosier Klan was not primarily an urban phenomenon and that many rural counties could be
                            counted among those with the highest percentages of klansmen. He reports that regression
                            analysis "confirms that the size of the Indiana Klan in 1925 was not influenced by
                            either the urban or rural status of potential members" and concludes that the Klan
                            found enthusiastic support in both urban and rural regions. Ibid., 59-60.
                            The counties that surpassed 
                                Tipton
                             in percentage of the population who were Klan members were, in descending
                            order, White, 
                                Hamilton

                     The county was also only fifteen miles south of 
                        Kokomo
                    , where on July 4,1923, D. C. Stephenson was installed as grand dragon amidst thousands
                    of Klan supporters in one of the largest Klan gatherings in the nation's history.14
            
            Although 
                        Tipton County
                     proved to be fertile ground for the Klan, the evidence suggests that organizers
                    experienced some initial setbacks. Two weeks after 
                        Brown
                     had made his appearance, copies of Fiery Cross were again distributed throughout the
                    town amid rumors that 
                        Tipton
                     would soon be the scene of active Klan organizing. The Tribune reported that several
                    members of the community had already been initiated into the Klan the previous April, although there
                    was not yet any formal klavern, or local unit. Throughout early October there were serious efforts
                    at recruitment, but one organizer suggested disappointment at the initial meager results,
                    commenting, "I am working night and day to do the best I can." There had even been
                    difficulty keeping the cross burning at one Klan rally, leading to the organizers' decision
                    to use an electric cross on future occasions.15
            
            On October 16 the Klan sponsored a by-invitation-only meeting at the Old Woodman's Hall.
                    Some two hundred and fifty invitations were sent out, and the Klan hoped to attract one hundred new
                    members. While the organizers obtained assistance from the nearby 
                        Kokomo
                     klavern and attempted to create an air of mystery and intrigue about the event,
                    according to the Tribune only about one hundred persons attended, and most of them did not
                    immediately join. But a week later a local Methodist minister, Asher S. Preston, presented a
                    pro-Klan address at his church to a crowd estimated at more than a thousand. In his address Preston
                    represented the Klan as a "one-hundred-percent American" organization dedicated to
                    moral reform; he spoke in favor of racial segregation and warned of the dangers posed by an
                    "antidemocratic" Catholic Church and by Jewish bankers and revolutionaries.16

                        Tipton
                     and in Cicero Township. The other new members were reported as residing in or near the

                    , including two bands, two electric crosses, and a parade in which 350 robed men and 150
                    men in civilian clothing marched. The Klan announced that several hundred candidates were initiated
                    as members that evening.18
            
            Throughout the next year the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan strove to enhance its visibility in the county by means commonly used by klaverns
                    throughout the nation. Members distributed baskets of food to needy families, and robed klansmen
                    descended upon church services throughout the county, leaving donations with the pastors. They
                    staged well-publicized "Klan funerals," featuring huge floral tributes in the
                    shape of a cross. The first of these was held in April 1923 for charter member John D. Smith and was
                    supervised by a company of forty-two robed klansmen. But probably the most successful methods of
                    promotion were the public demonstrations, picnics, and parades that the Klan held in the town of 
                        Tipton
                     and in the smaller communities of the county, such as Sharpsville, Kempton, Windfall,
                    and Goldsmith. The appearance of hundreds of robed marchers and fiery crosses undoubtedly made a
                    dramatic impression on these small villages. In 1923 alone there were at least seventeen public Klan
                    demonstrations throughout the county. On April 24, at an event described by the Tribune as
                    "immense in every phase," a reported crowd of two thousand robed klansmen gathered
                    in 
                        Tipton
                     to attend a rally and parade that featured three visiting bands, two drum corps,
                    horsemen, American flags, and the fiery cross, as well as the initiation of four hundred Klan
                    candidates and an address by evangelist E. J. Bulgin. The following month the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan announced they had organized a twenty-piece band, and in November the Klan hosted
                    a reportedly well-attended state meeting. Soon after, the KKK band leased the Martz theater to show
                    D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation, which celebrated the original
                    post-Civil War Klan. On Christmas eve a large crowd gathered to see a fiery cross that illuminated
                    the entire courthouse square; the event was followed by Christmas caroling by klansmen and
                        klanswomen.19

            Despite such extraordinary visibility, the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan experienced some difficulties in establishing women's organizations in
                    the county. The first effort in January 1923 floundered when the main speaker failed to appear
                    before an audience of sixty to seventy women assembled in the public library. Press reports also
                    show that the Kamelia, a women's group established by former Imperial Wizard William J.
                    Simmons, who had been ousted by Hiram W. Evans as national Klan leader in 1922, competed for members
                    with the Evans-approved Women of the Ku Klux Klan. According to Kathleen Blee's study, Women of the Klan, such organizational differences and strife were typical. Yet,
                    in the end, if Tribune accounts are to be believed, several hundred women
                    affiliated themselves with the Klan within a year's time.20
            
            Quite clearly then, while Klan organizing took effort and some ingenuity, the Invisible Empire
                    established itself in 
                        Tipton
                     as a thriving enterprise within a few months. The operations of the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan offer considerable evidence in support of the revisionist position in a number of
                    areas. This is the case, for example, with regard to the demographic makeup of the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan.
            The available Klan records for 
                        Tipton County
                     provide the names of 1,067 men who at one time or another were members of the John

                            created. Although it reportedly reached a membership of over one hundred, after 1924 little
                            was heard about this group. At the same time the old Horse Thief Detective Association was
                            revived in the county as well as elsewhere in Indiana. The group was widely believed to have
                            been allied with the Klan in efforts against bootlegging and gambling, although in

                            first names were used, so it is sometimes difficult to ascertain whether, for example, a
                            ‘J. Smiths’ on one list is the same person as a ‘Joseph
                            Smith’ who appears on another list. Efforts were made to compare names with those
                            in phone directories and in the 1920 census (where again names were often misspelled) to try
                            to eliminate duplications. Weaver warned that Klan membership rolls might underestimate
                            membership since kleagles did not necessarily report everyone who had
               
                     males who petitioned for membership in the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan in the fall of 1922 confirms the revisionist contention that the Klan enjoyed
                    support across occupational categories. It was possible to obtain occupational information
                    concerning 309 of these persons.22 For this group one finds the following

                        Klan," 151. The number of names on the lists available in the Indiana State Historical
                        Society collection (1,067) falls substantially short of the 1,622 members claimed by the Klan in
                        1925. This opens up the possibilities that lists were incomplete or that the 1925 claim was
                        inflated. However, by 1924 separate klaverns or "suborganizations" had been
                        established in the 
                            Tipton county
                         communities of Windfall and Sharpsville, and this might account in part for the
                        discrepancy. Arthur Phars et al., Memo, January 24, 1924, 
                            Tipton
                         Klan Papers. None of the names of individuals from Windfall or Sharpsville who
                        signed this memo appears on the 1924 membership lists, although the names of four of these six
                        people appear on earlier lists. Of the 399 people who petitioned for membership in 1922, 42 were
                        from Sharpsville and 66 from Windfall. In the 1924 list of members in good standing, of those
                        for whom residences could be established only 7 came from the Sharpsville vicinity and 6 from
                        the Windfall vicinity. Moreover, by 1925 
                            Tipton
                        
                        Daily Tribune accounts suggest that the Klan was becoming more active in
                        Windfall and Sharpsville and less so in the town of 
                            Tipton
                         itself.
               
                  22 Percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth. Of the 309 persons for
                        whom occupations were found, 304 were listed in the 1920 census and the occupations of 5
            
            
            The percentage of farmers declined considerably between 1922 and 1924, as did the number of
                    high-white-collar and skilled workers. The loss of farm members is probably explained by the
                    formation of separate Klan suborganizations in the smaller, even more rural communities of
                    Sharpsville and Windfall. The lower number of high-white-collar and skilled workers fits a general
                    pattern detected in a number of studies, including Moore's, in which the earlier members of
                    the klaverns tended to be more affluent or better educated than those who joined later.23
            
            The 1924 membership figures also reveal that among nonagricultural workers there were more in
                    blue-collar (55.2 percent) than in white-collar jobs (44.8 percent). Fifty (19.8 percent) of the 253
                    klansmen on the 1924 lists for whom occupations are known were listed in the 1920 census as having
                    some blue-collar affiliation with the railroad.24 The occupational breakdown for 
                        Tipton
                     klansmen in 1924 also is in accord with the revisionists' finding that the
                    Klan drew few of its members from either the very top or very bottom of the economic pyramid.
            The differing demographic characteristics of the various midwestern localities for which there has
                    been some occupational analysis of Klan membership make it difficult to draw meaningful comparisons.
                    Although Moore provides occupational breakdowns for klansmen in several Indiana communities, the
                    only one comparable to 
                        Tipton County
                    , in that it includes both sizable rural and town components, is 
                        Crown Point
                     in 
                        Lake County
                     in the northwest corner of the state. In 
                        Crown Point
                     28.5 percent of Klan members were farmers, 6.8 percent were high white collar, 30.9
                    percent were low white collar, 14.6 percent were skilled, 18.7 percent were lower manual
                    (semiskilled and unskilled combined) and 0.8 percent were listed as retired. Thus, compared to 
                        Tipton
                     the 
                        Crown Point
                     Man had a slightly higher percentage of low-level white-collar workers and a somewhat
                    smaller percentage of blue-collar workers (33.3 percent compared to 
                        Tipton
                    's 37.9 percent). Moore speculates that the particularly high percentage of
                    low-level white-collar workers among 
                        Crown Point
                     klansmen can be traced to the high level of Klan participation by county employees

                     was also a county seat, but it served a much smaller population, and one factor that
                    may have weighed the scales of 
                        Tipton
                     Klan membership on the side of blue-collar workers was the high number of railroad
                    workers who lived in the community and joined the Klan.26
            
            An even more significant factor weighting the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan membership with blue-collar workers was the general distribution of population in
                    the county. A sample of 590 white, native-born adult male residents of 
                        Tipton County
                     whose names do not appear on the available Klan membership lists reveals that those in
                    blue-collar jobs outnumbered white-collar workers by a significant margin—151 to 70, or
                    68.3 percent to 31.7 percent—among the adult men who were not engaged in agriculture.
                    Thus it would appear that white-collar workers were actually overrepresented in the 1924 Klan,
                    compared with the non-man sample. Yet this analysis suggests that railroad workers were also
                    significantly overrepresented in the 1924 man, since they formed nearly one fifth of the members and
                    only 8 percent of the 590 whose names were not on the Klan list.27

                            Michigan
                        , found that 42.7 percent were farmers, 28.6 percent were white collar, 24.3 percent
                        were blue collar, and 4.3 percent were not employed. Jackson, Ku Klux Klan in the

                  27 The sample of 590 was formed by examining each page in the 1920 
                            Tipton
                         census and selecting the first and last white, native-born adult (age eighteen and
                        over) male listed on that page. Using this method, 665 names were selected; from this group the
                        names of seventy-five men whose names appeared in the Klan membership lists were subtracted, for
                        a total of 590 individuals. However, one should regard this sample with some caution since it is
                        quite possible that some of these 590 men might have belonged to the Klan at one time, even
                        though their names do not appear on the available Nan rosters. Also, because individuals are
                        occasionally identified in both Klan
            
            
            This distribution reveals that farmers, although a majority in the above sample, were noticeably
                    underrepresented in Klan membership, even when the comparison is made with the 1922 Klan lists where
                    farmers represented 37.5 percent of the members. One explanation for this discrepancy may be the
                    heavy concentration of Catholics in the farming areas of the county.28 In
                    contrast, white-collar occupations were substantially overrepresented in both the 1922 and 1924 Klan
                    lists, and semiskilled workers were very much overrepresented in the 1924 list. It is also
                    interesting that although the high-white-collar category constituted only 12.6 percent of the 1922
                    Klan membership lists and 5.5 percent of the 1924 Klan membership lists, this category formed just
                    4.7 percent of the general non-Klan sample. Thus, while it is true that the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan drew most of its members from middle-range economic categories, the
                    high-white-collar category was statistically overrepresented, especially in the 1922 group.
            The availability of 1920 census figures also permits a comparison of age distribution between those
                    in the non-Klan sample, those who petitioned for membership in late 1922, and those who were listed
                    as members in good standing in the third and fourth quarters of 1924.

                These figures show the tendency of Klan membership to be weighted heavily in the middle-age
                    category, with nearly half of the Klan members having been between the ages of 40 and 59, while less
                    than a third of the non-Klan sample fall within this range.29

                        apparent misspellings in both sets of records, it is conceivable that a few of the 590
                        persons' names appeared on the Klan rosters in an altered form.

                  29 In the case of the 304 men from the 1922 Klan list whose ages were
                        listed in the census (which was taken at the very beginning of 1920), three years were added to
                        their ages in this distribution chart to reflect their actual ages when they enrolled
            
            
            Yet, although its members might not have mirrored the occupational and age distribution found in the
                    county as a whole, the available information indicates that the 
                        Tipton
                     Man enjoyed a broad base of support and that its members, as Moore and other
                    revisionists argue, do not easily fit into any particular stereotype.
            The leaders of John Tipton Klan Number 50 also displayed a broad representation of occupations.30 In 1925 the exalted cyclops or head of the local klavern was Thomas Gregg,
                    fifty-six, who had worked some thirty-five years for the Nickel Plate Railroad, most recently as a
                    conductor, until he was seriously injured in a 1922 accident. He left 
                        Tipton
                     in late 1924 to pursue farming in the southeastern corner of the county and remained
                    there until 1927, when he and his family moved near 
                        Noblesville
                     in neighboring 
                        Hamilton county
                    . Gregg, described as "secretary," was one of a few men to be publicly
                    identified in the Tribune as 
                        Tipton
                     Klan officers. The Tribune also identified E. C. Vore as the kleagle
                    or recruiter for the Klan in 1923 and as the kilgrapp (secretary) in the 1925 Klan roll of leaders.
                    Unfortunately, no biographical or census information has been found on Vore.31
            
            The klaliff (vice cyclops) was a fifty-year-old jewelry store owner; the klokard (lecturer) was a
                    thirty-two-year-old laborer; the kludd (chaplain) was a forty-seven-year-old junior high school
                    principal; the kladd (conductor) was a thirty-eight-year-old canning factory worker. The night hawk,
                    in charge of initiating candidates, was a forty-two-year-old garage laborer. Albert Bragg, fifty-one
                    and a farmer, served as the klarago (inner guard) and several years later was named by the Tribune as the exalted cyclops of the Windfall klavern, in the northeast section
                    of the county. The only biographical information found concerning the klabee (treasurer) of the 
                        Tipton
                     klavern was that he resided in 
                        Tipton
                     and served as trustee and treasurer of the West Street Christian Church. The only thing
                    known about the klexter 
                  in the Klan. In the case of the 223 men listed in the third and fourth quarters of 1924
                            whose ages could be found in the 1920 census, five years were added to the ages on the 1920
                            census schedules. The 1920 census also indicated whether heads of households owned or rented
                            the property on which they lived, but as Moore points out, such designations
                            "provide only a crude measure of economic status…." Moore, Citizen Klansmen, 70. From the census one can determine the place of birth
                            of those listed, as well as the place of birth of their parents. As one might expect, a
                            higher percentage (5.8 percent) in the non-Klan sample had at least one parent of foreign
                            birth than in the Klan sample. Of the 223 in the 1924 third and fourth quarters Klan lists
                            whose names were found in the census, only 8 (3.6 percent) had at least one parent of
                            foreign birth. US., Fourteenth Census, 1920, Population Schedules for

                     (guard) is that the 1925 list of leaders identifies him as a
                    resident of Windfall. The three most socially and politically prominent officers were the three men
                    who served on the klokann, the klavern's board of investigators, auditors, and advisers.
                    The forty-two-year-old head of the board owned a creamery and also served as president of the
                    Kiwanis club and as director of the Chamber of Commerce. The other klokann members were a
                    forty-five-year-old realtor who also served as city chairman of the Republican party and the
                    forty-three-year-old manager of the phone company.32
            
            The local Klan leadership was thus fairly representative of the rank and file. The leaders were
                    predominantly middle-aged and almost evenly divided between white-collar (five) and blue-collar
                    (four) workers, while the rank and file tended more to be blue collar. There was only one farmer
                    among the officers, although over one quarter of the members of the klavern were engaged in
                    agriculture.
            The 1925 list of Klan leaders also identifies a 
                        Tipton
                     resident, a forty-one-year-old carpenter, as one of the three great klaliffs for
                    Province Number 9, which included 
                        Tipton
                     along with 
                  Fountain, Montgomery
               , Carroll, Clinton, 
                        Boone
                    , Howard, and 
                        Hamilton
                     counties. In late 1924 the great klaliff from 
                        Tipton
                     was appointed by Mayor Sterling R. Standerford to serve as chief of police, and he
                    immediately launched a campaign against petty gambling. Within a few months he resigned, remarking
                    that the wear and tear connected with the work were too much for the salary he received.33
            
            Although the great klaliffs official exertions in behalf of moral reform were surprisingly
                    short-lived, the case of 
                        Tipton
                     nonetheless does lend support to another central revisionist thesis: the Klan sharply
                    focused on local concerns, with particular attention to combating corruption and vice, redressing
                    the alleged laxity of local officials, and enforcing the Eighteenth Amendment.
            In March 1923 Fiery Cross began publishing a series of articles decrying the
                    failure of corrupt or complacent local officials in Indiana to deal effectively with bootlegging,
                    gambling, and prostitution, and the paper announced the Man's determination to eliminate
                    vice. It also published an allegation that Mayor Standerford, a Democrat, had formed a corrupt
                    business alliance with Daisy Parish, a local brothel owner.34 In May, with much
                    fanfare and the assistance of the

                     police force, the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan initiated a campaign against selling cigarettes to minors and against permitting
                    minors in poolrooms. As the campaign began, the Tribune approvingly noted similar
                    campaigns in other Hoosier communities and predicted "permanent results" because
                    the Klan had a reputation of "meaning business." The police chief, another
                    Democrat whose name appears on the Klan membership list, quickly announced his willingness to
                    cooperate with any organization aiming to improve the town's morals.35
            
            Prosecutor Alfred Fletcher, a Republican who later openly acknowledged Klan ties and became its most
                    visible spokesman, also publicly endorsed this Klan program. The Tribune reported
                    that Klan members had been "appointed" to watch places where violations might
                    occur. Within a matter of days two poolroom owners pleaded guilty to gambling violations and were
                    fined. The mayor responded defensively that under his administration the town had been freer from
                    crime than ever before in its history and that serious violations such as bootlegging had been
                    effectively stopped. The forces of morality seemed to enjoy another victory at the end of the year,
                    when Daisy Parish's conviction for operating a public nuisance was affirmed by the Indiana
                    Supreme Court.36
            
            Although there is no clear evidence that its editor or publisher ever joined the organization, the
                        Tribune appears to have played an important role in legitimizing the Klan and
                    its moral crusade. In March 1925 the paper, which lacked an editorial page but freely interjected
                    its views in its news stories, remarked that the "drastic" manner in which the
                    county had handled liquor violations "has brought it down to the point where a bootlegger
                    in this territory is about as scarce as Ku Klux at a Knights of 
                        Columbus
                     picnic." As Mayor Standerford's term ended in early 1926, the Tribune praised the high rate of liquor convictions under his administration and
                    boasted that the county now stood "at the top of the dry column in the
                        country."37
            
            The 
                        Tipton
                     Klan involved itself in other moral crusades as well. The Martz theater canceled
                    Charlie Chaplin's film The Pilgrim in August 1923 after receiving a
                    communication from Kleagle Vore protesting that the film was "an insult to every protestant
                    minister in this fair land…., The Klan also pushed for blue laws. In April 1925 the Women
                    of the Ku Klux Klan adopted a resolution asking for a ban on "hobo" auto races in
                    the county, declaring that every child should be taught "to respect Sunday, the day of rest
                    and beautiful

                            Daily Tribune, May 2, 3, 1923. The Tribune also printed
                            comments that had appeared in a recent edition of the Fiery Cross alluding
                            to the alleged ties between the mayor and Daisy Parish. Ibid., May 3,

                     ideals, and to enjoy clean pleasures…."
                    Soon after, races were stopped altogether at the 
                        Tipton
                     fairground, and the management of a dirt track in Windfall announced that races would
                    be rescheduled from Sunday to Saturday afternoons. In August the Tribune reported,
                    "Strange, secretive meetings have occurred here periodically for the past several days.
                    Whether or not action is contemplated against Sunday amusements here is not known, but there are
                    suspicious rumors abroad."38
            
            The actions of the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan must be understood as part of a general nationwide apprehensiveness among
                    traditionalists about a decline of morals during the jazz age, particularly among youth. The
                    flouting of Prohibition, the raucous music and dancing, the sexual explicitness of Hollywood films,
                    and the new personal freedoms permitted by the automobile all contributed to this concern, and 
                        Tipton
                     was hardly immune. Modern dancing, an impassioned evangelist at the West Street
                    Christian Church proclaimed, "is immodest, it is immoral, and wicked. It breaks down all
                    modesty, it cultivates familiarity that leads to brazenness, it destroys that innate modesty and
                    innocence that is the charm of young womenhood [sic], and the glory of
                    manhood…." A particularly sore point was the decision of the proprietors of the
                    Sand Island Amusement Park on the west edge of town to remain open on Sundays and to permit dancing.
                    Despite protests organized by local pastors and elders, some of whom had Klan affiliations, the
                    park's first Sunday opening took place shortly before Christmas 1924 and was well attended,
                    although the Tribune claimed most of the crowd came from neighboring towns. The presence of bootleg alcohol at the park was another cause of concern;
                    after much agitation, a raid, and an unsuccessful effort to prosecute, the Sand Island dance hall
                    was finally padlocked in 1928 for a year under court order.39
            
            Juvenile delinquency became an increasing concern in the community, not only because young men were
                    arrested for the illegal consumption of alcohol but also because girls were accused of sexual
                    misconduct. Investigations launched by a newly appointed probation officer revealed "a
                    shocking and almost unbelievable delinquency among certain young people of the city," and
                    the Tribune published titillating accounts of teenage girls who spoke
                    "with the knowledge and hardness of confirmed prostitutes…." Circuit
                    court judge Cleon Mount called for a curfew ordinance and suggested the alarming number of cases of
                    venereal disease among the young was largely due to late-night automobile parties. There was
                    discussion of opening

                     a clinic in the county to treat venereal disease; a
                    "mother's meeting" was organized to meet monthly to discuss the problem;
                    and in December 1925 a "health week," conducted with the assistance of the state
                    health department, featured motion pictures and lectures on the subject. Although the
                    Klan's particular role in this local campaign is unclear, klaverns and Klan publications
                    throughout the nation were addressing this issue.40
            
            The 
                        Tipton
                     Klan thus acted predictably to lend its support to civic action, with a strong emphasis
                    on moral reform. Yet its involvement in local politics was somewhat less typical. The Klan has been
                    viewed as operating primarily in Indiana through the Republican party, although there were Democrats
                    in its ranks. And in a number of communities the Klan's moral campaigns were linked with
                    party politics; this could be seen, for example, in neighboring 
                        Kokomo
                    .41 But in the case of 
                        Tipton
                    , where the numbers of Democrats and Republicans were almost equal, such a large
                    proportion of political candidates from both political parties had Klan connections that its impact
                    was canceled out in elections. In 1924 both the Democratic and 
                        Republican county
                     chairmen were Klan members. There was a split in the county races, with five Democrats
                    and four Republicans winning— and of these victors, three Democrats and one Republican
                    were identified in Klan records as members. The Klan's showing was even stronger in the
                    1925 city elections. Of the six men elected to city office (four Democrats and two Republicans),
                    four (three Democrats and one Republican) can be identified as Klan members or former members,
                    including both the new Democratic mayor and his defeated Republican opponent. The Klan's
                    own 1925 report stated, "All [Tip-ton] county officials are sympathetic and most of them
                        members."42
            
            Newspaper accounts show that while the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan sought to organize voters in behalf of its slates, their efforts were focused on
                    state-level races rather than on local politics. In 1924 Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed
                    Jackson, with open Klan backing, carried the county against the Democratic, rather cautiously
                    anti-Klan candidate Carleton B. McCulloch, but Jackson won by a slim margin of 293 votes.43

                        and women than about male misconduct, and she argues that the Klan was attempting to defend the
                        patriarchal hierarchy against unwanted social changes. MacLean, Behind the Mask of

            In 
                        Tipton
                     there is little indication of the kind of organized anti-Klan sentiment that Moore
                    detected among the business elites (like members of the Chamber of Commerce) in larger Hoosier
                    communities such as 
                        Richmond
                     or 
                        Kokomo
                    . Unlike 
                        Kokomo
                     where a community elite ran sizable automotive and plate glass industries and felt
                    concerned about nativist-generated economic friction that would be bad for business, in 
                        Tipton
                     a large proportion of chamber members had joined the Klan, and the town lacked any
                    sizable group of industrialists or executives.44
            
            Open anti-Klan sentiment among Protestants did not take any concerted political or economic form; it
                    was small and found in very isolated expressions. In the fall of 1922, just as the Klan was
                    beginning to organize in the county, the Reverend J. J. Ashenhurst of the Bethesda Presbyterian
                    Church, six miles southwest of the town of 
                        Tipton
                    , vigorously attacked the Klan before a reportedly large audience, asserting that the
                    order was un-American, unpatriotic, and unchristian. He soon after sent a letter to the Tribune,
                    noting the opposition of the Federal Council of the Protestant Churches of America to secret, masked
                    organizations that generated religious prejudices and racial antipathies. In April of the following
                    year Judge Earl Stroup of the 
                        Clinton County
                     circuit court, a Republican, created controversy in a speech before the 
                        Tipton
                     Kiwanis club by taking the Klan to task for hampering equal opportunity and creating
                    disharmony. At a meeting of the Indiana State Bar Association in West Baden a few months later 
                        Tipton
                     attorney George Gifford spoke in behalf of a resolution that condemned secret
                    organizations whose members concealed themselves behind robes and masks.45
            
            After the summer of 1923, as the Klan made more inroads in the community, public criticism ceased,
                    except by the Catholics. Not until the spring of 1926, well after the conviction of former Grand
                    Dragon Stephenson for second-degree homicide in the death of Madge Oberholtzer, did the local paper
                    report another instance of a Protestant objecting to bigotry, and this was from an outsider. At the

            One of the most difficult issues confronting students of the Klan of the 1920s is how to interpret
                    the Klan's racism, religious prejudice, and xenophobia. Was bigotry the Indiana
                    Klan's raison d'etre,

                            It might be pointed out, however, that in attacking the Klan Judge Stroup called for

                     and did it lead to actions that posed a threat to minority
                    groups in 
                        Tipton
                     and other Indiana communities? Moore argued that in the case of Indiana
                    "ethnic conflict… played only a minor role in the success of the Klan
                    movement." He maintained that in most instances klaverns "paid little attention to
                    local neighborhoods of Catholics, Jews or blacks…. Given the insignificant threat these
                    groups represented to white Protestant dominance and the fact that numerous means already existed to
                    control them if it appeared necessary," Moore wrote, "Klan chapters generally had
                    little reason to concern themselves with harassing ethnic minorities."47
            
            Anti-Catholicism was hardly a new phenomenon in Indiana, and Catholics appeared to be the prime
                    target of Klan nativism in 
                        Tipton
                     as elsewhere in Indiana. As in other communities the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan organized a TWK (Trade with Klansmen) campaign that not only encouraged patronage
                    of businesses owned by klansmen but boycotted Catholic-and Jewish-owned enterprises. There is
                    conflicting testimony among local residents about the campaign's effectiveness.48
            
            Alfred Fletcher was a key figure in the drive against Catholics. A minister as well as prosecutor, he
                    was publicly identified with the Klan as early as November 1923. Not listed as an officer in the
                    1925 Klan rolls, by the next year he emerged as the local organization's leading public
                    spokesman. As prosecutor he had made little effort to conceal his anti-Catholicism; he even traveled
                    outside the county to Hope, Indiana, to deliver a lecture on "The Beast and His Image vs.
                    The Invisible Empire," in which he condemned "Roman political
                    machinations." Fletcher created a stir in early 1927 when as a private attorney he filed a
                    writ of habeas corpus against the mother superior of the local 
                        St. Joseph
                    's Academy and its chaplain in behalf of Nellie Fortune. Fortune, a
                    twenty-year-old recent arrival from 
                        Ireland
                    , allegedly had "escaped from the convent and found refuge with a
                    "good Protestant family." The case was quickly resolved, however, when authorities
                    learned the girl suffered from extreme homesickness rather than torture and abuse, and she was given
                    passage home to 
                        Ireland

                        that he had received death threats because of his role in the case. The alleged escape found its
                        way into anti-Catholic literature.
            
            
            It is difficult to say with precision just how vulnerable 
                        Tipton
                    's Catholics felt during the Klan era. One Catholic resident who was in her
                    early teens when the Klan was at its zenith testified decades later to the fear and anger her family
                    experienced; a slightly older Catholic resident remembered that he had sensed little apprehension
                    among his coreligionists. The Tribune reported that John Langan, who was active in
                    the Knights of 
                        Columbus
                     and superintendent of the electric utility department, lost his job in early 1926 when
                    the newly elected mayor, a Klan member, combined that department with the water plant. But despite
                    rumors that the Klan might burn crosses at the convent or march on St. John's Church,
                    apparently nothing like this occurred. The Knights of 
                        Columbus
                     were prompted to sponsor two public lectures that denounced movements that generated
                    hate, and at least one Catholic wrote to the Tribune challenging Klan accusations
                    against the church. Probably the most dramatic action taken by Catholics was a boycott of the 
                        Tipton County
                     Free Fair during the summer of 1923, when the fair's board of directors agreed
                    to have one day designated as "Klan Day," at which the main speaker would be
                    Secretary of State Ed Jackson, widely assumed to be the Klan's candidate in the next
                    gubernatorial election. The Tribune characterized the controversy as a
                    "regrettable situation" that had resulted from "a comparatively minor
                    affair." Fiery Cross presented the outcome as a victory against
                    un-American forces and charged that the boycott was really the work of Pat O'Donnell,
                    leader of the 
                        Chicago
                    -based anti-Klan American Unity League. The Klan paper also reported that the three
                    Catholic members of the fair board had resigned over the incident.50
            
            There is no evidence of resistance to the Klan by 
                        Tipton
                    's Jews, the Rosenthal, Haas, and Levi families. Since all three families were
                    engaged in small retail businesses, they probably were not in a position to be very outspoken.
                    People interviewed for this study expressed differing opinions about the extent to which 
                        Tipton
                    's Jews were accepted by the rest of the community. The effectiveness of Klan
                    boycotts is also unclear, although Simon Rosenthal, the most prominent figure in this group, gave up
                    his clothing business in 1925. Rosenthal was a pivotal figure in raising funds to develop a city
                    park in 1913, and during the 1920s he served as fire chief under Mayor Standerford,

                     before the Klan won all city offices in 1925. He was
                    reappoint-ed in 1929 under the administration of a new mayor, who had succeeded the Klan affiliated
                    mayor when he died in office the previous year.51
            
            Although in the nineteenth century 
                        Tipton County
                     had had a small black population that reached seventy-eight persons by 1870, the 1920
                    census reported only four blacks, and the 1930 census listed none.52 The
                    histories of the county scarcely mention blacks, and the precise reasons for the decline in black
                    population in 
                        Tipton County
                     are unexplained, but racial prejudice was common there as it was for all small Indiana
                    towns. Blacks ordinarily left because of greater economic opportunities in the cities or because of
                    overt hostility and intimidation. Present-day 
                        Tipton
                     residents acknowledge that the county has long had the reputation of being inhospitable
                    to blacks, and during the 1920s 
                        Tipton
                    , like a number of other Hoosier communities, still observed unwritten "sundown
                    laws," rooted in the custom that blacks would not be permitted to remain Overnight.53 "Colored" baseball teams, minstrel shows, bands, and
                    singing groups occasionally appeared in 
                        Tipton
                     and smaller county villages, but articles in the Tribune indicate
                    that the "sundown law" was being strictly enforced. Furthermore, the Tribune consistently referred to blacks in

                                blacks in 1900, twenty-two were in the northern half of the state. Also see Blee, Women

                                he especially enjoyed as a youth at the county fair "was to throw at the
                                ‘nigger babies.’ These were made of boards shaped more or less
                                like a small colored person standing up. You threw cheap baseballs in an effort to bash
                                them over. Some such places would pay you a quarter if you would knock down three of the
                                five or six in the bottom row…." Ibid.
                     
                        
               
                     a demeaning fashion, even making joking references to racial
                        lynchings.54 While the Klan's racist rhetoric and commitment to
                    white supremacy had considerable appeal in such an environment, it would appear that this racism was
                    something that the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan exploited rather than generated.
            The situation in 
                        Tipton
                     thus provides some evidence to support Moore's position. Prejudice against
                    minorities predated the rise of the Klan; it appears that such prejudice was not the only reason
                    people gravitated towards the organization; and there is no clear evidence of the use of physical
                    violence against minorities. Yet, whether or not the Klan had "reason" to harass
                    minorities, the harassment certainly occurred. The TWK campaigns in some instances may have been
                    less than completely effective; some Catholics may not have felt personally endangered; and there is
                    even evidence that at least some Klan leaders regarded Fletcher as too extreme.55 Yet possibly religion was a factor in John Langan's removal from office, and
                    Catholics were sufficiently disturbed that they sponsored lectures on tolerance and boycotted the
                    county fair.
            Perhaps Moore's most controversial assertion is that, despite the corruption among the top
                    leadership and despite the resistance they often evoked from community elites, klaverns represented
                    a genuinely unifying force among white, native-born Protestants. Moore contends that the Klan stood
                    for preserving an older definition of community against a newer one based on business success. Klan
                    chapters, he wrote, "forcefully asserted the notion that the essence of community was its
                    shared ethnic culture, not simply its ability to generate profit."56
            
            It is true that the Klan was able to gather under its banners a remarkably high percentage of 
                        Tipton
                    's white, native-born Protestants and to mobilize them in a crusade to protect
                    some traditional values. Yet in the end the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan movement appeared to generate more disharmony in this community than unity.
            First, the Klan's significant attrition of membership suggested its inability to unite the
                    community. In his detailed master's thesis on the Indiana Klan, 
                        Norman
                     Weaver pointed out that few individuals other than leaders maintained membership for
                    long. The available records reveal that the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan, despite the many who passed through its ranks, had difficulty sustaining a
                    consistent membership. Members not only had to pay an initiation fee but were assessed dues and
                    taxes. These assessments contributed to dissension and divisions within the ranks of the Hoosier
                    Invisible Empire as well

                     as to attrition. The tendency of members to fall in arrears and
                    thus be suspended alarmed state Klan officials enough to prompt them to send memos to local leaders
                    urging them to conduct special campaigns to reinstate these lapsed klansmen. Of the 1,067 names that
                    appear in the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan records, 656 (or 61.5 percent) had been suspended at least one time, presumably
                    for nonpayment of dues. Of those suspended, 230 were eventually reinstated, but the figures suggest
                    the difficulty of sustaining membership; in fact 38 members were suspended more than once.57
            
            Secondly, although the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan pursued a reform agenda, its crusades often generated friction and suspicion even
                    within its own ranks. A case in point is the career of Fletcher, who as prosecutor became involved
                    in a public dispute in November 1923. His adversary was the junior high school principal, another
                    klansman who later served as the klavern's chaplain. Fletcher had charged two vendors with
                    illegally selling cigarettes to minors. After it was revealed that the principal had instructed the
                    students to make the purchase Fletcher dismissed the charges, but at the same time he accused the
                    principal of contributing to delinquency. Fletcher was officially "naturalized" as
                    a Klan member in the third quarter of 1924, shortly before his bid for reelection, but he was
                    soundly defeated, even though fellow klansmen swept the positions of circuit judge, sheriff,
                    surveyor, and treasurer by considerable margins. In 1926 and 1928 he also met defeat in the
                    Republican primaries when he ran for prosecutor. During the 1927 controversy over the
                    "kidnapped" nun at 
                        St. Joseph
                    's convent, Fletcher's charges were publicly refuted by the sheriff, a
                    Democrat who had also been associated with the Klan.58
            
            Although the Klan had pledged itself to an anticorruption campaign, and although a large number of
                    city and county posts were held by klansmen from both major parties, they did not appear to work in
                    unison as a political machine, as the 1927 dispute between Fletcher and the Democratic sheriff
                    illustrated. By 1928 rumors circulated concerning the activities of current and former county
                    officials, and in July the deposed superintendent of the Cicero Creek

                     dredging project, a former Klan member, was convicted of
                    perjury and the embezzlement of nearly twenty thousand dollars and sent to prison.59
            
            To make matters worse, in 1926 the Reverend John L. Noland of the First Baptist Church and an open
                    supporter of the Klan was accused of crimes "so sensational that persons who heard the
                    sordid details were loath to believe they were true," as the Tribune delicately put it. The
                    minister was formally charged with the rape of two girls under the age of sixteen, and the state
                    alleged that this abuse was part of a long pattern. Some who had been associated with the Klan
                    rallied to Noland's support by contributing to his bond, and Noland denied the charges. A
                    few days later, however, he shot himself, leaving the issue of his guilt unresolved.60
            
            In addition, there was some fallout in 
                        Tipton
                     from Stephenson's conviction and the subsequent revelation of statewide
                    corruption among individuals associated with the Klan.61 The indictment of
                    Governor Ed Jackson on bribery charges in 1927 struck close to home, for not only had Jackson
                    frequently visited the county, but he had spent his boyhood in Normanda in western 
                        Tipton County
                     and had studied law with a local judge. Seven county residents, including a judge and
                    former state representative who had been Klan members, were subpoenaed to testify for the defense.
                    Another former county resident, R. A. Leavitt, was among the bank officers indicted for embezzlement
                    and grand larceny in the aftermath of the financial collapse of the American Trust Company of 
                        Kokomo
                    , a so-called "Klan bank" that had served as a depository for funds
                    collected for the Invisible Empire.62
            
            After the Stephenson scandals not only was the state Klan organization in disarray, but there were
                    also tensions evident within the local klavern. In 
                        Tipton
                     the Grand Dragon W. Lee Smith was prompted to issue warnings and threats and to call
                    special meetings in January and again in August 1926 to address the rebellious klansmen.63
            
            It seems safe to assume that by this point the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan, like other Klans throughout Indiana, was suffering from declining membership,

                    described as "large," there were fewer attempts to estimate their size. Klan
                    "suborganizations" had been created in Sharpsville and Windfall, and by the end of
                    1926 most of the publicized Klan activity seemed to center in Windfall rather than in the town of

                    of 
                        New York
                    , provoked a cross burning at the Rock 
                        Prairie
                     Separate Baptist Church near Sharpsville and another meeting in Windfall. But by 1929
                    the only 
                        Tipton
                     Klan activity reported in the Tribune was the attendance of several
                    local members at a February province meeting to be held in 
                        Gas City
                    . The paper reported a "large attendance" of 300 at this gathering, in
                    which eleven counties were represented, a far cry from the crowds of previous years.64
            
            After the winter of 1928-1929 the Tribune ceased its regular coverage of the
                    activities of the Ku Klux Klan and began to give coverage to the seemingly innocuous social
                    activities of the Phi Delta Kappa fraternity, which according to a 1922 Klan document had served as
                    a front for the Invisible Empire. The nature of any continued connection between the two
                    organizations remains unclear, but it is interesting to note that the first Tribune article on the
                    fraternity indicated that inactive members might reinstate their membership without paying a
                    reinstatement fee and that the names of all four men listed as its temporary officers appear in the
                    Klan membership lists.65
            
            In sum, the available evidence suggests that the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan from its origins to its decline was something less than a cohesive force in the
                    community. It was also less than a significant counterforce to commercialism and a profit-oriented
                    ethos. If the Klan seemed to espouse traditional values above pecuniary gain—its motto in
                    its own unique jargon was "Non Silba Sed Anthar," meaning "not self but
                    others"—the whole movement was so beset by huckstering and the pursuit of
                    self-gain that one has to wonder not just about the leaders' motives, but also those of the
                    rank and file.

                        In an interview in July 1989 with one of the temporary 1929 officers, this individual, whose
                        name appears on the Klan list, stated he had never joined the Klan and was opposed to it because
                        of its anti-Catholicism.
            
            
            At the top, of course, there were the kleagles and other national, state, and local officers, as well
                    as Klan-run enterprises such as the Gates City Manufacturing Company of 
                  Atlanta, Georgia
               , which
                    produced robes and other paraphernalia, all profiting handsomely. As the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan records affirm, a good deal of calculation and creativity went into the
                    organization of klaverns. The burning of fiery crosses, the attempt to create an air of mystery, the
                    effort to attract ministers and other influential people, the organization of drum corps-all
                    reflected the manner in which the Klan of the 1920s "adapted to contemporary fashions in
                    salesmanship and public relations."66 And if the rank-and-file members
                    were genuinely concerned about threats to traditional values, they were also vulnerable to and
                    manipulated by the rather sophisticated techniques utilized by the leaders. Self-interest could play
                    a role on every level. For example, the TWK program was designed not only to discriminate against
                    Catholic and Jewish enterprises but also to enhance the fortunes of klansmen.67
                    The Klan, despite its objections to the degrading effect on youth of the "Jew-produced
                    motion picture industry," exploited films such as the pro-Klan Birth of a
                        Nation and even produced its own feature films.68
            
            The term "populist" that Moore uses to describe the Klan movement in Indiana
                    implies a grass roots endeavor. There is certainly validity to the claim that local Klans had
                    agendas that reflected community concerns, but one must ask if there really could have been much of
                    a Klan movement without the top leadership, state and local, who obviously had independent
                    interests. Perhaps it is to be expected that the one local history of 
                        Tipton County
                     that mentions the Klan— and then only briefly—reports that
                    "after people realized its leaders used it to further selfish purposes, they withdrew. Upon
                    deposit of a fee of $10, members were proclaimed 100-percent Americans. This is about all
                    the benefit its members realized from their money."69 This is somewhat self-serving, to be
                    sure, but it nonetheless contains an element of truth.

            How much moral reform the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan accomplished is debatable. Its support of Prohibition, antivice measures, and blue
                    laws may have had some temporary impact, but in the long run it would prove impossible to stem the
                    modernist tide. Prohibition was repealed in 1933, the mass media extended their influence over
                    youth, and the automobile continued to afford the young of 
                        Tipton
                     release from parental authority, even if the onslaught of the Great Depression seemed
                    to dampen the more sensational excesses of the jazz age. In a letter to the Tribune in 1925,
                    Fletcher had proposed Bible study in public schools as a remedy for juvenile delinquency and
                    "depravity," in the hope that this somehow might reverse the trend. At the end of
                    1928 the Martz theater announced it would begin to show films on Sundays on a trial basis and would
                    await public reaction. Perhaps some could see divine retribution when the theater burned down the
                    following April, although the same building had also housed the headquarters of the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan.70
            
            The enigma of the Klan stems in part from the Invisible Empire's attempt to conduct its
                    operations in secret, the scarcity of Klan records, the reluctance of former members to discuss
                    their involvement and of many communities to acknowledge, let alone investigate, the role the Klan
                    may have played in their past. Of the two 
                        Tipton
                     histories published since the 1920s, one made no mention of the local Klan, and the
                    other, in obvious understatement, observed that the Klan "is believed to have claimed
                    several members in 
                        Tipton County
                     in the 1920s."71
                    
                        Tipton
                    's older residents generally recall the Klan as a minor or short-lived
                    phenomenon that now is rarely discussed.72 In the last two decades researchers
                    have been able to find at least some individuals willing to discuss their Klan involvement, although
                    memory lapses and a possible lack of candor make such testimony dubious. The few individuals in 
                        Tipton
                     willing to discuss their past Klan connections offer different perspectives. One, an
                    opponent of Prohibition who professed to have had many Catholic friends at the time, continued more
                    than half a century later to view the Klan as a benevolent group that helped all in need. Another, a
                    retired railroad worker and union member, remembered joining when his fellow workers did and
                    remaining three and a half years; he also recalled the order's

                             reports having been present in the 1960s when some Klan records from the late
                            1920s and early 1930s were discovered in an old hotel and then destroyed, because it was
                            believed they could serve no useful purpose.

                     denunciation of Catholics because of their "different
                    belief." A third related how he had joined the Klan with his high school friends out of
                    curiosity but claimed to have left quickly after attending one meeting in which disturbingly
                    "arrogant" klansmen vilified Catholics and Jews.73 The candor
                    and accuracy of such individual reflections may be open to question, but in aggregate such
                    statements reflect the complexities of possible motives. We must also keep in mind that the Klan in
                    the 1920s operated in a context in which joining fraternities, each with its own set of elaborate
                    rituals and extensive social activities, was much more commonplace than today and that Klan
                    membership was often encouraged by local clergymen, if not by national church leaders and
                        publications.74
            
            It seems safe then to suggest that for a variety of reasons historians will continue to find the
                    truth about the Klan movement of the 1920s elusive. If the revisionists provide no final answers,
                    they at least raise important issues that need to be considered. An examination of the 
                        Tipton
                     Klan to some degree bears out the revisionist hypothesis. It gathered into its ranks a
                    broad spectrum of residents and to a certain extent operated as a social action group aimed at
                    addressing genuine social issues in a time of rapid cultural change. It tapped and reflected, rather
                    than initiated, the community's prejudices against Catholics, Jews, African Americans, and
                    foreigners, but there is no evidence of direct violence being employed against any of these groups.
                    It is perhaps significant that the old vigilante Horse Thief Detective Association was revived in
                    1923 in the county in the wake of the Klan's success. Possibly some klansmen took action
                    along with the association against "moral slackers," although there is little
                    surviving evidence of what occurred in 
                        Tipton
                    . The one documented case of possible Klan violence in 
                        Tipton
                     took place in July 1922 before the Klan was much of a force in the community; twelve
                    masked men attacked six strikebreakers employed by the Lake Erie &
                    Western Railroad yards, injuring four of them.75 Although certainly elsewhere
                    through the nation violence and lynching are part of the legacy of the Klan movement of the 1920s,
                    the Klan in 
                        Tipton
                     seems not to have participated in it.76
            
            In the end, populist movement or not, the Klan left a sordid legacy in 
                        Tipton
                    . American populist movements inevitably have had

                    anti-Semitism exhibited by some figures in the People's Party of the 1890s, the corruption
                    and opportunism found in Huey Long's machine—but in one sense or another it can
                    be said that these movements "delivered." If it is misleading to vilify the entire
                    movement of the 1920s as "one of history's most vicious campaigns of
                        intolerance,"77 to represent all its members as demons, or to
                    equate it with the post-Civil War or present-day Klans, it is difficult to find much lasting good in
                    the Invisible Empire of the 1920s. As revisionist David A. Horowitz pointed out in the case of the

            Early Protestant-Catholic Relations in Southern Indiana and the 1842 Case of Roman Weinzaepfel
            
                    C. Walker Gollar
                    ∗
                
            In the late 1830s rumors spread that two Catholic priests in 
                        Kentucky
                     had sexually assaulted several young women. In May 1836 Presbyterian editor Nathan
                    Lewis Rice claimed that David Alexander Deparcq, a chaplain of a Catholic girls' school in
                    Calvary, 
                        Kentucky
                    , had seduced and then abducted a female penitent. A year later in nearby 
                        Lexington
                     an anonymous Protestant writer charged another Catholic clergyman, Edward McMahon, with
                    lewd behavior toward the schoolgirls under his care. Neither charge was brought before a court
                    though both accusations enlivened public conversation for some time. In order to explain the
                    anti-Catholic climate that may have advanced these kinds of allegations, historians of the
                    Protestant crusade have chronicled widespread fear of European Catholic immigration, as well as more
                    specific suspicion directed at the growing number of Catholic schools.1 Yet
                    another, largely unexplored, incident suggests a different interpretation. On May 6, 1842, a priest
                    in 
                        Evansville
                    , Indiana, was formally charged with rape of a female penitent. The subsequent trial
                    gained national attention. Most earlier commentators, as well as more recent accounts of the story,
                    describe the priest as a victim of "a deep-set hatred of Catholics, existing all over the
                        country."2 A reexamination of the circumstances surrounding the
                    case, however, identifies more personal motives and qualifies the claim that anti-Catholic bigotry
                    was widespread.
            Catholics were few in southwestern Indiana before the 1840s. In the summer of 1836 the Indiana state
                    legislature had picked 
                        Evansville
                     as the southern terminus of a four-hundred-mile canal

                     system planned to connect Lake Erie to the 
                        Ohio River
                    . Immigrants flooded into southern Indiana, with the initial population of five hundred
                    or so residents in 
                        Evansville
                     increasing four times over within the next four years, and most of the newcomers were
                    Protestants. But immediately after his consecration in 1834 the first Catholic bishop of 
                        Vincennes
                    , Simon Brute, proposed to establish the Catholic faith in the area in part by
                    converting nearly all of the unchurched to Catholicism. In the summer of 1837 he sent Anthony
                    Deydier, a forty-one-year-old newly ordained priest, to 
                        Evansville
                    , where he found only two Catholic families, both of German descent. The nationwide
                    financial crisis later that same year put a hold on plans for the canal and crippled most 
                        Evansville
                     businesses, but it did not squelch Deydier's fervor. Undoubtedly relying in
                    part on money from Protestants, he began construction for the first Catholic edifice in 
                        Evansville
                    , laying the cornerstone for the Church of the Assumption on August 5, 1840. Then he
                    traveled to the east coast to raise funds to complete the project.3
            
            Deydier left an inexperienced priest named Roman Weinzaepfel in charge. Weinzaepfel had been
                    recruited from 
                        France
                     by Célestin René Laurent Guynemer de la Hailandière,
                    the second bishop of 
                        Vincennes
                    . Upon his arrival in Indiana on October 23, 1839, Weinzaepfel had asked that his
                    ordination be postponed for two years so that he could learn English and seek a cure for his
                    migraine headaches. But Hailandière turned down this request, explaining that he
                    desperately needed Weinzaepfel's services.4 Weinzaepfel was ordained on
                    April 5, 1840, a few days before his twenty-seventh birthday, at St. Francis Xavier Cathedral. The
                    following evening one wall of the church collapsed moments after Weinzaepfel had left, and he thus
                    celebrated his first mass on April 7 before a side altar in the partially destroyed building. On
                    April 9 he was sent to 
                        Evansville
                     to assist Deydier. At first Weinzaepfel resided with Michael Bymes, a young Irish
                    teacher who had been recruited from the East by Deydier, in a 
                  
                     3 Protestant churches in 
                                Evansville
                             included Walnut Street Presbyterian (1821), Trinity Methodist Episcopal (1821),
                            Liberty General Baptist (1824), and

                            , James E. Morlock stated that the city's population in 1832 numbered
                            314. The figure of 500 in 1836 is my own estimate based on the broader demographics cited by
                            Morlock and by Joseph P. Elliott in his history of 
                                Evansville

                     4 In 1847 Hailandière resigned his bishopric in large part
                            because many priests of the diocese disliked his autocratic style. An example of this style
                            was HailandiéGre's refusal to allow Weinzaepfel to acclimate himself to
                            the 
                                United States
                             before his ordination. Had this favor been granted, the subsequent troubles
                            might have been avoided.
               
                     detached, dilapidated summer kitchen on property belonging to
                    one of Deydier's converts, a former Lutheran named William Heinrich. After the
                    kitchen's roof began to collapse, Weinzaepfel and Byrnes slept at the school.
            Weinzaepfel was not altogether popular among the small clusters of Catholics that he visited. His
                    vast missionary district extended from the Ohio River to 
                        Vincennes
                     and across the Wabash River into 
                        Illinois
                    . Especially in 
                        Evansville
                    , according to Deydier, Weinzaepfel's principles "were found too
                    austere for some individuals of the congregation, who, perhaps, had not a very high sense of their
                    religious duties." At least twice while hearing confessions Weinzaepfel withheld absolution
                    (that is, remission of guilt for sin), convinced that the penitents had not yet thoroughly examined
                    their consciences. As was true of many of the other French exiles who had served as 
                        Kentucky
                    's first priests, Weinzaepfel's European Catholic rigor did not suit
                    the generally looser pioneer lifestyle of southern Indiana. In fact, his harsh standards provoked
                    ill will from Catholics and Protestants alike, and some of them soon became Weinzaepfel's
                        enemies.5
            
            His greatest challenge arose out of encounters with a young penitent named Anna Maria Schmoll. Born
                    Anna Maria Long in 
                        Germany
                     in 1819, she had come with her family to 
                  Cincinnati, Ohio
               , in 1840.
                    Late in 1841 she moved to 
                        Evansville
                    , where she entered Weinzaepfel's confessional at the still-unfinished Church
                    of the Assumption. According to her later testimony, while in the box he scolded her for being proud
                    and for dressing better than she could afford, or at least better than her neighbors. Because of
                    this admonition she confided to another individual that Weinzaepfel was "a good priest
                    because he talked to her, and advised her as other priests had done." But on New
                    Year's Eve 1841, without any priest's consent, she eloped with another German
                    immigrant named Martin Schmoll. He was a somewhat older Lutheran widower of some means, who seemed
                    no more familiar with the Catholic faith than he was with Maria—they had met just a week
                    before their marriage. During the previous two years he had appeared many times before an 
                        Evansville
                     judge to face accusations of illegally retailing spirits, provoking a riot, inciting a

                     fight, trespassing, theft, fraud, and rape. Schmoll probably
                    had friends in high places, since he was never convicted of any offense.6
            
            Maria's father, Lewis Long, did not approve of the marriage and asked Weinzaepfel to
                    investigate its validity. Since Weinzaepfel did not know secular or church law concerning this
                    matter, he sought the advice of the bishop. Hailandière admitted that the union was
                    lawful, even though in his mind Maria had committed a grievous sin in marrying outside the church.
                    Hailandière also suggested that Long persuade Martin Schmoll to promise that he would not
                    interfere with the religious duties of his wife. On Sunday, May 1, 1842, Schmoll signed a
                    certificate before two witnesses in which he pledged to allow his wife to raise their children as
                    Catholics and to "never… afflict through word or deed her Catholic
                    conscience." Though Weinzaepfel accepted the bond, he doubted its sincerity.7
            
            Maria had not been to church since her marriage and hoped to attend mass on May 5, Ascension
                    Thursday. She had been taught that Catholics should take communion on that day more than any other,
                    but first she felt compelled to confess her sins and asked her husband to find Weinzaepfel. Schmoll
                    looked for the priest at the home of Heinrich, who told Schmoll that Weinzaepfel would return to
                    church later that evening. Schmoll said he would send his wife, but he also told Heinrich that she
                    should spend as little time as possible in church since he wanted her home to care for household
                    duties and especially to prepare his dinner. About five or six o'clock that evening
                    Heinrich escorted Maria to Weinzaepfel's confessional. Heinrich then left the building, and
                    Maria's confession was heard. Among other things Weinzaepfel chastised her for marrying a
                    Protestant. Maria returned home just after dark.
            Two days later Schmoll stormed back to church and demanded that Weinzaepfel return the certificate
                    Schmoll had signed several days before. The priest surrendered the document and inquired what had
                    provoked this change of mind. Schmoll then accused Weinzaepfel of raping his wife after having heard
                    her confession. "Had I done this," the priest replied, "I would be the
                    worst man in the world!"8 Later that same day Weinzaepfel was formally
                    charged with assault and battery and rape. Deputies John A. Curl and Z. B. Hyellott found

                        Evansville
                    , where he had been called to baptize a child of "Mr. Fitzwilliams."
                    Both officers later claimed that when arrested, Weinzaepfel muttered something like,
                        "Woman—Schmoll—Traitor."9
                    Weinzaepfel was locked in jail before sunset. While incarcerated he wrote to Deydier in 
                        New York
                    , blaming himself for admitting Maria into the confessional even though he knew that no
                    one else was in the church. But "[m]y conscience does not reproach me with the horrible
                    accusation which has been brought against me," he proclaimed, "since I entertained
                    not a thought, or spoke a single word, or acted otherwise, than duty before God obliged me to think,
                    speak, and act."70
            
            The following morning, May 7, Weinzaepfel petitioned for a change of venue, on the grounds that he
                    would not receive a fair trial before Judge Joseph Wheeler because of "the prejudice of the
                    said Wheeler against Catholic Priests." A series of postponements ensued. Wheeler, who was
                    also a preacher for the Methodist Episcopal Church, moved the hearing to nearby Pigeon Township
                    under Squire Nathan Rowley, a prominent local citizen and benefactor of 
                        St. Paul
                    's Protestant Episcopal Church.11
            
            Before Rowley on Monday, May 9, Maria began to describe the events surrounding the alleged rape but,
                    Weinzaepfel later claimed, "contradicted her own statements so palpably, and made use of so
                    many Protestant expressions, that everybody became convinced, that she only repeated in a bunglesome
                    manner the instructions received from her husband. The lawyers themselves laughed." Then
                    she fell off her chair and fainted. Prosecuting attorneys James Davis and James E. Blythe announced
                    that she was pregnant and simply too ill to continue. Weinzaepfel's Protestant counsel,
                    brothers William T. T. Jones and James G. Jones, demanded time for cross-examination, but Schmoll
                    shouted that he would not allow his wife to be detained or abused any longer."

            A group of Schmoll supporters, some of whom lived in his house, took over the courtroom and attempted
                    to seize Weinzaepfel, and some Irish friends barely managed to rescue him. Order eventually was
                    restored, but Maria apparently had not yet recovered. Her account of the event would be completed
                    later. In the meantime the Schmoll supporters grew irate and began to consume alcohol. It was not
                    uncommon for drunken groups to terrorize western cities during this period; in March 1843 over a
                    thousand persons would loot several recently failed banks in 
                  Cincinnati, Ohio
               , and
                    later on "Bloody Monday," August 6,1855, more than twenty people lost their lives
                    in riots in 
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               . Although the number of men who terrorized Pigeon
                    Township after the 1842 Weinzaepfel hearing was much smaller than the size of the 
                        Cincinnati
                     or 
                        Louisville
                     mobs, the crowd was undoubtedly menacing.13
            
            The bail for Weinzaepfel was raised from $2,000 to $4,000, and it was instantly
                    pledged by twelve courageous men. One supporter was severely beaten, and others were harassed by the
                    now thoroughly drunken mob, which roamed the streets carrying torches throughout the night, forcibly
                    entering a number of Catholic homes, including Heinrich's. Their battle cry was
                    "Whiskey on the death of the priest!" even though plenty of whiskey had already
                    been consumed. A few "right minded Protestants" tried in vain to stop the
                        violence.14 The mob finally located Weinzaepfel at the residence of a Mr.
                    Stahlhoefer, a Catholic, and threatened to burn down the place if he did not deliver the priest.
                    Weinzaepfel hid in a closet under the stairs while another Catholic, a Dr. McDonald, distracted the
                    mob by freeing many of their horses from the public hitching post.15
            
            Two Catholic allies named O'Connell and Walsh quickly disguised Weinzaepfel in a dress and
                    whisked him out of 
                        Evansville
                     to the farm of another Catholic, Mr. Neuhaus, in Bornville (now Boonville). Neuhsus led
                    the priest through the woods to the towpath of the canal. There Weinzaepfel set off on his own
                    further east toward 
                        Newark
                     in 
                        Warrick County
                     and then turned north, resting for a brief time at the home of a Catholic in 
                        Princeton
                    . A Protestant neighbor offered Weinzaepfel a ride, but he decided to continue to 
                        Vincennes
                     by himself. Though wolves roamed the area, he was not afraid for, as he

                     15 A note in the St. Meinrad Archabbey Archives purports to contain
                            eyewitness information on the alleged rape and the escape from the angry mob. This piece
                            seemed to run the two events together. See "A Friend of the Saintly
                            Priest," n.a., n.d., "Roman Weinzaepfel," folder 1, box 53, St.
                            Meinrad Monks Papers.
               
                     told Deydier, "God [already] had saved me from the
                    [more dangerous] fury of a drunken mob."16
            
            At the following term of the 
                        Vanderburgh County
                     circuit court, the grand jury authorized three indictments against Weinzaepfel: one for
                    rape, another for assault, and the third for assault and battery with the intent to commit rape. The
                    trial was scheduled for September 1842. The editor of the 
                        Evansville
                    
                    Journal, a Schmoll supporter named William H. Chandler, insinuated that
                    "other, and serious complaints" could be brought against Weinzaepfel. An 
                        Iowa
                     editor claimed that horrid crimes committed by priests were much more frequent than
                    most people might know. But the 
                        Louisville
                    
                    Catholic Advocate interpreted any accusation against Weinzaepfel as the
                    manifestation of bigotry on the part of a few German Lutherans in retaliation for the recent
                    defection of some of their ranks (including the Heinrich family) to the Catholic faith. The Indiana Sentinel in 
                        Indianapolis
                     insinuated that the charges against Weinzaepfel had been fabricated, and the 
                        Louisville
                    
                    Public Advertiser suggested that "the unfortunate priest had been a
                    victim of foul conspiracy."17
            
            Bishop Hailandière read the 
                        Kentucky
                     papers while he happened to be in 
                        Louisville
                     and raced to 
                        Vincennes
                     in order to investigate the affair. He generally did not get along with his clergy and
                    in fact readily dismissed priests whom he judged unworthy of their positions. But after interviewing
                    Weinzaepfel, Hailandiere was convinced that the priest was innocent. The bishop showed his support
                    by not relieving Weinzaepfel of his priestly duties but instead assigning him to the 
                        Illinois
                     missions. In the meantime a pamphlet circulated by Chandler, and allegedly written by
                    Schmoll, attacked that "hoary letcher" Hailandiere and his "polluted
                    Priesthood… who hast through all time filled the land with… whoredoms and
                    iniquities, whose lives have not only been a disgrace to religion, but to mankind." With
                    sworn allegiance to the foreign pope, the pamphlet concluded, all Catholic clergymen had supplanted
                    civil duties with church interests and thus donned an antirepublican spirit. In response to these
                    charges the Catholic Advocate declared that the 
                        Evansville
                     editor had "poured out a quantum sufficit of bile, and we
                    hope that he now feels greatly relieved." Amid these literary skirmishes some speculated
                    incorrectly that Weinzaepfel would jump bail and never return

                             was organized on January 17, 1841. None of the characters described in the
                            present story was listed among the early members of this congregation in Elliott, History of 
                                    Evansville

                     to face the charges. In the meantime, Maria's child
                    was born on September 15, 1842.18
            
            Later that month Weinzaepfel came back to 
                        Evansville
                     where according to one report, "he was greeted on all hands, both by
                    Protestants and Catholics, many of the former calling on him for the purpose of expressing their
                    conviction of his innocence." Although most favored the accused, a significant minority
                    clearly did not. A few men intimidated the proprietor of the Sherwood Hotel, who consequently
                    refused Weinzaepfel lodging. Others threatened to harm the priest, hoping that he might leave town.
                    But Weinzaepfel courageously remained. On September 29, he pleaded not guilty before Elisha Embree,
                    the presiding judge of the 
                        Vanderburgh County
                     circuit court. Weinzaepfel then asked that the trial be postponed to the next term so
                    that, as he argued, sufficient evidence could be gathered. In fact, however, he hoped that with time
                    the anti-Catholic fever would subside. Embree postponed the proceedings to March 1843. fir continued
                    threats on his life Weinzaepfel returned to 
                        Vincennes
                    . This time Hailandière decided to keep a close eye on Weinzaepfel in order
                    to protect him. Weinzaepfel was assigned to serve the German Catholics in the city and also was
                    appointed rector of St. Charles Seminary.19
            
            Since Maria Schmoll only recently had moved to 
                        Evansville
                    , the defense went to 
                        Cincinnati
                     in February 1843 to see what they might dig up. There they lined up over thirty formal
                    depositions on her past reputation, beginning with reports about her family and her childhood in 
                        Germany
                    . George Speidel stated that she came from good Catholic parents, and David Westerich
                    said her character in 
                        Germany
                     was without stain. Joseph Jansen, however, claimed that she was a dishonest young girl.
                    Her brother Lewis Long, Jr., and half-brother Jacob had immigrated to 
                        Cincinnati
                     probably in early 1840. In August the rest of the family joined them. For eight days
                    the family stayed with Jacob above Francis Hein's grocery on the east side near the
                    waterworks. Her father then moved the small children to a German settlement seven or eight miles
                    outside of 
                        Evansville
                    , while Maria remained in 
                        Cincinnati
                     with her closest younger sibling, Wilhelmina or Mina, and her two brothers.20

                         Circuit Court Papers, box 206, file 1. All the depositions were found in the same

            In 
                        Cincinnati
                    , Maria longed for a husband despite the insistence of her parents that she should not
                    marry, not even to, as Hein put it, "the sickest man [that is, the individual most in need
                    of a wife] in 
                        Cincinnati
                    ."21 Maria grudgingly took a job as a domestic with Charles
                    H. and Elizabeth Ann Winter on Lower Market Street. Mr. Winter described Maria as "a large
                    and powerful girl" who actively sought male companionship.22 Within a
                    few weeks he chastised her for repeated nighttime rendezvous with at least one unnamed man. After
                    she violated a curfew, Mr. Winter locked her out. The following day she returned to pack up her
                    things, and, furious with her employer, she hid in her suitcase a silk handkerchief belonging to
                    Winter and some undergarments belonging to his wife. Maria then fled to Hein's grocery
                    where she got drunk with young male patrons, including her brother Jacob. Mrs. Winter later found
                    Maria in the store and was able to recoup about five dollars' worth of stolen property.
            Maria subsequently lived in a variety of places. For example, during the "Big Snow"
                    of late 1840 she resided for a month with Isaac Adkins. In the middle of this stay she hurt her hand
                    severely while washing. For a few weeks in January 1841 she lived with Mary and John J. Webb, who
                    considered her a very good girl. She was the godmother of a child of Earhart Geyer and also rented
                    part of Catherine Rhinehart's pew at the German St. Mary's Catholic Church, where
                    she fell behind in paying church dues.
            In March she went with Mina to 
                        Evansville
                     to attend to her dying mother. During this time, probably at the funeral, Maria must
                    have met Weinzaepfel. That summer she returned alone to 
                        Cincinnati
                     dressed in mourning. For two weeks in June she boarded with Susan Gray at Captain
                    Joseph Harrison's home a few miles outside 
                        Cincinnati
                    . Just before returning to the city she was accused of stealing a handkerchief. She then
                    took a room on 
                        Broadway
                     at a boardinghouse operated by Susan's parents, Jane and Oliver Gray. After
                    only a few weeks Mr. Gray accused her of stealing a brooch and wedding ring. She denied the
                    accusation, but moments after the brooch was found Maria was seen in the vicinity. She consequently
                    was put 
                  one representing those of the prosecution, the other of the defense. Each side collected
                            approximately thirty depositions. The depositions for the defense were more securely bound,
                            and thus when cited in the present text, the number of the sheet on which they were found is
                            placed in parenthesis after the citation, even though the sheets are not numbered as such.
                            Several deponents indicated that they may have heard of the Indiana proceedings against
                            Weinzaepfel through local papers. However, there is no mention of the case in 
                                Cincinnati

                             Circuit Court Papers, box 206, file 1. James F. Willett employed
                            Maria's sisters Mina a block away from the Winters on 
                                Broadway
                            .
               
                     out on the street. A few days later she was living at the 
                        Broadway
                     Hotel with a Mrs. Adams.
            Sometime during all these moves Maria hurt her foot. Several persons, including Catherine Broksat and
                    Rhinehart, periodically checked on her condition. On one occasion they watched her lift her dress as
                    high as her knee in order to expose the wound to several men. Broksat and Rhinehart reproved her for
                    what they considered to be unladylike behavior. Disregarding this reprimand, she later showed the
                    sore to George Kehn by lifting her dress to her knee, this time in broad daylight on Fifth Street
                    between Main and Walnut.
            Perhaps to ease her foot problem she ordered two pairs of shoes from Nicholas Meyer but refused to
                    pay for the first pair after it was delivered. Mary Meyer held Jacob Long accountable for the debt,
                    but he argued that it should be his father's responsibility. Unbeknownst to Jacob, after
                    his mother's funeral Maria had been given forty dollars from her father to share with the
                    family in 
                        Cincinnati
                    . About the time of the shoe incident Jacob discovered that Maria had kept this money
                    for herself. He then threw her out of his house. A few days later on December 11, 1841, he found her
                    with her brother Lewis at the home of John Groschevit. In a fit of anger, Jacob called Maria a
                    "whore," a "bad woman and every thing bad."23 In the presence of Lewis, Mrs. Groschevit, and Kehn, Jacob then struck Maria several times.
                    No one tried to stop him. Two or three days later Maria left 
                        Cincinnati
                     for 
                        Evansville
                    .
            One final 
                        Cincinnati
                     witness, Mary Whitmore, concluded that Maria "seemed like a girl that came out
                    of a bad house [whore house]."24 No deposition actually claimed that
                    Maria was a prostitute, though a later, somewhat related document may shed some light on her
                    situation. In 1855 the Protestant Home for the Friendless and Female Guardian Society opened its
                    doors to prostitutes and abused women in 
                        Cincinnati
                    . The annual report of 1858 described typical clients who seemed like Maria: 
                        deprived of home and family by coming to the city as strangers, and having been unable to
                            obtain situations, or being incompetent to fill them, [they] have been driven to the last
                            resource, and, to drown the sense of their distress, have fled, alas.' to the
                            intoxicating cup; and from that sad hour, their course has tended downward with quick and
                            sure strides, and ere a year has passed, they have been almost irrevocably ruined by men
                            baser than themselves, and in the haunts of nightly revelry and daily obscenity, they alone
                            could find shelter for their devoted heads.25
                  
                     Against her will Maria had been forced into the workplace and thereafter always seemed to
                    struggle financially. She apparently lied and

                     stole at least in part to make up for her economic and
                    emotional misfortunes.
            Early in 1843 Maria went to 
                        Cincinnati
                     in search of favorable testimony on her behalf, but her plan backfired when two women
                    reported to the defense that during this visit Maria had told them that Weinzaepfel never acted
                    improperly toward her. The prosecutors also went to 
                        Cincinnati
                    , yet after collecting nearly thirty more testimonies one of the prosecuting attorneys,
                    Davis, mysteriously disappeared and was not heard from again. He may have been disturbed either by
                    the unfavorable rumors he had heard about Maria or by the redeeming testimony he had discovered on
                    behalf of the accused.
            Incomprehensibly, after all the collection of evidence about Maria the defense decided not to
                    introduce their depositions, in the naive conviction that their case was airtight. A priest from
                    western 
                        Kentucky
                    , E. J. Durbin, was less optimistic. Anticipating another rioting mob, Durbin marched to 
                        Evansville
                     with a group of Irishmen who pledged to defend the accused against possible violence.
                    None broke out, but the first trial, held in late March 1843, demonstrated Schmoll's
                    influence when the jury nearly convicted the priest. Only one juror, Charles Harrington, had the
                    courage to defy threats against his life by arguing for Weinzaepfel's innocence. The jury
                    was hung. Judge Embree ordered that the case be reconsidered the next September. In the meantime a
                    Presbyterian minister in 
                        Evansville
                    , Jeremiah R. Barnes, speculated that Harrington refused to convict Weinzaepfel only
                    because sometime earlier Harrington had made a vow never to trust the testimony of a woman.
                    Harrington adamantly denied this interpretation.26
            
            Barnes claimed that Maria Schmoll enjoyed "the sympathy of the whole Protestant
                    community," but other reports demonstrated that most observers, including her own husband,
                    did not believe her.27 Shortly before the second trial began Maria fled from
                    Martin. She then called Deydier to her father's home in order to baptize her sick infant. A
                    few days later the child died. Martin Schmoll supplied two coffins, one placed inside the other, and
                    allowed the infant to be buried in the Catholic cemetery. But later that night he reopened the grave
                    and reinterred the smaller coffin in the public burial grounds. Maria afterwards fell so ill that
                    the trial again had to be delayed. A later report suggested that the "real cause [of the
                    delay] was that there was trouble in the Schmoll household."28
            
            Weinzaepfel's counsel took advantage of this postponement to ask for another change of
                    venue, arguing that it remained "impossible

                    of the defendant."29 Embree decided to move the case twenty-five miles
                    north of 
                        Evansville
                     to his hometown of 
                        Princeton
                     in the 
                        Gibson County
                     circuit court. But there were few Catholics who lived in the town.30 Knowing that he had no support in that town, Weinzaepfel's spirits waned. He
                    confessed to a friend, "my detestable trial preoccupies me and at times makes
                    me… so melancholy that sometimes the idea come[s] to me of abandoning everything if it
                    doesn't end soon."31
            
            Assuming that Maria Schmoll's character would be discussed at 
                        Princeton
                    , by late February 1844 the prosecutors informed the defense that 130 local persons had
                    agreed to testify on her behalf. Few if any of these persons were acquainted with Maria Schmoll. All
                    undoubtedly had been enlisted by her estranged husband. In response to this planned counterattack,
                    the defense followed earlier precedents by conceding that Maria's past would not be
                    mentioned. Many observers later considered this decision to have been a crucial mistake. Defense
                    attorney Benjamin Thomas actually withdrew his services when the other lawyers on the team outvoted
                    him on this strategy. The prosecution accentuated the fact that the defense had decided not to
                    discuss character, arguing that Maria Schmoll's reputation was not questioned because it
                    was unimpeachable.
            The three-day trial began on March 4,1844, with the excited testimony of the alleged victim. Before a
                    jury composed of three Methodists, two Baptists, two Cumberland Presbyterians, and five unchurched
                    men, Maria testified that not only had Weinzaepfel questioned the validity of her marriage, but also
                    that he had asked how often she had sexual relations with her husband. Weinzaepfel apparently later
                    admitted that he had interrogated her along these lines. It was his duty to ask, he had said, and
                    her obligation to tell. At first she refused to answer, but after his repeated inquest, she told him
                    she had sex with her husband either once or twice a week. Weinzaepfel next suggested that she should
                    try to live in peace with her husband even though, Weinzaepfel believed, it was very hard to do so
                    with a Lutheran. He also instructed her not to reveal to Martin the topic of their conversation,
                    because, as Weinzaepfel reportedly said, "it did not belong to the confessional."
                    He concluded the interview and assigned a penance. Intimate questions in the confessional may have
                    been

                     permitted in Weinzaepfel's morally rigid homeland, but
                    he seemed to realize that they were not welcome on the American frontier.32
            
            Maria then testified that after her confession Weinzaepfel raped her. When she began to recite the
                    prayer customarily said at that time, Weinzaepfel 
                        pulled me from the bench where I was kneeling [in the confessional] and threw me on the floor
                            [of the church proper]—and then committed a rape upon me—and I
                            fainted, but not instantly—I fainted during the perpetration of the
                            act—and after he was done he lifted me up and set me on a bench—after
                            I sat on the bench he threw water on my face—I don't know exactly
                            whether he washed or sprinkled my face. After I came to myself on the bench I said to him,
                            "O God what have you done to me?"—and then he asked me whether
                            I remembered my penance and I answered "no"—and he then gave me
                            a new penance, after he gave me the second penance I left and went home….
                     She said she tried to avoid her husband the rest of the day, refusing to respond when he
                    asked what was wrong.33
            
            Schmoll testified that he did not know what to make of her demeanor, commenting to his wife, as he
                    subsequently reported to the jury, that "I thought when Catholics had their sins forgiven
                    they feel more contented and lively." Early in the morning she told him "something
                    of what the Pr[ie]st said to [her]," but then went to church where she received communion
                    from Weinzaepfel. Not until the following evening did she allegedly tell her husband that she had
                    been raped. He vowed to "take a pistol and go and shoot the priest," but Maria
                    dissuaded him by reminding him he would be hanged if caught.34
            
            In cross-examination Maria admitted that Martin Schmoll had coerced her into the marriage. After the
                    alleged rape her husband treated her very badly, and after the child was born he first threatened to
                    starve both of them, then drove them from his house. She blamed the infant's death on her
                    husband's maltreatment. At the time of the trial she considered her husband, as she
                    reported to the jury, "her greatest enemy." In cross-examination he admitted that,
                    at least at the time of the trial, he did not live on friendly terms with his wife. All the evidence
                    had been presented by Thursday evening, March 5.35

                         Maria refused to answer any questions not presented through the interpreters, who
                        included Philip Decker for the prosecution and Daniel and Joseph Graff for the defense. On
                        several occasions the interpreters disagreed over what Maria had said. Apparently some were more
                        familiar than others with her particular dialect. The jury included Hudson Brown, David Milburn,
                        John Ayers, John R. Campbell, John Dougherty, Alexander Tribbett, Henry Ayers, John Hyndman
                        (foreman), John King, Joseph P. McClure, George Kendall, and James W. Maxam. One report claimed
                        that the jury "knew nothing of the real principles of Catholics." Moreover
                        Embree had denied the defense's contention that no juror should be accepted if he
                        already had formed an opinion on the
            
            
            The following day Jones of the defense began his closing remarks. He speculated that Maria's
                    behavior may have given Martin Schmoll reason to doubt her faithfulness; she seemed to have lingered
                    at the church longer than expected, and also she avoided direct contact with her husband upon
                    returning home. Jones speculated that Schmoll had wrongly concluded that she had had sexual
                    relations with the priest. Martin had admitted that he was madly jealous of his wife. In fact, he
                    testified that upon seeing her after the alleged rape, he examined her genital region but found no
                    evidence of recent sexual penetration. Jones theorized about the source of Schmoll's
                    jealousy: 
                        Mrs. Schmoll went to confession to the defendant a week before she was married; and counting
                            from that time you will find that the term of nine months had just about elapsed at the
                            birth of her child, and as the priest and Schmoll are both Dutch, and both have black hair,
                            it was impossible to tell whether the child was "begotten by its own
                            daddy" or not.
                     While Jones clearly stated that he believed Weinzaepfel had not had sexual relations with
                    Maria, he speculated that Schmoll might have believed that if Maria became pregnant right away he
                    might be cheated and have to accept Weinzaepfel's child as his own. Yet these speculations
                    concerning paternity were proposed as possible ruminations of Martin Schmoll. Jones went on to offer
                    a motive for Maria to lie about the "rape": upon returning home after confession
                    she may have seen accusations of infidelity on the impatient face of her spouse. Thus when pressed
                    upon exactly what had transpired in the church, she may have fabricated the questions of Weinzaepfel
                    about the marriage and later conjured up the accusations of rape. But the priest clearly was
                    innocent, Jones concluded.36
            
            The jury was not convinced; after forty minutes of deliberation on Saturday, March 9, the foreman
                    read the verdict, "guilty as he stands charged" in the first count of rape.37 The prosecution agreed not to prosecute the two remaining charges.
                    Weinzaepfel did not blame the jury but rather implicated, as he wrote to a friend, "the
                    malice and sworn hatred previously manifested by my enemies." He remained calm but added,
                    "Who can reflect without indignation on the malicious slander and wicked persecution so
                    wantonly heaped on a person, that as the persecutors themselves best know, is not even guilty of the
                    shadow of the pretended crimes?"36 Weinzaepfel 
                  case. Several jurors were seated who admitted to holding an opinion that they claimed
                            could he changed.

                                Jeffersonville

                                St. Mary-of-the-Woods
                            ,
               
                     received the minimum sentence of five years of hard labor in
                    the state prison.
            First thing the next morning, a Sunday, Sheriff Kirkman and twenty-four armed men escorted
                    Weinzaepfel to a blacksmith shop where he was chained to a Methodist who had stolen five dollars.
                    The sheriff then transported his ward to the 
                        Ohio River
                    , stopping the stage, at least according to Weinzaepfel's recollection,
                    "on every occasion to show the wild beast he had chained up." On
                    the steamboat to the state prison at 
                        Jeffersonville
                     Kirkman was ordered by several passengers to stop mistreating his prisoner. His instant
                    accession to this request illustrated the first signs of popular opinion sympathetic to Weinzaepfel,
                    in contrast to what Weinzaepfel described as the "deep prejudice that… bad
                    spread across] the whole county of 
                        Princeton
                    ."39 The passengers devised a plot to set the sheriff on
                    the shore and land the priest wherever he wished. The pilot was ready to implement the plot, but
                    Weinzaepfel refused to cooperate. He explained, "I now suffer unjustly under the law, but I
                    trust that the higher courts will rectify the wrong which had been done me. I prefer to be
                    imprisoned in 
                        Jeffersonville
                     of my own free will, patiently await the result, than to become by flight guilty of a
                    transgression of the law."40 At the end of the journey, Sheriff Kirkman
                    recommended that the warden, James R. Pratt, treat the priest with kindness. ‘You should
                    have brought the jury,’ remarked Pratt, "and not the priest!"41
            
            In prison Weinzaepfel was treated well and admitted that he was far happier than he had expected to
                    be. The guards asked little of him, while Irish Catholics from 
                        Louisville
                     attended to his needs. John Larkin, S.J., of St. Ignatius Literary Institution (and the
                    future president of St. John's, now known as Fordham University, in 
                        New York
                    ) every week crossed the river for a visit, and Bishop Benedict Flaget of 
                        Louisville
                     and coadjutor Martin John Spalding called upon Weinzaepfel several times. While
                    traveling down the Ohio River Archbishop Anthony Blanc of 
                        New Orleans
                     gave Weinzaepfel a gold cross and chain to be sold to defray legal expenses. The trial
                    had cost $1,597.92, of which Weinzaepfel paid $184.92 out of his own funds.
                    The Catholic Church assumed responsibility for the remaining balance. As late as the summer of 1847,
                    Bishop Hailandiére had collected only $135.00 and thus remained
                    $1,244.37 in debt. At this time he ran two notices in the Catholic
                    Advocate asking for donations.42

            Three days after the trial Durbin visited Weinzaepfel in jail and then delivered to the Catholic Advocate his account of what he had seen at the "one-sided and
                    unfair" trial. "From an impartial hearing of the testimony, and consideration of
                    the circumstances," he wrote, "I am convinced of the innocence of the present
                    victim of judicial prosecution, and, though no prophet, I hesitate not to say, that there will yet
                    be proof of this." Within a short while priests from both Indiana and 
                        Kentucky
                    , along with (reportedly) the Catholic hierarchy from the entire nation, concurred with
                    Durbin's estimation and acclaimed Weinzaepfel's past piety, regular deportment,
                    and edifying example. To have garnered such seemingly unanimous support despite his relatively short
                    time in the country either Weinzaepfel must have seemed saintly to many or, more likely, this case
                    provided the opportunity for his brethren to rally against this expression of anti-Catholicism. Even
                    Durbin admitted that he had been unacquainted with Weinzaepfel before the accusations.43
            
            The fervor both for and against Weinzaepfel was slow to dissipate. A few months after the trial
                    Chandler circulated an eighty-page Report of the Trial and Conviction of Romain
                        Weinzoepflein [sic], a Roman Catholic priest, for rape, committed upon the
                        person of Mrs. Anna Maria Schmoll, while at confessional, in the Catholic Church at 
                            Evansville
                        , Ind. The work included accurate summaries, briefs, and some verbatim
                    testimony and closing arguments, as were commonly published for controversial trials. The Catholic Advocate described Chandler's tract as "exparte and garbled," "gross and obscene in the extreme," and
                    certainly not appropriate for a respectable woman to read. To further illustrate the so-called
                    "catch-penny" nature of this piece, the Catholic Advocate
                    referred to two portraits presented inside the cover: "no modest person can view these two
                    faces," the paper surmised, "without at once deciding which is stamped with
                    virtue, and which disgraced with vice." Whereas Weinzaepfel appeared calm, resigned,
                    humble, and with "purity of heart and purpose," Maria looked bold and impudent:
                    "A big, gross, German woman, weighing 150 pounds, with a broad face, coarse features, and
                    eye which seems never to have batted, with a cool unfaltering purpose, denoted in the expression of
                    the eye and lips and forehead;—the whole features bespeaking rather the bold and reckless
                    and practiced profligate, than the meek, and humble, and virtuous Christian female." Anyone
                    familiar with phrenology, the paper concluded, had an advantage in this case. Underlying this
                    analysis was the contemporary expectation that women should be submissive to men. Maria Schmoll
                    challenged these cultural norms and thus for this alone might have been denounced.44

            Within a few months the Schmolls's story began to unravel. Maria, at least according to one
                    account, "at the conclusion of the final trial, went on at such a rate at a public tavern
                    in 
                        Evansville
                    , as to excite the disgust, and to raise a blush on the hard cheeks of a crowd of men
                        present."45 On July 4,1844, she filed for divorce. Schmoll spent
                    that summer with friends who had immigrated with him from 
                        Germany
                     and who were at that time living outside of 
                        St. Louis
                     near St. Charles, 
                        Missouri
                    , only returning to 
                        Evansville
                     late in September. In a written statement to the court he denied all the charges that
                    Maria had levied against him, then rebuked his wife as an alcoholic, a thief, and a liar. When the
                    child was born, he explained that 
                        for various reasons [he] did not feel satisfied about its paternity and was so troubled about
                            it that he took a little too much liquor and said various sundry foolish and imprudent
                            things but offered her no violence and after getting sober… asked her pardon and
                            she forgave him.
                     During the divorce hearing Schmoll claimed that his wife had been "raped twice
                    while last in 
                        Cincinnati
                    . What he actually meant in using the word "rape" was that Maria on
                    two occasions had consented to sexual relations with two different men. Before the judge Maria
                    admitted that these accusations were true. In September the court granted a divorce and ordered
                    Schmoll to pay $600 as alimony in lieu of dower and court costs.46
            
            Schmoll left town and soon allegedly disclosed to several fellow immigrants in Augusta, 
                        Missouri
                    , his motivations in accusing Weinzaepfel. According to sworn testimonies given by these
                    families to former defense attorney Thomas and to a Father Kindeck of 
                        Jasper
                    , Indiana, Schmoll admitted that he always had suspected that his wife had entertained
                    an affair with the priest. But Schmoll added that he had fabricated the accusation of rape in order
                    to punish the priest and embarrass his wife. Thomas published these new revelations in September
                    1845 in the Catholic Advocate. In the

                    February 1846 published through Chandler's press The Exposure Exposed or the
                        Popish Plot to Purify Their Sanctuary and

                            received the same endorsements from the prosecution and defense that Chandler's
                            pamphlet had displayed. Drapier also included virtually the same court evidence as presented
                            by Chandler, but he also added details concerning the jury selection, summaries of the 
                                Cincinnati

                     Warden Pratt and clerk W. F. Collum wrote to Governor James Whitcomb on behalf of the
                    priest: "His deportment since his confinement, his amiable and gentle manners, and above
                    all, the evidence produced before us recently of the bad character of the
                    accuser,… have satisfied us that injustice has been done
                        him."48 At least twenty-seven other petitions with 3,478
                    signatures, all promoting belief in Weinzaepfel's innocence, were delivered to the
                    governor. These petitions had been gathered from over a dozen southern

                     counties of Indiana and from Union County, 
                        Kentucky
                    . Most signers were Catholic Democrats, but some were Protestants and a few were Whigs.
                    Five hundred women from 
                        Evansville
                     signed a petition. Male signers came from diverse backgrounds, including
                    "farmers, merchants, lawyers, and mechanics of good standing and character."49 Even prosecuting attorney Lockhart suggested executive clemency based on
                    Weinzaepfel's previously unblemished reputation, along with what Lockhart referred to as
                    "all of the circumstances connected with his trial."50
            
            The case attracted national attention, and the 
                        New York
                     Sun proposed that "The Governor of Indiana should demand the surrender of the
                    perjured conspirators, and have them punished as they merit."51 But
                    Whitcomb, a Democrat, hesitated either to reopen the case or to respond to the petitions, fearing
                    that such a potentially controversial move might prompt many Protestant Democrats to switch to the
                    Whig party. Whitcomb apparently visited Weinzaepfel in jail and told him, according to several early
                    reports, "that he was convinced of the injustice done to him but that politics prevented
                    him from using his power at the time."52
            
            Later when Democratic President-elect James K. Polk passed through 
                        Jeffersonville
                     on his way to 
                        Washington
                    , his wife, Sarah Childress Polk, asked Whitcomb, "Is that not the prison in
                    which the Catholic priest is?" She added that most believed him to be innocent, and
                    Whitcomb assured her that he would release the priest as soon as possible. After nearly a year in
                    prison Weinzaepfel was set free on February 20, 1845. Though some agreed with the correspondent to
                    the 
                        Madison
                    
                    Daily Whig Examiner who called this "an outrageous abuse of pardoning
                    power," most apparently concurred with the Catholic Advocate, which
                    labeled the release a "simple act of tardy justice."53

                        claiming that in prosecuting the priest he had been led astray by prejudice. But Embree made no
                        such retraction and, at least according to Alerding, lost the next election partly because he
                        had presided over what most eventually described as an unjust trial. Alerding, History of the Catholic Church, 535-36. The

            Supporters proposed a grand homecoming in 
                        Evansville
                    , but Weinzaepfel had other plans. Escorted from jail by a priest named Bacquelin from
                    across the river, Weinzaepfel spent the next year quietly resting at St. Mary's College in
                            
                  Marion County, Kentucky
               . He wanted to retire to the Holy Cross Community at Notre
                    Dame, but Bishop Hailandière refused to release him from active ministry. Weinzaepfel
                    returned to 
                        Evansville
                     in April 1846 to serve first at St. Wendel's, six miles north of the town, and
                    later at St. Philip, St. James, and 
                        St. Joseph
                     churches.54
            
            In September 1845 a committee of Catholic young men from 
                        Baltimore
                     sent a chalice for Weinzaepfel to Spalding, asking him to deliver this testimonial of
                    their respect. Weinzaepfel expressed his gratitude on December 9: "I… viewed the
                    whole [affair of my trial, conviction, and reprieve]," he proclaimed, "as a
                    special disposition of… [God's] 
                        Providence
                     for glorifying in the end his church against her revilers." On August 17,
                    1858, he was appointed pastor at New Alsace, and in 1866 became the first resident pastor of St.
                    Anthony at Morris in 
                        Ripley county
                    . Throughout his long career he maintained rigid standards and frequently upset his
                    parishioners. "With grave concern," one report added, "he fought [all his
                    life] against the growth of progressive religious thought in our country."55
            
            When he was sixty years old, partially blind, and quite infirm, Weinzaepfel finally was allowed to
                    retire from active ministry. In 1874 he professed vows with the Benedictine monks at St.
                    Meinrad's Archabbey in 
                        Spencer county
                    . He returned to 
                        Evansville
                     in 1881 to lay the cornerstone for St. Boniface Church "in the presence
                    of," according to one witness, "a vast assemblage of the people, who were present
                    as much to give testimony of their faith in the good priest as to assist at the sacred
                    ceremonies." Two years later historian and future Fort 
                        Wayne
                     bishop Herman Alerding devoted thirty-nine pages of his History of the
                        Catholic Church in the Diocese of 
                            Vincennes
                        
                to

                            appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court with the hope that on various technicalities the court
                            would set aside the 
                                Princeton
                             verdict, declare a mistrial, and convene a new trial. But in the summer of 1844
                            the court refused to disturb the verdict; Weinzorpflin [sic] v. The State, 7 Indiana Reports 186 (1847).

                     the Schmoll accusations, concluding that Weinzaepfel was an
                    innocent man. Weinzaepfel lived to celebrate his Golden Jubilee as a priest. The obituary published
                    upon his death on November 11, 1895, at St. Meinrad again exonerated him. This report also described
                    him as a rather austere man.56
            
            The Weinzaepfel incident was clearly more complicated than simply another example of religious
                    tension in early nineteenth century America. The evidence supports the contention that the
                    accusations arose initially from the personal animosity of Martin Schmoll and probably his wife
                    toward the priest. Subsequently the smoldering divisions between Protestants and Catholics did
                    become part of the story, but even then the religious cleavage remained far from clear. As early as
                    the Pigeon Township hearing some Protestants tried to stop the mob. Immediately after the trial
                    Sheriff Kirkman was forced to stop mistreating the prisoner, and on the way to 
                        Jeffersonville
                     Weinzaepfel's fellow passengers tried to set him free. A sizeable number of
                    people from various backgrounds across southern Indiana not only expressed their belief in
                    Weinzaepfel's innocence but were willing to fight for justice in this case. Ultimately the
                    priest was released, to the satisfaction of most observers. The overwhelming support for Weinzaepfel
                    by both Catholics and non-Catholics who knew him not only points to his innocence but also
                    demonstrates that many, possibly a majority of persons in southern Indiana, did not harbor strong
                    anti-Catholic sentiments. Nevertheless, a small group of drunks led by an influential and
                    contentious man not only assured the guilty verdict but also affected the future of religion in the
                    area. Perhaps because of the scandal surrounding the case, Catholicism in 
                        Evansville
                     barely grew over the next quarter of a century.

            Falls Cities Ferries: A Note

            While the Ohio River was and remains a 981-mile east-west transportation artery
                    of vast importance, it was also a serious obstacle to travel between the North and the South. Before
                    the river was improved by building dams and locks (canalization), during extreme low-water stages
                    the 
                        Ohio
                     could be forded at a number of places, one of which was the Old Buffalo Trace at the
                    foot of the Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                    . Winter crossings could sometimes be made on ice, but for about ten months of each year
                    boats were needed to cross the 
                        Ohio River
                    .1 In the days of settlement and exploitation of the West, much
                    thought, technology, and money were invested to devise suitable means of crossing. Today, with
                    bridges that average fewer than fifteen miles apart, travelers scarcely know the river is there.2
            
            Settlers who were headed for Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                     set out west on the 
                        Ohio
                     below the series of rapids at Clarksville, Indiana, known as the Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                    . Six communities, commonly known as the Falls Cities, surrounded the rapids: 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , Clarksville, and New 
                        Albany
                    , Indiana, and 
                        Louisville
                    , Shippingport, and 
                  Portland, Kentucky
               . The principal primitive trails that
                    reached the area in the late eighteenth century included paths from 
                        Lexington
                     and the East, 
                        Nashville
                     and the South, and westward to 
                        Vincennes
                    . The road from 
                        Nashville
                     divided near Shepherdsville, 
                        Kentucky
                    . The western leg traversed Blue Lick Gap to 
                        Louisville
                    . The eastern branch passed through 
                  Middletown, Kentucky
               , to 
                        Charlestown
                    , Northwest Territory, via Harrods Creek, 
                        Kentucky
                     (then known as Seminary Lands or Transylvania), and crossed the 
                        Ohio
                     to Utica.3

                            THIS IS A SIDEWHEEL HORSE-POWERED FERRYBOAT.
               M. C. Striegel Collection
            
            
            Ferry service at the Falls Cities followed the common history of industry and technology: humble
                    beginnings, improvement, expansion to large and profitable companies, and a decline caused by
                    competition from a more efficient technology. The earliest ferries used almost anything that would
                    float, including rafts, canoes, and skiffs. When the horse paths were widened to make wagon roads,
                    the heavy wagons required larger boats, usually scows. Owned by individuals or families, they were
                    propelled by manual labor using poles, oars, or even sails. Horsepowered ferryboats became
                    practicable in the 1810-1820 period, and in the 1830s steam propulsion began to replace human and
                    animal power, a transformation that took about thirteen years in the Falls area. Competition between
                    owners was unrestrained, even feral, notwithstanding charters, licenses, and efforts at local
                    governmental control. By 1820 attrition and consolidation had eliminated much competition, but
                    ferries and landings were bought, sold, traded, inherited, and even acquired by marriage in a
                    bewildering series of transactions until the middle of the nineteenth century.
            The introduction of steam power in the 1830s made ferryboats too expensive for individual ownership.
                    Ferry companies became large and profitable businesses, capitalized by partnerships and public stock
                    subscriptions. Schedules were formalized, and rates were controlled. By 1850 only two ferry services
                    remained at the Falls Cities, one between New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Portland
                     and another between the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     and 
                        Louisville
                     landings. Since the two services were five miles apart by river and more by land,
                    competition between them was minimal.
            Major technological competition arose when railroad bridges were opened in 1870, 1886, and 1895
                    between the Falls Cities. This competition was redoubled when interurban cars supplemented trains in
                    the 1890s and early 1900s.
            The New 
                        Albany
                     ferry service ended in the early 1890s, and by 1920 the 
                        Louisville
                     & 
                        Jeffersonville
                     Ferry Company was in serious financial straits. A new company, the Falls Cities Ferry
                    and Transit Company, owned by the advocates for a highway bridge, ironically, carried on until the
                    end of 1929 as a public service. No longer needed when the bridge was opened, ferry service ended at
                    the Falls Cities in 1929.
            Ferry trades soon settled into nine distinct routes. (See map below, p. 283.) They were:
                        
                     1) from the mouth of Falling Run, a mile and a half below downtown New

                                , probably Ferry Street;
                     5) from the mouth of Silver Creek at the western edge of Clarksville to the Point, in
                                Shippingport, within easy reach of Tarascon's Mills;
                     
                     6) from Spring Street in

                     9) between Utica, Indiana, and Harrods Creek, 
                                    Kentucky
                                .
                  
                    
            
            Other more or less maverick routes served the various communities from time to time.
            John Campbell owned much land below the falls in what was then the county of Jefferson, 
                        Virginia
                    . In 1785 the commonwealth of 
                        Virginia
                     granted the earliest franchise in that vicinity to 
                        Campbell
                    , between his land in 
                        Jefferson County
                     across the Ohio River to the mouth of Silver Creek and Mill Run.
                    There is no evidence that 
                        Campbell
                     ever exercised his ferry rights.4
            
            James Noble Wood kept the ferry between Utica, Indiana, and Harrods Creek, 
                        Kentucky
                    , from 1794 until about 1825. That location was favored by many settlers because it
                    bypassed the dangerous Falls and 
                        Louisville
                    , then regarded as an extremely unhealthy place because of malaria and miasmic diseases.
                    Occasionally traffic reversed when settlers fled Indian attacks at Pigeon Roost and other points
                    between the Falls and 
                        Vincennes
                    . Service began with a five-passenger canoe, which was replaced by a scow large enough
                    to carry wagons, teams, and cattle. The ferry carried an immense traffic in 1810, and often long
                    lines of wagons waited their turns to cross the river.5 Wood also provided hotel
                    and stable accommodations for travelers.
            In August 1799 William Croghan, brother-in-law of George Rogers Clark and owner of Locust Grove, a
                    plantation in 
                        Kentucky
                    , established a ferry to the Indiana shore by way of Six Mile Island. Run by a Mr. Ward,
                    it was of little importance and mainly a personal convenience for Croghan.6
            
            The Clarksville and Shippingport ferry service began at Gut Ford on Silver Creek, used by Indians and
                    hunters when that stream was impassable. This early ferry was owned by John Carson, a squatter.
                    Later Richard Aston, Carson's son-in-law, expanded the ferry route to cross the 
                        Ohio
                     between the mouth of Silver Creek and the Point in Shippingport. In 1816 Aston sold the
                    Silver Creek-to-Shippingport ferry to Moses McCann.7 In 1817 the land between
                    Silver Creek and Mill Run, about a half-mile upriver, was sold to William Wright: who bought the
                    ferry from Moses McCann in 1824.9

            William Wright was an innovative owner who converted the ferry scow from manual propulsion to
                    horsepower and provided shore facilities for his customers. Wright heavily advertised his ferry in
                    the newspapers for more than a decade.

            In 1805 Joseph Oatman, a hunter, settled on land at the mouth of Falling Run, just below the site of
                    New 
                        Albany
                    . The important 
                        Vincennes
                        Pike
                     abutted the northern edge of Oatman's property. Oatman and his sons, George,
                    Jesse, and John, started a ferry, possibly in 1805, when the family immigrated to Indiana Territory
                    from 
                        Pennsylvania
                    ." It is said they ‘set people over’ the 
                        Ohio
                     in a canoe free of charge until they were granted a license in 1807.12 Oatman's Landing was directly across the river from land owned by William Lytle at
                    the foot of Duncan Street in West 
                        Louisville
                    . Aaron Fontaine bought Lytle's tract in 1814.13 It is not
                    clear whether both families operated boats or the Oatmans simply used Lytle's and
                    Fontaine's landing. Joseph Oatman died in 1812, and in 1814 his widow, Christiana, married
                    John Pittman, who gave bond that he would manage her farm and the ferry in her family's
                    behalf. The farm was sold to Fontaine in 1822. It is possible that ferries owned by the Oatman,
                    Snider, and Fontaine families shared the route for a decade or more.14
            
            The Oatman family had a close alliance with the Snider family, members of whom also kept a ferry. In

                    brothers John and Anthony had bought the ferry in about 1816. The ferry continued to be known as
                    Oatman's. A November 18, 1820, advertisement in the New 
                        Albany
                     Chronicle gave the owner's name as Jacob Oatman, apparently a mildly deceitful
                    combination of Jacob Snider's first name with the Oatman surname to exploit the Oatman
                    reputation; there was no Jacob Oatman.17 The Sniders continued operations with
                    Fontaine until about 1823, when the ferry was abandoned. George Oatman became a preacher in 
                        Georgetown
                    , Indiana, while Jesse and John became tanners.18

                        Kentucky
                     made arrangements such as that between Oatman and Fontaine more or less common. It also
                    tended to foster competition on routes in which a landowner on one side of the river might permit
                    several ferries to land on his property while their keepers were obliged to use separate landings on
                    the other. Public landings were available for all upon payment of rentals and wharfage fees to city
                    or county governments.

                     from Paul included Trueblood's ferry rights, which
                    were sold to J. Sproatt, or Spratt, a week before the Scribner takeover.20 A
                    person known as ‘Sproud, the Ferryman’ ran the ferry for the Scribners until
                    about 1816.21
            
            The Scribners sold a large number of lots, one of which included the ferry landing, to Stephen Smith
                    and Charles Paxson on December 5, 1816.22 When Smith died, his four daughters
                    inherited his half of the Smith & Paxson Ferry, which was continued until 1822. They sold
                    their ferry rights to Mason Fitch,23 who sold them to Peleg Underwood August 3,
                        1830.24 Peleg Underwood sold the ferry to J. Underwood in 1834.
            In 1816 John Conners came to New 
                        Albany
                     and purchased several lots, one of which included ferry rights. It was at Upper Fifth
                    Street, only one block, or 320 feet, from Smith & Paxson's landing, which placed
                    Conners in direct competition with them.25 By 1847 Conners and his son Thomas,
                    who formed the New 
                        Albany
                     & 
                        Portland
                     Ferry Company, had full control and maintained exclusive rights to the landings in both
                    New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Portland
                    . Various partners were taken into the company, including Captains Frank McHarry and
                    Moses Irwin. In about 1858 Moses F. Irwin, James F. Irwin, John Hunter, and William A. Duckwall
                    became partners in the New 
                        Albany
                     & 
                        Portland
                     Ferry Company.26 In 1881 the firm was reincorporated as the 
                        Portland
                     & New 
                        Albany
                     Ferry Company.27
            
            The end came when the ferry was bought by the New 
                        Albany
                     Belt & Terminal Railroad in 1891. The ferry service was abandoned soon
                    thereafter, but the boats continued to do excursion work for a number of years. The New 
                        Albany
                     Belt & Terminal was later absorbed by the 
                        Kentucky
                     & Indiana Bridge Company, which built a bridge to 
                        Portland
                    , by that time a part of 
                  Louisville,
                            Kentucky

                        Albany
                     was kept by Caleb Newman, near Elizabeth, Indiana. Newman was a leading citizen of New

                            enterprises. He died in 1857, and his tomb was cut into a cliff eleven miles below New 
                                Albany
                            , where according to local myth he was interred standing erect behind a stone
                            porthole overlooking the Ohio River through which he could curse
                            passing steamboats. Steamboat pilots blew whistle salutes to foil the curse until the 1950s.

            Epaphras Jones, a 
                        Connecticut
                     Revolutionary War veteran, bought a tract of 100 acres on the eastern boundary of New 
                        Albany
                     from William Clark.28 He subdivided the property and named it 
                        Providence
                    . Jones's ferry served between

                        Portland

                    rights granted by the commonwealth of 
                        Kentucky
                     in Shippingport, successively owned by William Lytle, Henry Clay, the famous statesman
                    and frequent presidential candidate, and Henry M. Shreve, may also have competed with the New 
                        Albany
                     and Clarksville ferries.
            Ferry services between 
                        Louisville
                     and 
                        Jeffersonville
                     followed the same hectic path of development as those of New 
                        Albany
                    , with free-for-all competition from the beginning. Marston G. Clark received the first
                    formal 
                        Jeffersonville
                     ferry charter from Indiana Territory October 12, 1802. He sold out to James Lemon in
                    1816, the same year a new ferry was established at 
                        Fulton
                     Street by Dr. Samuel Meriwether.30
            
            By 1815 at least ten ferries served 
                        Clark County
                     (which included much of 
                        Floyd County
                     until 1819), owned by Richard Aston, Joseph Bowman, Marston G. Clark, William Clark,
                    Peter McDonald, Robert Patterson, John Pettitt, William Plaskett, Nathaniel Scribner, and James
                    Noble Wood. The routes and landings of several of these are unknown, and many of them may have
                    competed between the same public landings. By 1820 attrition and consolidation eliminated most of
                    them.
            Marston Clark owned the ferry from October 12, 1802, until March 4, 1815, when it was sold to James
                    Lemon. Lemon sold to Robert Fray October 9,1822, and Fray sold to George White December 19, 1822.31
            
            In 1820 George White received a grant from the state of Indiana to consolidate many of these ferries.
                    By 1832 the owners included Athanasius Wathen and Ephraim Gilmore, who formed the 
                        Louisville
                     & 
                        Jeffersonville
                     Ferry Company, the longest-lived and most successful of all.
            By July 22,1838, Gilmore was bought out and the owners were John Shallcross (a delightful name for a
                    ferryman), James J. Thompson, Charles M. Strader, and Athanasius Wathen.32 Later
                    owners' names read like a Who's Who of western rivers steamboat
                    capitalists and included captains Zachary M. Sherley, William C. Hite, and

            In 1865 the new North & South Ferry Company was formed by William C. Hite, Pinckney Varble,
                    Richard J. Woolfolk, and William J. May to run between a point in 
                        Jeffersonville
                     to a point between Floyd and 
                        Clay
                     Streets, formerly Geiger's Landing, in 
                        Louisville
                    . Since it was owned by several partners in the older line, this may have been a gambit
                    by the 
                        Louisville
                     & 
                        Jeffersonville
                     Ferry Company to control those landings. It vanished without a trace.34
            
            Ferry companies at both New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Jeffersonville
                     flourished in the period from 1835 to 1870. The opening of the 
                        Louisville
                     Bridge in 1870 began serious railroad competition with the ferries. Passengers could
                    make uninterrupted and rapid trips between New 
                        Albany
                    , Clarksville, and 
                        Louisville
                    , but vehicular traffic still was obliged to use the boats.35 The
                    opening of the 
                        Kentucky
                     & Indiana Bridge Company's span in 1886 was the deathblow for the 
                        Portland
                     & New 
                        Albany
                    , for the bridge had carriageways for vehicles in addition to the railway tracks.36 Ferry traffic declined even more when the Big Four Railroad Bridge opened in

                        Jeffersonville
                     Ferry Company developed Fern Grove, a resort and amusement park on the Indiana shore
                    about thirteen miles above 
                        Jeffersonville
                    ; the company also shared ownership of Sugar Grove, another resort about the same
                    distance below New 
                        Albany
                    , with the

                        Albany
                     Ferry Company. These resorts, beyond the reach of railways and good roads, became
                    important sources of revenue for the ferry companies, which transported vast crowds to their
                    attractions. Hotels, rental cabins, restaurants, dance halls, and amusement park rides were
                    provided.

                    1917 did much damage to the fleet and landing flats, and competition from every direction plagued
                    the company. By 1919 civic organizations and private

                     citizens alike deplored the quality of service.38 In December 1920 a group of promoters within the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     Chamber of Commerce, all advocates of a new highway bridge, formed the Falls Cities
                    Ferry & Transportation Company to keep the ferries running until the bridge could be built.
                    David B. G. Rose, Froman M. Coots, John Geiger, William T. Ingram, and Charles Antz were officers.
                    Harlan D. Sanders, secretary of the chamber and later renowned for fried chicken, was an
                        investor.39
            
            Two steel-hulled steamers and two steel landing flats were purchased from the Wiggins Ferry Company
                    of 
                        St. Louis
                     to replace the aged fleet.40 One of the steamers was converted to a
                    modern diesel-electric drive in 1925.41 Both served until the end.
            The 
                        Louisville
                     Municipal Bridge, now the Clark Memorial Bridge, was opened between 
                        Jeffersonville
                     and 
                        Louisville
                     in October 1929. To fulfill charter conditions, the ferry ran until December 31,1929.
                    The owners sold the equipment, breathed a collective sigh of relief, and promptly disbanded the
                    company, ending 145 years of ferry service in the Falls Cities.42
            
            During the pioneer period ferryboats were propelled by manual labor using poles, paddles, or oars.
                    Service was provided on demand. The perfection of the steamboat in 1807 and its adaptation to the
                    western rivers in 1811 had no effect on ferry equipment in the Falls Cities area for two decades.
                    The biggest early change occurred when paths and trails were improved to become wagon roads. Ferry
                    owners replaced rafts and small boats with well-made scows ranging from forty to sixty feet in
                    length by twenty to twenty-five feet in width.
            Ferry franchises required their keepers to build and maintain approach roads between the high-and
                    low-water marks at landings. Owners building such approaches often limited their efforts to clearing
                    away the trees and underbrush, but at the busier landings owners installed corduroyed log or
                    cobblestone roads to provide better footing for vehicles and animals. Asphalt and concrete were
                    uncommon until the 1920s. Patrons used a bell, supported on pole or tree, to call the ferry from the
                    opposite shore.43
            
            First mentioned in 1824, by the 1880s all the Falls Cities ferries had landing floats, called flats,
                    equipped with one or more stages to reach the wharf. A hinged section of rail on the ferry that
                    formed

                     a short bridge when dropped onto the deck of the flat spanned
                    the gap between flat and ferry. Flats ranged from open-decked hulls to rather elaborate models with
                    waiting rooms, ticket booths, and other conveniences.
            When the Scribners took over Martin Trueblood's ferry in 1813, it used a scow propelled by
                    oars.& The Oatmans, too, had a scow, but they carried passengers in skiffs for many years.
                    In 1816 Scribner sold his ferry to Paxson and Smith, who replaced the scow with a horse-powered
                    ferryboat consisting of two flatboats joined by deck timbers. The horses walked a
                    ‘tramp-wheel’ through hatches in the deck.45 The Oatmans
                    met this competition with a horsepowered inclined treadmill system that drove side paddlewheels.46 When William Wright took over the Clarksville and Shippingport ferry he
                    quickly provided a horse ferryboat, or ‘team-boat.’47 A
                    horse ferryboat ran between 
                        Jeffersonville
                     and Geiger's Landing in the late 1820s.48 Horsepowered
                    boats persisted elsewhere for many decades, one of the last being built at the Howard shipyard in
                        1880.49
            
            The first steampowered ferryboat at the Falls Cities appeared on October 8, 1831. The vessel was
                    named simply Steam Ferry Boat and ran between Spring Street in 
                        Jeffersonville
                     and the foot of Second Street, just above the mouth of Beargrass Creek, in 
                        Louisville
                    . An advertisement in the Daily 
                            Louisville
                         Public Advertiser of that date promoted the new service:
            
                    STEAM FERRY BOAT
                    A new and splendid Steam Ferry Boat is now running continually from
                        Gray's Wharf, 
                            Louisville
                        , to 
                            Jeffersonville
                        . Persons wishing to cross will find her the most safe, convenient and comfortable
                        way of crossing that has ever been offered between those two places, for either business or
                        pleasure. She is very large and commodious, for wagons, carriages, gigs, horses and stock, and
                        being built expressly for this ferry, it is hoped she may receive a share of public patronage.

            The adjective ‘safe’ proved to be ill chosen, for on November 9, 1831, the Steam Ferry Boat exploded at the foot of Spring Street, killing four men outright.
                    Another died within a week.51 The horse ferries

                    James Howard built the ferry using black locust timbers, which proved to be very durable. The Black
                    Locust's superstructure was rebuilt in 1847, and the hull lasted until the ferryboat was
                    cut down by ice in the winter of 1866—1867.52
            
            Later steam ferryboats were designed in one of three configurations, determined by hull shape and by
                    paddlewheel location. By far the most common were sidewheelers, with independently controlled
                    paddlewheels on each side. They were fast and extremely maneuverable because one wheel could come
                    ahead while the other backed, turning the boat almost on its axis. Sternwheel ferryboats were not so
                    handy, but they were cheaper to build and operate, since they needed but one engineer. Some small
                    ferryboats were built ‘bootjack’ style with a ‘U’-shaped
                    recess at the stern in which the paddlewheel turned. The name was derived from the hull shape, which
                    resembled the familiar household bootjack. No propeller-driven ferryboats served the Falls Cities.
            Boilers were enclosed in a superstructure designed to occupy as little deck area as possible. The
                    paddlewheels for bootjack and catamaran hulls were included in that space. Sidewheelers had the
                    wheels enclosed outside the hull, supported by the flaring guard deck, with passages between the
                    cabin and the wheel housings on each side for vehicles to reach the after deck. Passenger cabins on
                    the smaller ferries were on the main deck in spaces not needed for anything else. On the larger
                    boats the passenger cabin was on the second, or boiler deck, so-named because it was above the
                    boilers. Passenger accommodations were stringently functional, furnished with wooden benches and
                    little else. Water closets were unknown on the ferries; toilet facilities were open privies and the
                    waste dropped directly to the river through the seat, which gave patrons a terrifying view of the
                    water rushing below.53
            
            The final improvement to ferries in the area was the conversion from steam to diesel-electric drive
                    on the Froman M. Coots, rebuilt from the W. S. McChesney, Jr.,
                    in 1925. The drive consisted of the diesel engine prime mover direct-connected to a direct current
                    dynamo, which drove larger motors. Speed and reversing were controlled by double-ended rheostats in
                    the pilothouse, which changed the current in the field coils. An impressive display of arcs and

                    change of speed or direction.54 The paddlewheels remained.
            A body of law governed ferries in the 
                        Virginia
                     statutes long before the first Falls Cities ferries began to operate. Ferry owners were
                    required to keep the ferry in continuous operation, either upon demand or by schedule, and build and
                    maintain access roads. Enabling acts established rates, and laws specified penalties for overcharges
                    or denial of immediate passage to travelers.55 Indiana and 
                        Kentucky
                     statutes were similar. This 
                        Virginia
                     legislature enactment of 1779 may be regarded as typical:
            
                    WHEREAS it is represented to this general assembly, that public ferries at the places hereinafter
                        mentioned, will be of great advantage to travellers and others: Be it therefore
                            enacted, that public ferries be constantly kept at the following places, and the rates
                        for passing same shall be as follows, that is to say:… the price for a man three
                        shillings, and for a horse the same… for every coach, chariot, or waggon, and the
                        driver thereof, the same as for six horses; for every cart or four wheel chaise, and the driver
                        thereof, the same as for four horses; for every two wheel chaise or chair, the same as for two
                        horses; for every hogshead of tobacco, as for one horse, for every head of neat cattle, as for
                        one horse; for every sheep, goat, or lamb, one fifth part of the ferriage for one horse; and for
                        every hog, one fourth part of the ferriage for one horse, and no more. And if any ferry-keeper
                        shall presume to demand or receive, from any person or persons whatsoever, any greater rates
                        than is hereby allowed… he shall for every such offense, forfeit and pay to the party
                        grieved, the ferriages demanded or received, and ten shillings, to be recovered with costs
                        before a justice of peace of the county where such offense shall be committed.56
               
                
            After Indiana became a territory and then a state and 
                        Kentucky
                     became a commonwealth, the laws and regulations were muddled by state boundaries. 
                        Kentucky
                    's government had no jurisdiction over ferry rights and landings in Indiana,
                    nor could Indiana enforce rules on the 
                        Kentucky
                     side. This led to much unregulated competition and questions such as ‘may a 
                        Kentucky
                     chartered ferry land or be denied landing at any place in Indiana’ were
                    mooted from time to time with no real answer. In general, public landings were open to all who paid
                    wharfage charges and taxes, but the owners of private landings could restrict the use of their land
                    as they saw fit. Thus ferries could be restricted to one landing on one side of the river but could
                    land anywhere on the opposite shore. The river, itself, was made open to all by the Supreme Court
                    decision in Gibbons v. Ogden in 1824, which annulled state navigation monopoly
                        laws.57
            
            Governmental agencies taxed ferrymen as quickly as they could manage. The taxes were often absurdly
                    low. The highest tax in 
                        Floyd County
                     in 1821 was only fifteen dollars per year, but rural ferries

                     paid as little as three dollars.58 Wharfage
                    fees were another matter. In 1867 the 
                        Portland
                     & New 
                        Albany
                     Ferry Company was charged one hundred dollars for the privilege of landing at the 
                        Portland
                     Wharf, while the busier 
                        Louisville

                        Jeffersonville
                     Ferry Company was charged thirteen hundred dollars.59
            
            Boats, including ferryboats, carried such lifesaving equipment as their owners deemed appropriate.
                    Many did not even have railings. Their estimates of need were more strongly influenced by costs than
                    by concern for safety, since virtually no safety regulations existed before the passage of the weak
                    1838 Steamboat Inspection Act. That federal act was flawed by having few provisions for inspection
                    and penalties. In 1852 a new Steamboat Inspection Act required testing and licensing officers,
                    testing and inspection of machinery and boilers, and specified the kinds and quantities of safety
                    appliances and equipment necessary. Stringent penalties were enacted, and the law was enforced. The
                    inspection and crew licensing laws were made ever more comprehensive by later amendments to further
                    protect the public.60
            
            Ferry regulations often specified the minimum distance between ferry landings and routes, especially
                    in rural areas,61 but at the Falls Cities landings were much closer to one
                    another. The landing at Falling Run was a mile and a half below downtown New 
                        Albany
                    , but the landings at Upper Fifth and Sixth Streets in downtown New 
                        Albany
                     were not much more than a boat-length apart owing to the sale of those properties to
                    competing ferrymen in 1816. Owned by John Conners and Paxson and Smith, both ferries shared the 
                        Portland
                     Wharf in unremitting rivalry.62 Epaphras Jones's landing
                    was a matter of yards above the eastern boundary of New 
                        Albany
                    . The Silver Creek Landing was less than a mile and a half upstream from there. A mere
                    seven blocks separated Spring Street and 
                        Fulton
                     Street in 
                        Jeffersonville
                    . This proximity abetted competition because it encouraged patrons to shop for the
                    lowest rates.
            The maximum fares specified in charter grants were often modified by local governmental agencies to
                    prevent overcharges to users, but ferrymen could charge less. William Wright advertised that his
                    rates were half those required by law, proving that ferrymen could compete by charging less. His
                    success for two decades bears testimony

                             civil court records for the two-year period following the explosion of the Steam Ferry Boat revealed that not one damage suit was filed. There were
                            many suits against steamboats for financial loss, unpaid wages, and cargo damage, but there
                            was not one for personal injury. Clearly, passengers were expected to be prudent and protect
                            themselves from injury before the Steamboat Inspection Act was passed. Hunter provides a

                    more than meet costs.63
            
            Travel on the ferries was somewhat hazardous. Ferryboats between 
                        Jeffersonville
                     and 
                        Louisville
                     crossed the river immediately above the falls, where any stoppage of propulsion could
                    result in being swept away. The five-passenger canoe at the Utica-to-Transylvania crossing was well
                    above the perils of the falls, but passengers may have been obliged to part their hair in the middle
                    to enhance stability. The Clarksville and Shippingport ferries crossed at the lower end of the
                    falls. While there was no danger of being swept up the rapids, the outflow from them was frequently
                    very swift and turbulent.
            The falls represented a real hazard, for even when they were passable during high stages, the channel
                    was crooked and was lined with rocks on both sides. Any loss of power or steering could be fatal in
                    those strong currents.64 Some of the rocks were so notoriously dangerous that
                    they were dignified with names. Rubel's Rock, also known as Wave Rock, lay near the head of
                    the Indiana chute and made a deceptive swell that looked like deep water. It was blasted away in
                    1889. Dick Smith's Wharf was a long rock ledge on the southeast side of Corn Island that
                    was particularly dangerous to the early ferrymen leaving Gray's Wharf when a freshet ran
                    out of Beargrass Creek.
            Fog, too, was a peril, as Captain Alfred Pirtle described it:
            
                    The great and constant traffic between 
                            Louisville
                         and 
                            Jeffersonville
                         required a fewboat every few minutes all day long and late into the night. This
                        navigation was attended with difficulties and dangers, especially in foggy weather, and only the
                        worst of fogs or storms laid up the boats. And now and then some accident, maybe of a log of
                        driftwood lodging in the wheel, might compel a crew to toll their big bell for some boat to come
                        to their assistance before the time of whistle signals. And fog sometimes rose so suddenly as to
                        shut out both shores and force a stoppage.
                    One morning early the boat just rounded out from

                         with a large number of passengers and an omnibus on board, when a fog came up,
                        compelling the pilot to stop his engines and float, peering in vain for a sight of land.
                        Suddenly the boat just rubbed bottom and then grounded. The fog was so dense that nothing could
                        be seen in any direction. The ringing of the bell attracted some boatmen on the 
                            Kentucky
                         shore, who, guided by the sound, at least reached the boat and told the people they
                        were on the rocks at the head of the falls. After [an] hour or two the ferry people managed to
                        get a line to the boat and made strenuous efforts to pull it off with the assistance of the
                        other ferryboats, but in vain…. The companion boat took the passengers off, who were
                        transferred in skiffs from the grounded boat to the other…. Then the people having
                        lightened the boat by leaving, she was safely hauled into deep water during the night.65
               
                
            The Ohio River was and remains subject to closure by ice. Ice was an inexorable
                    enemy to boats, especially those with wooden hulls.

                     It attacked in several ways. Boats trapped in moving floes
                    broke their mooring lines and were carried away. When lines held firm, the ice often piled up and
                    climbed over the hull to shear away the cabin. Ice from one to four inches thick grinding along a
                    hull could trim that hull off neatly at the waterline. Only when ice was stabilized in heavy sheets
                    could people and vehicles walk or drive from shore to shore. New dangers arrived with each thaw, for
                    heaped ice formed gorges, backing up the river for miles. When such a gorge let go it swept
                    everything before it to destruction. Riverboats sought ice harbors in the mouths of tributaries, in
                    the chutes behind islands, or used the islands as shields. In any event, ice often stopped ferry
                        service.66
            
            During the severe winter of 1866-1867, the second Black Locust was crushed and sunk
                    by ice.67 In 1879 the James Wathen was caught in ice floes,
                    drifted into a pier of the 
                        Ohio
                     Falls Bridge, and sank. It was raised and ran until 1886.88
            
            Other hazards to the ferryboats included winds and waves, floods, snags, collisions, and, after the
                    introduction of steamers, machinery failures, explosions, and fires. The first steamer in the area
                    exploded. On August 17, 1854, the Adelaide was snagged at 
                        Portland
                     Bar and sank within seconds.69 The vessel was raised and continued
                    until lost in Civil War service at Cairo, 
                        Illinois
                    , in 1861.70 The New

                     ferry Ben South was also a war casualty when the steamer was captured and burned at
                    Cumberland City, 
                        Tennessee
                    , by Confederate General Hylan B. Lyons's troops on December 10, 1864.71
                    The John Shallcross's machinery broke down during a regular crossing in
                    January 1865. The vessel drifted down the falls and went aground in the Indiana chute, and
                    passengers were safely carried ashore in skiffs.72
            
            James Howard, the famous boat builder, was drowned from the deck of the John
                    Shallcross when his horse shied and backed his rig into the river because of an improperly
                    fastened ramp on October 14, 1876.73 The

            Despite this litany of disaster, the ferries had an enviable safety record.
            Most manual-and animal-powered ferryboats were not named but were identified either by the names of
                    their owners or their terminal points. Steamers, though, were a matter of much pride, and owners
                    delighted in painting their own names in four-foot-tall black letters, fancifully shaded. At the
                    Falls Cities these included A. Wathen, Isaac Bowman, James Thompson, John Shallcross,
                        James Wathen, Z. M. Sherley, W. C. Hite, Froman M. Coots, John M. Martin, Ben South, Thomas
                        Conner, and Frank McHarry. Other names were romantic: the expressive Walk In
                        The Water; Adelaide, possibly named for a French queen; and the Excelsior, named for a
                    famous thoroughbred horse, bespoke excellence and speed. Connotations of speed and convenience are
                    implicit in Rush and Transit. Music, Sunshine, and Corona expressed pleasure. George
                        Rogers Clark and Henry Watterson were named for notable persons. For a
                    time the latter boat bore a portrait of the famous editor of the 
                        Louisville
                    
                    Courier-Journal in lieu of the usual block-lettered wheelhouse sign.
            An advertisement on page one of the Daily 
                            Louisville
                         Public Advertiser on August 3, 1831, gave notice:
            
                    Mr. and Mrs. Crew of the 
                            Jeffersonville
                         Mineral Springs have the honor of announcing to the ladies and gentlemen of 
                            Louisville
                         and vicinity that in addition to the comfort and convenience of their establishment
                        they propose having a few dancing parties during the season under the management of Mr. A.
                        Mathieu, who on such occasions will offer a variety of pleasing specimens of
                        fireworks—the first will take place Thursday, the 4th August next… in
                        addition a large balloon will ascend.
                    They also have the pleasure of stating that arrangements have been made with the proprietor of
                        the horse ferry boat at 
                            Jeffersonville
                        , to be near the Bear Grass Bridge [at the foot of Second Street in 
                            Louisville
                        ] at 10 o'clock precisely on that day.
                    For the convenience of those persons who may feel disposed to visit this establishment on that
                        occasion, carriages will be prepared, and only regular ferriage will be charged.
                    It is intended to send up a live goose with the balloon, and which will take its flight from it,
                        accompanied with fire rockets at about 300 yards from the ground.
                    Should any sportsmen feel inclined to try their skill, a more favorable opportunity is not likely
                        to occur.76
               
                
            The Chalybeate Springs was a lively place; similar advertisements appeared October 543, 1831,
                    celebrating the new Steam Ferry Boat's first excursion with similar
                    attractions, but no goose was mentioned. The Springs were destroyed during an improvement of the Big
                    Four Railroad in 1904.77
            
            Athletic teams, debating societies, and choruses used the boats to visit cross-river colleagues,
                    frequently bringing their bands and cheering fans with them, carrying flags and draping the railings

                     bunting. Moonlight excursions with dancing and daytime
                    excursions with picnic lunches were often offered. Ferryboats frequently took patrons to amusement
                    parks and resorts at Fern Grove (later Rose Island), Sugar Grove, and White City, as they did to
                    picnics on Six Mile Island and Twelve Mile Island.
            Occasionally ferryboats ventured far from home. On June 24, 1901, the Sunshine
                    delivered a crowd from New 
                        Albany
                     to 
                  Brandenburg, Kentucky
               , forty-three miles from her 
                        Louisville
                     home, to see a drama on the Grand Floating Palace.
               78 Ferryboats met delegations and dignitaries who were transferred from a line packet boat to
                    be wined and dined on the last leg of their journey to the Falls Cities, as was done on the 
                        
                            Columbia

            For many years harried mothers entertained their children on the ferryboats, taking advantage of the
                    custom that allowed a passenger to ride back and forth all day for one five-cent fare. Children
                    loved to watch and worry with delectable terror lest the soaring jack-staff should hit the Big Four
                    Bridge.
            
               
                        Jeffersonville
                     was 
                        Louisville
                    's Gretna Green for several decades and had a number of marriage parlors for
                    the convenience of 
                        Kentucky
                     couples bent on quick marriage. Maidens could cross northward and return to the south
                    as matrons in little more than an hour.
            While the Falls Cities always competed with one another, like close-knit families, tribes, and
                    nations they also often rose to one another's defense. Fire equipment and firemen on loan
                    frequently crossed during major conflagrations. Captain Alfred Pirtle wrote:
            
                    Several times the Indiana State Prison, then adjoining 
                            Jeffersonville
                         on the west, was set fire, and 
                            Louisville
                         was called on to assist in putting out the fire. Four engines and hose carts were
                        sent over on a load and 500 or 600 volunteers manned the apparatus. It was very exciting to see
                        the rivalry displayed by the several companies as they rushed up the bank on the 
                            Jeffersonville
                         wharf.80
               
                
            Police departments also cooperated with their cross-river counterparts. Miscreants who tried to flee
                    a jurisdiction on arrival across the river often found the police, alerted by telegraph or
                    telephone, waiting to prevent their landing; they were arrested when the ferry returned.
            The ferry steamers departed and arrived with as much panache as the floating palaces. When the last
                    rig or auto was safely aboard, the roof bell was rung three taps. The ready whistle chirped three
                    times. The mighty whistle sounded three blasts, ramps were raised by deckhands to form rails, and
                    lines were lifted from timberheads. The ferryboat left the landing flat with a flourish. The gentle

                     of the paddles striking the water were communicated to the
                    farthest reaches of the boat. About ten minutes later, upon the approach to the yonder landing, the
                    pilot blew a brassy landing signal, to announce the boat's arrival. Lines were heaved and
                    ramps slammed down. Autos were cranked up to bounce over the flat to shore.
            While passage time was short, waiting one's turn during rush hour in a long queue angling
                    down the wharf to the landing flat was tedious. It was irritating to be left behind when the boat
                    was loaded to capacity.
            The importance of ferries in the days of settlement of the American West, when every stream was an
                    obstacle to wheeled vehicular travel, cannot be overstated. Crossing a stream of the power and size
                    of the 
                        Ohio
                     without a boat was an insurmountable problem. The first major bridge over that river
                    was not completed until 1870, almost seven decades after the opening of 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, and 
                        Illinois
                     for settlement. Another seventy years passed before the basic rail and highway bridge
                    system was completed. During that whole time the humble, unsung ferryboats were vital to our
                    nation's growth.

                            selected data from these texts according to how close the source was in time and distance to
                            the information reported; hence they were used in the following order: 1) Fishbaugh and
                            Savage, who used Howard Shipyard records; 2) Annual List of Merchant
                            Vessels, which was contemporary; 3) Way; and 4) Lytle-Holdcamper.

            INDIANA ARCHIVES: Archival Holdings in Eastern Indiana
            
                    John M. Glen, John B. Straw, and Thomas D. Hamm
                    ∗
                
            This fifth installment of the Indiana Archives series examines some of the local archival holdings
                    that can be found in the eastern part of Indiana. As has been the case in defining other regions
                    within the state, the boundaries of eastern Indiana reflect varying perspectives. Yet two interstate
                    highways, geography, and history help to give definition to eastern Indiana. The land east of
                    Interstate 69 and bisected by Interstate 74 ranges from flat and gently rolling terrain to deep
                    river valleys and steep ridges, some of which overlook the broad 
                        Ohio River
                    . A largely rural area, the region's economy is primarily tied to agriculture.
                    Industry once flourished in this part of Indiana, beginning with the natural gas boom of the late
                    nineteenth century and continuing during the first half of the twentieth century. But a gradual
                    decline in durable goods manufacturing after the 1950s has meant a shift to more service-oriented
                    economic activity, including tourism in a number of communities. Eastern Indiana has long had a
                    diverse ethnic and religious heritage, with a highly visible Amish, Mennonite, and 
                        Quaker
                     presence in some areas.
            These economic and cultural characteristics point to several other historical sources of regional
                    identity. Antebellum eastern Indiana was an active conduit for the Underground Railroad,
                    transporting several thousand newly freed blacks through such communities as 
                        Fountain City
                    , the so-called Grand Central Station of the system, and establishing institutional
                    support for African Americans through the Union Literary Institute in 
                        Randolph County
                     and Eleutherian College in 
                        Jefferson County
                    , which was the second school west of the Allegheny Mountains to
                    offer interracial education. The Indiana Women's Rights Association was formed in 1852 in 
                        Wayne County
                    , a center of the women's suffrage campaign in the state during the nineteenth
                    century. John Hunt Morgan's Confederate raiders briefly swept through the area during the
                    Civil War before a force of around one thousand 
                        Jennings County
                     volunteers and Union troops drove them

                     away. The discovery of natural gas in the 1870s and 1880s
                    fueled a boom-and-bust economy in several towns, but the gas also induced some companies, most
                    notably the Ball Corporation, to set up operations and make far reaching economic and educational
                    contributions to the region. Eastern Indiana provided a fertile setting for the volatile cultural
                    contrasts of the 1920s; a reborn Ku Klux Klan gained national attention even as the Gennett studio

                    Great Depression and continues to attract the attention of scholars, journalists, and film-makers.
            Eastern Indiana also gains a measure of regional identity through the authors, entrepreneurs,
                    politicians, and folkloric figures associated with it. Naturalist Gene Stratton Porter, humorist
                    Emily Kimbrough, historian Edward Eggleston, and novelist Ross Lockridge, Jr., all to varying
                    degrees made the area the backdrop for their works. The region was also home to James F. D. Lanier,
                    who financed Indiana's entry into the Civil War; Wilbur Wright, who with his brother
                    Orville ushered in a new era in transportation; and the Hillenbrand families of Batesville, whose
                    furniture-making company broadened into several other enterprises. In 1885 the Reverend James M.

            The local historical societies, museums, halls of fame, restored riverfront mansions, and historic
                    preservation districts in eastern Indiana reflect both a local appreciation of the region's
                    past and a recognition of the benefits that result from a combination of conservation and commerce.

                    a broad scope of resources for the area's history. Thomas D. Hamm's survey of
                    Earlham College's manuscript collections reaffirms the centrality of the Friends in the
                    social and religious life of east-central Indiana in the nineteenth century, while noting that other
                    materials illuminate peace and civil rights activism for most of the twentieth century.  These essays suggest that some promising avenues for primary research
                    in the history of this part of the state have been prepared and that those pursuits can well lead to
                    national and international connections.

                    , Indiana, for only the second time in over a week, and Thomas Neely was writing in his
                    diary: 
                        This is the day designated for the beginning of the trial of President Johnson. He has so
                            many lucrative offices to dispose of, I fear that some of the Senators may be bribed by him,
                            and the Country still be cursed with him another year.
                     After the trial had ended, Neely wrote on May 25, 1868, 
                        The democrats had a meeting in the Hall, on Saturday night, rejoicing in the Escape from
                            impeachment of Andy Johnson. Nero fiddled while

                        Delaware County
                     was officially formed on April 1, 1827, and 
                        Muncie
                    , also founded in 1827, became the county seat. The discovery of natural gas near Eaton
                    on September 15,1886, had a profound effect on the area. The gas boom that followed and continued
                    through the early years of the twentieth century attracted factories, especially in the glass and
                    steel industries. The Ball Brothers Company was one of the first companies to arrive and had a
                    tremendous impact on the development of 
                        Muncie
                    .
            In the 1920s, Robert and Helen Lynd conducted a sociological study of 
                        Muncie
                     that was published in 1929 as

                        Muncie
                     as a "typical" American community. Robert Lynd updated the study in

                    , the Lynds observed that there were "forty-odd buildings throughout the city for
                    religious ceremonies."2 Two churches built in the 1890s reflect the
                    growth of the community. The founding of the Avondale United Methodist Church in 1891 gave southside 
                        Muncie
                     residents an attractive alternative to the High Street Methodist Church, since the city
                    lacked sidewalks and streetcar or bus service. The Avondale United Methodist Church Records,
                    1891-1991 (MSS 124), contain annual reports, attendance records, board minutes, budgets and
                    financial reports, directories, membership lists, programs, publications, and scrapbooks. When the

                     Street Methodist Episcopal) was formed on June 2, 1895, the first services were held
                    under a large tree in Heekin Park. Their records, 1903-1995 (MSS 146) include board minutes,

            During the early part of the twentieth century, local tuberculosis organizations were formed across
                    the country to fight this dreaded disease. The Indiana Tuberculosis Association was formed in 1907,
                    and the 
                        Delaware County
                     association was established in 1919. Its records, 1919-1989 (MSS 141), include annual
                    reports, board minutes, correspondence, financial and statistical reports, and scrap-books.
            The records of women's organizations can be valuable sources for the study of
                    women's history. The Mary-Martha Club traces its origin to the fall of 1890, when three
                    women met to discuss the need for a county women's club. It was formally organized in 1891
                    as a club for women of 
                        Delaware County
                     who resided outside the corporate limits of 
                        Muncie
                    . The club held programs and activities covering such topics as history, literature,
                    politics, domestic science, and biblical history, and in 1896, it affiliated with the 
                        Delaware County
                     Federated Club of Clubs. The club's records, 1891-1977 (MSS 5),

                    group first called itself the Young Women's Social and Betterment Association. On December
                    21, 1911, seventeen of these women met and organized a Board for a YWCA. The YWCA

                    showing how we lived in those days, what some of our values were, and what we looked
                    like… a microcosm of America."7 The Spurgeon-

            Earlham College's Friends Collection is one of the three largest repositories of books and
                    manuscripts relating to the life and history of the Society of Friends (Quakers) in the 
                        United States
                    . It also has significant holdings for Indiana history, especially the history of 
                        Richmond
                     and east-central Indiana.
            
            
               College Archives. Earlham was founded as Friends Boarding School by Indiana
                    Yearly Meeting of Orthodox Friends in 1847. The name was changed to Earlham College in 1859. The
                    college archives are relatively complete, except for most early presidential office files, which
                    were lost in a fire in 1924. Holdings include official records, such as the minutes of the board of
                    trustees and predecessor bodies (from 1847), the faculty meeting (from 1859), and numerous student
                    groups. Runs of campus publications are virtually complete. A large collection of student letters,
                    diaries, and other manuscripts dates from 1847.
            The college archives also include papers of a number of faculty members with various professional
                    interests. The Ernest A. Wild-man Papers and the Murvel Garner Papers, for example, include large
                    bodies of material concerning their administration of Civilian Public Service camps for conscientous
                    objectors under the auspices of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) during World War 11.
                    The Thomas E. and Esther Jones Papers include materials on 
                        Japan
                    , reflecting the Joneses' work there as teachers and 
                        Quaker
                     missionaries from 1918 to 1926. The Landrum R. Bolling Papers contain material on his
                    work in international arbitration and peacemaking, especially in the Middle East, from the 1970s to
                    the present. There is a small collection of the papers of E. Merrill Root (1895-1973), a member of
                    the faculty from 1920 to 1960 and one of the leading academic defenders of McCarthyism in the 1950s.
            Earlham's 
                        Quaker
                     affiliation means that the college archives contain extensive materials reflecting
                    traditional 
                        Quaker
                     concerns. The presidential office files, the Oral History Collection, and Controversial
                    Issues Collection encompass such issues as the American Student Union and the Student Strike against
                    War in the 1930s, draft resistance in the 1940s and 1950s, opposition to the 
                        Vietnam
                     War in the 1960s and 1970s, Japanese American students on the campus during World War
                    II, and protests against segregation and racial discrimination, especially in 
                        Richmond
                    , from the 1920s into the 1980s.
            
               
                  
                            Quaker
                         Records. Earlham is the repository for the records of the two largest 
                        Quaker
                     entities in Indiana: Indiana Yearly Meeting (founded 1821), which includes Friends
                    meetings in eastern Indiana, western 
                        Ohio
                    , and parts of 
                        Michigan
                    ; and Western Yearly Meeting (founded 1858), which includes Friends in western and
                    southern Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                    . These records, dating back to 1809, include birth, death, marriage, and membership
                    records for local congregations as well as minutes of monthly, quarterly, and business meetings. Of
                    particular interest are materials reflecting 
                        Quaker
                     humanitarian concerns, such as the minutes of the Indiana Yearly Meeting Indian
                    Committee (1821-1855); the minutes of monthly, quarterly, and yearly meeting committees on the
                    concerns of people of color, beginning  in the 1820s and usually
                    ending in the 1870s; and minutes of temperance and "social purity" committees.
                    Also included are records of several 
                        Quaker
                     academies, including those at 
                  Plainfield, Mooresville, Fairmount
               , and Bloomingdale.
            Earlham is also the repository for a number of 
                        Quaker
                    -affiliated organizations. The papers of the United Society of Friends Women, founded in 
                        Mooresville
                    , Indiana, in 1881, includes records of 
                        Quaker
                     missionary work in, and the attitudes of Indiana Quakers toward, Mexico, Africa, the
                    Caribbean, and 
                        Japan
                    . The files of Friends United Meeting (founded as the Five Years Meeting of Friends in
                    1902) are being transferred to the collection and are especially rich in material on Friends outside
                    the 
                        United States
                    . The archives of the Young Friends of North America, founded at Winona
                    Lake, Indiana, in 1911, contain considerable material on peace activism in the 1950s and
                    1960s.
            Several organizational collections are not technically 
                        Quaker
                     records but reflect traditional 
                        Quaker
                     concerns. They include records of the 
                        Dublin
                    , Indiana, Good Templars Lodge (1864-1873); Woman's Christian Temperance Union
                    (WCTU) minutes from 
                        Richmond
                     and 
                        Fairmount
                    , Indiana; and the records of the Rural Life Association (1948-1967), an Indiana-based
                    group dedicated to improving rural life.
            
               Individual Manuscript Collections. The following are the most significant
                    individual holdings at Earlham College that help illuminate the history of eastern and central

                    Levi Coffin (1798-1877), the abolitionist and reputed "President of the Underground
                    Railroad" whose home in 
                        Fountain City
                     is now a state historic landmark. Although it contains a few letters written to and by
                    Coffin, most of the collection is clippings and reminiscences about Coffin and antislavery in 
                        Wayne County
                    .
            
               The Willard Heiss Collection (1773-) is a large collection of materials relating to 
                        Quaker
                     and midwestern history and genealogy assembled by Willard C. Heiss (1921-1988), for
                    many years the 
                        Indianapolis City
                     Archivist. It includes numerous clippings, letters, unpublished manuscripts, and
                    photographs relating to a wide range of topics including communitarianism, the antislavery movement,
                    temperance, and divisions among Quakers in the nineteenth century. It is especially strong in
                    materials from 
                  Randolph, Wayne
               , and Hendricks counties. The collection also contains materials
                    reflecting the work of Heiss and his wife, Virginia, in peace and racial justice causes in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in the 1950s and 1960s.
            
               The Hill-Hudelson Family Papers (1831-1932) consist of correspondence, diaries, and
                    business records of the families of Henry B. Hill (1807-1874) of 
                        Carthage
                    , Indiana, who, though a 
                        Quaker
                    , was a Union officer in the Civil War, and his son William P. Hill (1832-1896) of 
                        Knightstown
                    , Indiana. Of particular interest is the diary William P. Hill's sister-in-law
                    Jane M. Hudelson (1837-1904) kept while teaching in a freedman's school near
                            
                  Nashville, Tennessee
               , in the 1860s.
            
               The Huff Family Papers (1760-1976) consists of correspondence, legal papers,
                    photographs, clippings, and reminiscences and genealogical materials of a prominent 
                        Fountain City
                    , Indiana, Quaker family. Most of the collection concerns Daniel Huff (1816-1899), an
                    abolitionist and associate of Levi Coffin, and Dr. Oliver Nixon Huff (1852-1937), well known for his
                    work in collecting local history. It contains material on the antislavery movement and other reform
                    causes in 
                        Fountain City
                     (formerly 
                        Newport
                    ).
            
               The Eli and Mahalah Jay Papers (1837-1921) are a large collection of correspondence
                    and writings of Eli Jay (1826-1911) and his wife, Mahalah (Pearson) Jay (1827-1916), who were
                    teachers in  several 
                        Quaker
                     schools in 
                        Ohio
                     and Indiana. Also included are materials relating to 
                        Quaker
                     women's temperance and missionary work.
            
               The Homer L. and Edna (Wright) Morris Collection (1906-1966) is one of the largest
                    in the Friends Collection. It reflects mainly the career of Homer L. Morris (1890-1951), a member of
                    the faculties at Earlham and at Fisk University, and a long-time staff member for the American
                    Friends Service Committee. The collection contains correspondence (1942-1945) relating to the
                    relocation of Japanese-American college students in Indiana during World War II.
            
               The Marcus Mote Collection (1833-) consists of material relating to the career of
                    the 
                        Quaker
                     painter and miniaturist Marcus Mote (1817-1898), who lived in 
                        Richmond
                     from 1865 until his death. Mote is best known for his often-reproduced works Indiana Yearly Meeting of Friends, 1844 and The Hoosier's
                        Nest. The collection includes correspondence, notebooks and sketchbooks, drawings, and a
                    series of diaries from the 1830s to the 1890s. The Friends Collection and the Earlham Permanent Art
                    Collection contain numerous works by Mote.
            
               The Josiah Parker Family Papers (1787-1836) consist largely of letters written by
                    Quakers in 
                        Ohio
                     and in 
                        Wayne
                     and Henry counties in Indiana between 1800 and 1833. Some of the correspondence
                    reflects the involvement of the Parker family in the transportation and resettlement of freed blacks
                    from 
                        North Carolina
                     to Indiana in the 1820s. One letter, written by Hannah Elliott from 
                        Wayne County
                     in 1829, is believed to be the oldest surviving letter written by an African American
                    in Indiana.
            
               The Elbert Russell Papers (1890-1966) illuminate the career of Elbert Russell
                    (1871-1951), a 
                        Quaker
                     who spent his childhood in West Newton, Indiana, and was a member of the Earlham
                    faculty from 1895 to 1915. From 1927 to 1941 he was the dean of the Duke University Divinity School.
                    The papers include letters relating to theological controversies over modernism and evolution among
                    Indiana Quakers between 1890 and 1925 and correspondence and sections of Russell's
                    manuscript autobiography relating to his role as a leader of the Progressive party and its candidate
                    for Congress in the 
                        Richmond
                     district in 1914.
            
               The Elton Trueblood Papers (1837-1994) consist of correspondence, photographs,
                    diaries, speeches, and other writings of D. Elton Trueblood (1900-1994), the long-time Earlham
                    philosophy professor who achieved an international reputation as a religious writer and speaker
                    after World War II.
            
               The Esther Griffin White Collection (1840-1954) is a large collection reflecting
                    the life of an early Hoosier feminist. White (1867-1954), a lifelong 
                        Richmond
                     resident, was a poet, editor, journalist, and art historian and critic. Her Little Paper, a complete file of which is included in the collection, supported
                    women's suffrage and progressive reform in the 1910s.
            
            
               The John T. White Family Papers (1707-1960) are a large collection of
                    correspondence, diaries, ledgers and financial records, and genealogical materials of a Quaker
                    family that moved from 
                  Perquimans county, North Carolina
               , to 
                        Washington
                     and Henry counties in Indiana in the 1830s. The collection contains correspondence
                    relating to 
                        Quaker
                     attitudes toward abolition and politics before the Civil War.
            
               The Mordecai M. and Francis T. White Papers (1760-1913), although small, contain
                    materials relating to the settlement of former slaves in 
                        Henry county
                    , Indiana, in the 1850s by the 
                        Quaker
                     brothers Mordecai Morris White (1830-1913) and Francis Toms White (1833-1907).
            
               The Henry Wilson Collection (1791-1911) contains the autobiography and diary of Dr.
                    Henry Wilson (1795-1863), a 
                        Quaker
                     physician who moved from 
                        North Carolina
                     to 
                        Salem
                    , Indiana, in 1817. It is an unusually vivid account of life in the early days of white
                    settlement.

            The formation of a new state in an almost virginal territory and on a rapidly spreading frontier
                    demanded a continuing series of local political compromises by a host of individuals with often
                    conflicting personal views and objectives. The issues they faced were complex, reflecting the
                    challenges posed by a sparse and widely-dispersed population that required governments, roads, and
                    banking services. The creation of a workable revenue system, for example, was a monumental task, and
                    it was basic to maintaining even the most elementary public services. Achieving all of this required
                    more ingenuity and leadership than Indiana could provide in the period of its formation as a state.
                    Donald F. Carmony has identified the personalities who dominated the first half-century of the
                    state's history and has traced the many strands of their political disputes.
            The miracle of early Indiana history is that the state survived so well despite its perennial
                    inability to pay debts; during the first six years the state's revenues fell about
                    $8,500 short of expenditures annually. This problem stemmed from national overspeculation
                    and the panic of 1819. Like other parts of the rapidly expanding American frontier, Indiana was
                    deeply divided over the vexing issue of banking. Virtually every problem was a revenue problem.
                    There existed, for example, no greater challenge in the backcountry than penetrating the barriers to
                    internal travel and commercial intercourse. But while topography, sparsity of population, and rising
                    agricultural production made travel both essential and difficult, the central problem was the lack
                    of capital resources to improve transportation. State treasurer Nathan B. Palmer put it clearly when
                    he warned that capital for internal improvements would have to be raised from sources other than
                    taxation. Ultimately, the state's attempt to finance internal improvements resulted in
                    excessive debt, financial crisis, and bankruptcy.
            Education was another early challenge. The state might have become a testing ground for public
                    education, but delegates meeting in an early constitutional convention in Corydon faltered in their
                    responsibility by referring the issue to the future general assembly, which, they said, should
                    concern itself with the organization of public schools "as circumstances will
                    permit." Thus education in Indiana, as in most other states, was a subject to which
                    governors and legislators could pay eloquent lipservice without giving financial support  to schools. Carmony writes comprehensively of Indiana's slow
                    and wobbling steps to establish a public school system and the semblance of higher education as
                    well. While there were a number of men who expressed opinions freely in support of education, there
                    were few leaders capable of articulating policies to achieve reasonable ends.
            The author discusses the political views of the Jeffersonian and Jacksonian parties in proposing
                    solutions to the problems of the newer states of the union and describes their highly partisan
                    approaches to government. Internal improvements, banking, the final phases of border defenses, and
                    applying land policies all evoked the same kinds of partisan responses in Indiana that appeared in
                    other states. Carmony discusses the two parties in two chapters that place their conflicts in the
                    context of grass roots backcountry realities as well as in philosophical differences.
            With the emergence of state government in 1816 there appeared a galaxy of strong-willed personalities
                    who engraved their names permanently in the annals of Indiana history. Their pullings and haulings
                    as governors, state officers, and legislators demonstrated a mixture of statesmanship and sheer
                    demagoguery. This is reflected in the legislative record, where one can marvel that any rational
                    resolution of the complex problems of government ever occurred in such an environment of legalistic
                    hairsplitting. But most states' histories have revealed that constitution-makers rarely
                    made rules that withstood the test of changing times, and Indiana has been no exception to this
                    pattern.
            Somewhere and at some time there may have been a sociogeo-graphically oriented topographer able to
                    lay out on the face of the great American frontier a state without sharp sectional divisions, but
                    such a person was not around to employ this skill when Indiana was formed as a state. Indiana, like
                    its sister states, has from the beginning been saddled with a fair amount of sectional paralysis.
                    Few, if any, state histories contain so clear a statement of the impact of sectionalism as
                    Carmony's treatment of the subject.
            It must be questioned whether a more detailed treatment of state formation and the maturing process
                    than Carmony's Indiana exists anywhere; he has enriched the text with
                    details that illuminate personalities, public issues, economic and fiscal concerns, and the problems
                    of establishing democratic government in the Old Northwest. He includes 243 pages of notes and
                    bibliography to support his analysis. A future state historian will find little, if anything, to add
                    to the history of the foundation of the state. The famous progenitor of well-researched local
                    history, Leopold von Ranke, would bestow his blessings upon Donald F. Carmony's head.

               Hoosier Schools, Past and Present. Edited by William J. Reese. (Bloom-ington:
                    Indiana University Press, 1998. Pp. xvi, 226. Notes, illustrations, figures, tables, index.
                    Clothbound, $29.95; paper-bound, $14.95.)
            According to editor William J. Reese, the nine articles that make up Hoosier Schools,
                        Past and Present reflect "the work of a new generation of scholars, whose
                    contributions explore moments in Indiana's educational past while stimulating further
                    inquiries" (p. xv). Presented chronologically, chapters address the central educational
                    issue of a specific time period. The first chapter deals with the leadership of common school reform
                    in the mid-nineteenth century; the second, written by Reese himself, discusses the cities'
                    leadership in school innovation after the Civil War. Subsequent chapters explore Progressive era
                    reforms: one reviews broad curricular expansion; a second, the changing definitions of social
                    studies education; a third, the expansion of the extracurriculum. The last four chapters,
                    approaching the present, study the evolution of high school basketball as an important supplement to
                    the curriculum; changes in funding urban schools after World War II that caused problems for
                    superintendents; Indiana's diverse response to racial issues; and reforms of the past
                    twenty years.
            While the book might have been strengthened by a concluding chapter that identified unifying themes,
                    each chapter stands on its own, and, moreover, the chapters fit well together. There is a surprising
                    uniformity of style, historical depth, tone, integration of Indiana's educational history
                    into the national context, and balance among theory, description, and analysis.
            Each of the chapters, as the editor intended, provides a more critical portrayal of
                    Indiana's educational past than have previous accounts (p. xv). Every chapter avoids
                    one-dimensional analyses, pointing out the multiplicity of cultural, political, and economic forces
                    that are always the context of education and that make reform difficult both to achieve and to
                    analyze. The essays provide complex portraits of educational reform, then and now, and ask new
                    questions. David G. Martin's chapter about the role of basketball, for example, notes both
                    that the sport excluded girls (p. 137) and that the sense of inclusion and local pride that team
                    support encouraged was similar to that fostered by the Ku Klux Klan, which played an active role in
                    Indiana's small towns (pp. 140-42). Such thought-provoking juxtapositions in all the
                    chapters show how education's history intersects with the broader culture.
            The book succeeds in placing 150 years of educational reforms in Indiana within the context of
                    national trends. The chapters are rich with references to 
                        United States
                     educational history and Indiana history. Students of education will praise this
                    volume's breadth, despite its single-state focus, while those interested in Indiana history
                         will appreciate its inclusion of all of Indiana, as well as
                    the scope that a broader, national perspective contributes.
            The volume also convincingly links Indiana's educational past with its present. The final
                    chapters approach the present with topics that are very much a part of current educational
                    consciousness, dramatizing the continuity of struggle over educational policy throughout
                    Indiana's history. While historians of education might wish for yet more critical analyses,
                    this book succeeds well on its own terms and will richly reward readers of both Indiana and
                    educational history.

            This is an extraordinarily valuable study of Indiana's, and to some extent the
                    nation's, concrete bridges. Although the subtitle indicates an early twentieth-century
                    focus, the book in effect begins with the 
                        Chicago
                     World's Fair of 1893 and explores the influence of its magnificent White City
                    upon subsequent architectural and engineering designs before delving into the main theme. As a
                    result, Artistry and Ingenuity is not only a comprehensive analysis of
                    bridge-building in Indiana during the first four decades of this century but also a history of
                    bridge engineering and engineers, of transportation systems, and of related developments, such as
                    the City Beautiful and Good Roads movements and the governmental bureaucracies, both state and
                    federal, involved in highway construction. All this is told within the framework of the fierce
                    battles waged between architects and bridge-design engineers, who won the first battle, and then
                    between empirically minded engineers and the "federal state alliance" of
                    government engineers, who generally prevailed during the Great Depression and afterwards.
            The engineers' approach to bridge-building was best articulated by bridge and structural
                    engineer H. G. Tyrrell, who found beauty in simplicity and called for selecting "the most
                    artistic form consistent with economy" (p. 71). This approach was practiced with a
                    vengeance by Indiana's Daniel B. Luten, the enigmatic, self-styled "Designing
                    Engineer," once a professor of engineering at Purdue University, who designed and built,
                    often through his own companies here and in other states, about 12,000 remarkable bridges using the
                    new material  of the time—reinforced
                    concrete—in daring and imaginative ways. Over the years Luten's nemesis was
                    Thomas H. McDonald, the long-time head of the Office of Public Roads based in 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., who defended the more traditional, sometimes redundant structures built by the
                    government. Indeed, an excellent chapter in the book is "an imagined debate"
                    between Luten and McDonald on the proposition that "State Highway Commission Control of
                    Public Bridge Design Best Promotes the General Welfare" (pp. 100-106).
            With this book Cooper has reaffirmed and solidified his standing as the preeminent scholar of Indiana
                    bridges. Artistry and Ingenuity is a worthy companion to his previous study, Iron Monuments to Distant Posterity: Indiana's Metal Bridges, 1870-1930
                    (1987). Deeply philosophical as well as painstakingly detailed and technical, the book is not
                    without flaws. Although the writing is occasionally lyrical and the author at times whimsical in his
                    chapter titles and captions to the generally superb photographs, Cooper's self-published
                    book unfortunately suffers from the lack of an experienced copy editor to catch mechanical errors, a
                    few misspellings, and an infrequent opaque phrase. Nevertheless, I can strongly recommend the book
                    and support the author's wish that his more than two decades of work on
                    "Indiana's historic bridges" will help preserve at least some of them.
                    Shockingly, more than 60 percent of the bridges listed in the metal bridges book inventory are no
                    longer extant. Let us hope that a similar fate does not await the bridges inventoried here, county
                    by county, in the book's final pages.

            In their classic sociological studies of

                         in Transition (1937), Robert and Helen Merrell Lynd referred briefly to a tiny
                    community of Jews, "SO small as to be numerically negligible" (quoted on p. vii).
                    In 1979 Martin D. Schwartz, a 
                        Muncie
                     businessman and long-time resident, asked two Ball State University professors, 
                        Warren
                     Vander Hill and Dwight W. Hoover, to undertake an oral history of the city's
                    older Jews in order to provide more substance than the Lynds' light, almost superficial,
                    treatment. Dan Rottenberg, a 
                        Philadelphia
                    -based journalist who was once associated with the 
                        Portland
                     (Indiana) Commercial-Review, edited nineteen of these interviews, and
                    the result is this fascinating group of recollections by some small-city Indiana Jews.
            
            Hill and Hoover asked about such topics as their motivations for moving to 
                        Muncie
                    ; sources of income; attempts to establish and maintain a sense of religious and social
                    communality; accommodations to the prevailing gentile culture; and, of course, the effect, if any,
                    of the Ku Klux Klan on their peace of mind. Most of 
                        Muncie
                    's Jews were descendants of Eastern European immigrants who arrived in the 
                        United States
                     in the several decades just before and after 1900 and came to 
                        Muncie
                     from other American cities. Nearly all went into business for themselves or as partners
                    and salesmen in Jewish-owned enterprises. As with Jews in other American small cities, they dealt
                    primarily in clothing (from elegant to workingmen's) and in scrap metal and junk, though
                    some got involved in jewelry, linen supply, paper products, and office machines. Hardly any of the
                    first generation pursued education after high school, but virtually all their children, especially
                    the boys, attended college.
            Most of the community maintained "Jewish" homes, which varied widely in the ways
                    the sabbath and other holidays (not to mention dietary laws) were observed. They built a synagogue
                    that conformed generally to a Reform service, hired a rabbi when they could afford one, and provided
                    children with at least an idea of Jewish traditions. Almost all of the first generation married
                    Jews, usually finding spouses in nearby cities. Though a number recalled attending a YMCA camp in
                    their teens, they also joined various Jewish youth groups.
            Relations with 
                        Muncie
                    's gentiles were for the most part correct, with some of those interviewed even
                    reminiscing about high school social clubs that elevated Jews to top offices, while others recalled
                    friendships with non-Jewish neighbors. But most interviewees also cited the
                    "closed-to-Jews" policies of 
                        Muncie
                    's leading social and fraternal organizations, especially the 
                        Delaware
                     Country Club and the Elks, Rotary, Kiwanis, and Lions clubs. The direct anti-Semitism
                    they encountered usually came from realtors who excluded Jews from the prominent residential
                    sections of Westwood and Kenmore or from childhood taunts and occasional fights. As for the Klan in
                    the 1920s, there was near unanimity among 
                        Muncie
                    's older Jews that Catholics and blacks had much more cause for concern than
                    did Jews, probably because the former were more numerous and visible than the "numerically
                    negligible" Jews, who deliberately kept a low profile.
            Schwartz, the 
                        Harvard
                    -educated elder of the community, has also contributed an elegantly concise
                    "Afterword," providing a broader historical context for the book.

                examines the birth and maturation of a carefully planned 1870s suburb on the
                    east side of 
                        Indianapolis
                     that was annexed to the capital in 1902 and became (and remains) one of the
                    city's most distinctive neighborhoods. The fact that "architecture" is
                    the first word in the subtitle is significant, for this is not a conventional narrative history.
                    Rather, Paul Diebold introduces the reader to 
                        Irvington
                     through its built environment. The strategy no doubt comes naturally to the author, who
                    works for the Indiana Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology. He is forthright about his
                    focus: "Although 
                        Irvington
                     is a community of people, it is the buildings and places of 
                        Irvington
                     that shaped and will shape the self-image of its residents" (p. C.1).
                    Perhaps-but such an approach inevitably narrows the volume's appeal. The book will be of
                    considerable interest to residents past and present, historic preservationists, and architectural
                    historians. More general readers, however, are likely to learn a bit more about the details of
                    changing architectural styles than they really want to know and a bit less about the lives of the
                    people who lived, studied, worked, played, and prayed in 
                        Irvington
                    's buildings.
            A large proportion of the volume examines the community's residential architecture, which
                    includes everything from the elaborate Italianate and Second Empire styles of the late-nineteenth
                    century to post-World War II ranch-style houses. There are also separate chapters on parks and
                    parkways, commercial and industrial structures, and (this reviewer's favorite) public and
                    institutional buildings. The latter chapter includes excellent discussions of 
                        Butler
                     University (which had a fifty-year run in 
                        Irvington
                     before moving to its current location on the city's north side), as well as
                    Thomas Carr Howe High School and the national headquarters of the Christian Church (Disciples of
                    Christ).
            A few problems may be noted. There are some editorial lapses, although none is serious enough to
                    impede a reader's understanding. The illustrations should have been numbered for easier
                    identification and reference in the text. Additional maps, especially for the twentieth century,
                    would aid readers who do not know the neighborhood. That said, Diebold deserves credit for his
                    thorough research (the bibliography and appendices are quite impressive), for assembling a
                    remarkable collection of excellent illustrations, and for writing an informative and thoughtful
                    text. He is particularly good at putting developments in 
                        Irvington
                     in context—in explaining how  national
                    movements in architecture, public health, education, recreation, and transportation were reflected
                    in this one small area of Indiana's capital. Simply doing that successfully sets this book
                    apart from a great many local histories. Diebold and the 
                        Irvington
                     Historical Society can take pride in this book, and those who nominate Indiana
                    publications for awards from the American Association for State and Local History should consider it
                    for such recognition.

            This book treats "the wrong end of Lincoln's life" (p. ix). It examines
                    the Civil War president's early years, a period of maturation haunted by melancholy, of
                    affairs of the heart and forays into politics, of the seedtime of legal practice and public service.
                    Since Lincoln scholarship primarily centers on the presidential era, there is, argues Douglas L.
                    Wilson, a regrettable lack of depth in historians' interpretations of the critical
                    formative years of Lincoln's life and the acceptance of generations of dubious
                    historiographical judgments.
            In this compilation of previously published articles, Wilson sets out to correct this oversight. By
                    examining afresh several long-held assumptions about Lincoln's experiences in 
                        New Salem
                     and 
                        Springfield
                     and about the crucial sources for that period—particularly those collected
                    by the future president's law partner, William H. Herndon, whose work has been much
                    maligned by historians—Wilson challenges the premises of such scholars as Paul Angle,
                    James G. and Ruth Painter Randall, and David Herbert Donald. The result is a fascinating and, at
                    times, bold grappling with the accepted portrait of the young Lincoln.
            At the heart of the author's analysis is a refurbishing of Herndon's role as an
                    historian. Building on his earlier study of Herndon and his informants, done in collaboration with
                    Rodney O. Davis (1997), Wilson seeks to release Herndon from "the doghouse of Lincoln
                    scholarship" (p. 21) to which he has too long been consigned. In doing so, he cogently
                    argues that Lincoln's associate "deserves to be much better known" (p.
                    34) as a careful investigator of Lincoln's younger days. According to Wilson, Herndon
                    recognized that, soon after Lincoln's assassination, his image was being distorted into
                    that of a "plaster saint" (p. 39). To counteract that trend, Herndon thoroughly
                    checked the material gleaned from his informants and conscientiously adhered to a doctrine of
                    "necessary truth: that "even the most private and painful secrets must come out to
                    explain the extraordinary  character and
                    accomplishments" of an historical figure (p. 43). These traits of Herndon's
                    research alone underscore the author's contention that fairness to Herndon is in order.
                    Perhaps a revealing testimony to Wilson's success at rehabilitating Herndon's
                    image is that Donald—whose 1948 treatment of Herndon receives judicious criticism at
                    Wilson's hands—in his recent highly-acclaimed Lincoln biography claims to have
                    "learned a great deal" from the articles reprinted here, which informed his own
                    reconsideration of Lincoln's prepresidential years (Lincoln, 1995, p.
                    608).
            Donald's kudos reflects specifically upon Wilson's handling of Lincoln's
                    relationship with Ann Rutledge. This episode is seen as merely legendary by historians who reject
                    Herndon's sources—evidence which, according to Wilson, "they themselves
                    had not seen" (p. 75)— and Wilson claims it offers an insight into
                    Lincoln's personal growth and especially into the melancholy that tempered his spirit
                    throughout his life. Likewise, valuable glimpses of Lincoln's moral and emotional character
                    emerge from an account of the angst the young lawyer felt when he broke his engagement to Mary Todd
                    on New Year's Day 1841, an act he later reversed out of a sense of honor. In other chapters
                    one witnesses the unseasoned politician using an assumed name in editorially attacking his political
                    opponent, evangelist Peter Cartwright, and the more experienced campaigner using the Declaration of
                    Independence for "political advantage" (p. 173). Finally, students of Indiana
                    history will find Wilson's account of Lincoln's 1844 visit to his Hoosier boyhood
                    region informative; the trip proved to be a pivotal moment in his confrontation with "the
                    humbling fact of human mortality" (p. 142).

               Beyond the Boundaries: Life and Landscape at the Lake Superior Copper Mines,
                        1840-1875. By Larry Lankton. (

            In 1991 Larry Lankton presented a comprehensive account of the development of the mineral ranges on
                    the Keweenaw Peninsula in northern 
                        Michigan
                     in Cradle to Grave: Life, Work, and Death at the Lake Superior Copper
                        Mines. In this companion volume, Beyond the Boundaries, he concentrates
                    on the settlement of the region between 1840 and 1875 with emphasis upon the development of copper
                         mining towns as they were transformed from crude isolated
                    mining camps to civilized communities.
            Other writers have concentrated on other aspects of this region— the geology of the
                    Keweenaw Peninsula, the technology of copper mining, Native Americans, the fur trade, and the role
                    of organized labor. Lankton focuses on the social history of the region, emphasizing the early
                    pioneers—the men, women, and children and the role they played in community life. Special
                    attention is devoted to a variety of related major themes, such as transportation and travel (not
                    only shipping from Sault Ste. Marie and the "world below," but overland travel
                    between the mines and the mining towns); the living conditions of explorers, missionaries, the
                    military, and the various groups associated with the copper-mining operation; the foodways of the
                    frontier and the yearly struggle to get sufficient supplies from "below" before
                    the ice and winter storms closed the Great Lakes for several months.
            Lankton gives special emphasis to family life on the mining frontier and the indispensable role of
                    pioneer women in building and maintaining homes for their spouses and children. The churches and
                    schools of the region are also covered in detail, based on official church records and the personal
                    collections and writings of religious leaders like Bishop Frederic Baraga and the Reverend John
                    Pitezel. For the educational aspects of the mining communities Lankton utilizes the school records
                    and the detailed account left by Henry Hobart, a young 
                        Vermont
                    -born school teacher who contracted to teach at the Cliff mine from 1863 to 1865. Hobart
                    described the life of a teacher facing a daily average of ninety students between the ages of six
                    and twenty in a one-room schoolhouse. In his four-hundred-page journal Hobart provides insights into
                    the educational philosophy of the day, student activities, and the interaction of young scholars
                    with diverse ethnic backgrounds. Fortunately for Lankton and others concerned about the social
                    history of the region, Hobart was a keen chronicler of everyday life on the mining frontier, the
                    celebration of holidays, the rivalries between the Cornish, Irish, and German settlers, the
                    consumption of alcohol, and the establishment of community clubs and organizations like the
                    Independent Order of Good Templars and Oddfellows.
            Lankton also relies upon other diaries to shed light on living conditions on the Keweenaw during this
                    formative period. Lucena Brockway, who came to the area in 1843 with her husband Daniel, described
                    the difficult life of a pioneer woman in various mining towns. Ruth Douglass's diary
                    described her life on Isle Royale, an isolated island in northern Lake Superior. The writings of
                    John Forster, Henry Schoolcraft, Charles Whittlesey, and other pioneers provided additional
                    invaluable material for the book.
            
               Beyond the Boundaries is not only a major contribution to the social history of the
                    Upper Peninsula but a model for those interested in  the
                    transformation of isolated settlements into organized communities.

               Mixed Harvest: The Second Great Transformation in the Rural North, 1870-1930. By
                    Hal S. Barron. (

            Specialists in rural history will find much of what Hal S. Barron says in Mixed
                    Harvest familiar, but that does not mean his book is unimportant. Barron offers a deliberate,
                    reasoned, and well-written survey of key topics in what he calls the "second great
                    transformation" of rural life, 1870 to 1930. He breaks considerable new ground and also
                    provides a masterly synthesis of research interpreting changes in farm life during this time.
            First he examines two classic arenas of conflict between urban reformers and rural defenders of the
                    status quo—road reform and school reform. The localism inherent in the office of
                    pathmaster and the folkways supported by working out road taxes were unacceptable to city folk, who
                    wanted good roads for bicycles and, later, automobiles. Likewise the local autonomy of school
                    districts was seen as a stumbling block to urban reformers bent on establishing graded schools
                    through consolidation. These were "flash points" that "highlighted the
                    conflict between two competing visions of society" (p. 44). Farmers opposed the reformers
                    because they valued local autonomy and were frugal. Urban reforms, they knew, always cost them
                    money. Federal aid, gas taxes, and their own adoption of the automobile eventually made farmers more
                    favorable to road reform. Schools, however, reflected "culture and ideology" (p.
                    7), and so consolidation was thwarted.
            The second general area examined is farm organization. Barron looks first at dairy organizations in 
                        New York
                     and second (with more pertinence to Indiana) at farmers' grain elevators in
                    the Midwest. Cooperative grain elevators were manifestations of localism too, striving to cut out
                    the middleman, but farmers found that pure localism was not tenable. To overcome obstacles and
                    boycotts initiated by private dealers, the cooperatives had to organize beyond their own
                    communities. Strictly as "a business proposition" (p. 128), they had to become
                    more cosmopolitan.
            The third and most interesting area treated is consumer culture, beginning with mail order catalogs
                    and progressing through chain stores, the proliferation of automobiles, movies, radio, and home
                    modernization before the "full flowering of a consumer culture"
                    by the  1920s. Here is an intriguing discussion of how 
                        Montgomery
                     Ward established rapport with rural buyers; the importance of parcel post; the rise of
                    chain stores; the reordering of rural geography by the automobile; the custom of Saturday night
                    trading and movie attendance; and the ways farmers and the radio industry affected one another.
                    Farmers bought radios, thus entering consumer culture, but when they did, their listening
                    preferences in turn shaped radio programming. This interchange brought about not the displacement of
                    farm values by urban values but rather "a hybrid rural version of that culture,"
                    WLS Barn Dance and so on—a sort of mass rural culture.
            Farmers thus reaped a "mixed harvest," one of "resistance and
                    accommodation and of change as well as continuity" (p. 245). Barron's conclusions
                    are particularly refreshing in that he does not consign farmers to the victim culture so fashionable
                    in recent decades. Farmers made their choices, he says, and lived with them.
            A final note on Barron's method: it reprises the approach of Earl Hayter a generation ago in
                        The Troubled Farmer, drawing general insights from a set of related, topical
                    essays. As opposed to the new social history, which postholes specific topics in a small area, the
                    essay approach follows the connecting strands across the countryside. It is a good method, as well
                    as a readable one, and Barron proves it so in this exemplary work.

               Gender and the Politics of Welfare Reform: Mothers' Pensions in 
                            Chicago
                        , 1911-1929. By Joanne L. Goodwin. (
                        Chicago
                    : University of 
                        Chicago

                    $45.00.)
            Although Joanne L. Goodwin's book joins a long list of works published in the past decade on
                    the Progressive era origins of welfare "as we knew it," her 
                        Chicago
                     study is the first to focus on the local implementation of "mothers'
                    pensions," state level programs to aid single-mother families that were adopted by forty
                    states between 1911, when 
                        Illinois
                     passed the first law, and 1920. Unfortunately, mothers' pensions case records
                    in 
                        Chicago
                     were destroyed; so Goodwin depends principally on institutional reports and
                    contemporary research, much of which was undertaken to justify and bolster the program.
                    Consequently, there are few glimpses of the way the program was administered in specific cases.
                    Instead, Goodwin concentrates on the ideas and interests of the groups promoting and opposing
                    mothers' pensions in 
                        Chicago
                    , their struggles for power, and the ways compromises shaped the program.
            
            Goodwin's story is essentially a familiar one: 
                        Chicago
                     mothers' pensions failed to provide adequate, dignified public assistance to
                    poor single-mother families. Despite popular rhetoric that stressed the social value of maternal
                    nurturance and the economy of supporting mother-only families in their own homes, fears of runaway
                    costs, runaway fathers, and big government undermined public support. 
                        Chicago
                    's politicians were hostile and stingy in providing funding because there was
                    no political payoff for them: the juvenile court administered the program and controlled the jobs.
                    Charities professionals rejected the law's social insurance philosophy and demanded
                    restrictions limiting pensions to citizens and to the "worthy" poor and required
                    ongoing supervision of recipients. Administrators also used racist criteria in enrolling families.
                    Goodwin argues that the pensions did not even keep single mothers out of the workforce, so that they
                    could rear their children full-time. She points out that administrators expected most mothers to
                    work for wages, at least part-time. She argues that this policy devalued both mothers' work
                    as childrearers and as wage-earners, since the "mother-work" was seen as less
                    important than wage-earning, yet the wage-earning was poorly remunerated and part-time.
            Goodwin is more sympathetic than some other scholars to the Hull House intellectuals (Julia Lathrop,
                    Sophonisba Breckinridge, and Edith Abbott) who provided the research underpinnings to
                    mothers' pensions. While she judges them to have been wrong in supporting legislation based
                    on women's difference from men, she concludes that they were at least social justice
                    feminists (committed to women's equality with men) rather than maternalists (who believed
                    mothers had special claims on the state).
            Some of Goodwin's critiques seem ahistorical; e.g., she criticizes mothers'
                    pensions supporters because they required "the achievement of certain standards"
                    of mothering for women to qualify for maternal entitlement (p. 185); but, since those supporters
                    thought entitlement was justified by mothers' service to the state in producing good
                    citizens, standards were inevitable. The model institution for Progressives was the juvenile court,
                    in which professionals evaluated parenting in a confidently interventionist spirit; without that
                    spirit, the mothers' pensions law would never have been passed.
            Indiana, though quick to adopt the juvenile court, was the last state in the Midwest to pass a
                    mothers' pension law, which seems not to have been put into effect, despite the attention
                    of women's organizations in the state. Therein lies a tale?

            The brief, violent careers of midwestern bandits in the early 1930s continues to exert an apparently
                    irresistible attraction to amateur historians of crime. Jeffery King, a retired reference librarian
                    and freelance writer, is the latest to join this group. Like his predecessors, King has diligently
                    mined the original sources of the period, including pertinent FBI materials which record the
                    bureau's gradual involvement in the effort to end the careers of these bandits. The result
                    is certainly entertaining, as are most of the recent biographies of the outlaws, but like his fellow
                    sleuths King fails to provide us with an understanding of the criminals and their times.
            King begins his story very well, briefly describing several advantages the bandits enjoyed over their
                    erstwhile captors, including the woeful lack of police training and inadequate manpower and
                    equipment. He gives due attention to the consequences of the mobility that automobiles gave these
                    criminals, pointing out that new roads and enhanced speed enabled outlaws to escape the scenes of
                    their crimes very rapidly. King also describes the isolated world of Cookson Hills in rural 
                        Oklahoma
                     where Floyd grew up and often hid during his violent career. Not yet fully integrated
                    into the state's economic and political networks, and resentful of outsiders, the residents
                    of Cook-son Hills provided a variety of criminals with safe refuge.
            Having set the stage for his drama, King fails to integrate these ideas into a fully developed
                    analysis of Floyd's career. While he occasionally notes the advantages outlaws enjoyed,
                    King does not explain systematically how they helped these bandits temporarily succeed. In fact, it
                    appears from King's narrative, as well as those of other recent biographers, that the
                    midsection of the nation had a loosely connected interstate urban criminal culture stretching from
                            
                  St. Paul, Minnesota
               , to Hot Springs, 
                        Arkansas
                    , and including 
                  Kansas City,
                            Chicago, Memphis
               , and several other cities where criminals could find such services
                    as fences, doctors, corrupt politicians and policemen, and safe houses. Despite his origins in rural 
                        Oklahoma
                    , Floyd utilized this urban underworld throughout his career, and its existence does
                    much to explain not only his success, but that of several other bandits as well. King therefore
                    misses an opportunity not only to entertain us, but also to enhance our understanding of the outlaw
                    phenomenon in the early 1930s.
            King does, however, provide a careful, detailed narrative of Floyd's violent career. In
                    doing so, he implicitly challenges Michael Wallis's assertion (in Pretty Boy:
                        The Life and Times of Charles Arthur Floyd, 1992) that Floyd was not involved in the
                    infamous 
                        Kansas City
                     Massacre. Utilizing FBI records, King carefully traces Floyd's journey to 
                        Kansas City
                     and the way in which he was recruited  for the
                    attempt to rescue Frank Nash. King's account of the massacre seems the more credible of the
                    two because he effectively cites specific FBI and other sources, while Wallis neglected to do so.
                    Settling such historiographical debates is a useful accomplishment, and King demonstrates that the
                    resolution of such disputes rests on the careful use of evidence.
            In sum, this highly readable narrative will provide devotees of social banditry with yet another
                    well-crafted biography of Floyd, but we still await the study that will make sense of the phenomenon
                    he exemplified.

               Cleaning Up the Great Lakes: From Cooperation to Confrontation. By Terence
                    Kehoe. (
                        DeKalb
                    : Northern 
                        Illinois
                     University Press, 1997. Pp. [xi], 250. Maps, illustrations, notes, selected
                    bibliography, index. $32.00.)
            The best parts of this book are in the last chapter, which contains two case studies of environmental
                    public policymaking involving the Great Lakes area: one was a dispute about the relation between
                    eutrophication and phosphorus-containing laundry detergents and the other a controversy over the
                    effects of hot water from the cooling systems of nuclear and conventional power plants. In these two
                    studies, the author traces the public's increasing environmental interest, loss of faith in
                    existing state institutions, and evolving reform strategies in the face of scientific uncertainty,
                    business intransigence, and state-federal regulatory conflicts.
            The strengths of these two studies lie in their complexity and completeness. Federal players from
                    presidents to undersecretaries and state players from governors to citizens' advisory
                    boards jostle with scientists, journalists, and local neighborhood environmental groups in
                    determining the fate of the Great Lakes. The two studies fulfill their author's
                    self-proclaimed mission of analyzing the relation between state and federal policymaking during an
                    era of transition from a cooperative climate in which lax water quality standards were negotiated
                    between state regulators and businesses, to a more confrontational climate, in which stricter
                    federally-mandated water quality standards were imposed. In the end, however, the author
                    demonstrates with appropriate irony that states still set many water quality standards in
                    consultation with businesses and substitute voluntary and very slow compliance for strict legal
                    enforcement of pollution control laws.
            The rest of the book is less comprehensive, although packed with useful information. The local
                    histories used as examples of fundamental  principles are based
                    largely on government reports, politicians' papers, business journals, and newspaper
                    accounts. Perhaps because of his reliance on these sources, the author's important actors
                    are government officials, business leaders, and journalists. Citizen-activists and scientists appear
                    seldom in early chapters. Still, the details on changing water quality policy in 
                  New York, Michigan,
                            Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio
               , Indiana, and 
                        Illinois
                     offer much to those interested in the political history of
                    environmental regulation in those areas. The author focuses particularly on federal intervention in
                    the Lake Erie, southern Lake Michigan, and 
                        Detroit
                     areas. 
                        Canada
                     is included only insofar as the International Joint Commission became involved in Great
                    Lakes water quality policy.
            The theoretical and conceptual heart of the book is largely derived from the work of Walter
                    Rosenbaum, George Hoberg, Joel Tarr, and other scholars of national water quality policies. The
                    author follows Samuel Hays in arguing that postwar affluence and increased leisure time allowed
                    citizens' increased attention to quality-of-life issues, including an appreciation of their
                    natural surroundings; a "sense of place" led midwestern inhabitants to seek to
                    protect their Great Lakes home. Discovering that "business corrupts politics," as
                    Richard McCormick has written, citizens turned to the courts and the federal government to force
                    states to protect the environment better. Public environmental concerns were both mirrored and
                    inflated by newspapers. The environmental agenda was welcomed by a Democratic party eager to address
                    citizens' quality-of-life concerns. Republicans, too, responded to indignation about the
                    business "capture" of the environmental regulatory apparatus (a phrase attributed
                    to James Q. Wilson), leading to the entertaining spectacle of Richard Nixon promoting stricter
                    business regulation.
            The book is confusing or seems incomplete in a few places. The national regulatory legislation, from
                    the 1899 Refuse Act to the 1972 Clean Water Act, is introduced topically, out of chronological
                    order; a table listing the various acts might have helped the reader sort out the many important
                    acts and amendments. Explanations of taconite "tailing fibers" and chloroorganic
                    pesticide persistence and mobility are weak, and overall the book would have benefited from more
                    attention to science and scientific debates. Kehoe refers to increasing amounts of effluent from
                    Great Lakes businesses entering municipal water treatment facilities during the 1960s and 1970s and
                    emphasizes cities' financial difficulties in undertaking necessary sewage treatment, but he
                    ignores discussions between sewage authorities and businesses about the quantity and quality of
                    manufacturing effluent entering municipal sewage streams.
            Despite these quibbles, however, overall the book succeeds at tracing a complicated story of the
                    Great Lakes states' regulatory aims  and apparatuses
                    and how they changed—and more importantly, did not change—over the 1960s and
                    1970s.

               Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and

            Philip D. Morgan's new book forced me to revise my view that in today's world of
                    academic publications any monograph over 400 pages is probably too long. Not only is there nothing
                    in this dense study that is superfluous or dispensable, but it also brings back the almost forgotten
                    pleasure of graceful, jargonless prose and argumentation that never feels contrived. Morgan set out
                    to paint a full and comprehensive panorama of slave life in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and
                    the Low Country, but unlike many panoramas, it is not painted in broad brushstrokes but in a
                    meticulous and systematic manner, rich in analytical detail and built upon a huge source base, which
                    includes much that is new to colonial American historiography.
            The first part of the book gives an extensive economic perspective on slavery in the two regions,
                    covering the different plantation systems, material life, and the organization of field and skilled
                    work of slaves. Since the economy defines daily existence in profound ways, this section provides a
                    solid basis for the more strictly social and cultural analysis that follows. Part II focuses on the
                    various types of encounters between Africans and Europeans: economic exchanges, violence, sex,
                    recreation, and religion. Particularly interesting is the richly documented examination of trade and
                    property ownership by slaves, showing how even in a repressive regime the relentless laws of the
                    market found avenues of expression. A separate section is devoted to patriarchalism, discussed here
                    as an ethos defining the relationships between master and slave. Notably, Morgan avoids the
                    pitfall—seen in some studies—of treating patriarchalism as primarily a
                    rationalization for the slave system; instead, he stresses that it was an "authentic, if
                    deeply flawed, worldview… not just a smokescreen for exploitation" (p. 275).
            Perhaps the most important and original contribution of this book is the extensive discussion in Part
                    III of the so far little-known interactions and social networks within the black community. These
                    include relations between Creoles and Africans, among Creoles, among  Africans, between blacks and Indians, and between the free blacks and
                    slaves. They reveal deep divisions and stratifications as well as a growing sense of common identity
                    transcending class lines. A distinct ethnic culture emerged, according to Morgan, when blacks
                    established solid networks of social relations in which the family became central. The two regions,
                    at the same time, retained their peculiar local characteristics as subcultures. For instance,
                    two-parent families were more common in 
                        South Carolina
                     than in 
                        Virginia
                    , where families were more often disrupted. Marked differences are also shown in
                    dialects, religious and magical practices, and music. The final section is devoted to culture in the
                    strict sense, the symbolic dimensions of slave life: language, play, and religion. Here one finds a
                    fascinating array of themes, including fashion consciousness, hairstyles, music, games, dancing,
                    funerals, and magical beliefs and practices derived from African heritage and preserved in slave
                    culture after Christianization.
            Except for a succinct prolegomenon introducing the basic conceptualizations, the book concentrates
                    entirely on the praxis of slave culture, the everyday life, the face-to-face relations (including
                    gestures!), the rare joys, and the tedium of life. Echoes of the work of E. P. Thompson and Eugene
                    D. Genovese are unmistakable, especially the latter's concept of slavery creating an
                    inseparable, organic relationship between blacks and whites, although Morgan sees it less in terms
                    of class rule than in terms of cultural interactions. Typically, there are no grand theories or
                    models of slaves' mentalité here; the author takes great care
                    to present a balanced view of a subject that has in the past elicited so much controversy. He
                    rejects extreme claims such as that the Africans experienced a "spiritual
                    holocaust," that they routinely practiced "African religion" (p. 6581, or
                    that white culture was widely penetrated and changed by African culture. True to the promise of the
                    title, the design of the book is consistently contrapuntal. The two regional African-American
                    societies provide "commentaries upon one another" (p. xvi) that reveal the similar
                    and the different forces that shaped them: staple production, ecology and settlement patterns,
                    character and volume of slave supply, structure of slave populations, and planter lifestyles. The
                    tension between masters and slaves is another organizing pattern; the two groups are posed as
                    "opposite extremes of a magnetic field, poles apart and yet holding each other in
                    suspension, each defining the other" (p. 273). The spotlight on two regions gives the book
                    sufficient specificity and focus while the comparative approach allows the author to uncover much
                    about eighteenth-century American slave life in general.
            Morgan's admirable and largely successful quest for striking a balance between presenting
                    the humanity of the various encounters between slave and master and exposing the exploitation of the
                    former occasionally produces an unintended effect; because of the constant  and forceful emphasis on the truth that slavery was deeply flawed and
                    intrinsically contradictory, the reader may at times be under the impression that the then
                    widely-accepted institution was an anomaly of sorts. If cultural history is an effort at imagining
                    what it would be like to believe in precepts and values that we may not share today and to act upon
                    them, then such weaving of modern and earlier conceptual means of constituting reality is a bit
                    risky, as it would be to analyze the caste system in the culture of 
                        India
                     in terms of its contradictions with one's own different notion of equality.
                    One could note along the same lines that his argument that the loyalty of many bondsmen to their
                    masters represented a "tragic involvement of many slaves in their own oppression"
                    (p. 385) downplays both the lack of choices caused by the totalitarian nature of the slave system
                    and the ensuing cultural efforts to make existential sense of participation in it (vide the
                    phenomenon of "captive minds" in communist and Nazi systems). Perhaps the book
                    would have benefited from a little more appreciation for the rich theory of cultural anthropology
                    (incidentally, Bronislaw Malinowski, one of its founders, has his first name cited incorrectly as
                    Bernard, p. xxiii).
            One may disagree with this or that minor detail of the author's interpretation, but the
                    overall product is without doubt impressive for its careful and balanced discussion of the dynamics
                    of slave culture, the logical architecture of the book (Morgan even eschews a
                    separate—and by now sacred requirement in colonial studies—chapter on the
                    Revolutionary era), the vast scholarship absorbed by the author, the originality of so much new
                    source material, and the elegant explanation of the complexities of the subject. It will remain an
                    authoritative study for a long time to come.

            Pickett's charge is one of only a handful of historic episodes that almost every American
                    knows something about. Or, as Carol Reardon reminds us, we think we know something about that
                    glorious— and horrible—charge on 
                        Gettysburg
                    's final day. This provocative book works at various levels, adding important
                    contributions to what we know while also calling into question the true meaning of that knowledge.
            At its most fundamental level Pickett's Charge in History and Memory is a
                    conventional chronological narrative, summarizing the  evolving
                    popular conception of Pickett's charge. Reardon begins with a very brief sketch of the
                    dramatis personae as they stood poised for the attack that early afternoon. Major General George E.
                    Pickett commanded three brigades of Virginians from the Confederate First Corps. To their left on
                    Seminary Ridge were men of the Third Corps from 
                  North
                        Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi
               , and 
                        Alabama
                    . Awaiting them behind fortifications on Cemetery Ridge were the Union's II
                    Corps. The eight chapters that follow consider different perspectives on the events that followed,
                    starting with the murky, fragmentary accounts by the participants themselves. Many points of
                    confusion and controversy emerged from these early descriptions, to be joined by other layers of
                    distortion introduced by subsequent waves of journalists, historians, novelists, and artists. But
                    the conflict at the core of the story centers on the identification of the charge with Pickett and
                    his Virginians. How much credit did the Third Corps deserve, and what explains their lack of public
                    recognition? And what of the gallant Union soldiers who turned back the assault? How has their
                    achievement been remembered? At a different level, this detailed account of the shifting
                    understanding of Pickett's charge merges with a broader discussion of the evolving place of
                    the Civil War in the national consciousness. As the nation underwent the slow process of
                    reconciliation and commemoration, Pickett's men became a culturally useful symbol for a
                    postwar America intent on acknowledging the Lost Cause without reopening old wounds.
            At the most theoretical levels Reardon uses this one episode as the focus for an extended discussion
                    of "two powerful forces [that] frame the way we recall past events: the objectivity of
                    history—the search for ‘truth’—and the subjectivity of
                    memory, which shapes perceptions of that ‘truth’" (p. 1). By
                    insisting on a dichotomy between history and memory, Reardon sometimes seems to be discounting the
                    role of the historian as arbiter among competing accounts. On other occasions she appears more
                    willing to take a side, indicating for instance that the non-Virginians are victims of
                    memory's distortions. Moreover, Reardon seems to draw no clear distinction between an
                    assemblage of "facts" and something else that we might call
                    "history," which includes (inherently subjective) judgments about the significance
                    of certain events. The initial eyewitness accounts by soldiers and reporters routinely garbled many
                    details while omitting others, but is it fair to dismiss these versions as mere subjective memory
                    rather than considering that these participants may have been quite reliable in recording those
                    aspects of their history—emotions, sensations, results-that they deemed most historically
                    significant?

               Thaddeus Stevens: Nineteenth-Century Egalitarian. By Hans L. Trefousse. (
                        Chapel Hill
                    : University of

            It has been over thirty years since the last book-length biographical study of Thaddeus Stevens
                    appeared. During those years historical scholarship has revised many interpretations of Civil War
                    history. It is only fitting, therefore, that the life of one of the most important figures of that
                    era, and perhaps the most important political figure of the Reconstruction period, the
                    "great commoner," should also be re-examined. Hans L. Trefousse's
                    detailed biography, Thaddeus Stevens: Nineteenth-Century Egalitarian, surpasses
                    previous biographies, offering a balanced yet admiring perspective on the public life of this
                    important leader in the nineteenth-century struggle for black equality.
            The bulk of Trefousse's biography is focused, as one would expect, on Stevens's
                    activities during the crisis of union. However, fully one-third of the volume examines his budding
                    political career in the 1830s through the 1850s' offering students of the period important
                    material on the origins and development of his political beliefs as well as his political practices.
                    Stevens's earliest crusades were involved not with the slavery issue but instead with
                    public school reform, tariffs, and antimasonry. In fact, early in his career he represented
                    slaveowners attempting to regain possession of runaway slaves. Even on these early issues, however,
                    Stevens was, in Trefousse's analysis, "a radical," (p. 137) something he
                    remained his entire life.
            Stevens's national fame did not come until the 1850s, when he became an uncompromising
                    critic of the South and her "peculiar institution." His distaste for slavery was
                    not new and, indeed, had revealed itself as early as the 1830s. Notable about Stevens's
                    antislavery beliefs was that they were informed by a real desire for equal rights for African
                    Americans and were not simply a free-soil attack on slavery's effects on white labor. Much
                    of Trefousse's discussion of Stevens's activities during the war and after is
                    familiar: he analyzes Stevens's political battles with other Republicans; his demand for
                    abolition; his insistence upon punishment for rebel leadership and confiscation of Confederate
                    property; and, of course, his significant work as a leader in the reconstruction process and the
                    struggle for equal rights for black Americans.
            Trefousse offers several noteworthy contributions in his analysis of Stevens's politics.
                    Although Trefousse recognizes Stevens's singular significance in the politics of the
                    period, he also makes clear that Stevens's power in shaping reconstruction policy has been
                    overstated by previous scholars. Although Stevens was probably the most powerful political figure in
                    the nation in the years immediately following the war, he was at the head of an often uneasy
                    alliance and  was by no means the "dictator"
                    of reconstruction policies, as he has so often been represented (p. xi).
            One drawback in Trefousse's study is that the reader does not get a full sense of why
                    Stevens took the political positions that he did. Although Trefousse argues that Stevens's
                    "increasing commitment to antislavery and radical uplift is not hard to explain"
                    (p. 46), it never is fully explained. Trefousse makes reference to Stevens's rethinking the
                    issue after he represented slaveowners, but why he reexamined his beliefs is not developed. Indeed,
                    the book would have been strengthened by a fuller exploration of Stevens's motivation in a
                    variety of areas, including his antislavery beliefs and hostility to the South, as well as his
                    progressive belief in complete equality (far ahead of most of his contemporaries).
            Nevertheless, Trefousse has authored a solid account of this important Civil War era political
                    figure. Stevens was decades ahead of contemporaries in his struggle for an interracial democracy,
                    and Trefousse convincingly argues that Stevens's "legacy made possible racial
                    progress in the twentieth century" (p. 245).

               Unionizing the Jungles: Labor and Community in the Twentieth Century Meatpacking
                        Industry. Edited by Shelton Stromquist and Marvin Bergman. (
                        Iowa City
                    : University of 
                        Iowa
                     Press, 1997. Pp. vi, 272. Notes, index. $32.95.)
            It is difficult to use the phrase "the jungle" without invoking Upton
                    Sinclair's classic novel; indeed, the editors of Unionizing the Jungles begin by noting the
                    persistence of this "compelling metaphor for life and work in the nation's
                    meatpacking industry" (p. 1). The metaphor, though, does not do justice to the complexity
                    of the history of packinghouse workers. The essays in this volume move toward bringing their
                    experience into the mainstream of American working-class history.
            The origins of this book lie in a "scholarly conversation" on the history of the
                    meatpacking industry that was sponsored by the Center for Recent 
                        United States
                     History (CRUSH), in which nine scholars presented their research and discussed it with
                    other scholars and labor activists. The resulting volume includes an editors' introduction
                    and essays by those who presented their work.
            Essay collections face many pitfalls, including uneven quality of individual contributions, lack of
                    coherence, and inadequate contextualization. The editors and contributors have largely avoided  these, presenting essays that complement each other, represent
                    solid research, and are consistently placed within larger themes in American working-class history.
                    These virtues reflect the conference's success in identifying central themes in the history
                    of packinghouse workers, including the degree to which the industry's labor relations were
                    exceptional; the question of worker agency in union-building; the role of race, ethnicity, and
                    gender in workforce formation and unionization; the United Packinghouse Workers of
                    America's (UPWA) history of social and political activism after World War II; and the
                    implications of this history for working-class history and for those interested in the current state
                    of the labor movement.
            Paul Street's essay on Swift and Company's welfare capitalism after World War I
                    argues that this program represented more than management manipulation: it incorporated the core
                    demands workers put forward during their wartime upsurge in organization and activism. Swift workers
                    found ways to manipulate welfare capitalism and use it to define the terms on which they would
                    embrace company "loyalty." When the Depression undermined Swift's ability
                    to maintain its programs, CIO organizers found a powerful organizing tool in the expectations
                    welfare capitalism had helped legitimize.
            Peter Rachleffs essay on the Independent Union of All Workers (IUAW) goes to the heart of the debate
                    over the potential of what Staughton Lynd and others have called "community-based
                    unionism" as an alternative to the national, bureaucratic, industrial unionism of the CIO.
                    Centered in the packing plants of Austin and 
                  Albert
                        Lea, Minnesota
               , the IUAW
                    organized "wall to wall" within communities, linking workers regardless of
                    occupation and emphasizing participation and democracy. Outside the workplace, it created a
                    union-based culture, with publications, organizations, classes, and social activities linking
                    members and their families. The IUAW enjoyed a brief but dramatic life before disappearing under the
                    onslaught of national unions and organizing committees in the late 1930s.
            Several essays focus on the UPWA, which survived the CIO's Cold War era purges with its
                    values of racial equality and social democracy intact. Rick Halpern explores race and radicalism in
                    the 
                        Chicago
                     stockyards, documenting an alliance between black and white workers that was crucial to
                    the success of the Packinghouse Workers Organizing Committee and to the UPWA. Roger Horowitz finds
                    the UPWA's civil rights activism rooted in its tradition of shopfloor unionism. Wilson J.
                    Warren demonstrates how rank-and file anti-communism and racial prejudice undermined the
                    UPWA's commitment to social democratic programs. Bruce Fehn presents a local case study of
                    the UPWA's commitment to racial equality. Dennis Deslippe describes the union's
                    response to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, finding that leaders and male rank-and-filers
                    resisted full implementation of gender equality because of a combination of union  traditions and concern over the shrinking number of jobs in the
                    industry. Deborah Fink documents, from a participant's perspective, the persistence of
                    gender inequity on the packinghouse floor.
            Mark A. Grey ends the volume by looking at Storm Lake, 
                        Iowa
                    . Long a unionized meatpacking center, Storm Lake saw its packing plant close down in
                    1981. It soon was reopened by 
                        Iowa
                     Beef Packers, which brought it and the city into the new order in meatpacking: nonunion
                    workers, lower pay, fewer benefits, high turnover, and a less-skilled workforce with a large
                    immigrant presence.
            This collection contributes much to our knowledge of the history of packinghouse workers; it should
                    prove valuable to labor historians, while also adding to our understanding of an important element
                    of midwestern history. The successes (and failures) of the UPWA that are documented here, moreover,
                    offer important lessons for those who hope to re-energize the labor movement.

            Peter Iverson's Barry Goldwater: Native Arizonan is volume 15 in the 
                        Oklahoma
                     Western Biography series. As such, it sticks closely to its central theme: to
                    understand Barry Goldwater one must understand Goldwater's roots in and lifelong attachment
                    to 
                        Arizona
                    , both in its physical and political aspects. Thus we read of the family history of the
                    "trader's grandson"; of Goldwater the businessman and advocate of 
                        Arizona
                    's economic development; of Goldwater the Phoenix political reformer; of
                    Goldwater the ham radio operator, the pilot, and the military aviator; of Goldwater the outdoors
                    adventurer and conservationist; of Goldwater the much-admired photographer of 
                        Arizona
                    's peoples and scenery; and of Goldwater the friend of the 
                        Arizona
                     Indians.
            Throughout the book, but particularly in the two last chapters, Iverson makes much of the tensions in
                    Goldwater's 
                        Arizona
                     career. Like so many Westerners before him, Goldwater, in person and politics, was a
                    rugged individualist and an opponent of intrusive and expansive government; but he also was a fierce
                    advocate for federal aid for 
                        Arizona
                     development, both in the water projects upon which he believed 
                        Arizona
                    's growth depended, and in the state's aviation, highway, and military
                    construction. At the end of his life, Goldwater came to recognize the mixed blessings of this
                    development, for it had transformed his beloved state in his own lifetime from a remote and
                    beautiful backwater of America to an economic powerhouse full of high tech industries and sprawling
                    retirement cities, awash in  tourism and dominated by the urban
                    politics of metropolitan Phoenix and Tucson. 
                        Arizona
                    , of course, still has many wild and empty spaces, but Iverson's extended
                    treatment of Goldwater's complex reaction to the development of 
                        Arizona
                     for which he had campaigned so long is the highlight of the book and its most original
                    contribution. This ambivalent view of the blessings of western development has been with us at least
                    since the days of Daniel 
                        Boone
                     and James Fenimore Cooper.
            Surprisingly, considering the focus of the book, there is little treatment of Goldwater's
                    activities as family man (Goldwater's first wife and mother of his four children, Margaret
                    "Peggy" Johnson, was from 
                        Muncie
                    , Indiana, where they were married on September 22,1934), business leader, or local
                    politician before his successful run for the 
                        United States
                     Senate in 1952. Perhaps space constraints precluded this, yet there are pages on what
                    seem like digressions about Hopi-Navajo conflicts (a specialty of Iverson's) and the
                    origins of 
                  
                            Arizona
                         Highways, as well as nine pages of preface. More understandably, while
                    Goldwater's national campaigns are covered appropriately, as is his contribution to the
                    development of modern American conservativism and the Republican party, there is little about
                    Goldwater's actual life in the Senate or his legislative career, except for his masterful
                    work on the Defense Reorganization Act of 1986.
            Iverson goes out of his way to note that his own politics are not Goldwater's, but, with a
                    few irritating exceptions, he is remarkably fair to Goldwater, the conservative icon. Here we see a
                    Goldwater far from the reactionary stereotype so viciously, and successfully, manufactured by
                    Goldwater's enemies within the Repblican party and by Lyndon Johnson and his followers,
                    particularly Bill Moyers. Here we see the Goldwater who devoted himself all his life, as a matter of
                    principle, to civic service. Here we also see a Goldwater who daringly raised some important
                    political issues that today leaders of both parties recognize as legitimate concerns, such as the
                    need to balance budgets, to restrain the spending of the national government, to reform the system
                    of old age assistance, and to restore a sense of the importance of individual responsibility and
                    personal liberty in a free society.
            As personal memories of Goldwater fade, this short, useful book is well suited to introduce Goldwater
                    to a general audience and to convey to them something of the character of the man who early inspired
                    those who brought a revitalized conservative perspective to the American political scene.
