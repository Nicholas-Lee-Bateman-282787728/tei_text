                <p><hi rend="b">THE</hi> new man, Gregory Rose, sat at the door of his dwelling, his
                    arms folded, his legs crossed, and a profound melancholy seeming to rest over
                    his soul. His house was a little square daub-and-wattle building, far out in the
                    âkarroo,â two miles from the homestead. It was covered outside with a sombre
                    coating of brown mud, two little panes being let into the walls for windows.
                    Behind it were the âsheep-kraals,â and to the right a large dam, now
                        principally<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7168-005"/> containing baked mud. Far off
                    the little âkopjeâ concealed the homestead, and was not itself an object
                    conspicuous enough to relieve the dreary monotony of the landscape.</p>
                <p>Before the door sat Gregory Rose in his shirt-sleeves, on a camp-stool, and ever
                    and anon he sighed deeply. There was that in his countenance for which even his
                    depressing circumstances failed to account. Again and again he looked at the
                    little âkopje,â at the milk-pail at his side, and at the brown pony, who a short
                    way off cropped the dry bushesâand sighed.</p>
                <p>Presently he rose and went into his house. It was one tiny room, the whitewashed
                    walls profusely covered with prints cut from the âIllustrated London Newsâ, and
                    in which there was a noticeable preponderance of female faces and figures. A
                    stretcher filled one end of the hut, and a rack for a gun and a little hanging
                    looking-glass diversified the gable opposite, while<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7168-006"/> in the centre stood a chair and table. All was
                    scrupulously neat and clean, for Gregory kept a little duster folded in the
                    corner of his table-drawer, just as he had seen his mother do, and every morning
                    before he went out he said his prayers, and made his bed, and dusted the table
                    and the legs of the chairs, and even the pictures on the wall and the
                    gun-rack.</p>
                <p>On this hot afternoon he took from beneath his pillow a watch-bag, made by his
                    sister Jemima, and took out the watch. Only half-past four! With a suppressed
                    groan he dropped it back and sat down beside the table. Half-past four!
                    Presently he roused himself. He would write to his sister Jemima. He always
                    wrote to her when he was miserable. She was his safety-valve. He forgot her when
                    he was happy; but he used her when he was wretched.</p>
                <p>He took out ink and paper; there was a family crest and motto on the latter, for
                        the<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7168-007"/> Roses since coming to the colony had
                    discovered that they were of distinguished lineage. Old Rose himself, an honest
                    English farmer, knew nothing of his noble descent; but his wife and daughter
                    knewâespecially his daughter. There were Roses in England who kept a park and
                    dated from the Conquest. So the colonial âRose Farmâ became âRose Manorâ in
                    remembrance of the ancestral domain, and the claim of the Roses to noble blood
                    was establishedâin their own minds at least.</p>
                <p>Gregory took up one of the white, crested sheets; but on deeper reflection he
                    determined to take a pink one, as more suitable to the state of his feelings. He
                    beganâ</p>
                <p>âKopje Alone,</p>
                <p>âMonday afternoon.</p>
                <p>âMY DEAR JEMINAââ</p>
                <p>Then he looked up into the little glass opposite. It was a youthful face
                    reflected there,<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7168-008"/> with curling brown beard and
                    hair; but in the dark blue eyes there was a look of languid longing that touched
                    him. He re-dipped his pen and wrote,â</p>
                <p>âWhen I look up into the little glass that hangs opposite me, I wonder if that
                    changed and sad faceââ</p>
                <p>Here he sat still and reflected. It sounded almost as if he might be conceited or
                    unmanly to be looking at his own face in the glass. No, that would not do. So he
                    looked for another pink sheet and began again.</p>

                                <p>â<hi rend="b">IT</hi> is hardly six months since I left you to
                                    come to this spot, yet could you now see me I know what you
                                    would say, I know what mother would sayââCan that be our
                                    Gregâthat thing with the strange look in his eyes?â</p>
                                <p>âYes, Jemima, it is your Greg, and the<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7168-009"/> change has been coming over me ever
                                    since I came here; but it is greatest since yesterday. You know
                                    what sorrows I have passed through, Jemima; how unjustly I was
                                    always treated at school, the masters keeping me back and
                                    calling me a blockhead, though, as they themselves allowed, I
                                    had the best memory of any boy in the school, and could repeat
                                    whole books from beginning to end. You know how cruelly father
                                    always used me, calling me a noodle and a milksop, just because
                                    he couldn't understand my fine nature. You know how he has made
                                    a farmer of me instead of a minister, as I ought to have been;
                                    you know it all, Jemima; and how I have borne it all, not as a
                                    woman, who whines for every touch, but as a man shouldâin
                                    silence.</p>
                                <p>âBut there are things, there is <emph>a</emph> thing, which the
                                    soul longs to pour forth into a kindred ear.</p>
                                <p>âDear sister, have you ever known what it is to keep wanting and
                                    wanting and wanting to kiss some one's mouth, and you may not;
                                    to touch some one's hand, and you cannot? I am in love,

                                    her name begins with <hi>E</hi>.</p>
                                <p>âShe is English. I do not know how her father came to marry a
                                    Boer-woman. It makes me feel so strange to put down that letter,
                                    that I can hardly go on writingâ<hi>E</hi>. I've loved her ever
                                    since I came here. For weeks I have not been able to eat or
                                    drink; my very tobacco when I smoke has no taste; and I can
                                    remain for no more than five minutes in one place, and sometimes
                                    feel as though I were really going mad.</p>
                                <p>âEvery evening I go there to fetch my milk. Yesterday she gave me
                                    some coffee. The spoon fell on the ground. She picked it up;
                                    when she gave it me her finger touched mine. Jemima, I do not
                                    know if I fancied itâI shivered hot, and she shivered too! I
                                    thought, âIt is all right; she will be mine; she loves me!â Just
                                    then, Jemima, in came a fellow, a great, coarse fellow, a
                                    Germanâa ridiculous fellow, with curls right down to his
                                    shoulders; it makes one sick to look at him. He's only a servant
                                    of the Boer-woman's, and a low, vulgar, uneducated<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7168-011"/> thing, that's never been to
                                    boarding-school in his life. He had been to the next farm
                                    seeking sheep. When he came in she said, âGood evening, Waldo.
                                    Have some coffee!â <emph>and she kissed him</emph>.</p>
                                <p>âAll last night I heard nothing else but âHave some coffee; have
                                    some coffee.â If I went to sleep for a moment I dreamed that her
                                    finger was pressing mine; but when I woke with a start I heard
                                    her say, âGood evening, Waldo. Have some coffee!â</p>
                                <p>âIs this madness?</p>
                                <p>âI have not eaten a mouthful to-day. This evening I go and
                                    propose to her. If she refuses me I shall go and kill myself
                                    to-morrow. There is a dam of water close by. The sheep have
                                    drunk most of it up, but there is still enough if I tie a stone
                                    to my neck.</p>
                                <p>âIt is a choice between death and madness. I can endure no more.
                                    If this should be the last letter you ever get from me, think of
                                    me tenderly, and forgive me. Without her life would be a howling
                                    wilderness, a long tribulation. She is my affinity; the one love
                                        of<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7168-012"/> my life, of my youth, of

                <p>Gregory, having finished this letter, read it over with much approval, put it in
                    an envelope,<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7168-013"/> addressed it, and sat
                    contemplating the ink-pot, somewhat relieved in mind.</p>
                <p>The evening turned out chilly and very windy after the day's heat. From afar off,
                    as Gregory neared the homestead on the brown pony, he could distinguish a little
                    figure in a little red cloak at the door of the cow-kraal. Em leaned over the
                    poles that barred the gate, and watched the frothing milk run through the black
                    fingers of the herdsman, while the unwilling cows stood with tethered heads by
                    the milking poles. She had thrown the red cloak over her own head, and held it
                    under her chin with a little hand, to keep from her ears the wind, that
                    playfully shook it, and tossed the little fringe of yellow hair into her
                    eyes.</p>
                <p>âIs it not too cold for you to be standing here?â said Gregory, coming softly
                    close to her.</p>
                <p>âOh, no; it is so nice. I always come to watch the milking. That red cow with
                        the<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7168-014"/> short horns is bringing up the calf of
                    the white cow that died. She loves it soâjust as if it were her own. It is so
                    nice to see her lick its little ears. Just look!â</p>
                <p>âThe clouds are black. I think it is going to rain to-night,â said Gregory.</p>
                <p>âYes,â answered Em, looking up as well as she could for the little yellow
                    fringe.</p>
                <p>âBut I'm sure you must be cold,â said Gregory, and put his hand under the cloak,
                    and found there a small fist doubled up, soft, and very warm. He held it fast in
                    his hand.</p>
                <p>âOh, Em, I love you better than all the world besides! Tell me, <emph>do</emph>
                    you love me a little?â</p>
                <p>âYes, I do,â said Em, hesitating, and trying softly to free her hand.</p>
                <p>âBetter than everything; better than all the world, darling?â he asked, bending
                    down so low that the yellow hair was blown into his eyes.</p>
                <pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7168-015"/>
                <p>âI don't know,â said Em, gravely. âI do love you very much; but I love my cousin
                    who is at school, and Waldo, very much. You see I have known them so long!â</p>
                <p>âOh, Em, do not talk to me so coldly!â Gregory cried, seizing the little arm that
                    rested on the gate, and pressing it till she was half afraid. The herdsman had
                    moved away to the other end of the âkraalâ now, and the cows, busy with their
                    calves, took no notice of the little human farce. âEm, if you talk so to me I
                    will go mad! You must love me, love me better than all! You must give yourself
                    to me. I have loved you since that first moment when I saw you walking by the
                    stone wall with the jug in your hands. You were made for me, created for me! I
                    will love you till I die! Oh, Em, do not be so cold, so cruel to me!â</p>
                <p>He held her arm so tightly that her fingers relaxed their hold, and the cloak
                    fluttered down<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7168-016"/> on to the ground, and the wind
                    played more roughly than ever with the little yellow head.</p>
                <p>âI do love you very much,â she said; âbut I do not know if I want to marry you. I
                    love you better than Waldo, but I can't tell if I love you better than Lyndall.
                    If you would let me wait for a week, I think perhaps I could tell you.â</p>
                <p>Gregory picked up the cloak and wrapped it round her.</p>
                <p>âIf you could but love me as I love you,â he said; âbut no woman <emph>can</emph>
                    love as a man can. I will wait till Saturday. I will not once come near you till
                    then. Good-bye! Oh, Em,â he said, turning again, and twining his arm about her,
                    and kissing her surprised little mouth, âif you are not my wife I cannot live. I
                    have never loved another woman, and I never shall!ânever, never!â</p>
                <p>âYou make me afraid,â said Em. âCome, let us go, and I will fill your pail.â</p>
                <pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7168-017"/>
                <p>âI want no milk. Good-bye! You will not see me again till Saturday.â</p>
                <p>Late that night, when every one else had gone to bed, the yellow-haired little
                    woman stood alone in the kitchen. She had come to fill the kettle for the next
                    morning's coffee, and now stood before the fire. The warm reflection lit the
                    grave old-womanish little face, that was so unusually thoughtful this
                    evening.</p>
                <p>âBetter than all the world; better than everything; he loves me better than
                    everything!â She said the words aloud, as if they were more easy to believe if
                    she spoke them so. She had given out so much love in her little life, and had
                    got none of it back with interest. Now one said, âI love you better than all the
                    world.â One loved her better than she loved him. How suddenly rich she was. She
                    kept clasping and unclasping her hands. So a beggar feels who falls asleep on
                    the pavement wet and hungry,<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7168-018"/> and who wakes in a
                    palace-hall with servants and lights, and a feast before him. Of course the
                    beggar's is only a dream, and he wakes from it; and this was real.</p>
                <p>Gregory had said to her, âI will love you as long as I live.â She said the words
                    over and over to herself like a song.</p>
                <p>âI will send for him to-morrow, and I will tell him how I love him back,â she
                    said.</p>
                <p>But Em needed not to send for him. Gregory discovered on reaching home that
                    Jemima's letter was still in his pocket. And, therefore, much as he disliked the
                    appearance of vacillation and weakness, he was obliged to be at the farm-house
                    before sunrise to post it.</p>
                <p>âIf I see her,â Gregory said, âI shall only bow to her. She shall see that I am a
                    man, one who keeps his word.â</p>
                <p>As to Jemima's letter, he had turned down one corner of the page, and then turned
                    it back, <choice>
                        <orig>leav-</orig>
                        <reg>leaving</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7168-019"/> ing a deep crease. That would show
                    that he was neither accepted nor rejected, but that matters were in an
                    intermediate condition. It was a more poetical way then putting it in plain
                    words.</p>
                <p>Gregory was barely in time with his letter, for Waldo was starting when he
                    reached the homestead, and Em was on the door-step to see him off. When he had
                    given the letter, and Waldo had gone, Gregory bowed stiffly and prepared to
                    remount his own pony, but somewhat slowly. It was still early; none of the
                    servants were about. Em came up close to him and put her little hand softly on
                    his arm as he stood by his horse.</p>
                <p>âI do love you best of all,â she said. She was not frightened now, however much
                    he kissed her. âI wish I was beautiful and nice,â she added, looking up into his
                    eyes as he held her against his breast.</p>
                <p>âMy darling, to me you are more beautiful<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7168-020"/> than
                    all the women in the world; dearer to me than everything it holds. If you were
                    in hell I would go after you to find you there! If you were dead, though my body
                    moved, my soul would be under the ground with you. All life as I pass with you
                    in my arms will be perfect to me. It will pass, pass like a ray of
                    sunshine.â</p>
                <p>Em thought how beautiful and grand his face was as she looked up into it. She
                    raised her hand gently and put it on his forehead.</p>
                <p>âYou are so silent, so cold, my Em,â he cried. âHave you nothing to say to
                    me?â</p>
                <p>A little shade of wonder filled her eyes.</p>
                <p>âI will do everything you tell me,â she said.</p>
                <p>What else could she say? Her idea of love was only service.</p>
                <p>âThen, my own precious one, promise never to kiss that fellow again. I cannot
                    bear that you should love any one but me. You must not! I will not have it! If
                    every relation I<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7168-021"/> had in the world were to die
                    to-morrow, I would be quite happy if I still only had you! My darling, my love,
                    why are you so cold? Promise me not to love him any more. If you asked
                        <emph>me</emph> to do anything for <emph>you</emph>, I would do it, though
                    it cost my life.â</p>
                <p>Em put her hand very gravely round his neck.</p>
                <p>âI will never kiss him,â she said, âand I will try not to love any one else. But
                    I do not know if I will be able.â</p>
                <p>âOh, my darling, I think of <emph>you</emph> all night, all day. I think of
                    nothing else, love, nothing else,â he said, folding his arms about her.</p>
                <p>Em was a little conscience-stricken; even that morning she had found time to
                    remember that in six months her cousin would come back from school, and she had
                    thought to remind Waldo of the lozenges for his cough, even when she saw Gregory
                    coming.</p>
                <pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7168-022"/>
                <p>âI do not know how it is,â she said humbly, nestling to him, âbut I cannot love
                    you so much as you love me. Perhaps it is because I am only a woman; but I
                        <emph>do</emph> love you as much as I can.â</p>
                <p>Now the Kaffir maids were coming from the huts. He kissed her again, eyes and
                    mouth and hands, and left her.</p>
                <p>Tant' Sannie was well satisfied when told of the betrothment. She herself
                    contemplated marriage within the year with one or other of her numerous
                    âvrijers,â and she suggested that the weddings might take place together.</p>
                <p>Em set to work busily to prepare her own household linen and wedding garments.
                    Gregory was with her daily, almost hourly, and the six months which elapsed
                    before Lyndall's return passed, as he felicitously phrased it, âlike a summer
                    night, when you are dreaming of some one you love.â</p>
                <pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7168-023"/>
                <p>Late one evening, Gregory sat by his little love, turning the handle of her
                    machine as she drew her work through it, and they talked of the changes they
                    would make when the Boer-woman was gone, and the farm belonged to them alone.
                    There should be a new room here, and a kraal there. So they chatted on. Suddenly
                    Gregory dropped the handle, and impressed a fervent kiss on the fat hand that
                    guided the linen.</p>
                <p>âYou are so beautiful, Em,â said the lover. âIt comes over me in a flood suddenly
                    how I love you.â</p>
                <p>Em smiled.</p>
                <p>âTant' Sannie says when I am her age no one will look at me; and it is true. My
                    hands are as short and broad as a duck's foot, and my forehead is so low, and I
                    haven't any nose. I <emph>can't</emph> be pretty.â</p>
                <p>She laughed softly. It was so nice to think he should be so blind.</p>
                <pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7168-024"/>
                <p>âWhen my cousin comes to-morrow you will see a beautiful woman, Gregory,â she
                    added presently. âShe is like a little queen: her shoulders are so upright, and
                    her head looks as though it ought to have a little crown upon it. You must come
                    to see her to-morrow as soon as she comes. I am sure you will love her.â</p>
                <p>âOf course I shall come to see her, since she is your cousin; but do you think I
                    could <emph>ever</emph> think any woman as lovely as I think you?â</p>
                <p>He fixed his seething eyes upon her.</p>
                <p>âYou could not help seeing that she is prettier,â said Em, slipping her right
                    hand into his; âbut you will never be able to like any one so much as you like
                    me.â</p>
                <p>Afterward, when she wished her lover good night, she stood upon the doorstep to
                    call a greeting after him; and she waited, as she always<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7168-025"/> did, till the brown pony's hoofs became inaudible
                    behind the âkopje.â</p>
                <p>Then she passed through the room where Tant' Sannie lay snoring, and through the
                    little room that was all draped in white, waiting for her cousin's return, on to
                    her own room.</p>
                <p>She went to the chest of drawers to put away the work she had finished, and sat
                    down on the floor before the lowest drawer. In it were the things she was
                    preparing for her marriage. Piles of white linen, and some aprons and quilts;
                    and in a little box in the corner a spray of orange-blossom which she had bought
                    from a smouse. There too was a ring Gregory had given her, and a veil his sister
                    had sent, and there was a little roll of fine embroidered work which Trana had
                    given her. It was too fine and good even for Gregory's wifeâjust right for
                    something very small and soft. She would keep it. And she touched it gently with
                    her forefinger, smiling;<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7168-026"/> and then she blushed
                    and hid it far behind the other things. She knew so well all that was in that
                    drawer, and yet she turned them all over as though she saw them for the first
                    time, packed them all out, and packed them all in, without one fold or crumple;
                    and then sat down and looked at them.</p>
                <p>To-morrow evening when Lyndall came she would bring her here, and show it her
                    all. Lyndall would so like to see itâthe little wreath, and the ring, and the
                    white veil! It would be so nice! Then Em fell to seeing pictures. Lyndall should
                    live with them till she herself got married some day.</p>
                <p>Every day when Gregory came home, tired from his work, and he would look about
                    and say, âWhere is my wife? Has no one seen my wife? Wife, some coffee!â and she
                    would give him some.</p>
                <p>Em's little face grew very grave at last, and<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7168-027"/>
                    she knelt up and extended her hands over the drawer of linen.</p>
                <p>âOh, God!â she said, âI am so glad! I do not know what I have done that I should
                    be so glad. Thank you!â</p>

                <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                <head type="sub">LYNDALL.</head>
                <p><hi rend="b">SHE</hi> was more like a princess, yes, far more like a princess,
                    than the lady who still hung on the wall in Tant' Sannie's bed-room. So Em
                    thought. She leaned back in the little armchair; she wore a grey dressing-gown,
                    and her long hair was combed out and hung to the ground. Em, sitting before her,
                    looked up with mingled respect and admiration.</p>
                <p>Lyndall was tired after her long journey, and had come to her room early. Her
                    eyes ran over the familiar objects. Strange to go away for four years, and come
                    back, and find that the candle standing on the dressing-table still cast the<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7168-029"/> shadow of an old crone's head in the corner
                    beyond the clothes-horse. Strange that even a shadow should last longer than a
                    man! She looked about among the old familiar objects; all was there, but the old
                    self was gone.</p>
                <p>âWhat are you noticing?â asked Em.</p>
                <p>âNothing and everything. I thought the windows were higher. If I were you, when I
                    get this place I should raise the walls. There is not room to breathe here; one
                    suffocates.â</p>
                <p>âGregory is going to make many alterations,â said Em; and drawing nearer to the
                    grey dressing-gown respectfully. âDo you like him, Lyndall? Is he not
                    handsome?â</p>
                <p>âHe must have been a fine baby,â said Lyndall, looking at the white dimity
                    curtain that hung above the window.</p>
                <p>Em was puzzled.</p>
                <p>âThere are some men,â said Lyndall, âwhom you never can believe were babies at
                    all; and<pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7168-030"/> others you never see without thinking
                    how very nice they must have looked when they wore socks and pink sashes.â</p>
                <p>Em remained silent; then she said with a little dignity,</p>
                <p>âWhen you know him you will love him as I do. When I compare other people with
                    him, they seem so weak and little. <emph>Our</emph> hearts are so cold, our
                    loves are mixed up with so many other things. But heâno one is worthy of his
                    love. I am not. It is so great and pure.â</p>
                <p>âYou need not make yourself unhappy upon that pointâyour poor return for his
                    love, my dear,â said Lyndall. âA man's love is a fire of olive-wood. It leaps
                    higher every moment; it roars, it blazes, it shoots out red flames; it threatens
                    to wrap you round and devour youâyou who stand by like an icicle in the glow of
                    its fierce warmth. You are self-reproached at your own chilliness and want of
                        reciprocity.<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7168-031"/> The next day, when you go to
                    warm your hands a little, you find a few ashes! 'Tis a long love and cool
                    against a short love and hot; men, at all events, have nothing to complain
                    of.â</p>
                <p>âYou speak so because you do not know men,â said Em, instantly assuming the
                    dignity of superior knowledge so universally affected by affianced and married
                    women in discussing man's nature with their uncontracted sisters.</p>
                <p>âYou will know them too some day, and then you will think differently,â said Em,
                    with the condescending magnanimity which superior knowledge can always afford to
                    show to ignorance.</p>
                <p>Lyndall's little lip quivered in a manner indicative of intense amusement. She
                    twirled a massive ring upon her forefingerâa ring more suitable for the hand of
                    a man, and noticeable in designâa diamond cross let into gold, with the initials
                    âR.R.â below it.</p>
                <pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7168-032"/>
                <p>âAh, Lyndall,â Em cried, âperhaps you are engaged yourselfâthat is why you smile.
                    Yes; I am sure you are. Look at this ring!â</p>
                <p>Lyndall drew the hand quickly from her.</p>
                <p>âI am not in so great a hurry to put my neck beneath any man's foot; and I do not
                    so greatly admire the crying of babies,â she said, as she closed her eyes half
                    wearily and leaned back in the chair. âThere are other women glad of such
                    work.â</p>
                <p>Em felt rebuked and ashamed. How could she take Lyndall and show her the white
                    linen and the wreath, and the embroidery? She was quiet for a little while, and
                    then began to talk about Trana, and the old farm-servants, till she saw her
                    companion was weary; then she rose and left her for the night. But after Em was
                    gone Lyndall sat on, watching the old crone's face in the corner, and with a
                    weary look, as<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7168-033"/> though the whole world's weight
                    rested on these frail young shoulders.</p>
                <p>The next morning, Waldo, starting off before breakfast with a bag of mealies
                    slung over his shoulder to feed the ostriches, heard a light step behind
                    him.</p>
                <p>âWait for me; I am coming with you,â said Lyndall, adding as she came up to him,
                    âIf I had not gone to look for you yesterday you would not have come to greet me
                    till now. Do you not like me any longer, Waldo?â</p>
                <p>âYesâbutâyou are changed.â</p>
                <p>It was the old clumsy, hesitating mode of speech.</p>
                <p>âYou like the pinafores better?â she said quickly. She wore a dress of a simple
                    cotton fabric, but very fashionably made, and on her head was a broad white hat.
                    To Waldo she seemed superbly attired. She saw it. âMy dress has changed a
                    little,â she said, âand I also;<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7168-034"/> but not to you.
                    Hang the bag over your other shoulder, that I may see your face. You say so
                    little that if one does not look at you you are an uncomprehended cipher.â Waldo
                    changed the bag, and they walked on side by side. âYou have improved,â she said.
                    âDo you know that I have sometimes wished to see you while I was away; not
                    often, but still sometimes.â</p>
                <p>They were at the gate of the first camp now. Waldo threw over a mug of mealies,
                    and they walked on over the dewy ground.</p>
                <p>âHave you learnt much?â he asked her simply, remembering how she had once said,
                    âWhen I come back again I shall know everything that a human being can.â</p>
                <p>She laughed.</p>
                <p>âAre you thinking of my old boast? Yes; I have learnt something, though hardly
                    what I expected, and not <emph>quite</emph> so much. In the first place, I have
                    learnt that one of my ancestors<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7168-035"/> must have been
                    a very great fool; for they say nothing comes out in a man but one of his
                    forefathers possessed it before him. In the second place, I have discovered that
                    of all cursed places under the sun, where the hungriest soul can hardly pick up
                    a few grains of knowledge, a girls' boarding-school is the worst. They are
                    called finishing schools, and the name tells accurately what they are. They
                    finish everything but imbecility and weakness, and that they cultivate. They are
                    nicely adapted machines for experimenting on the question, âInto how little
                    space a human soul can be crushed?â I have seen some souls so compressed that
                    they would have fitted into a small thimble, and found room to move there, wide
                    room. A woman who has been for many years in one of those places carries the
                    mark of the beast on her till she dies, though she may expand a little
                    afterward, when she breathes in the free world.â</p>
                <pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7168-036"/>
                <p>âWere you miserable?â he asked, looking at her with quick anxiety.</p>
                <p>âI?âno. I am never miserable and never happy. I wish I were. But I should have
                    run away from the place on the fourth day, and hired myself to the first
                    Boer-woman whose farm I came to, to make fire under her soap-pot, if I had to
                    live as the rest of the drove did. Can you form an idea, Waldo, of what it must
                    be to be shut up with cackling old women, who are without knowledge of life,
                    without love of the beautiful, without strength, to have your soul cultured by
                    them? It is suffocation only to breathe the air they breathe; but I made them
                    give me room. I told them I should leave, and they knew I came there on my own
                    account; so they gave me a bed-room without the companionship of one of those
                    things that were having their brains slowly diluted and squeezed out of them. I
                    did not learn music, because I had no<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7168-037"/> talent;
                    and when the drove made cushions, and hideous flowers that the roses laugh at,
                    and a footstool in six weeks that a machine would have made better in five
                    minutes, I went to my room. With the money saved from such work I bought books
                    and newspapers, and at night I sat up. I read, and epitomized what I read; and I
                    found time to write some plays, and find out how hard it is to make your
                    thoughts look anything but imbecile fools when you paint them with ink and
                    paper. In the holidays I learnt a great deal more. I made acquaintances, saw a
                    few places and many people, and some different ways of living, which is more
                    than any books can show one. On the whole, I am not dissatisfied with my four
                    years. I have not learnt what I expected; but I have learnt something else. What
                    have you been doing?â</p>
                <p>âNothing.â</p>
                <pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7168-038"/>
                <p>âThat is not possible. I shall find out by and by.â</p>
                <p>They still stepped on side by side over the dewy bushes. Then suddenly she turned
                    on him.</p>
                <p>âDon't you wish you were a woman, Waldo?â</p>
                <p>âNo,â he answered readily.</p>
                <p>She laughed.</p>
                <p>âI thought not. Even you are too worldly wise for that. I never met a man who
                    did. This is a pretty ring,â she said, holding out her little hand, that the
                    morning sun might make the diamonds sparkle. âWorth fifty pounds at least. I
                    will give it to the first man who tells me he would like to be a woman. There
                    might be one on Robbin Island<ref target="#schreiner-2afrnote01">*</ref> who
                    would win it perhaps, but I doubt it even there. It is delightful to be a woman;
                    but every man thanks the Lord devoutly that he isn't one.â</p>
                <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="schreiner-2afrnote01">Lunatics at the
                    Cape are sent to Robbin Island.</note>
                <pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7168-039"/>
                <p>She drew her hat to one side to keep the sun out of her eyes as she walked. Waldo
                    looked at her so intently that he stumbled over the bushes. Yes, this was his
                    little Lyndall who had worn the check pinafores; he saw it now, and he walked
                    closer beside her. They reached the next camp.</p>
                <p>âLet us wait at this camp and watch the birds,â she said, as an ostrich hen came
                    bounding toward them with velvety wings outstretched, while far away over the
                    bushes the head of the cock was visible as he sat brooding on the eggs.</p>
                <p>Lyndall folded her arms on the gate-bar, and Waldo threw his empty bag on the
                    wall and leaned beside her.</p>
                <p>âI like these birds,â she said; âthey share each other's work, and are
                    companions. Do you take an interest in the position of women, Waldo?â</p>
                <p>âNo.â</p>
                <pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7168-040"/>
                <p>âI thought not. No one does, unless they are in need of a subject upon which to
                    show their wit. And as for you, from of old you can see nothing that is not
                    separated from you by a few millions of miles, and strewed over with mystery. If
                    women were the inhabitants of Jupiter, of whom you had happened to hear
                    something, you would pore over us and our condition night and day; but because
                    we are before your eyes you never look at us. You care nothing that
                        <emph>this</emph> is ragged and ugly,â she said, putting her little finger
                    on his sleeve; âbut you strive mightily to make an imaginary leaf on an old
                    stick beautiful. I'm sorry you don't care for the position of women; I should
                    have liked us to be friends; and it is the only thing about which I think much
                    or feel muchâif, indeed, I have any feeling about anything,â she added,
                    flippantly, readjusting her dainty little arms. âWhen I was a baby, I fancy my
                    parents left me out in the<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7168-041"/> frost one night, and
                    I got nipped internallyâit feels so!â</p>
                <p>âShow me what you feel,â he said. âI have only a few old thoughts, and I think
                    them over and over again; always beginning where I left off. I never get any
                    further. I am weary of them. I am like an old hen that sits on eggs month after
                    month and they never come out.â</p>
                <p>âAnd I,â she said quickly, âam so pressed in upon by new things that, lest they
                    should trip one another up, I have to keep forcing them back. My head swings
                    sometimes. But this one thought stands, never goesâif I might but be one of
                    these born in the future; then perhaps to be born a woman will not be to be born
                    branded.â</p>
                <p>Waldo looked at her. It was hard to say whether she were in earnest or
                    mocking.</p>
                <p>âI know it is foolish. Wisdom never kicks at the iron walls it can't bring down,â
                    she said.</p>
                <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7168-042"/>
                <p>âBut we are cursed. Waldo, born cursed from the time our mothers bring us into
                    the world till the shrouds are put on us. Do not look at me as though I were
                    talking nonsense. Everything has two sidesâthe outside that is ridiculous, and
                    the inside that is solemn.â</p>
                <p>âI am not laughing,â said the boy solemnly enough; âbut what curses you?â</p>
                <p>He thought she would not reply to him, she waited so long.</p>
                <p>âIt is not what is done to us, but what is made of us,â she said at last, âthat
                    wrongs us. No man can be really injured but by what modifies himself. We all
                    enter the world little plastic beings, with so much natural force perhaps, but
                    for the restâblank; and the world tells us what we are to be, and shapes us by
                    the ends it sets before us. To you it saysââ<emph>Work</emph>;â and to us it
                        saysââ<emph>Seem!</emph>â To you it saysâAs you approximate to man's highest
                    ideal of God, as your arm<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7168-043"/> is strong and your
                    knowledge great, and the power to labour is with you, so you shall gain all that
                    human heart desires. To us it saysâStrength shall not help you, nor knowledge,
                    nor labour. You shall gain what men gain, but by other means. And so the world
                    makes men and women.</p>
                <p>âLook at this little chin of mine, Waldo, with the dimple in it. It is but a
                    small part of my person; but though I had a knowledge of all things under the
                    sun, and the wisdom to use it, and the deep loving heart of an angel, it would
                    not stead me through life like this little chin. I can win money with it, I can
                    win love; I can win power with it, I can win fame. What would knowledge help me?
                    The less a woman has in her head the lighter she is for climbing. I once heard
                    an old man say, that he never saw intellect help a woman so much as a pretty
                    ankle; and it was the truth. They begin to<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7168-044"/>
                    shape us to our cursed end,â she said, with her lips drawn in to look as though
                    they smiled, âwhen we are tiny things in shoes and socks. We sit with our little
                    feet drawn up under us in the window, and look out at the boys in their happy
                    play. We want to go. Then a loving hand is laid on us: âLittle one, you cannot
                    go,â they say; âyour little face will burn, and your nice white dress be
                    spoiled.â We feel it must be for our good, it is so lovingly said: but we cannot
                    understand; and we kneel still with one little cheek wistfully pressed against
                    the pane. Afterwards we go and thread blue beads, and make a string for our
                    neck; and we go and stand before the glass. We see the complexion we were not to
                    spoil, and the white frock, and we look into our own great eyes. Then the curse
                    begins to act on us. It finishes its work when we are grown women, who no more
                    look out wistfully at a more healthy life; we are<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7168-045"/> contented. We fit our sphere as a Chinese-woman's foot fits her shoe exactly,
                    as though God had made bothâand yet He knows nothing of either. In some of us
                    the shaping of our end has been quite completed. The parts we are not to use
                    have been quite atrophied, and have even dropped off; but in others, and we are
                    not less to be pitied, they have been weakened and left. We wear the bandages,
                    but our limbs have not grown to them; we know that we are compressed, and chafe
                    against them.</p>
                <p>âBut what does it help? A little bitterness, a little longing when we are young,
                    a little futile searching for work, a little passionate striving for room for
                    the exercise of our powers,âand then we go with the drove. A woman must march
                    with her regiment. In the end she must be trodden down or go with it; and if she
                    is wise she goes.</p>
                <p>âI see in your great eyes what you are<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7168-046"/>
                    thinking,â she said, glancing at him; âI always know what the person I am
                    talking to is thinking of. How is this woman who makes such a fuss worse off
                    than I? I will show you by a very little example. We stand here at this gate
                    this morning, both poor, both young, both friendless; there is not much to
                    choose between us. Let us turn away just as we are, to make our way in life.
                    This evening you will come to a farmer's house. The farmer, albeit you come
                    alone on foot, will give you a pipe of tobacco and a cup of coffee and a bed. If
                    he has no dam to build and no child to teach, to-morrow you can go on your way
                    with a friendly greeting of the hand. I, if I come to the same place to-night,
                    will have strange questions asked me, strange glances cast on me. The Boer-wife
                    will shake her head and give me food to eat with the Kaffirs, and a right to
                    sleep with the dogs. That would be the first step in our<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7168-047"/> progressâa very little one, but every step to the end
                    would repeat it. We were equals once when we lay new-born babes on our nurses'
                    knees. We will be equals again when they tie up our jaws for the last
                    sleep.â</p>
                <p>Waldo looked in wonder at the little quivering face; it was a glimpse into a
                    world of passion and feeling wholly new to him.</p>
                <p>âMark you,â she said, âwe have always this advantage over youâwe can at any time
                    step into ease and competence, where you must labour patiently for it. A little
                    weeping, a little wheedling, a little self-degradation, a little careful use of
                    our advantages, and then some man will sayââCome, be my wife!â With good looks
                    and youth marriage is easy to attain. There are men enough; but a woman who has
                    sold herself, even for a ring and a new name, need hold her skirt aside for no
                    creature in the street. They both earn their bread in one way.<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7168-048"/> Marriage for love is the beautifulest external symbol
                    of the union of souls; marriage without it is the uncleanliest traffic that
                    defiles the world.â She ran her little finger savagely along the topmost bar,
                    shaking off the dozen little dewdrops that still hung there. âAnd they tell us
                    we have men's chivalrous attention!â she cried. âWhen we ask to be doctors,
                    lawyers, law-makers, anything but ill-paid drudges, they say,âNo; but you have
                    men's chivalrous attention; now think of that and be satisfied! What would you
                    do without it?â</p>
                <p>The bitter little silvery laugh, so seldom heard, rang out across the bushes. She
                    bit her little teeth together.</p>
                <p>âI was coming up in Cobb and Co.'s the other day. At a little wayside hotel we
                    had to change the large coach for a small one. We were ten passengers, eight men
                    and two women. As I sat in the house the gentlemen came and<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7168-049"/> whispered to me, âThere is not room for all in the
                    new coach, take your seat quickly.â We hurried out, and they gave me the best
                    seat, and covered me with rugs, because it was drizzling. Then the last
                    passenger came running up to the coachâan old woman with a wonderful bonnet, and
                    a black shawl pinned with a yellow pin.</p>
                <p>ââThere is no room,â they said; âyou must wait till next week's coach takes you
                    up;â but she climbed on to the step, and held on at the window with both
                    hands.</p>
                <p>ââMy son-in-law is ill, and I must go and see him,â she said.</p>
                <p>ââMy good woman,â said one, âI am really exceedingly sorry that your son-in-law
                    is ill; but there is absolutely no room for you here.â</p>
                <p>ââYou had better get down,â said another, âor the wheel will catch you.â</p>
                <p>âI got up to give her my place.</p>
                <p>ââOh, no, no!â they cried, âwe will not allow that.â</p>
                <pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7168-050"/>
                <p>ââI will rather kneel,â said one, and he crouched down at my feet; so the woman
                    came in.</p>
                <p>âThere were nine of us in that coach, and only one showed chivalrous
                    attentionâand that was a woman to a woman.</p>
                <p>âI shall be old and ugly, too, one day, and I shall look for men's chivalrous
                    help, but I shall not find it.</p>
                <p>âThe bees are very attentive to the flowers till their honey is done, and then
                    they fly over them. I don't know if the flowers feel grateful to the bees; they
                    are great fools if they do.â</p>
                <p>âBut some women,â said Waldo, speaking as though the words forced themselves from
                    him at that moment, âsome women have power.â</p>
                <p>She lifted her beautiful eyes to his face.</p>
                <p>âPower! Did you ever hear of men being asked whether other souls should have
                    power or not? It is born in them. You may dam up<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7168-051"/> the fountain of water, and make it a stagnant marsh, or you may let it run
                    free and do its work; but <emph>you</emph> cannot say whether it shall be there;
                        <emph>it is there</emph>. And it will act, if not openly for good, then
                    covertly for evil; but it will act. If Goethe had been stolen away a child, and
                    reared in a robber horde in the depths of a German forest, do you think the
                    world would have had âFaustâ and âIphegenie?â But he would have been Goethe
                    stillâstronger, wiser than his fellows. At night, round their watch-fire, he
                    would have chanted wild songs of rapine and murder, till the dark faces about
                    him were moved and trembled. His songs would have echoed on from father to son,
                    and nerved the heart and armâfor evil. Do you think if Napoleon had been born a
                    woman that he would have been contented to give small tea-parties and talk small
                    scandal? He would have risen; but the world would not have heard of him as<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7168-052"/> it hears of him nowâa man great and kingly,
                    with all his sins; he would have left one of those names that stain the leaf of
                    every historyâthe names of women, who, having power, but being denied the right
                    to exercise it openly, rule in the dark, covertly, and by stealth, through the
                    men whose passions they feed on and by whom they climb.</p>
                <p>âPower!â she said, suddenly, smiting her little hand upon the rail. âYes, we have
                    power; and since we are not to expend it in tunnelling mountains, nor healing
                    diseases, nor making laws, nor money, nor on any extraneous object, we expend it
                    on <emph>you</emph>. You are our goods, our merchandise, our material for
                    operating on; we buy you, we sell you, we make fools of you, we act the wily old
                    Jew with you, we keep six of you crawling to our little feet, and praying only
                    for a touch of our little hand; and they say truly, there was never an ache or
                    pain or<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7168-053"/> broken heart but a woman was at the
                    bottom of it. We are not to study law, nor science, nor art, so we study you.
                    There is never a nerve or fibre in a man's nature but we know it. We keep six of
                    you dancing in the palm of one little hand,â she said, balancing her
                    outstretched arm gracefully, as though tiny beings disported themselves in its
                    palm. âThereâwe throw you away, and you sink to the devil,â she said, folding
                    her arms composedly. âThere was never a man who said one word for woman but he
                    said two for man, and three for the whole human race.â</p>
                <p>She watched the bird pecking up the last yellow grains; but Waldo looked only at
                    her.</p>
                <p>When she spoke again it was very measuredly.</p>
                <p>âThey bring weighty arguments against us when we ask for the perfect freedom of
                    women,â she said; âbut, when you come up to the objections, they are like
                    pumpkin-devils, with<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7168-054"/> candles inside, hollow,
                    and can't bite. They say that women do not wish for the sphere and freedom we
                    ask for them, and would not use it!</p>
                <p>âIf the bird <emph>does</emph> like its cage, and <emph>does</emph> like its
                    sugar and will not leave it, why keep the door so very carefully shut? Why not
                    open it, only a little? Do they know, there is many a bird will not break its
                    wings against the bars, but would fly if the doors were open.</p>
                <p>âThen they say again, âIf women have the liberty you ask for, they will be found
                    in positions for which they have not talent!â If two men climb one ladder, did
                    you ever see the weakest anywhere but at the foot? The surest sign of fitness is
                    success. The weakest never wins but where there is handicapping. Nature, left to
                    herself, will as beautifully apportion a man's work to his capacities as long
                    ages ago she graduated the colours on the bird's breast. If we are not fit you
                    give us to no purpose the<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7168-055"/> right to labour; the
                    work will fall out of our hands into those that are abler.â</p>
                <p>She talked more quickly and eagerly as she went on, as one talks of that over
                    which they have brooded long, and which lies near their hearts.</p>
                <p>Waldo watched her intently.</p>
                <p>âThey say women have one great and noble work left them, and they do it ill.âThat
                    is true; they do it execrably. It is the work that demands the broadest culture,
                    and they have not even the narrowest. The lawyer may see no deeper than his law
                    books, and the chemist see no further than the windows of his laboratory, and
                    they may do their work well. But the woman who does woman's work needs a
                    many-sided, multiform culture; the heights and depths of human life must strike
                    an answering chord in her; she must have knowledge of men and things in many
                    states, a wide catholicity<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7168-056"/> of sympathy, the
                    strength that springs from knowledge, and the magnanimity which springs from
                    strength. <emph>We</emph> bear the world, and <emph>we</emph> make it. The souls
                    of little children are marvellously delicate and tender things, and keep for
                    ever the shadow that first falls on them, and that is the mother's or at best a
                    woman's. There was never a great man who had not a great motherâit is hardly an
                    exaggeration. The first six years of our life make us; all that is added later
                    is veneer; and yet some say, if a woman can cook a dinner or dress herself she
                    has culture enough.</p>
                <p>âThe mightiest and noblest of human work is given to us, and we do it ill. Send
                    an untutored navvie to work into an artist's studio, and see what you will find
                    there! And yet, thank God, we have this work,â she added quickly: âit is the one
                    window through which we see into the great world of earnest labour. The meanest
                    girl who<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7168-057"/> dances and dresses becomes something
                    higher when her children look up into her face and ask her questions. It is the
                    only education we have and which they cannot take from us.â</p>
                <p>âAnd they say,â she went on, âthat we complain of woman's being compelled to look
                    upon marriage as a profession; but that she is free to enter upon it or leave
                    it, as she pleases.</p>
                <p>âYesâand a cat set afloat in a pond is free to sit in the tub till it dies, it is
                    under no obligation to wet its feet; and a drowning man may catch at a straw or
                    not, just as he likesâit is a glorious liberty! Let any man think for five
                    minutes of what old maidenhood means to a womanâand then let him be silent. Is
                    it easy to bear through life a name that in itself signifies defeat? to dwell,
                    as nine out of ten unmarried women must, under the finger of another woman? Is
                    it easy to look forward to an old age without honour, without the reward<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7168-058"/> of useful labour, without love? I wonder how
                    many men there are who would give up everything that is dear in life for the
                    sake of maintaining a high purity.â</p>
                <p>She laughed, a little laugh that was clear without being pleasant. âAnd then,
                    when they have no other argument against us, they sayââGo on; but when you have
                    made women what you wish, and her children inherit her culture, you will defeat
                    yourself. Man will gradually become extinct from excess of intellect, the
                    passions which replenish the race will die.â Fools!â she said, curling her
                    pretty lip; âa Hottentot sits at the road-side, and feeds on a rotten bone he
                    has found there, and takes out his bottle of Cape-smoke and swills at it, and
                    grunts with satisfaction; and the cultured child of the nineteenth century sits
                    in his arm-chair, and sips choice wines with the lip of a connoisseur, and
                    tastes delicate dishes with a<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7168-059"/> delicate palate,
                    and with a satisfaction of which the Hottentot knows nothing. Heavy jaw and
                    sloping foreheadâall have gone with increasing intellect; but the animal
                    appetites are there stillârefined, discriminative, but immeasurably intensified.
                    Fools! Before men forgave or worshipped, while they were weak on their hind
                    legs, did they not eat and drink and fight for wives? When all the latter
                    additions to humanity have vanished, will not the foundation on which they are
                    built remain?â</p>
                <p>She was silent then for a while, and said somewhat dreamily, more as though
                    speaking to herself than to him,â</p>
                <p>âThey ask, What will you gain, even if man does not become extinct?âyou will have
                    brought justice and equality on to the earth, and sent love from it. When men
                    and women are equals they will love no more. Your highly-cultured women will not
                    be lovable, will not love.</p>
                <pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7168-060"/>
                <p>âDo they see nothing, understand nothing? It is Tant' Sannie who buries husbands
                    one after another, and folds her hands resignedly,ââThe Lord gave, and the Lord
                    hath taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord,ââ and she looks for
                    another. It is the hard-headed, deep thinker who, when the wife who has thought
                    and worked with him goes, can find no rest, and lingers near her till he finds
                    sleep beside her.</p>
                <p>âA great soul draws and is drawn with a more fierce intensity than any small one.
                    By every inch we grow in intellectual height our love strikes down its roots
                    deeper, and spreads out its arms wider. It is for love's sake yet more than for
                    any other that we look for that new time.â She had leaned her head against the
                    stones, and watched with her sad, soft eyes the retreating bird. âThen when that
                    time comes,â she said lowly, âwhen love is no more bought or sold, when it is
                    not a means of making bread,<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7168-061"/> when each woman's
                    life is filled with earnest, independent labour, then love will come to her, a
                    strange, sudden sweetness breaking in upon her earnest work; not sought for, but
                    found. Then, but not nowââ</p>
                <p>Waldo waited for her to finish the sentence, but she seemed to have forgotten
                    him.</p>
                <p>âLyndall,â he said, putting his hand upon herâshe startedââif you think that that
                    new time will be so great, so good, you who speak so easilyââ</p>
                <p>She interrupted him.</p>
                <p>âSpeak! speak!â she said, âthe difficulty is not to speak; the difficulty is to
                    keep silence.â</p>
                <p>âBut why do you not try to bring that time?â he said with pitiful simplicity.
                    âWhen you speak I believe all you say; other people would listen to you
                    also.â</p>
                <p>âI am not so sure of that,â she said with a smile.</p>
                <pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7168-062"/>
                <p>Then over the small face came the weary look it had worn last night as it watched
                    the shadow in the corner, Ah, so weary!</p>
                <p>âI, Waldo, I?â she said. âI will do nothing good for myself, nothing for the
                    world, till some one wakes me. I am asleep, swathed, shut up in self; till I
                    have been delivered I will deliver no one.â</p>
                <p>He looked at her wondering, but she was not looking at him.</p>
                <p>âTo see the good and the beautiful,â she said, âand to have no strength to live
                    it, is only to be Moses on the mountain of Nebo, with the land at your feet and
                    no power to enter. It would be better not to see it. Come,â she said, looking up
                    into his face, and seeing its uncomprehending expression, âlet us go, it is
                    getting late. Doss is anxious for his breakfast also,â she added, wheeling round
                    and calling to the dog, who was endeavouring to unearth a mole, an<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7168-063"/> occupation to which he had been zealously addicted
                    from the third month, but in which he had never on any single occasion proved
                    successful.</p>
                <p>Waldo shouldered his bag, and Lyndall walked on before in silence, with the dog
                    close to her side. Perhaps she thought of the narrowness of the limits within
                    which a human soul may speak and be understood by its nearest of mental kin, of
                    how soon it reaches that solitary land of the individual experience, in which no
                    fellow footfall is ever heard. Whatever her thoughts may have been, she was soon
                    interrupted. Waldo came close to her, and standing still, produced with
                    awkwardness from his breast-pocket a small carved box.</p>
                <p>âI made it for you,â he said, holding it out.</p>
                <p>âI like it,â she said, examining it carefully.</p>
                <p>The workmanship was better than that of the grave-post. The flowers that covered
                    it were delicate, and here and there small conical <choice>

                    </choice><pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7168-064"/> tuberances were let in among them.
                    She turned it round critically. Waldo bent over it lovingly.</p>
                <p>âThere is one strange thing about it,â he said earnestly, putting a finger on one
                    little pyramid. âI made it without these, and I felt something was wrong; I
                    tried many changes, and at last I let these in, and then it was right. But why
                    was it? They are not beautiful in themselves.â</p>
                <p>âThey relieve the monotony of the smooth leaves, I suppose.â</p>
                <p>He shook his head as over a weighty matter.</p>
                <p>âThe sky is monotonous,â he said, âwhen it is blue, and yet it is beautiful. I
                    have thought of that often; but it is not monotony and it is not variety makes
                    beauty. What is it? The sky, and your face, and this boxâthe same thing is in
                    them all, only more in the sky and in your face. But what is it?â</p>
                <p>She smiled.</p>
                <p>âSo you are at your old work still. Why,<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7168-065"/> why,
                    why? What is the reason? It is enough for me,â she said, âif I find out what is
                    beautiful and what is ugly, what is real and what is not. Why it is there, and
                    over the final cause of things in general, I don't trouble myself; there must be
                    one, but what is it to me? If I howl to all eternity I shall never get hold of
                    it; and if I did I might be no better off. But you Germans are born with an
                    aptitude for burrowing; you can't help yourselves. You must sniff after reasons,
                    just as that dog must after moles. He knows perfectly well he will never catch
                    it, but he's under the imperative necessity of digging for it.â</p>
                <p>âBut he <emph>might</emph> find it.â</p>
                <p>â<emph>Might!</emph>âbut he never has and never will. Life is too short to run
                    after mights; we must have certainties.â</p>
                <p>She tucked the box under her arm and was about to walk on, when Gregory Rose,
                        with<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7168-066"/> shining spurs, an ostrich feather in
                    his hat, and a silver-headed whip, careered past. He bowed gallantly as he went
                    by. They waited till the dust of the horse's hoofs had laid itself.</p>
                <p>âThere,â said Lyndall, âgoes a true womanâone born for the sphere that some women
                    have to fill without being born for it. How happy he would be sewing frills into
                    his little girl's frocks, and how pretty he would look sitting in a parlour,
                    with a rough man making love to him! Don't you think so?â</p>
                <p>âI shall not stay here when he is master,â Waldo answered, not able to connect
                    any kind of beauty with Gregory Rose.</p>
                <p>âI should imagine not. The rule of a woman is tyranny; but the rule of a
                    man-woman grinds fine. Where are you going?â</p>
                <p>âAnywhere.â</p>
                <p>âWhat to do?â</p>
                <p>âSeeâsee everything.â</p>
                <pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7168-067"/>
                <p>âYou will be disappointed.â</p>
                <p>âAnd were you?â</p>
                <p>âYes; and you will be more so. I want some things that men and the world give,
                    you do not. If you have a few yards of earth to stand on, and a bit of blue over
                    you, and something that you cannot see to dream about, you have all that you
                    need, all that you know how to use. But I like to see real men. Let them be as
                    disagreeable as they please, they are more interesting to me than flowers, or
                    trees, or stars, or any other thing under the sun. Sometimes,â she added,
                    walking on, and shaking the dust daintily from her skirts, âwhen I am not too
                    busy trying to find a new way of doing my hair that will show my little neck to
                    better advantage, or over other work of that kind, sometimes it amuses me
                    intensely to trace out the resemblance between one man and another: to see how
                    Tant' Sannie and I, you and Bonaparte, St. Simon on his<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7168-068"/> pillow, and the Emperor dining off larks' tongues,
                    are one and the same compound, merely mixed in different proportions. What is
                    microscopic in one is largely developed in another; what is a rudimentary fold
                    in me is a great active organ in you; but all things are in all men, and one
                    soul is the model of all. We shall find nothing new in human nature after we
                    have once carefully dissected and analyzed the one being we ever shall truly
                    knowâourself. The Kaffir girl threw some coffee on my arm in bed this morning; I
                    felt displeased, but said nothing. Tant' Sannie would have thrown the saucer at
                    her and sworn for an hour; but the feeling would be the same irritated
                    displeasure. If a huge animated stomach like Bonaparte were put under a glass by
                    a skilful mental microscopist, even he would be found to have an embryonic
                    doubling somewhere indicative of a heart, and rudimentary buddings that might
                    have become conscience<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7168-069"/> and sincerity:âLet me
                    take your arm Waldo. How full you are of mealie dust.âNo, never mind. It will
                    brush off.âAnd sometimes what is more amusing still than tracing the likeness
                    between man and man, is to trace the analogy there always is between the
                    progress and development of one individual and of a whole nation; or, again,
                    between a single nation and the entire human race. It is pleasant when it dawns
                    on you that the one is just the other written out in large letters; and very odd
                    to find all the little follies and virtues, and developments and retrogressions,
                    written out in the big world's book that you find in your little internal self.
                    It is the most amusing thing I know of; but of course, being a woman, I have not
                    often time for such amusements. Professional duties always first, you know. It
                    takes a great deal of time and thought always to look perfectly exquisite even
                    for a pretty<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7168-070"/> woman. Is the old buggy still in
                    existence, Waldo?â</p>
                <p>âYes; but the harness is broken.â</p>
                <p>âWell, I wish you would mend it. You must teach me to drive. I must learn
                    something while I am here. I got the Hottentot girl to show me how to make
                    âsar-sar-tiesâ this morning; and Tant' Sannie is going to teach me to make
                    âkapjes.â I will come and sit with you this afternoon while you mend the
                    harness.â</p>
                <p>âThank you.â</p>
                <p>âNo, don't thank me; I come for my own pleasure. I never find any one I can talk
                    to. Women bore me, and men, I talk so toââGoing to the ball this evening? Nice
                    little dog that of yours. Pretty little ears. So fond of pointer pups!â And they
                    think me fascinating, charming! Men are like the earth, and we are the moon; we
                    turn always one side to them, and<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7168-071"/> they think
                    there is no other, because they don't see itâbut there is.â</p>
                <p>They had reached the house now.</p>
                <p>âTell me when you set to work,â she said, and walked toward the door.</p>
                <p>Waldo stood to look after her, and Doss stood at his side, a look of painful
                    uncertainty depicted on his small countenance, and one little foot poised in the
                    air. Should he stay with his master or go? He looked at the figure with the wide
                    straw hat moving toward the house, and he looked up at his master; then he put
                    down the little paw and went. Waldo watched them both in at the door and then
                    walked away alone. He was satisfied that at least his dog was with her.</p>

                <head type="sub">TANT' SANNIE HOLDS AN UPSITTING, AND GREGORY WRITES A
                    LETTER.</head>
                <p><hi rend="b">IT</hi> was just after sunset, and Lyndall had not yet returned from
                    her first driving-lesson, when the lean coloured woman standing at the corner of
                    the house to enjoy the evening breeze, saw coming along the road a strange
                    horseman. Very narrowly she surveyed him, as slowly he approached. He was
                    attired in the deepest mourning, the black crape round his tall hat totally
                    concealing the black felt, and nothing but a dazzling shirt-front relieving the
                    funereal tone of his attire. He rode much forward in his saddle, with his chin
                    resting on the uppermost<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7168-073"/> of his shirt-studs,
                    and there was an air of meek subjection to the will of Heaven, and to what might
                    be in store for him, that bespoke itself even in the way in which he gently
                    urged his steed. He was evidently in no hurry to reach his destination, for the
                    nearer he approached to it the slacker did his bridle hang. The coloured woman
                    having duly inspected him, dashed into the dwelling.</p>
                <p>âHere is another one!â she criedââa widower; I see it by his hat.â</p>
                <p>âGood Lord!â said Tant' Sannie; âit's the seventh I've had this month; but the
                    men know where sheep and good looks and money in the bank are to be found,â she
                    added, winking knowingly. âHow does he look?â</p>
                <p>âNineteen, weak eyes, white hair, little round nose,â said the maid.</p>
                <p>âThen it's he! then it's he!â said Tant' Sannie triumphantly; âlittle Piet Vander
                    Walt, whose<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7168-074"/> wife died last monthâtwo farms,
                    twelve thousand sheep. I've not seen him, but my sister-in-law told me about
                    him, and I dreamed about him last night.â</p>
                <p>Here Piet's black hat appeared in the doorway, and the Boer-woman drew herself up
                    in dignified silence, extended the tips of her fingers, and motioned solemnly to
                    a chair. The young man seated himself, sticking his feet as far under it as they
                    would go, and said mildlyâ</p>
                <p>âI am Little Piet Vander Walt, and my father is Big Piet Vander Walt.â</p>
                <p>Tant' Sannie said solemnly, âYes.â</p>
                <p>âAunt,â said the young man, starting up spasmodically; âcan I off-saddle?â</p>
                <p>âYes.â</p>
                <p>He seized his hat, and disappeared with a rush through the door.</p>
                <p>âI told you so! I knew it!â said Tant' Sannie. âThe dear Lord doesn't send dreams
                    for nothing.<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7168-075"/> Didn't I tell you this morning
                    that I dreamed of a great beast like a sheep, with red eyes, and I killed it?
                    Wasn't the white wool his hair, and the red eyes his weak eyes, and my killing
                    him meant marriage? Get supper ready quickly; the sheep's inside and
                    roaster-cakes. We shall sit up to-night.â</p>
                <p>To young Piet Vander Walt that supper was a period of intense torture. There was
                    something overawing in that assembly of English people, with their
                    incomprehensible speech; and moreover, it was his first courtship; his first
                    wife had courted him, and ten months of severe domestic rule had not raised his
                    spirit nor courage. He ate little, and when he raised a morsel to his lips
                    glanced guiltily round to see if he were not observed. He had put three rings on
                    his little finger, with the intention of sticking it out stiffly when he raised
                    a coffee-cup; now the little finger was curled miserably among its fellows.
                        It<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7168-076"/> was small relief when the meal was over,
                    and Tant' Sannie and he repaired to the front-room. Once seated there, he set
                    his knees close together, stood his black hat upon them, and wretchedly turned
                    the brim up and down. But supper had cheered Tant' Sannie, who found it
                    impossible longer to maintain that decorous silence, and whose heart yearned
                    over the youth.</p>
                <p>âI was related to your aunt Selena who died,â said Tant' Sannie. âMy mother's
                    step-brother's child was married to her father's brother's step-nephew's
                    niece.â</p>
                <p>âYes, aunt,â said the young man, âI knew we were related.â</p>
                <p>âIt was her cousin,â said Tant' Sannie, now fairly on the flow, âwho had the
                    cancer cut out of her breast by the other doctor, who was not the right doctor
                    they sent for, but who did it quite as well.â</p>
                <p>âYes, aunt,â said the young man.</p>
                <pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7168-077"/>
                <p>âI've heard about it often,â said Tant' Sannie. âAnd he was the son of the old
                    doctor that they say died on Christmas day; but I don't know if that's true.
                    People do tell such awful lies. Why should he die on Christmas day more than any
                    other day?â</p>
                <p>âYes, aunt, why?â said the young man meekly.</p>
                <p>âDid you ever have the toothache?â asked Tant' Sannie.</p>
                <p>âNo, aunt.â</p>
                <p>âWell, they say that doctor,ânot the son of the old doctor that died on Christmas
                    day, the other that didn't come when he was sent for,âhe gave such good stuff
                    for the toothache, that if you opened the bottle in the room where any one was
                    bad they got better directly. You could see it was good stuff,â said Tant'
                    Sannie; âit tasted horrid. <emph>That</emph> was a real doctor! He used to give
                    a bottle so high,â said the Boer-woman, raising<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7168-078"/>
                    her hand a foot from the table, âyou could drink at it for a month and it
                    wouldn't get done, and the same medicine was good for all sorts of
                    sicknessesâcroup, measles, jaundice, dropsy. <emph>Now</emph> you have to buy a
                    new kind for each sickness. The doctors aren't so good as they used to be.â</p>
                <p>âNo, aunt,â said the young man, who was trying to gain courage to stick out his
                    legs and clink his spurs together. He did so at last.</p>
                <p>Tant' Sannie had noticed the spurs before; but she thought it showed a nice manly
                    spirit, and her heart warmed yet more to the youth.</p>
                <p>âDid you ever have convulsions when you were a baby?â asked Tant' Sannie.</p>
                <p>âYes,â said the young man.</p>
                <p>âStrange!â said Tant' Sannie; âI had convulsions too. Wonderful that we should be
                    so much alike!â</p>
                <p>âAunt,â said the young man explosively, âcan we sit-up to-night?â</p>
                <pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7168-079"/>
                <p>Tant' Sannie hung her head and half closed her eyes; but finding that her little
                    wiles were thrown away, the young man staring fixedly at his hat, she simpered,
                    âYes,â and went away to fetch candles.</p>
                <p>In the dining room Em worked at her machine, and Gregory sat close beside her,
                    his great blue eyes turned to the window where Lyndall leaned out talking to
                    Waldo.</p>
                <p>Tant' Sannie took two candles out of the cupboard and held them up triumphantly,
                    winking all round the room.</p>
                <p>âHe's asked for them,â she said.</p>
                <p>âDoes he want them for his horse's sore back?â asked Gregory, new to up-country
                    life.</p>
                <p>âNo,â said Tant' Sannie, indignantly; âwe're going to sit-up!â and she walked off
                    in triumph with the candles.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, when all the rest of the house had<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7168-080"/>
                    retired, when the long candle was lighted, when the coffee-kettle was filled,
                    when she sat in her elbow-chair, with her lover on a chair close beside her, and
                    when the vigil of the night was fairly begun, she began to find it wearisome.
                    The young man looked chilly, and said nothing.</p>
                <p>âWon't you put your feet on my stove?â said Tant' Sannie.</p>
                <p>âNo thank you, aunt,â said the young man, and both lapsed into silence.</p>
                <p>At last Tant' Sannie, afraid of going to sleep, tapped a strong cup of coffee for
                    herself and handed another to her lover. This visibly revived both.</p>
                <p>âHow long were you married, cousin?â</p>
                <p>âTen months, aunt.â</p>
                <p>âHow old was your baby?â</p>
                <p>âThree days when it died.â</p>
                <p>âIt's very hard when we must give our husbands and wives to the Lord,â said Tant'
                    Sannie.</p>
                <pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7168-081"/>
                <p>âVery,â said the young man; âbut it's the Lord's will.â</p>
                <p>âYes,â said Tant' Sannie, and sighed.</p>
                <p>âShe was such a good wife, aunt: I've known her break a churn-stick over a maid's
                    head for only letting dust come on a milk cloth.â</p>
                <p>Tant' Sannie felt a twinge of jealousy. She had never broken a churn-stick on a
                    maid's head.</p>
                <p>âI hope your wife made a good end,â she said.</p>
                <p>âOh, beautiful, aunt: she said up a psalm and two hymns and a half before she
                    died.â</p>
                <p>âDid she leave any messages?â asked Tant' Sannie.</p>
                <p>âNo,â said the young man; âbut the night before she died I was lying at the foot
                    of her bed; I felt her foot kick me.</p>
                <p>ââPiet,â she said.</p>
                <p>ââAnnie, my heart,â said I.</p>
                <p>ââMy little baby that died yesterday has been here, and it stood over the
                    waggon-box,â she said.</p>
                <pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7168-082"/>
                <p>ââWhat did it say?â I asked.</p>
                <p>ââIt said that if I died you must marry a fat woman.â</p>
                <p>ââI will,â I said, and I went to sleep again. Presently she woke me.</p>
                <p>ââThe little baby has been here again, and it says you must marry a woman over
                    thirty, and who's had two husbands.â</p>
                <p>âI didn't go to sleep after that for a long time, aunt; but when I did she woke
                    me.</p>
                <p>ââThe baby has been here again,â she said, âand it says you mustn't marry a woman
                    with a mole.â I told her I wouldn't; and the next day she died.â</p>
                <p>âThat was a vision from the Redeemer,â said Tant' Sannie.</p>
                <p>The young man nodded his head mournfully. He thought of a younger sister of his
                    wife's who was not fat, and who <emph>had</emph> a mole, and of whom his wife
                    had always been jealous, and<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7168-083"/> he wished the
                    little baby had liked better staying in heaven to coming and standing over the
                    waggon-chest.</p>
                <p>âI suppose that's why you came to me,â said Tant' Sannie.</p>
                <p>âYes, aunt. And pa said I ought to get married before shearing time. It is bad if
                    there's no one to see after things then; and the maids waste such a lot of
                    fat.â</p>
                <p>âWhen do you want to get married?â</p>
                <p>âNext month, aunt,â said the young man in a tone of hopeless resignation. âMay I
                    kiss you, aunt?â</p>
                <p>âFie! fie!â said Tant' Sannie, and then gave him a resounding kiss. âCome, draw
                    your chair a little closer,â she said, and their elbows now touching, they sat
                    on through the night.</p>
                <p>The next morning at dawn, as Em passed through Tant' Sannie's bed-room, she
                        found<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7168-084"/> the Boer-woman pulling off her boots
                    preparatory to climbing into bed.</p>
                <p>âWhere is Piet Vander Walt?â</p>
                <p>âJust gone,â said Tant' Sannie; âand I am going to marry him this day four weeks.
                    I am dead sleepy,â she added; âthe stupid thing doesn't know how to talk
                    love-talk at all,â and she climbed into the four-poster, clothes and all, and
                    drew the quilt up to her chin.</p>
                <p>On the day preceding Tant' Sannie's wedding, Gregory Rose sat in the blazing sun
                    on the stone wall behind his daub-and-wattle house. It was warm, but he was
                    intently watching a small buggy that was being recklessly driven over the bushes
                    in the direction of the farmhouse. Gregory never stirred till it had vanished;
                    then, finding the stones hot, he slipped down and walked into the house. He
                    kicked the little pail that lay in the doorway, and sent it into<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7168-085"/> one corner; that did him good. Then he sat down on
                    the box, and began cutting letters out of a piece of newspaper. Finding that the
                    snippings littered the floor, he picked them up and began scribbling on his
                    blotting-paper. He tried the effect of different initials before the name Rose:
                    G. Rose, E. Rose, L. Rose, L. Rose, L.L.L.L. Rose. When he had covered the
                    sheet, he looked at it discontentedly a little while, then suddenly began to
                    write a letter.</p>

                                <p>â<hi rend="b">IT</hi> is a long while since I last wrote to you,
                                    but I have had no time. This is the first morning I have been at
                                    home since I don't know when. Em always expects me to go down to
                                    the farm-house in the morning; but I didn't feel as though I
                                    could stand the ride to-day.</p>
                                <p>âI have much news for you.</p>
                                <p>âTant' Sannie, Em's Boer step-mother, is to be married to-morrow.
                                    She is gone to town to-day, and the wedding feast is to be at
                                        her<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7168-086"/> brother's farm. Em and
                                    I are going to ride over on horseback, but her cousin is going
                                    to ride in the buggy with that German. I don't think I've
                                    written to you since she came back from school. I don't think
                                    you would like her at all, Jemima; there's something so proud
                                    about her. She thinks just because she's handsome there's nobody
                                    good enough to talk to her, and just as if there had nobody else
                                    but her been to boarding-school before.</p>
                                <p>âThey are going to have a grand affair to-morrow: all the Boers
                                    about are coming, and they are going to dance all night; but I
                                    don't think I shall dance at all; for, as Em's cousin says,
                                    these Boer dances are low things. I am sure I only danced at the
                                    last to please Em. I don't know why she is so fond of dancing.
                                    Em talked of our being married on the same day as Tant' Sannie;
                                    but I said it would be nicer for her if she waited till the
                                    shearing was over, and I took her down to see you. I suppose she
                                    will have to live with us (Em's cousin, I mean), as she has not
                                    anything in the world but a poor fifty pounds. I don't like her
                                        <emph>at all</emph>, Jemima,<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7168-087"/> and I don't think you would. She's got such queer ways; she's
                                    always driving about in a gig with that low German; and I don't
                                    think it's at all the thing for a woman to be going about with a
                                    man she's not engaged to. Do you? If it was me now, of course,
                                    who am a kind of connection, it would be different. The way she
                                    treats me, considering that I am so soon to be her cousin, is
                                    not at all nice. I took down my album the other day with your
                                    likenesses in it, and I told her she could look at it, and put
                                    it down close to her; but she just said thank you, and never
                                    even touched it, as much as to sayâWhat are your relations to
                                    me?</p>
                                <p>âShe gets the wildest horses in that buggy, and a horrid snappish
                                    little cur belonging to the German sitting in front, and then
                                    she drives out alone. I don't think it's at all proper for a
                                    woman to drive out alone; I wouldn't allow it if she was
                                        <emph>my</emph> sister. The other morning, I don't know how
                                    it happened, I was going in the way from which she was coming,
                                    and that little beastâthey call him Dossâbegan to bark when he
                                    saw meâhe always does, the little wretchâand the<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7168-088"/> horses began to spring, and kicked
                                    the splashboard all to pieces. It was a sight to see Jemima! She
                                    has got the littlest hands I ever sawâI could hold them both in
                                    one of mine, and not know that I'd got anything except that they
                                    were so soft; but she held those horses in as though they were
                                    made of iron. When I wanted to help her she said, âNo, thank
                                    you; I can manage them myself. I've got a pair of bits that
                                    would break their jaws if I used them well,â and she laughed and
                                    drove away. It's so unwomanly.</p>
                                <p>âTell father my hire of the ground will not be out for six
                                    months, and before that Em and I will be married. My pair of
                                    birds is breeding now, but I haven't been down to see them for
                                    three days. I don't seem to care about anything any more. I
                                    don't know what it is; I'm not well. If I go into town on
                                    Saturday I will let the doctor examine me; but perhaps she'll go
                                    in herself. It's a very strange thing, Jemima, but she never
                                    will send her letters to post by me. If I ask her she has none,
                                    and the very next day she goes in and posts them herself. You
                                    mustn't say anything about it, Jemima,<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7168-089"/> but <emph>twice</emph> I've brought
                                    her letters from the post in a gentleman's hand, and I'm sure
                                    they were both from the same person, because I noticed every
                                    little mark, even the dotting of the <hi>i</hi>'s. Of course
                                    it's nothing to <emph>me</emph>; but for Em's sake I can't help
                                    feeling an interest in her, however much I may dislike her
                                    myself; and I hope she's up to nothing. I pity the man who
                                    marries <emph>her</emph>; I wouldn't be him for
                                        <emph>anything</emph>. If I had a wife with pride I'd make
                                    her give it up, sharp. I don't believe in a man who can't make a
                                    woman obey him. Now Em,âI'm very fond of her, as you know,âbut
                                    if I tell her to put on a certain dress, that dress she puts on;
                                    and if I tell her to sit on a certain seat, on that seat she
                                    sits; and if I tell her not to speak to a certain individual,
                                    she does not speak to them. If a man lets a woman do what he
                                    doesn't like <emph>he's a muff</emph>.</p>

                <p>â<emph>I DIDN'T</emph> know before you were so fond of riding hard,â said Gregory
                    to his little betrothed.</p>
                <p>They were cantering slowly on the road to Oom Muller's on the morning of the
                    wedding.</p>
                <p>âDo you call this riding hard?â asked Em in some astonishment.</p>
                <p>âOf course I do! It's enough to break the horses' necks, and knock one up for the
                    whole day besides,â he added testily; then twisted his head to look at the buggy
                    that came on behind. âI thought Waldo was such a mad driver; they are taking it
                    easily enough to-day,â said<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7168-092"/> Gregory. âOne would
                    think the black stallions were lame.â</p>
                <p>âI suppose they want to keep out of our dust,â said Em. âSee, they stand still as
                    soon as we do.â</p>
                <p>Perceiving this to be the case, Gregory rode on.</p>
                <p>âIt's all that horse of yours: she kicks up such a confounded dust, I can't stand
                    it myself,â he said.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the cart came on slowly enough.</p>
                <p>âTake the reins,â said Lyndall, âand make them walk. I want to rest and watch
                    their hoofs to-dayânot to be exhilarated; I am so tired.â</p>
                <p>She leaned back in her corner, and Waldo drove on slowly in the grey dawn light
                    along the level road. They passed the very milk-bush behind which so many years
                    before the old German had found the Kaffir woman. But<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7168-093"/> their thoughts were not with him that morning: they
                    were the thoughts of the young, that run out to meet the future, and labour in
                    the present. At last he touched her arm.</p>
                <p>âWhat is it?â</p>
                <p>âI feared you had gone to sleep and might be jolted out,â he said; âyou sat so
                    quietly.â</p>
                <p>âNo; do not talk to me; I am not asleep;â but after a time she said suddenly: âI
                    hope I shall never bring a human being into the world.â</p>
                <p>Waldo looked round; she sat drawn into the corner, her blue cloud wound tightly
                    about her, and she still watched the horses' feet. Having no comment to offer on
                    her somewhat unexpected remark, he merely touched up his horses.</p>
                <p>âI have no conscience, none,â she added; âbut I would not like to bring a soul
                    into this world. When it sinned and when it suffered something like a dead hand
                    would fall on meââYou did it, you, for your own pleasure you<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7168-094"/> created this thing! See your work!â If it lived to be
                    eighty it would always hang like a mill-stone round my neck, have the right to
                    demand good from me, and curse me for its sorrow. A parent is only like to
                    Godâif his work turns out bad, so much the worse for him; he <emph>dare</emph>
                    not wash his hands of it. Time and years can never bring the day when you can
                    say to your child: âSoul, what have I to do with you?ââ</p>
                <p>Waldo said dreamingly,â</p>
                <p>âIt is a marvellous thing that one soul should have power to cause another.â</p>
                <p>She heard the words as she heard the beating of the horses' hoofs; her thoughts
                    ran on in their own line.</p>
                <p>âThey say, âGod sends the little babies.â Of all the dastardly revolting lies men
                    tell to suit themselves, I hate that most. I suppose my father said so when he
                    knew he was dying of<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7168-095"/> consumption, and my mother
                    when she knew she had nothing to support me on, and they created me to feed like
                    a dog from stranger hands. Men do not say God sends the books, or the newspaper
                    articles, or the machines they make; and then sigh, and shrug their shoulders
                    and say they can't help it. Why do they say so about other things? Liars! âGod
                    sends the little babies!ââ She struck her foot fretfully against the
                    splashboard. âThe small children say so earnestly. <emph>They</emph> touch the
                    little stranger reverently who has just come from God's far country, and they
                    peep about the room to see if not one white feather has dropped from the wing of
                    the angel that brought him. On their lips the phrase means much; on all others
                    it is a <emph>deliberate</emph> lie. Noticeable, too,â she said, dropping in an
                    instant from the passionate into a low, mocking tone, âwhen people are married,
                    though they should have sixty children, they throw the<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7168-096"/> whole <foreign xml:lang="lat">onus</foreign> on God.
                    When they are not, we hear nothing about God's having sent them. When there has
                    been no legal contract between the parents, who sends the little children then?
                    The Devil perhaps!â She laughed her little silvery, mocking laugh. âOdd that
                    some men should come from hell and some from heaven, and yet all look so much
                    alike when they get here.â</p>
                <p>Waldo wondered at her. He had not the key to her thoughts, and did not see the
                    string on which they were strung. She drew her cloud tighter about her.</p>
                <p>âIt must be very nice to believe in the Devil,â she said; âI wish I did. If it
                    would be of any use I would pray three hours night and morning on my bare knees,
                    âGod, let me believe in Satan.â He is so useful to those people who do. They may
                    be as selfish and as sensual as they please, and, between God's will and the
                    Devil's action,<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7168-097"/> always have some one to throw
                    their sin on. But we, wretched unbelievers, we bear our own burdens: we must
                    say, âI myself did it, <emph>I</emph>. Not God, not Satan; I myself!â That is
                    the sting that strikes deep. Waldo,â she said gently, with a sudden and complete
                    change of manner, âI like you so much, I love you.â She rested her cheek softly
                    against his shoulder. âWhen I am with you I never know that I am a woman and you
                    are a man; I only know that we are both things that think. Other men when I am
                    with them, whether I love them or not, they are mere bodies to me; but you are a
                    spirit; I like you. Look,â she said quickly, sinking back into her corner, âwhat
                    a pretty pinkness there is on all the hill-tops! The sun will rise in a
                    moment.â</p>
                <p>Waldo lifted his eyes to look round over the circle of golden hills; and the
                    horses, as the first sunbeams touched them, shook their heads<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7168-098"/> and champed their bright bits, till the brass
                    settings in their harness glittered again.</p>
                <p>It was eight o'clock when they neared the farm-house: a red-brick building, with
                    kraals to the right and a small orchard to the left. Already there were signs of
                    unusual life and bustle: one cart, a waggon, and a couple of saddles against the
                    wall betokened the arrival of a few early guests, whose numbers would soon be
                    largely increased. To a Dutch country wedding, guests start up in numbers
                    astonishing to one who has merely ridden through the plains of
                    sparsely-inhabited karroo.</p>
                <p>As the morning advances, riders on many shades of steeds appear from all
                    directions, and add their saddles to the long rows against the walls, shake
                    hands, drink coffee, and stand about outside in groups to watch the arriving
                    carts and ox-waggons, as they are unburdened of their heavy freight of massive
                    Tantes and<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7168-099"/> comely daughters, followed by swarms
                    of children of all sizes, dressed in all manner of print and mole-skin, who are
                    taken care of by Hottentot, Kaffir, and half-caste nurses, whose many-shaded
                    complexions, ranging from light yellow up to ebony black, add variety to the
                    animated scene. Everywhere is excitement and bustle, which gradually increases
                    as the time for the return of the wedding-party approaches. Preparations for the
                    feast are actively advancing in the kitchen; coffee is liberally handed round,
                    and amid a profound sensation, and the firing of guns, the horse-waggon draws
                    up, and the wedding-party alight. Bride and bridegroom with their attendants
                    march solemnly to the marriage-chamber, where bed and box are decked out in
                    white, with ends of ribbon and artificial flowers, and where on a row of chairs
                    the party solemnly seat themselves. After a time bridesmaid and best man rise,
                    and conduct in with ceremony each individual guest,<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7168-100"/> to wish success, and to kiss bride and bridegroom.
                    Then the feast is set on the table, and it is almost sunset before the dishes
                    are cleared away, and the pleasure of the day begins. Everything is removed from
                    the great front room, and the mud floor, well rubbed with bullock's blood,
                    glistens like polished mahogany. The female portion of the assembly flock into
                    the side-rooms to attire themselves for the evening; and re-issue clad in white
                    muslin, and gay with bright ribbons and brass jewelry. The dancing begins as the
                    first tallow candles are stuck up about the walls, the music coming from a
                    couple of fiddlers in a corner of the room. Bride and bridegroom open the ball,
                    and the floor is soon covered with whirling couples, and every one's spirits
                    rise. Bride and bridegroom mingle freely in the throng, and here and there a
                    musical man sings vigorously as he drags his partner through the Blue Water or
                    John Speriwig; boys shout and<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7168-101"/> applaud, and the
                    enjoyment and confusion are intense, till eleven o'clock comes. By this time the
                    children who swarm in the side-rooms are not to be kept quiet longer, even by
                    hunches of bread and cake; there is a general howl and wail, that rises yet
                    higher than the scraping of fiddles, and mothers rush from their partners to
                    knock small heads together, and cuff little nursemaids, and force the wailers
                    down into unoccupied corners of beds, under tables and behind boxes. In half an
                    hour every variety of childish snore is heard on all sides, and it has become
                    perilous to raise or set down a foot in any of the side-rooms lest a small head
                    or hand should be crushed. Now too the busy feet have broken the solid coating
                    of the floor, and a cloud of fine dust arises, that makes a yellow halo round
                    the candles, and sets asthmatic people coughing, and grows denser, till to
                    recognise any one on the opposite side of the room becomes impossible,<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7168-102"/> and a partner's face is seen through a yellow
                    mist.</p>
                <p>At twelve o'clock the bride is led to the marriage-chamber and undressed; the
                    lights are blown out, and the bridegroom is brought to the door by the best man,
                    who gives him the key; then the door is shut and locked, and the revels rise
                    higher than ever. There is no thought of sleep till morning, and no unoccupied
                    spot where sleep may be found.</p>
                <p>It was at this stage of the proceedings on the night of Tant' Sannie's wedding
                    that Lyndall sat near the doorway in one of the side-rooms, to watch the dancers
                    as they appeared and disappeared in the yellow cloud of dust. Gregory sat
                    moodily in a corner of the large dancing-room. His little betrothed touched his
                    arm.</p>
                <p>âI wish you would go and ask Lyndall to dance with you,â she said; âshe must be
                    so tired; she has sat still the whole evening.â</p>
                <pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7168-103"/>
                <p>âI have asked her three times,â replied her lover shortly. âI'm not going to be
                        <emph>her</emph> dog, and creep to <emph>her</emph> feet, just to give her
                    the pleasure of kicking meânot for you, Em, nor for anybody else.â</p>
                <p>âOh, I didn't know you had asked her, Greg,â said his little betrothed, humbly;
                    and she went away to pour out coffee.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, some time after Gregory found he had shifted so far round the room
                    as to be close to the door where Lyndall sat. After standing for some time he
                    inquired whether he might not bring her a cup of coffee. She declined; but still
                    he stood on (why should he not stand there as well as anywhere else?), and then
                    he stepped into the bed-room.</p>
                <p>âMay I not bring you a stove, Miss Lyndall, to put your feet on?â</p>
                <p>âThank you.â</p>
                <p>He sought for one, and put it under her feet.</p>
                <pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7168-104"/>
                <p>âThere is a draught from that broken window: shall I stuff something in the
                    pane?â</p>
                <p>âNo, we want air.â</p>
                <p>Gregory looked round, but nothing else suggesting itself, he sat down on a box on
                    the opposite side of the door. Lyndall sat before him, her chin resting in her
                    hand; her eyes, steel-grey by day but black by night, looked through the doorway
                    into the next room. After a time he thought she had entirely forgotten his
                    proximity, and he dared to inspect the little hands and neck as he never dared
                    when he was in momentary dread of the eyes being turned upon him.</p>
                <p>She was dressed in black, which seemed to take her yet further from the
                    white-clad, gew-gawed women about her; and the little hands were white, and the
                    diamond ring glittered. Where had she got that ring? He bent forward a little
                    and tried to decipher the letters, but the candle-light was too faint. When he
                    looked up her<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7168-105"/> eyes were fixed on him. She was
                    looking at himânot, Gregory felt, as she had ever looked at him before; not as
                    though he were a stump or a stone that chance had thrown in her way. To-night,
                    whether it were critically, or kindly, or unkindly, he could not tell, but she
                    looked at him, at the man, Gregory Rose, with attention. A vague elation filled
                    him. He clinched his fist tight to think of some good idea he might express to
                    her; but of all those profound things he had pictured himself as saying to her,
                    when he sat alone in the daub-and-wattle house, not one came. He said, at
                    last,</p>
                <p>âThese Boer dances are very low things;â and then, as soon as it had gone from
                    him, he thought it was not a clever remark, and wished it back.</p>
                <p>Before Lyndall replied Em looked in at the door.</p>
                <p>âOh, come,â she said; âthey are going to have the cushion-dance. I do not want to
                    kiss any of these fellows. Take me quickly.â</p>
                <pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7168-106"/>
                <p>She slipped her hand into Gregory's arm.</p>
                <p>âIt is so dusty, Em; do you care to dance any more?â he asked, without
                    rising.</p>
                <p>âOh, I do not mind the dust, and the dancing rests me.â</p>
                <p>But he did not move.</p>
                <p>âI feel tired; I do not think I shall dance again,â he said.</p>
                <p>Em withdrew her hand, and a young farmer came to the door and bore her off.</p>
                <p>âI have often imagined,â remarked Gregoryâbut Lyndall had risen.</p>
                <p>âI am tired,â she said. âI wonder where Waldo is; he must take me home. These
                    people will not leave off till morning, I suppose; it is three already.â</p>
                <p>She made her way past the fiddlers, and a bench full of tired dancers, and passed
                    out at the front door. On the âstoepâ a group of men and boys were smoking,
                    peeping in at the<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7168-107"/> windows, and cracking coarse
                    jokes. Waldo was certainly not among them, and she made her way to the carts and
                    waggons drawn up at some distance from the homestead.</p>
                <p>âWaldo,â she said, peering into a large cart, âis that you? I am so dazed with
                    the tallow candles, I see nothing.â</p>
                <p>He had made himself a place between the two seats. She climbed up and sat on the
                    sloping floor in front.</p>
                <p>âI thought I should find you here,â she said, drawing her skirt up about her
                    shoulders. âYou must take me home presently, but not now.â</p>
                <p>She leaned her head on the seat near to his, and they listened in silence to the
                    fitful twanging of the fiddles as the night wind bore it from the farm-house,
                    and to the ceaseless thud of the dancers, and the peals of gross laughter. She
                    stretched out her little hand to feel for his.</p>
                <pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7168-108"/>
                <p>âIt is so nice to lie here and hear that noise,â she said. âI like to feel that
                    strange life beating up against me. I like to realise forms of life utterly
                    unlike mine. When my own life feels small, and I am oppressed with it, I like to
                    crush together, and see it in a picture, in an instant, a multitude of
                    disconnected unlike phases of human lifeâa mediÃ¦val monk with his string of
                    beads pacing the quiet orchard, and looking up from the grass at his feet to the
                    heavy fruit-trees; little Malay boys playing naked on a shining sea-beach; a
                    Hindoo philosopher alone under his banyan tree, thinking, thinking, thinking, so
                    that in the thought of God he may lose himself; a troop of Bacchanalians dressed
                    in white, with crowns of vine-leaves, dancing as they sing along the Roman
                    streets; a martyr on the night of his death looking through the narrow window to
                    the sky, and feeling that already he has the wings that shall bear him up;<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7168-109"/> an epicurean discoursing at a Roman bath to a
                    knot of his disciples on the nature of happiness; a Kaffir witch-doctor seeking
                    for herbs by moonlight, while from the huts on the hill-side come the sound of
                    dogs barking, and the voices of women and children; a Nihilist starting up in
                    her sleep, and vowing, with clenched fist, the vow she had sworn waking, to
                    sacrifice life and blood in the cause of freedom; a mother giving bread and milk
                    to her children in little wooden basins and singing the evening-song. I like to
                    see it all; I feel it run through meâthat universal life belongs to me, of which
                    I am part; it makes my little life larger, it breaks down the narrow walls that
                    shut me in.â</p>
                <p>She sighed, and drew a long breath.</p>
                <p>âHave you made any plans?â she asked him presently.</p>
                <p>âYes,â he said, the words coming in jets, with pauses between; âI will take the
                    grey mare,â<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7168-110"/> I will travel firstâI will see the
                    worldâthen I will find work.â</p>
                <p>âWhat work?â</p>
                <p>âI do not know.â</p>
                <p>She made a little impatient movement.</p>
                <p>âThat is no plan. If you go into the world aimless, without a definite object,
                    dreaming, dreaming, you will be definitely defeated, bamboozled, knocked this
                    way and that; in the end you will stand with your beautiful life all spent, and
                    nothing to show. They talk of geniusâit is nothing but this, that a man knows
                    what he can do best, and does it, and nothing else. Waldo,â she said, knitting
                    her little fingers closer among his, âI wish I could help you; I wish I could
                    rouse you up, and make you see tht nowâto-dayâyou must decide what you will be
                    and do. It does not matter what you choose,âbe a farmer, business-man, artist,
                    politician, what you will,âbut know your aim, and<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7168-111"/> live for that one thing. The secret of success is
                    concentration; wherever there has been a great life, or a great work, that has
                    gone before. Taste everything a little, look at everything; but live for one
                    thing. Anything is possible to a man who knows his end and moves straight for
                    it, and for it alone. I will show you what I mean,â she said, concisely; âwords
                    are gas till you condense them into pictures.â</p>
                <p>âSuppose a woman, young, friendless as I am, the weakest thing on God's earth.
                    But she must make her way through life. What she would be she cannot be because
                    she is a woman; so she looks carefully at herself and the world about her, to
                    see where her path must lie. There is no one to help her; she must help herself.
                    She looks. These things she hasâa sweet voice, rich in subtile intonations; a
                    fair, very fair face, with a power of concentrating in itself, and giving
                    expression to, feelings that otherwise<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7168-112"/> must
                    have been dissipated in words; a rare power of entering into other lives unlike
                    her own, and intuitively reading them aright. These qualities she has. How shall
                    she use them? A poet, a writer, needs only the mental; what use has he for a
                    beautiful body that registers clearly mental emotions? And the painter wants an
                    eye for form and colour, and the musician an ear for time and tune, and the mere
                    drudge has no need for mental gifts. But there is one art in which all she has
                    would be used, for which they are all necessaryâthe delicate expressive body,
                    the rich voice, the power of mental transposition. The actor, who absorbs and
                    then reflects from himself other human lives, needs them all, but needs not much
                    more. This is her end; but how to reach it? Before her are endless difficulties:
                    seas must be crossed, poverty must be endured, loneliness, want. She must be
                    content to wait long before<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7168-113"/> she can even get
                    her feet upon the path. If she has made blunders in the past, if she has
                    weighted herself with a burden which she must bear to the end, she must but bear
                    the burden bravely, and labour on. There is no use in wailing and repentance
                    here: the next world is the place for that; this life is too short. By our
                    errors we see deeper into life. They help us.</p>
                <p>âIf she does all thisâif she waits patiently, if she is never cast down, never
                    despairs, never forgets her end, moves straight toward it, bending men and
                    things most unlikely to her purpose,âshe must succeed at last. Men and things
                    are plastic; they part to the right and left when one comes among them moving in
                    a straight line to one end. I know it by my own little experience,â she said.
                    âLong years ago I resolved to be sent to school. It seemed a thing utterly out
                    of my power; but I waited, I watched, I collected clothes, I took my place at
                    the school;<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7168-114"/> when all was ready I bore with my
                    full force on the Boer-woman, and she sent me at last. It was a small thing; but
                    life is made up of small things, as a body is built up of cells. What has been
                    done in small things can be done in large. Shall be,â she said softly.</p>
                <p>Waldo listened. To him the words were no confession, no glimpse into the strong,
                    proud, restless heart of the woman. They were general words with a general
                    application. He looked up into the sparkling sky with dull eyes.</p>
                <p>âYes,â he said; âbut when we lie and think, and think, we see that there is
                    nothing worth doing. The universe is so large, and man is so smallââ</p>
                <p>She shook her head quickly.</p>
                <p>âBut we must not think so far; it is madness, it is a disease. We know that no
                    man's work is great, and stands for ever. Moses is dead, and the prophets, and
                    the books that our<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7168-115"/> grandmothers fed on the
                    mould is eating. Your poet and painter and actor,âbefore the shouts that applaud
                    them have died their names grow strange, they are mile-stones that the world has
                    passed. Men have set their mark on mankind forever, as they thought; but time
                    has washed it out as it has washed out mountains and continents. And what if we
                        <emph>could</emph> help mankind, and leave the traces of our work upon it to
                    the end? Mankind is only an ephemeral blossom on the tree of time; there were
                    others before it opened; there will be others after it has fallen. Where was man
                    in the time of the dicynodont, and when hoary monsters wallowed in the mud? Will
                    he be found in the Ã¦ons that are to come? We are sparks, we are shadows, we are
                    pollen, which the next wind will carry away. We are dying already; it is all a
                    dream.</p>
                <p>âI know that thought. When the fever of living is on us, when the desire to
                    become, to<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7168-116"/> know, to do, is driving us mad, we
                    can use it as an anodyne, to still the fever and cool our beating pulses. But it
                    is a poison, not a food. If we live on it it will turn our blood to ice; we
                    might as well be dead. We must not, Waldo; I want your life to be beautiful, to
                    end in something. You are nobler and stronger than I,â she said; âand as much
                    better as one of God's great angels is better than a sinning man. Your life must
                    not go for nothing.â</p>
                <p>âNo, we will work,â he said.</p>
                <p>She moved closer to him and lay still, his black curls touching her smooth little
                    head.</p>
                <p>Doss, who had lain at his master's side, climbed over the bench, and curled
                    himself up in her lap. She drew her skirt up over him, and the three sat
                    motionless for a long time.</p>
                <p>âWaldo,â she said, suddenly, âthey are laughing at us.â</p>
                <p>âWho?â he asked, starting up.</p>
                <pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7168-117"/>
                <p>âTheyâthe stars!â she said, softly. âDo you not see? there is a little white,
                    mocking finger pointing down at us from each one of them! We are talking of
                    to-morrow, and to-morrow, and our hearts are so strong; we are not thinking of
                    something that can touch us softly in the dark and make us still forever. They
                    are laughing at us, Waldo.â</p>
                <p>Both sat looking upward.</p>
                <p>âDo you ever pray?â he asked her in a low voice.</p>
                <p>âNo.â</p>
                <p>âI never do; but I might when I look up there. I will tell you,â he added, in a
                    still lower voice, âwhere I could pray. If there were a wall of rock on the edge
                    of a world, and one rock stretched out far into space, and I stood alone upon
                    it, alone with stars above me, and stars below. I would not say anything; but
                    the feeling would be prayer.â</p>
                <pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7168-118"/>
                <p>There was an end to their conversation after that, and Doss fell asleep on her
                    knee. At last the night wind grew very chilly.</p>
                <p>âAh,â she said, shivering, and drawing the skirt about her shoulders, âI am cold.
                    Span in the horses, and call me when you are ready.â</p>
                <p>She slipped down and walked toward the house, Doss stiffly following her, not
                    pleased at being roused. At the door she met Gregory.</p>
                <p>âI have been looking for you everywhere; may I not drive you home?â he said.</p>
                <p>âWaldo drives me,â she replied, passing on; and it appeared to Gregory that she
                    looked at him in the old way, without seeing him. But before she had reached the
                    door an idea had occurred to her, for she turned.</p>
                <p>âIf you wish to drive me you may.â</p>
                <p>Gregory went to look for Em, whom he found pouring out coffee in the back room.
                    He put his hand quickly on her shoulder.</p>
                <pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7168-119"/>
                <p>âYou must ride with Waldo; I am going to drive your cousin home.â</p>
                <p>âBut I can't come just now, Greg; I promised Tante Annie to look after the things
                    while she went to rest a little.â</p>
                <p>âWell, you can come presently, can't you? I didn't say you were to come now. I'm
                    sick of this thing,â said Gregory, turning sharply on his heel. âWhy must I sit
                    up the whole night because your step-mother chooses to get married?â</p>
                <p>âOh, it's all right, Greg, I only meantââ</p>
                <p>But he did not hear her, and a man had come up to have his cup filled.</p>
                <p>An hour after Waldo came in to look for her, and found her still busy at the
                    table.</p>
                <p>âThe horses are ready,â he said; âbut if you would like to have one dance more I
                    will wait.â</p>
                <p>She shook her head wearily.</p>
                <p>âNo; I am quite ready. I want to go.â</p>
                <pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7168-120"/>
                <p>And soon they were on the sandy road the buggy had travelled an hour before.
                    Their horses, with heads close together, nodding sleepily as they walked in the
                    starlight, you might have counted the rise and fall of their feet in the sand;
                    and Waldo in his saddle nodded drowsily also. Only Em was awake, and watched the
                    starlit road with wide-open eyes. At last she spoke.</p>
                <p>âI wonder if all people feel so old, so very old, when they get to be
                    seventeen.â</p>
                <p>âNot older than before,â said Waldo sleepily, pulling at his bridle.</p>
                <p>Presently she said again,</p>
                <p>âI wish I could have been a little child always. You are good then. You are never
                    selfish; you like every one to have everything; but when you are grown-up there
                    are some things you like to have all to yourself, you don't like any one else to
                    have any of them.â</p>
                <pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7168-121"/>
                <p>âYes,â said Waldo sleepily, and she did not speak again.</p>
                <p>When they reached the farm-house all was dark, for Lyndall had retired as soon as
                    they got home.</p>
                <p>Waldo lifted Em from her saddle, and for a moment she leaned her head on his
                    shoulder and clung to him.</p>
                <p>âYou are very tired,â he said, as he walked with her to the door; âlet me go in
                    and light a candle for you.â</p>
                <p>âNo, thank you; it is all right,â she said. âGood night, Waldo, dear.â</p>
                <p>But when she went in she sat long alone in the dark.</p>

                <head type="sub">WALDO GOES OUT TO TASTE LIFE, AND EM STAYS AT HOME AND TASTES
                    IT.</head>
                <p><hi rend="b">AT</hi> nine o'clock in the evening, packing his bundles for the
                    next morning's start, Waldo looked up, and was surprised to see Em's yellow head
                    peeping in at his door. It was many a month since she had been there. She said
                    she had made him sandwiches for his journey, and she stayed a while to help him
                    put his goods into the saddle-bags.</p>
                <p>âYou can leave the old things lying about,â she said; âI will lock the room, and
                    keep it waiting for you to come back some day.â</p>
                <p>To come back some day! Would the bird ever<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7168-123"/>
                    return to its cage? But he thanked her. When she went away he stood on the
                    doorstep holding the candle till she had almost reached the house. But Em was
                    that evening in no hurry to enter, and instead of going in at the back door,
                    walked with lagging footsteps round the low brick wall that ran before the
                    house. Opposite the open window of the parlour she stopped. The little room,
                    kept carefully closed in Tant' Sannie's time, was well lighted by a paraffin
                    lamp; books and work lay strewn about it, and it wore a bright, habitable
                    aspect. Beside the lamp at the table in the corner sat Lyndall, the open letters
                    and papers of the day's post lying scattered before her, while she perused the
                    columns of a newspaper. At the centre table, with his arms folded on an open
                    paper, which there was not light enough to read, sat Gregory. He was looking at
                    her. The light from the open window fell on Em's little face under its white
                        kapje<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7168-124"/> as she looked in, but no one glanced
                    that way.</p>
                <p>âGo and fetch me a glass of water,â Lyndall said at last.</p>
                <p>Gregory went out to find it; when he put it down at her side she merely moved her
                    head in recognition, and he went back to his seat and his old occupation. Then
                    Em moved slowly away from the window, and through it came in spotted,
                    hard-winged insects, to play round the lamp, till one by one, they stuck to its
                    glass, and fell to the foot dead.</p>
                <p>Ten o'clock struck. Then Lyndall rose, gathered up her papers and letters, and
                    wished Gregory good night. Some time after Em entered; she had been sitting all
                    the while on the loft ladder, and had drawn her âkapjeâ down very much over her
                    face.</p>
                <p>Gregory was piecing together the bits of an envelope when she came in.</p>
                <pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7168-125"/>
                <p>âI thought you were never coming,â he said, turning round quickly, and throwing
                    the fragments onto the floor. âYou know I have been shearing all day, and it is
                    ten o'clock already.â</p>
                <p>âI'm sorry. I did not think you would be going so soon,â she said in a low
                    voice.</p>
                <p>âI can't hear what you say. What makes you mumble so? Well, good night, Em.â</p>
                <p>He stooped down hastily to kiss her.</p>
                <p>âI want to talk to you, Gregory.â</p>
                <p>âWell, make haste,â he said pettishly. âI'm awfully tired. I've been sitting here
                    all the evening. Why couldn't you come and talk before?â</p>
                <p>âI will not keep you long,â she answered very steadily now. âI think, Gregory, it
                    would be better if you and I were never to be married.â</p>
                <p>âGood heavens! Em, what do you mean? I thought you were so fond of me? You always
                        <emph>professed</emph> to be. What on earth have you taken into your head
                    now?â</p>
                <pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7168-126"/>
                <p>âI think it would be better,â she said, folding her hands over each other, very
                    much as though she were praying.</p>
                <p>âBetter, Em! What do you mean? Even a woman can't take a freak all about nothing!
                    You must have <emph>some</emph> reason for it, and I'm sure I've done nothing to
                    offend you. I wrote only to-day to my sister to tell her to come up next month
                    to our wedding, and I've been as affectionate and happy as possible. Comeâwhat's
                    the matter?â</p>
                <p>He put his arm half round her shoulder, very loosely.</p>
                <p>âI think it would be better,â she answered, slowly.</p>
                <p>âOh, well,â he said, drawing himself up, âif you won't enter into explanations
                    you won't; and I'm not the man to beg and prayânot to any woman, and you know
                    that! If you don't want to marry me I can't oblige you to, of course.â</p>
                <pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7168-127"/>
                <p>She stood quite still before him.</p>
                <p>âYou women never <emph>do</emph> know your own minds for two days together; and
                    of course you know the state of your own feelings best; but it's very strange.
                    Have you really made up your mind, Em?â</p>
                <p>âYes.â</p>
                <p>âWell, I'm very sorry. I'm sure I've not been in anything to blame. A man can't
                    always be billing and cooing; but, as you say, if your feeling for me has
                    changed, it's much better you shouldn't marry me. There's nothing so foolish as
                    to marry some one you don't love; and I only wish for your happiness, I'm sure.
                    I daresay you'll find some one can make you much happier than I could; the first
                    person we love is seldom the right one. You are very young; it's quite natural
                    you should change.â</p>
                <p>She said nothing.</p>
                <p>âThings often seem hard at the time, but<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7168-128"/>
                    Providence makes them turn out for the best in the end,â said Gregory. âYou'll
                    let me kiss you, Em, just for old friendship's sake.â He stooped down. âYou must
                    look upon me as a dear brother, as a cousin at least; as long as I am on the
                    farm I shall always be glad to help you, Em.â</p>
                <p>Soon after the brown pony was cantering along the footpath to the daub-and-wattle
                    house, and his master as he rode whistled John Speriwig and the Thorn Kloof
                    schottische.</p>
                <p>The sun had not yet touched the outstretched arms of the prickly pear upon the
                    kopje, and the early cocks and hens still strutted about stiffly after the
                    night's roost, when Waldo stood before the waggon-house saddling the grey mare.
                    Every now and then he glanced up at the old familiar objects: they had a new
                    aspect that morning. Even the cocks, seen in the light of<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7168-129"/> parting, had a peculiar interest, and he listened
                    with conscious attention while one crowed clear and loud as it stood on the
                    pigsty wall. He wished good morning softly to the Kaffir-woman who was coming up
                    from the huts to light the fire. He was leaving them all to that old life, and
                    from his height he looked down on them pityingly. So they would keep on crowing,
                    and coming to light fires, when for him that old colourless existence was but a
                    dream.</p>
                <p>He went into the house to say good-bye to Em, and then he walked to the door of
                    Lyndall's room to wake her; but she was up, and standing in the doorway.</p>
                <p>âSo you are ready,â she said.</p>
                <p>Waldo looked at her with sudden heaviness; the exhilaration died out of his
                    heart. Her grey dressing-gown hung close about her, and below its edge the
                    little bare feet were resting on the threshold.</p>
                <pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7168-130"/>
                <p>âI wonder when we shall meet again, Waldo. What you will be, and what I?â</p>
                <p>âWill you write to me?â he asked of her.</p>
                <p>âYes; and if I should not, you can still remember, wherever you are, that you are
                    not alone.â</p>
                <p>âI have left Doss for you,â he said.</p>
                <p>âWill you not miss him?â</p>
                <p>âNo; I want you to have him. He loves you better than he loves me.â</p>
                <p>âThank you.â They stood quiet.</p>
                <p>âGood-bye!â she said, putting her little hand in his, and he turned away; but
                    when he reached the door she called to him: âCome back, I want to kiss you.â She
                    drew his face down to hers, and held it with both hands, and kissed it on the
                    forehead and mouth. âGood-bye, dear!â</p>
                <p>When he looked back the little figure with its beautiful eyes was standing in the
                    doorway still.</p>

                <head type="sub">THE KOPJE.</head>
                <p>â<hi rend="b">GOOD</hi> morning!â</p>
                <p>Em, who was in the storeroom measuring the Kaffir's rations, looked up and saw
                    her former lover standing betwixt her and the sunshine. For some days after that
                    evening on which he had ridden home whistling he had shunned her. She might wish
                    to enter into explanations, and he, Gregory Rose, was not the man for that kind
                    of thing. If a woman had once thrown him overboard she must take the
                    consequences, and stand by them. When, however, she showed no inclination to
                    revert to the past, and shunned him more than he shunned her, Gregory
                    softened.</p>
                <pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7168-132"/>
                <p>âYou must let me call you Em still, and be like a brother to you till I go,â he
                    said; and Em thanked him so humbly that he wished she hadn't. It wasn't so easy
                    after that to think himself an injured man.</p>
                <p>On that morning he stood some time in the doorway switching his whip, and moving
                    rather restlessly from one leg to the other.</p>
                <p>âI think I'll just take a walk up to the camps and see how your birds are getting
                    on. Now Waldo's gone you've no one to see after things. Nice morning, isn't it?â
                    Then he added suddenly, âI'll just go round to the house and get a drink of
                    water first;â and somewhat awkwardly walked off. He might have found water in
                    the kitchen, but he never glanced toward the buckets. In the front room a monkey
                    and two tumblers stood on the centre table; but he merely looked round, peeped
                    into the parlour, looked round again, and then walked out at the<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7168-133"/> front door, and found himself again at the store-room
                    without having satisfied his thirst. âAwfully nice morning this,â he said,
                    trying to pose himself in a graceful and indifferent attitude against the door.
                    âIt isn't hot and it isn't cold. It's awfully nice.â</p>
                <p>âYes,â said Em.</p>
                <p>âYour cousin, now,â said Gregory in an aimless sort of wayââI suppose she's shut
                    up in her room writing letters.â</p>
                <p>âNo,â said Em.</p>
                <p>âGone for a drive, I expect? Nice morning for a drive.â</p>
                <p>âNo.â</p>
                <p>âGone to see the ostriches, I suppose?â</p>
                <p>âNo.â After a little silence Em added, âI saw her go by the kraals to the
                    kopje.â</p>
                <p>Gregory crossed and uncrossed his legs.</p>
                <p>âWell, I think I'll just go and have a look about,â he said, âand see how things
                    are getting<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7168-134"/> on before I go to the camps.
                    Good-bye; so long.â</p>
                <p>Em left for a while the bags she was folding and went to the window, the same
                    through which, years before, Bonaparte had watched the slouching figure cross
                    the yard. Gregory walked to the pigsty first, and contemplated the pigs for a
                    few seconds; then turned round, and stood looking fixedly at the wall of the
                    fuel-house as though he thought it wanted repairing; then he started off
                    suddenly with the evident intention of going to the ostrich-camps; then paused,
                    hesitated, and finally walked off in the direction of the âkopje.â</p>
                <p>Then Em went back to the corner, and folded more sacks.</p>
                <p>On the other side of the âkopjeâ Gregory caught sight of a white tail waving
                    among the stones, and a succession of short, frantic barks told where Doss was
                    engaged in howling <choice>

                    </choice><pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7168-135"/> ingly to a lizard who had crept
                    between two stones, and who had not the slightest intention of re-sunning
                    himself at that particular moment.</p>
                <p>The dog's mistress sat higher up, under the shelving rock, her face bent over a
                    volume of plays upon her knee. As Gregory mounted the stones she started
                    violently and looked up; then resumed her book.</p>
                <p>âI hope I am not troubling you,â said Gregory as he reached her side. âIf I am I
                    will go away. I justââ</p>
                <p>âNo; you may stay.â</p>
                <p>âI fear I startled you.â</p>
                <p>âYes; your step was firmer than it generally is. I thought it was that of some
                    one else.â</p>
                <p>âWho could it be but me?â asked Gregory, seating himself on a stone at her
                    feet.</p>
                <p>âDo you suppose you are the only man who would find anything to attract him to
                    this âkopjeâ?â</p>
                <pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7168-136"/>
                <p>âOh, no,â said Gregory.</p>
                <p>He was not going to argue that point with her, nor any other; but no old Boer was
                    likely to take the trouble of climbing the âkopje,â and who else was there?</p>
                <p>She continued the study of her book.</p>
                <p>âMiss Lyndall,â he said at last, âI don't know why it is you never talk to
                    me.â</p>
                <p>âWe had a long conversation yesterday,â she said, without looking up.</p>
                <p>âYes; but you ask me questions about sheep and oxen. I don't call that talking.
                    You used to talk to Waldo, now,â he said, in an aggrieved tone of voice. âI've
                    heard you when I came in, and then you've just left off. You treated me like
                    that from the first day; and you couldn't tell from just looking at me that I
                    couldn't talk about the things you like. I'm sure I know as much about such
                    things as Waldo does,â said Gregory, in exceeding bitterness of spirit.</p>
                <pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7168-137"/>
                <p>âI do not know which things you refer to. If you will enlighten me I am quite
                    prepared to speak of them,â she said, reading as she spoke.</p>
                <p>âOh, you never used to ask Waldo like that,â said Gregory, in a more sorely
                    aggrieved tone than ever. âYou used just to begin.â</p>
                <p>âWell, let me see,â she said, closing her book and folding her hands on it.
                    âThere goes a Kaffir; he has nothing on but a blanket; he is a splendid
                    fellowâsix feet high, with a magnificent pair of legs. In his leather bag he is
                    going to get his rations, and I suppose to kick his wife with his beautiful legs
                    when he gets home. He has a right to; he bought her for two oxen. There is a
                    lean dog going after him, to whom I suppose he never gives more than a bone from
                    which he has sucked the marrow; but his dog loves him, as his wife does. There
                    is something of the master about him in<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7168-138"/> spite
                    of his blackness and wool. See how he brandishes his stick and holds up his
                    head!â</p>
                <p>âOh, but aren't you making fun?â said Gregory, looking doubtfully from her to the
                    Kaffir herd, who rounded the âkopje.â</p>
                <p>âNo; I am very serious. He is the most interesting and intelligent thing I can
                    see just now, except, perhaps, Doss. He is profoundly suggestive. Will his race
                    melt away in the heat of a collision with a higher? Are the men of the future to
                    see his bones only in museumsâa vestige of one link that spanned between the dog
                    and the white man? He wakes thoughts that run far out into the future and back
                    into the past.â</p>
                <p>Gregory was not quite sure how to take these remarks. Being about a Kaffir, they
                    appeared to be of the nature of a joke; but being seriously spoken, they
                    appeared earnest; so he half laughed and half not, to be on the safe side.</p>
                <pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7168-139"/>
                <p>âI've often thought so myself. It's funny we should both think the same; I knew
                    we should if once we talked. But there are other thingsâlove, now,â he added. âI
                    wonder if we would think alike about that. I wrote an essay on love once; the
                    master said it was the best I ever wrote, and I can remember the first sentence
                    stillââLove is something that you feel in your heart.ââ</p>
                <p>âThat was a trenchant remark. Can't you remember any more?â</p>
                <p>âNo,â said Gregory, regretfully; âI've forgotten the rest. But tell me what do
                    you think about love?â</p>
                <p>A look, half of abstraction, half amusement, played on her lips.</p>
                <p>âI don't know much about love,â she said, âand I do not like to talk of things I
                    do not understand; but I have heard two opinions. Some say the devil carried the
                    seed from hell<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7168-140"/> and planted it on the earth to
                    plague men and make them sin; and some say, that when all the plants in the
                    garden of Eden were pulled up by the roots, one bush that the angels planted was
                    left growing, and it spread its seed over the whole earth, and its name is love.
                    I do not know which is rightâperhaps both. There are different species that go
                    under the same name. There is a love that begins in the head, and goes down to
                    the heart, and grows slowly; but it lasts till death, and asks less than it
                    gives. There is another love, that blots out wisdom, that is sweet with the
                    sweetness of life and bitter with the bitterness of death, lasting for an hour;
                    but it is worth having lived a whole life for that hour. I cannot tell, perhaps
                    the old monks were right when they tried to root love out; perhaps the poets are
                    right when they try to water it. It is a blood-red flower, with the colour of<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7168-141"/> sin; but there is always the scent of a god
                    about it.â</p>
                <p>Gregory would have made a remark; but she said, without noticing,</p>
                <p>âThere are as many kinds of loves as there are flowers. Everlastings that never
                    wither; Speedwells that wait for the wind to fan them out of life; blood-red
                    mountain-lilies that pour their voluptuous sweetness out for one day, and lie in
                    the dust at night. There is no flower has the charm of allâthe Speedwell's
                    purity, the Everlasting's strength, the mountain-lily's warmth; but who knows
                    whether there is no love that holds allâfriendship, passion, worship!</p>
                <p>âSuch a love,â she said, in her sweetest voice, âwill fall on the surface of
                    strong, cold, selfish life as the sunlight falls on a torpid winter world;
                    there, where the trees are bare, and the ground frozen, till it rings to the
                    step like iron, and the water is solid, and the air is sharp<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7168-142"/> as a two-edged knife that cuts the unwary. But when
                    its sun shines on it, through its whole dead crust a throbbing yearning wakes:
                    the trees feel him, and every knot and bud swell, aching to open to him. The
                    brown seeds, who have slept deep under the ground, feel him, and he gives them
                    strength, till they break through the frozen earth, and lift two tiny, trembling
                    green hands in love to him. And he touches the water, till down to its depths it
                    feels him and melts, and it flows, and the things, strange sweet things that
                    were locked up in it, it sings as it runs, for love of him. Each plant tries to
                    bear at least one fragrant little flower for him; and the world that was dead
                    lives, and the heart that was dead and self-centred throbs, with an upward,
                    outward yearning, and it has become that which it seemed impossible ever to
                    become. There, does that satisfy you?â she asked, looking down<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7168-143"/> at Gregory. âIs that how you like me to talk?â</p>
                <p>âOh, yes,â said Gregory, âthat is what I have already thought. We have the same
                    thoughts about everything. How strange!â</p>
                <p>âVery,â said Lyndall, working with her little toe at a stone in the ground before
                    her.</p>
                <p>Gregory felt he must sustain the conversation. The only thing he could think of
                    was to recite a piece of poetry. He knew he had learnt many about love; but the
                    only thing that would come into his mind now, was the âBattle of Hohenlinden,â
                    and âNot a drum was heard,â neither of which seemed to bear directly on the
                    subject on hand.</p>
                <p>But unexpected relief came to him from Doss, who, too deeply lost in
                    contemplation of his crevice, was surprised by the sudden descent of the stone
                    Lyndall's foot had loosened, which, rolling against his little front paw,
                    carried away<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7168-144"/> a piece of white skin. Doss stood
                    on three legs, holding up the paw with an expression of extreme
                    self-commiseration; he then proceeded to hop slowly upward in search of
                    sympathy.</p>
                <p>âYou have hurt that dog,â said Gregory.</p>
                <p>âHave I?â she replied indifferently, and re-opened the book, as though to resume
                    her study of the play.</p>
                <p>âHe's a nasty, snappish little cur!â said Gregory, calculating from her manner
                    that the remark would be endorsed. âHe snapped at my horse's tail yesterday, and
                    nearly made it throw me. I wonder his master didn't take him, instead of leaving
                    him here to be a nuisance to all of us!â</p>
                <p>Lyndall seemed absorbed in her play; but he ventured another remark.</p>
                <p>âDo you think now, Miss Lyndall, that he'll ever have anything in the worldâthat
                    German. I meanâmoney enough to support a wife on, and<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7168-145"/> all that sort of thing? <emph>I</emph> don't. He's
                    what <emph>I</emph> call soft.â</p>
                <p>She was spreading her skirt out softly with her left hand for the dog to lie down
                    on it.</p>
                <p>âI think I <emph>should</emph> be rather astonished if he ever became a
                    respectable member of society,â she said. I don't expect to see him the
                    possessor of bank-shares, the chairman of a divisional council, and the father
                    of a large family; wearing a black hat, and going to church twice on a Sunday.
                    He would rather astonish me if he came to such an end.â</p>
                <p>âYes; I don't expect <emph>anything</emph> of him either,â said Gregory,
                    zealously.</p>
                <p>âWell, I don't know,â said Lyndall; âthere are some small things I rather look to
                    him for. If he were to invent wings, or <choice>
                        <sic>carry</sic>
                        <corr>carve</corr>
                    </choice> a statue that one might look at for half an hour without wanting to
                    look at something else, I should not be surprised. He may do some little thing
                        of<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7168-146"/> that kind perhaps, when he has done
                    fermenting and the sediment has all gone to the bottom.â</p>
                <p>Gregory felt that what she said was not wholly intended as blame.</p>
                <p>âWell, I don't know,â he said sulkily; âto me he looks like a fool. To walk about
                    always in that dead-and-alive sort of way, muttering to himself like an old
                    Kaffir witch-doctor! He works hard enough, but it's always as though he didn't
                    know what he was doing. You don't know how he looks to a person who sees him for
                    the first time.â</p>
                <p>Lyndall was softly touching the little sore foot as she read, and Doss, to show
                    he liked it, licked her hand.</p>
                <p>âBut, Miss Lyndall,â persisted Gregory, âwhat do you really think of him?â</p>
                <p>âI think,â said Lyndall, âthat he is like a thorn-tree, which grows up very
                    quietly, without<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7168-147"/> any one's caring for it, and
                    one day suddenly breaks out into yellow blossoms.â</p>
                <p>âAnd what do you think I am like?â asked Gregory, hopefully.</p>
                <p>Lyndall looked up from her book.</p>
                <p>âLike a little tin duck floating on a dish of water, that comes after a piece of
                    bread stuck on a needle, and the more the needle pricks it the more it comes
                    on.â</p>
                <p>âOh, you <emph>are</emph> making fun of me now, you really are!â said Gregory
                    feeling wretched. âYou <emph>are</emph> making fun, aren't you, now?â</p>
                <p>âPartly. It is always diverting to make comparisons.â</p>
                <p>âYes; but you don't compare me to anything nice, and you do other people. What is
                    Em like, now?â</p>
                <p>âThe accompaniment of a song. She fills up the gaps in other people's lives, and
                    is always number two; but I think she is like many<pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7168-148"/> accompanimentsâa great deal better than the song she
                    is to accompany.â</p>
                <p>âShe is not half so good as you are!â said Gregory, with a burst of
                    uncontrollable ardour.</p>
                <p>âShe is so much better than I, that her little finger has more goodness in it
                    than my whole body. I hope you may not live to find out the truth of that
                    fact.â</p>
                <p>âYou are like an angel,â he said, the blood rushing to his head and face.</p>
                <p>âYes, probably; angels are of many orders.â</p>
                <p>âYou are the one being that I love!â said Gregory quivering; âI thought I loved
                    before, but I know now! Do not be angry with me. I know you could never like me;
                    but, if I might but always be near you to serve you, I would be utterly, utterly
                    happy. I would ask nothing in return! If you could only take everything I have
                    and use it; I want nothing but to see you.â</p>
                <pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7168-149"/>
                <p>âHow do you know,â she said slowly, âthat I would not be willing to marry you if
                    you asked me?â</p>
                <p>He started, and turned his burning face to her.</p>
                <p>âYou are very cruel; you are ridiculing me,â he said.</p>
                <p>âNo, I am not, Gregory. What I am saying is plain, matter-of-fact business. If
                    you are willing to marry me within three weeks' time, I am willing to marry you,
                    if not, not. That is a clear proposal, is it not?â</p>
                <p>He looked up. Was it contempt, loathing, pity, that moved in the eyes above? He
                    could not tell; but he stooped over the little foot and kissed it.</p>
                <p>She smiled.</p>
                <p>âDo you really mean it?â he whispered.</p>
                <p>âYes. You wish to be near me, and to serve me, and to have nothing in return?âyou
                    shall have what you wish. I believe you love me; I<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7168-150"/> too could love so, that to lie under the foot of the
                    thing I loved would be more heaven than to lie in the breast of another.âCome!
                    let us go. Carry the dog,â she added; âhe will not bite you if I put him in your
                    arms. Soâdo not let his foot hang down.â</p>
                <p>They descended the âkopje.â At the bottom, he whispered,â</p>
                <p>âWould you not take my arm? the path is very rough.â</p>
                <p>She rested her fingers lightly on it.</p>
                <p>âI would try to make everything beautiful for you,â he said; âbut now there is
                    not time.â</p>
                <p>âIt does not matter. I may yet change my mind about marrying you before the time
                    comes. Mark you!â she said, turning round on him; âI remember your
                        words:â<hi>You will give everything, and expect nothing.</hi> The knowledge
                    that you are serving me is to be your reward; and you will have that. You will
                    serve me, and greatly.<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7168-151"/> The reasons I have for
                    marrying you I need not inform you of now; you will probably discover some of
                    them before long.â</p>
                <p>âI only want to be of some use to you,â he said.</p>
                <p>It seemed to Gregory that there were pulses in the soles of his feet, and the
                    ground shimmered as on a summer's day. They walked round the foot of the kopje,
                    and past the Kaffir huts. An old Kaffir maid knelt at the door of one grinding
                    mealies. That she should see him walking so made his heart beat so fast that the
                    hand on his arm felt its pulsation. It seemed that she must envy him.</p>
                <p>Just then Em looked out again at the back window and saw them coming. She cried
                    bitterly all the while she sorted the skins.</p>
                <p>But that night when Lyndall had blown her candle out, and half turned round to
                    sleep, the door of Em's bed-room opened.</p>
                <p>âI want to say good night to you, Lyndall,â<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7168-152"/> she
                    said, coming to the bedside and kneeling down.</p>
                <p>âI thought you were asleep,â Lyndall replied.</p>
                <p>âYes, I have been asleep; but I had such a vivid dream,â she said, holding the
                    other's hands, âand that woke me. I never had so vivid a dream before.</p>
                <p>âIt seemed I was a little girl again, and I came somewhere into a large room. On
                    a bed in the corner there was something lying dressed in white, and its little
                    eyes were shut, and its little face was like wax. I thought it was a doll, and I
                    ran forward to take it; but some one held up her finger and said, âHush! it is a
                    little dead baby.â And I said, âOh, I must go and call Lyndall, that she may
                    look at it also.â</p>
                <p>âAnd they put their faces close down to my ear and whispered, âIt is Lyndall's
                    baby.â</p>
                <p>âAnd I said, âShe cannot be grown up yet;<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7168-153"/> she
                    is only a little girl! Where is she?â And I went to look for you, but I could
                    not find you.</p>
                <p>âAnd when I came to some people who were dressed in black, I asked them where you
                    were, and they looked down at their black clothes, and shook their heads, and
                    said nothing; and I could not find you anywhere. And then I woke.</p>
                <p>âLyndall,â she said, putting her face down upon the hands she held, âit made me
                    think about that time when we were little girls and used to play together, when
                    I loved you better than anything else in the world. It isn't any one's fault
                    that they love you; they can't help it. And it isn't your fault; you don't make
                    them love you. I know it.â</p>
                <p>âThank you, dear,â Lyndall said. âIt is nice to be loved, but it would be better
                    to be good.â</p>
                <pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7168-154"/>
                <p>Then they wished good night, and Em went back to her room. Long after Lyndall lay
                    in the dark thinking, thinking, thinking; and as she turned round wearily to
                    sleep she muttered,</p>
                <p>âThere are some wiser in their sleeping than in their waking.â</p>

                <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                <head type="sub">LYNDALL'S STRANGER.</head>
                <p><hi rend="b">A FIRE</hi> is burning in the unused hearth of the cabin. The fuel
                    blazes up, and lights the black rafters, and warms the faded red lions on the
                    quilt, and fills the little room with a glow of warmth and light made brighter
                    by contrast, for outside the night is chill and misty.</p>
                <p>Before the open fire-place sits a stranger, his keen blue eyes studying the fire
                    from beneath delicately-pencilled, drooping eyelids. One white hand plays
                    thoughtfully with a heavy flaxen moustache; yet once he starts, and for an
                    instant the languid lids raise themselves: there is a keen, intent look upon the
                    face as he listens<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7168-156"/> for something. Then he
                    leans back in his chair, fills his glass from the silver flask in his bag, and
                    resumes his old posture.</p>
                <p>Presently the door opens noiselessly. It is Lyndall, followed by Doss. Quietly as
                    she enters, he hears her, and turns.</p>
                <p>âI thought you were not coming.â</p>
                <p>âI waited till all had gone to bed. I could not come before.â</p>
                <p>She removed the shawl that enveloped her, and the stranger rose to offer her his
                    chair; but she took her seat on a low pile of sacks before the window.</p>
                <p>âI hardly see why I should be outlawed after this fashion,â he said, re-seating
                    himself and drawing his chair a little nearer to her; âthese are hardly the
                    quarters one expects to find after travelling a hundred miles in answer to an
                    invitation.â</p>
                <p>âI said, âCome if you wish.ââ</p>
                <pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7168-157"/>
                <p>âAnd I did wish. You give me a cold reception.â</p>
                <p>âI could not take you to the house. Questions would be asked which I could not
                    answer without prevarication.â</p>
                <p>âYour conscience is growing to have a certain virgin tenderness,â he said, in a
                    low, melodious voice.</p>
                <p>âI have no conscience. I spoke one deliberate lie this evening. I said the man
                    who had come looked rough, we had best not have him in the house; therefore I
                    brought him here. It was a deliberate lie, and I hate lies. I tell them if I
                    must, but they hurt me.â</p>
                <p>âWell, you do not tell lies to yourself, at all events. You are candid, so
                    far.â</p>
                <p>She interrupted him.</p>
                <p>âYou got my short letter?â</p>
                <p>âYes; that is why I come. You sent a very<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7168-158"/>
                    foolish reply; you must take it back. Who is this fellow you talk of
                    marrying?â</p>
                <p>âA young farmer.â</p>
                <p>âLives here?â</p>
                <p>âYes; he has gone to town to get things for our wedding.â</p>
                <p>âWhat kind of a fellow is he?â</p>
                <p>âA fool.â</p>
                <p>âAnd you would rather marry him than me?â</p>
                <p>âYes; because you are not one.â</p>
                <p>âThat is a novel reason for refusing to marry a man,â he said, leaning his elbow
                    on the table and watching her keenly.</p>
                <p>âIt is a wise one,â she said shortly. âIf I marry him I shall shake him off my
                    hand when it suits me. It is three weeks since I first talked of marrying him,
                    and he has not once dared to kiss my hand. As far as I wish he should come, he
                    comes, and no further. Would<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7168-159"/> you ask me what
                    you might and what you might not do?â</p>
                <p>Her companion raised the moustache with a caressing movement from his lip and
                    smiled. It was not a question that stood in need of any answer.</p>
                <p>âWhat have you done with the ring I gave you?â he said.</p>
                <p>âSometimes I wear it; then I take it off and wish to throw it into the fire; the
                    next day I put it on again, and sometimes I kiss it.â</p>
                <p>âSo you do love me a little?â</p>
                <p>âIf you were not something more to me than any other man in the world, do you
                    thinkââ she paused. âI love you when I see you; but when you are away from me I
                    hate you.â</p>
                <p>âThen I fear I must be singularly invisible at the present moment,â he said.
                    âPossibly if you were to look less fixedly into the fire you might perceive
                    me.â</p>
                <pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7168-160"/>
                <p>He moved his chair slightly, so as to come between her and the firelight. She
                    raised her eyes to his face.</p>
                <p>âIf you do love me,â he asked her, âwhy will you not marry me?â</p>
                <p>âBecause, if I had been married to you for a year I should have come to my senses
                    and seen that your hands and your voice are like the hands and the voice of any
                    other man. I cannot quite see that now. But it is all madness. You call into
                    activity one part of my nature; there is a higher part that you know nothing of,
                    that you never touch. If I married you, afterwards it would arise and assert
                    itself, and I should hate you always, as I do now sometimes.â</p>
                <p>âI like you when you grow metaphysical and analytical,â he said, leaning his face
                    upon his hand. âGo a little further in your analysis, say, âI love you with the
                    right ventricle of my heart, but not the left, and with the left auricle<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7168-161"/> of my heart, but not the right; and this
                    being the case, my affection for you is not of a duly elevated, intellectual and
                    spiritual nature.â I like you when you get philosophical.â</p>
                <p>She looked quietly at him; he was trying to turn her own weapons against her.</p>
                <p>âYou are acting foolishly, Lyndall,â he said, suddenly changing his manner, and
                    speaking almost earnestly, âmost foolishly. You are acting like a little child;
                    I am surprised at you. It is all very well to have ideals and theories; but you
                    know as well as any one can that they must not be carried into the practical
                    world. I love you. I do not pretend that it is in any high, superhuman sense; I
                    do not say that I should like you as well if you were ugly and deformed, or that
                    I should continue to prize you whatever your treatment of me might be, or to
                    love you though you were a spirit without any body at all. That is
                    sentimentality for beardless boys.<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7168-162"/> Every one
                    not a mere child (and you are not a child, except in years) knows what love
                    between a man and a woman means. I love you with that love. I should not have
                    believed it possible that I could have brought myself twice to ask of any woman
                    to be my wife, more especially one without wealth, without position, and
                    whomââ</p>
                <p>âYesâgo on. Do not grow sorry for me. Say what you were going toââwho has put
                    herself into my power, and who has lost the right of meeting me on equal terms.â
                    Say what you think. At least we two may speak the truth to one another.â</p>
                <p>Then she added after a pause,</p>
                <p>âI believe you do love me, as much as you possibly could love anything; and I
                    believe that when you ask me to marry you, you are performing the most generous
                    act you ever have performed in the course of your life, or ever will; but, at
                    the same time, if I had required your<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7168-163"/>
                    generosity, it would not have been shown me. If, when I got your letter a month
                    ago, hinting at your willingness to marry me, I had at once written, imploring
                    you to come, you would have read the letter. âPoor little Devil!â you would have
                    said, and torn it up. The next week you would have sailed for Europe, and have
                    sent me a check for a hundred and fifty pounds (which I would have thrown in the
                    fire), and I would have heard no more of you.â The stranger smiled. âBut because
                    I declined your proposal, and wrote that in three weeks I should be married to
                    another, then what you call love woke up. Your man's love is a child's love for
                    butterflies. You follow till you have the thing, and break it. If you have
                    broken one wing, and the thing flies still, then you love it more than ever, and
                    follow till you break both; then you are satisfied when it lies still on the
                    ground.â</p>
                <pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7168-164"/>
                <p>âYou are profoundly wise in the ways of the world; you have seen far into life,â
                    he said.</p>
                <p>He might as well have sneered at the firelight.</p>
                <p>âI have seen enough to tell me that you love me because you cannot bear to be
                    resisted, and want to master me. You liked me at first because I treated you and
                    all men with indifference. You resolved to have me because I seemed
                    unattainable. This is all your love means.â</p>
                <p>He felt a strong inclination to stoop down and kiss the little lip that defied
                    him; but he restrained himself. He said quietly,</p>
                <p>âWell, since you will not marry me, may I inquire what your intentions are, the
                    plan you wrote of. You asked me to come and hear it, and I have come.â</p>
                <p>âI said, âCome if you wish.ââIf you agree to it, well; if not, I marry on
                    Monday.â</p>
                <p>âWell?â</p>
                <p>She was still looking beyond him at the fire.</p>
                <pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7168-165"/>
                <p>âI cannot marry you,â she said slowly, âbecause I cannot be tied; but if you
                    wish, you may take me away with you, and take care of me; then when we do not
                    love any more we can say good-bye. I will not go down-country,â she added; âI
                    will not go to Europe. You must take me to the Transvaal. That is out of the
                    world. People we meet there we need not see again in our future lives.â</p>
                <p>âOh, my darling,â he said, bending tenderly, and holding his hand out to her,
                    âwhy will you not give yourself entirely to me? One day you will desert me and
                    go to another.â</p>
                <p>She shook her head without looking at him.</p>
                <p>âNo, life is too long. But I will go with you.â</p>
                <p>âWhen?â</p>
                <p>âTo-morrow. I have told them that before daylight I go to the next farm. I will
                    write from the town and tell them the facts. I do not<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7168-166"/> want them to trouble me; I want to shake myself free
                    of these old surroundings; I want them to lose sight of me. You can understand
                    that is necessary for me.â</p>
                <p>He seemed lost in consideration; then he said,</p>
                <p>âIt is better to have you on those conditions than not at all. If you
                        <emph>will</emph> have it, let it be so.â</p>
                <p>He sat looking at her. On her face was the weary look that rested there so often
                    now when she sat alone. Two months had not passed since they parted; but the
                    time had set its mark on her. He looked at her carefully, from the brown, smooth
                    head to the little crossed feet on the floor. A worn look had grown over the
                    little face, and it made its charm for him stronger. For pain and time, which
                    trace deep lines and write a story on a human face, have a strangely different
                    effect on one face and another.<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7168-167"/> The face that
                    is only fair, even very fair, they mar and flaw; but to the face whose beauty is
                    the harmony between that which speaks from within and the form through which it
                    speaks, power is added by all that causes the outer man to bear more deeply the
                    impress of the inner. The pretty woman fades with the roses on her cheeks, and
                    the girlhood that lasts an hour; the beautiful woman finds her fulness of bloom
                    only when a past has written itself on her, and her power is then most
                    irresistible when it seems going.</p>
                <p>From under their half-closed lids the keen eyes looked down at her. Her shoulders
                    were bent; for a moment the little figure had forgotten its queenly bearing, and
                    drooped wearily; the wide, dark eyes watched the fire very softly.</p>
                <p>It certainly was not in her power to resist him, nor any strength in her that
                    made his own at that moment grow soft as he looked at her.</p>
                <pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7168-168"/>
                <p>He touched one little hand that rested on her knee.</p>
                <p>âPoor little thing!â he said; âyou are only a child.â</p>
                <p>She did not draw her hand away from his, and looked up at him.</p>
                <p>âYou are very tired?â</p>
                <p>âYes.â</p>
                <p>She looked into his eyes as a little child might whom a long day's play had
                    saddened.</p>
                <p>He lifted her gently up, and sat her on his knee.</p>
                <p>âPoor little thing!â he said.</p>
                <p>She turned her face to his shoulder, and buried it against his neck; he wound his
                    strong arm about her, and held her close to him. When she had sat for a long
                    while, he drew with his hand the face down, and held it against his arm. He
                    kissed it, and then put it back in its old resting-place.</p>
                <pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7168-169"/>
                <p>âDon't you want to talk to me?â</p>
                <p>âNo.â</p>
                <p>âHave you forgotten the night in the avenue?â</p>
                <p>He could feel that she shook her head.</p>
                <p>âDo you want to be quiet now?â</p>
                <p>âYes.â</p>
                <p>They sat quite still, excepting that only sometimes he raised her fingers softly
                    to his mouth.</p>
                <p>Doss, who had been asleep in the corner, waking suddenly, planted himself before
                    them, his wiry legs moving nervously, his yellow eyes filled with anxiety. He
                    was not at all sure that she was not being retained in her present position
                    against her will, and was not a little relieved when she sat up and held out her
                    hand for the shawl.</p>
                <p>âI must go,â she said.</p>
                <p>The stranger wrapped the shawl very carefully about her.</p>
                <pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7168-170"/>
                <p>âKeep it close around your face, Lyndall; it is very damp outside. Shall I walk
                    with you to the house?â</p>
                <p>âNo. Lie down and rest; I will come and wake you at three o'clock.â</p>
                <p>She lifted her face that he might kiss it, and, when he had kissed it once, she
                    still held it that he might kiss it again. Then he let her out. He had seated
                    himself at the fire-place, when she re-opened the door.</p>
                <p>âHave you forgotten anything?â</p>
                <p>âNo.â</p>
                <p>She gave one long, lingering look at the old room. When she was gone, and the
                    door shut, the stranger filled his glass, and sat at the table sipping it
                    thoughtfully.</p>
                <p>The night outside was misty and damp; the faint moonlight, trying to force its
                    way through the thick air, made darkly visible the outlines of the buildings.
                    The stones and walls were moist,<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7168-171"/> and now and
                    then a drop, slowly collecting, fell from the eaves to the ground. Doss, not
                    liking the change from the cabin's warmth, ran quickly to the kitchen door-step;
                    but his mistress walked slowly past him, and took her way up the winding
                    foot-path that ran beside the stone wall of the camps. When she came to the end
                    of the last camp, she threaded her way among the stones and bushes till she
                    reached the German's grave. Why she had come there she hardly knew; she stood
                    looking down. Suddenly she bent and put one hand on the face of a wet stone.</p>
                <p>âI shall never come to you again,â she said.</p>
                <p>Then she knelt on the ground, and leaned her face upon the stones.</p>
                <p>âDear old man, good old man, I am so tired!â she said (for we will come to the
                    dead to tell secrets we would never have told to the living). âI am so tired.
                    There is light, there<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7168-172"/> is warmth,â she wailed;
                    âwhy am I alone, so hard, so cold? I am so weary of myself! It is eating my soul
                    to its core,âself, self, self! I cannot bear this life! I cannot breathe, I
                    cannot live! Will nothing free me from myself?â She pressed her cheek against
                    the wooden post. âI want to love! I want something great and pure to lift me to
                    itself! Dear old man, I cannot bear it any more! I am so cold, so hard, so hard;
                    will no one help me?â</p>
                <p>The water gathered slowly on her shawl, and fell on to the wet stones; but she
                    lay there crying bitterly. For so the living soul will cry to the dead, and the
                    creature to its God; and of all this crying there comes nothing. The lifting up
                    of the hands brings no salvation; redemption is from within, and neither from
                    God nor man; it is wrought out by the soul itself, with suffering and through
                    time.</p>
                <p>Doss, on the kitchen door-step, shivered, and<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7168-173"/>
                    wondered where his mistress stayed so long; and once, sitting sadly there in the
                    damp, he had dropped asleep, and dreamed that old Otto gave him a piece of
                    bread, and patted him on the head, and when he woke his teeth chattered, and he
                    moved to another stone to see if it was drier. At last he heard his mistress's
                    step, and they went into the house together. She lit a candle, and walked to the
                    Boer-woman's bed-room. On a nail under the lady in pink hung the key of the
                    wardrobe. She took it down and opened the great press. From a little drawer she
                    took fifty pounds (all she had in the world), relocked the door, and turned to
                    hang up the key. The marks of tears were still on her face, but she smiled.</p>
                <p>âFifty pounds for a lover! A noble reward!â she said, and opened the wardrobe and
                    returned the notes to the drawer.</p>
                <p>Once in her own room, she arranged the<pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7168-174"/> few
                    articles she intended to take to-morrow, burnt her old letters, and then went
                    back to the front-room to look at the time. There were two hours yet before she
                    must call him. She sat down at the dressing-table to wait, and leaned her elbows
                    on it, and buried her face in her hands. The glass reflected the little brown
                    head with its even parting, and the tiny hands on which it rested. Presently she
                    looked up. The large, dark eyes from the glass looked back at her. She looked
                    deep into them.</p>
                <p>âWe are all alone, you and I,â she whispered; âno one helps us, no one
                    understands us; but we will help ourselves.â The eyes looked back at her. There
                    was a world of assurance in their still depths. So they had looked at her ever
                    since she could remember, when it was but a small child's face above a blue
                    pinafore they had looked from. âWe shall never be quite alone,<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7168-175"/> you and I,â she said; âwe shall always be together,
                    as we were when we were little.â</p>
                <p>The beautiful eyes looked into the depths of her soul.</p>
                <p>âWe are not afraid; we will help ourselves!â she said. She stretched out her hand
                    and pressed it over them on the glass. âDear eyes! we will never be quite alone
                    till they part us;âtill then!â</p>

                <head type="sub">GREGORY ROSE HAS AN IDEA.</head>
                <p><hi rend="b">GREGORY ROSE</hi> was in the loft putting it neat. Outside the rain
                    poured; a six months' drought had broken, and the thirsty plain was drenched
                    with water. What it could not swallow ran off in mad rivulets to the great
                    âsloot,â that now foamed like an angry river across the flat. Even the little
                    furrow between the farmhouse and the kraals was now a stream, knee-deep, which
                    almost bore away the Kaffir-women who crossed it. It had rained for twenty-four
                    hours, and still the rain poured on. The fowls had collectedâa melancholy
                    crowdâin and about the waggon-house, and the<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7168-177"/>
                    solitary gander, who alone had survived the six months' want of water, walked
                    hither and thither, printing his webbed foot-marks on the mud, to have them
                    washed out the next instant by the pelting rain, which at eleven o'clock still
                    beat on the walls and roofs with unabated ardour.</p>
                <p>Gregory, as he worked in the loft, took no notice of it beyond stuffing a sack
                    into the broken pane to keep it out; and, in spite of the pelt and patter, Em's
                    clear voice might be heard through the open trap-door from the dining room,
                    where she sat at work, singing the âBlue Waterââ <q>
                        <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                            <l>âAnd take me away,</l>
                            <l>And take me away,</l>
                            <l>And take me away,</l>
                            <l>To the Blue Waterââ</l>
                        </lg>
                    </q> that quaint, childish song of the people, that has a world of sweetness,
                    and sad, vague yearning when sung over and over dreamily by a woman's voice as
                    she sits alone at her work.<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7168-178"/> But Gregory heard
                    neither that nor yet the loud laughter of the Kaffir maids, that every now and
                    again broke through from the kitchen, where they joked and worked. Of late
                    Gregory had grown strangely impervious to the sounds and sights about him. His
                    lease had run out, but Em had said, âDo not renew it; I need one to help me;
                    just stay on.â And, she had added, âYou must not remain in your own little
                    house; live with me; you can look after my ostriches better so.â</p>
                <p>And Gregory did not thank her. What difference did it make to him, paying rent or
                    not, living there or not; it was all one. But yet he came. Em wished that he
                    would still sometimes talk of the strength of the master-right of man; but
                    Gregory was as one smitten on the cheek-bone. She might do what she pleased, he
                    would find no fault, had no word to say. He had forgotten that it is man's right
                    to rule. On that<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7168-179"/> rainy morning he had lighted
                    his pipe at the kitchen fire, and when breakfast was over stood in the front
                    door watching the water rush down the road till the pipe died out in his mouth.
                    Em saw she must do something for him, and found him a large calico duster. He
                    had sometimes talked of putting the loft neat, and to-day she could find nothing
                    else for him to do. So she had the ladder put to the trap-door that he need not
                    go out in the wet, and Gregory with the broom and duster mounted to the loft.
                    Once at work he worked hard. He dusted down the very rafters, and cleaned the
                    broken candle moulds and bent forks that had stuck in the thatch for twenty
                    years. He placed the black bottles neatly in rows on an old box in the corner,
                    and piled the skins on one another, and sorted the rubbish in all the boxes; and
                    at eleven o'clock his work was almost done. He seated himself on the
                    packing-case which had<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7168-180"/> once held Waldo's
                    books, and proceeded to examine the contents of another which he had not yet
                    looked at. It was carelessly nailed down. He loosened one plank, and began to
                    lift out various articles of female attireâold-fashioned caps, aprons, dresses
                    with long pointed bodies such as he remembered to have seen his mother wear when
                    he was a little child. He shook them out carefully to see there were no moths,
                    and then sat down to fold them up again one by one. They had belonged to Em's
                    mother, and the box, as packed at her death, had stood untouched and forgotten
                    these long years. She must have been a tall woman, that mother of Em's, for when
                    he stood up to shake out a dress the neck was on a level with his, and the skirt
                    touched the ground. Gregory laid a night-cap out on his knee, and began rolling
                    up the strings; but presently his fingers moved slower and slower, then his chin
                    rested on his breast, and<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7168-181"/> finally the
                    imploring blue eyes were fixed on the frill abstractedly. When Em's voice called
                    to him from the foot of the ladder he started, and threw the nightcap behind
                    him.</p>
                <p>She was only come to tell him that his cup of soup was ready; and, when he could
                    hear that she was gone, he picked up the night-cap again, and a great brown
                    sun-âkapjeââjust such a âkapjeâ and such a dress as one of those he remembered
                    to have seen a sister-of-mercy wear. Gregory's mind was very full of thought. He
                    took down a fragment of an old looking-glass from behind a beam, and put the
                    âkapjeâ on. His beard looked somewhat grotesque under it; he put up his hand to
                    hide itâthat was better. The blue eyes looked out with the mild gentleness that
                    became eyes looking out from under a âkapje.â Next he took the brown dress, and,
                    looking round furtively, slipped it over his head. He had just got his arms in
                    the sleeves, and was<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7168-182"/> trying to hook up the
                    back, when an increase in the patter of the rain at the window made him drag it
                    off hastily. When he perceived there was no one coming he tumbled the things
                    back into the box, and, covering it carefully, went down the ladder.</p>
                <p>Em was still at her work, trying to adjust a new needle in the machine. Gregory
                    drank his soup, and then sat before her, an awful and mysterious look in his
                    eyes.</p>
                <p>âI am going to town to-morrow,â he said.</p>
                <p>âI'm almost afraid you won't be able to go,â said Em, who was intent on her
                    needle; âI don't think it is going to leave off to-day.â</p>
                <p>âI am going,â said Gregory.</p>
                <p>Em looked up.</p>
                <p>âBut the âslootsâ are as full as rivers; you cannot go. We can wait for the
                    post,â she said.</p>
                <p>âI am not going for the post,â said Gregory, impressively.</p>
                <pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7168-183"/>
                <p>Em looked for explanation; none came.</p>
                <p>âWhen will you be back?â</p>
                <p>âI am not coming back.â</p>
                <p>âAre you going to your friends?â</p>
                <p>Gregory waited, then caught her by the wrist.</p>
                <p>âLook here, Em,â he said between his teeth, âI can't stand it any more. I am
                    going to her.â</p>
                <p>Since that day, when he had come home and found Lyndall gone, he had never talked
                    of her; but Em knew who it was who needed to be spoken of by no name.</p>
                <p>She said, when he had released her hand,</p>
                <p>âBut you do not know where she is?â</p>
                <p>âYes, I do. She was in Bloemfontein when I heard last. I will go there, and I
                    will find out where she went then, and then, and then! I will have her.â</p>
                <pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7168-184"/>
                <p>Em turned the wheel quickly, and the ill-adjusted needle sprung into twenty
                    fragments.</p>
                <p>âGregory,â she said, âshe does not want us; she told us so clearly in the letter
                    she wrote.â A flush rose on her face as she spoke. âIt will only be pain to you,
                    Gregory. Will she like to have you near her?â</p>
                <p>There was an answer he might have made, but it was his secret, and he did not
                    choose to share it. He said only,</p>
                <p>âI am going.â</p>
                <p>âWill you be gone long, Gregory?â</p>
                <p>âI do not know; perhaps I shall never come back. Do what you please with my
                    things. I cannot stay here!â</p>
                <p>He rose from his seat.</p>
                <p>âPeople say, forget, forget!â he cried, pacing the room. âThey are mad! they are
                    fools! Do they say so to men who are dying of thirstâforget, forget? Why is it
                    only to us they say<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7168-185"/> so? It is a lie to say
                    that time makes it easy; it is afterward, afterward that it eats in at your
                    heart!</p>
                <p>âAll these months,â he cried bitterly, âI have lived here quietly, day after day,
                    as if I cared for what I ate, and what I drank, and what I did! I care for
                    nothing! I cannot bear it! I will not! Forget! forget!â ejaculated Gregory. âYou
                    can forget all the world, but you cannot forget yourself. When one thing is more
                    to you than yourself, how are you to forget it?</p>
                <p>âI read,â he saidââyes; and then I come to a word she used, and it is all back
                    with me again! I go to count my sheep, and I see her face before me, and I stand
                    and let the sheep run by. I look at you, and in your smile, a something at the
                    corner of your lips, I see her. How can I forget her when, whenever I turn, she
                    is there, and not there? I cannot, I will not, live where I do not see her.</p>
                <pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7168-186"/>
                <p>âI know what you think,â he said, turning upon her. âYou think I am mad; you
                    think I am going to see whether she will not like me! I am not so foolish. I
                    should have known at first she never could suffer me. Who am I, what am I, that
                    she should look at me? It was right that she left me; right that she should not
                    look at me. If any one says it is not, it is a lie! I am not going to speak to
                    her,â he addedââonly to see her; only to stand sometimes in a place where she
                    has stood before.â</p>

                <head type="sub">AN UNFINISHED LETTER.</head>
                <p><hi rend="b">GREGORY ROSE</hi> had been gone seven months. Em sat alone on a
                    white sheepskin before the fire.</p>
                <p>The August night-wind, weird and shrill, howled round the chimneys and through
                    the crannies, and in walls and doors, and uttered a long low cry as it forced
                    its way among the clefts of the stones on the âkopje.â It was a wild night. The
                    prickly pear tree, stiff and upright as it held its arms, felt the wind's might,
                    and knocked its flat leaves heavily together, till great branches broke off. The
                    Kaffirs, as they slept in their straw huts,<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7168-188"/>
                    whispered one to another that before morning there would not be an armful of
                    thatch left on the roofs; and the beams of the waggon-house creaked and groaned
                    as if it were heavy work to resist the importunity of the wind.</p>
                <p>Em had not gone to bed. Who could sleep on a night like this? So in the dining
                    room she had lighted a fire, and sat on the ground before it, turning the
                    roaster-cakes that lay on the coals to bake. It would save work in the morning;
                    and she blew out the light because the wind through the window-chinks made it
                    flicker and run; and she sat singing to herself as she watched the cakes. They
                    lay at one end of the wide hearth on a bed of coals, and at the other end a fire
                    burnt up steadily, casting its amber glow over Em's light hair and black dress,
                    with the ruffle of crape about the neck, and over the white curls of the
                    sheepskin on which she sat.</p>
                <p>Louder and more fiercely yet howled the<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7168-189"/> storm;
                    but Em sang on, and heard nothing but the words of her song, and heard them only
                    faintly, as something restful. It was an old, childish song she had often heard
                    her mother sing long agoâ <q>
                        <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                            <l>âWhere the reeds dance by the river,</l>
                            <l>Where the willow's song is said,</l>
                            <l>On the face of the morning water,</l>
                            <l>Is reflected a white flower's head.â</l>
                        </lg>
                    </q></p>
                <p>She folded her hands and sang the next verse dreamilyâ <q>
                        <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                            <l>âWhere the reeds shake by the river,</l>
                            <l>Where the moonlight's sheen is shed,</l>
                            <l>On the face of the sleeping water,</l>
                            <l>Two leaves of a white flower float dead.</l>
                            <l rend="ti-4">Dead, dead, dead!â</l>
                        </lg>
                    </q></p>
                <p>She echoed the refrain softly till it died away, and then repeated it. It was as
                    if, unknown to herself, it harmonized with the pictures and thoughts that sat
                    with her there alone in the firelight. She turned the cakes over, while the<pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7168-190"/> wind hurled down a row of bricks from the
                    gable, and made the walls tremble.</p>
                <p>Presently she paused and listened; there was a sound as of something knocking at
                    the back-doorway. But the wind had raised its level higher, and she went on with
                    her work. At last the sound was repeated. Then she rose, lit the candle and the
                    fire, and went to see. Only to satisfy herself, she said, that nothing could be
                    out on such a night.</p>
                <p>She opened the door a little way, and held the light behind her to defend it from
                    the wind. The figure of a tall man stood there, and before she could speak he
                    had pushed his way in, and was forcing the door to close behind him.</p>
                <p>âWaldo!â she cried in astonishment.</p>
                <p>He had been gone more than a year and a half.</p>
                <p>âYou did not expect to see me,â he answered, as he turned toward her; âI should
                    have slept in the out-house, and not troubled you to-night;<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7168-191"/> but through the shutter I saw glimmerings of a
                    light.â</p>
                <p>âCome in to the fire,â she said; âit is a terrific night for any creature to be
                    out. Shall we not go and fetch your things in first?â she added.</p>
                <p>âI have nothing but this,â he said, motioning to the little bundle in his
                    hand.</p>
                <p>âYour horse?â</p>
                <p>âIs dead.â</p>
                <p>He sat down on the bench before the fire.</p>
                <p>âThe cakes are almost ready,â she said; âI will get you something to eat. Where
                    have you been wandering all this while?â</p>
                <p>âUp and down, up and down,â he answered wearily; âand now the whim has seized me
                    to come back here. Em,â he said, putting his hand on her arm as she passed him,
                    âhave you heard from Lyndall lately?â</p>
                <p>âYes,â said Em, turning quickly from him.</p>
                <pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7168-192"/>
                <p>âWhere is she? I had one letter from her, but that is almost eighteen months ago
                    nowâjust when she left. Where is she?â</p>
                <p>âIn the Transvaal. I will go and get you some supper; we can talk afterward.â</p>
                <p>âCan you give me her exact address? I want to write to her.â</p>
                <p>But Em had gone into the next room.</p>
                <p>When food was on the table she knelt down before the fire, turning the cakes,
                    babbling restlessly, eagerly, now of this, now of that. She was glad to see
                    himâTant' Sannie was coming soon to show her her new babyâhe must stay on the
                    farm now, and help her. And Waldo himself was well content to eat his meal in
                    silence, asking no more questions.</p>
                <p>âGregory is coming back next week,â she said; âhe will have been gone just a
                    hundred and three days to-morrow. I had a letter from him yesterday.â</p>
                <pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7168-193"/>
                <p>âWhere has he been?â</p>
                <p>But his companion stooped to lift a cake from the fire.</p>
                <p>âHow the wind blows! One can hardly hear one's own voice,â she said. âTake this
                    warm cake; no one's cakes are like mine. Why, you have eaten nothing!â</p>
                <p>âI am a little weary,â he said; âthe wind was mad to-night.â</p>
                <p>He folded his arms, and rested his head against the fire-place, whilst she
                    removed the dishes from the table. On the mantel-piece stood an ink-pot and some
                    sheets of paper. Presently he took them down and turned up the corner of the
                    table-cloth.</p>
                <p>âI will write a few lines,â he said; âtill you are ready to sit down and
                    talk.â</p>
                <p>Em, as she shook out the table-cloth, watched him bending intently over his
                    paper. He had changed much. His face had grown<pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7168-194"/>
                    thinner; his cheeks were almost hollow, though they were covered by a dark
                    growth of beard.</p>
                <p>She sat down on the skin beside him, and felt the little bundle on the bench; it
                    was painfully small and soft. Perhaps it held a shirt and a book, but nothing
                    more. The old black hat had a piece of unhemmed muslin twisted round it, and on
                    his elbow was a large patch so fixed on with yellow thread that her woman's
                    heart ached. Only his hair was not changed, and hung in silky beautiful waves
                    almost to his shoulders. To-morrow she would take the ragged edge off his
                    collar, and put a new band round his hat. She did not interrupt him, but she
                    wondered how it was that he sat to write so intently after his long weary walk.
                    He was not tired now; his pen hurried quickly and restlessly over the paper, and
                    his eye was bright. Presently Em raised her hand to her breast, where lay the
                    letter yesterday had brought<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7168-195"/> her. Soon she had
                    forgotten him, as entirely as he had forgotten her; each was in his own world
                    with his own. He was writing to Lyndall. He would tell her all he had seen, all
                    he had done, though it were nothing worth relating. He seemed to have come back
                    to her, and to be talking to her now he sat there in the old house.</p>
                <p>ââ and then I got to the next town, and my horse was tired, so I could go no
                    further, and looked for work. A shop-keeper agreed to hire me as salesman. He
                    made me sign a promise to remain six months, and he gave me a little empty room
                    at the back of the store to sleep in. I had still three pounds of my own, and
                    when you just come from the country three pounds seems a great deal.</p>
                <p>âWhen I had been in the shop three days I wanted to go away again. A clerk in a
                    shop has the lowest work to do of all the people. It is<pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7168-196"/> much better to break stones; you have the blue sky
                    above you, and only the stones to bend to. I asked my master to let me go, and I
                    offered to give him my two pounds, and the bag of mealies I had bought with the
                    other pound; but he would not.</p>
                <p>âI found out afterward he was only giving me half as much as he gave to the
                    othersâthat was why. I had fear when I looked at the other clerks that I would
                    at last become like them. All day they were bowing and smirking to the women who
                    came in; smiling, when all they wanted was to get their money from them. They
                    used to run and fetch the dresses and ribbons to show them, and they seemed to
                    me like worms with oil on. There was one respectable thing in that storeâit was
                    the Kaffir storeman. His work was to load and unload, and he never needed to
                    smile except when he liked, and he never told lies.</p>
                <pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7168-197"/>
                <p>âThe other clerks gave me the name of Old Salvation; but there was one person I
                    liked very much. He was clerk in another store. He often went past the door. He
                    seemed to me not like othersâhis face was bright and fresh like a little
                    child's. When he came to the shop I felt I liked him. One day I saw a book in
                    his pocket, and that, made me feel near him. I asked him if he was fond of
                    reading, and he said, yes, when there was nothing else to do. The next day he
                    came to me, and asked me if I did not feel lonely; he never saw me going out
                    with the other fellows; he would come and see me that evening, he said.</p>
                <p>âI was glad, and bought some meat and flour, because the grey mare and I always
                    ate mealies; it is the cheapest thing; and if you boil it hard you can't eat
                    much of it. I made some cakes, and I folded my great coat on the box to make it
                    softer for him; and at last he came.</p>
                <pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7168-198"/>
                <p>ââYou've got a rummy place here,â he said.</p>
                <p>âYou see there was nothing in it but packing-cases for furniture, and it was
                    rather empty. While I was putting the food on the box he looked at my books; he
                    read their names out aloud. âElementary Physiology,â âFirst Principles.â</p>
                <p>ââGolly!â he said; âI've got a lot of dry stuff like that at home I got for
                    Sunday School prizes; but I only keep them to light my pipe with now; they come
                    in handy for that.â Then he asked me if I had ever read a book called the
                    âBlack-eyed Creole.â âThat is the style for me,â he said; âthere where the
                    fellow takes the nigger-girl by the arm, and the other fellow cuts it off!
                    That's what I like.â</p>
                <p>âBut what he said after that I don't remember, only it made me feel as if I were
                    having a bad dream, and I wanted to be far away.</p>
                <p>âWhen he had finished eating he did not<pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7168-199"/> stay
                    long; he had to go and see some girls home from a prayer-meeting; and he asked
                    how it was he never saw me walking out with any on Sunday afternoons. He said he
                    had lots of sweethearts, and he was going to see one the next Wednesday on a
                    farm, and he asked me to lend my mare. I told him she was very old. But he said
                    it didn't matter; he would come the next day to fetch her.</p>
                <p>âAfter he was gone my little room got back to its old look. I loved it so; I was
                    so glad to get into it at night, and it seemed to be reproaching me for bringing
                    him there. The next day he took the grey mare. On Thursday he did not bring her
                    back, and on Friday I found the saddle and bridle standing at my door.</p>
                <p>âIn the afternoon he looked into the shop, and called out,</p>
                <p>ââHope you got your saddle, Farber. Your bag-of-bones kicked out six miles from
                    here. I'll send you a couple of shillings to-morrow,<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7168-200"/> though the old hide wasn't worth it. Good
                    morning.â</p>
                <p>âBut I sprung over the counter, and got him by his throat. My father was so
                    gentle with her; he never would ride her up-hill, and now this fellow had
                    murdered her! I asked him where he had killed her, and I shook him till he
                    slipped out of my hand. He stood in the door grinning.</p>
                <p>ââIt didn't take much to kill <emph>that</emph> bag-of-bones, whose master sleeps
                    in a packing-case, and waits till his company's finished to eat on the plate.
                    Shouldn't wonder if you fed her on sugar-bags,â he said; âand if you think I've
                    jumped her, you'd better go and look yourself. You'll find her along the road by
                    the âaas-vogelsâ that are eating her.â</p>
                <p>âI caught him by his collar, and I lifted him from the ground, and I threw him
                    out into the street, half-way across it. I heard the book-keeper say to the
                    clerk that there was always<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7168-201"/> the devil in those
                    mum fellows; but they never called me Salvation after that.</p>
                <p>âI am writing to you of very small things, but there is nothing else to tell; it
                    has been all small and you will like it. Whenever anything has happened I have
                    always thought I would tell it to you. The back thought in my mind is always
                    you. After that only one old man came to visit me. I had seen him in the streets
                    often; he always wore very dirty black clothes, and a hat with crape round it,
                    and he had one eye, so I noticed him. One day he came to my room with a
                    subscription-list for a minister's salary. When I said I had nothing to give he
                    looked at me with his one eye.</p>
                <p>ââYoung man,â he said, âhow is it I never see you in the house of the Lord?â I
                    thought he was trying to do good, so I felt sorry for him, and I told him I
                    never went to chapel. âYoung man,â he said, âit grieves me to hear such<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7168-202"/> godless words from the lips of one so
                    youngâso far gone in the paths of destruction. Young man, if you forget God, God
                    will forget you. There is a seat on the right hand side as you go at the bottom
                    door that you may get. If you are given over to the enjoyment and frivolities of
                    this world, what will become of your never-dying soul?â</p>
                <p>âHe would not go till I gave him half-a-crown for the minister's salary.
                    Afterward I heard he was the man who collected the pew-rents, and got a per
                    centage. I didn't get to know any one else.</p>
                <p>âWhen my time in that shop was done I hired myself to drive one of a
                    transport-rider's waggons.</p>
                <p>âThat first morning, when I sat in the front and called to my oxen, and saw
                    nothing about me but the hills with the blue coming down to them, and the karroo
                    bushes, I was drunk; I laughed; my heart was throbbing till it hurt<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7168-203"/> me. I shut my eyes tight, that when I opened them I
                    might see there were no shelves about me. There must be a beauty in buying and
                    selling, if there is beauty in everything: but it is very ugly to me. My life as
                    transport-rider would have been the best life in the world if I had had only one
                    waggon to drive. My master told me he would drive one, I the other, and he would
                    hire another person to drive the third. But the first day I drove two to help
                    him, and after that he let me drive all three. Whenever we came to an hotel he
                    stopped behind to get a drink, and when he rode up to the waggons he could never
                    stand; the Hottentot and I used to lift him up. We always travelled all night,
                    and used to âout-spanâ for five or six hours in the heat of the day to rest. I
                    planned that I would lie under a waggon and read for an hour or two every day
                    before I went to sleep, and I did for the first<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7168-204"/> two or three; but after that I only wanted to sleep, like the rest, and I
                    packed my books away. When you have three waggons to look after all night, you
                    are sometimes so tired you can hardly stand. At first when I walked along
                    driving my waggons in the night it was glorious; the stars had never looked so
                    beautiful to me; and on the dark nights when we rode through the bush there were
                    will-o'-the-wisps dancing on each side of the road. I found out that even the
                    damp and dark are beautiful. But I soon changed, and saw nothing but the road
                    and my oxen. I only wished for a smooth piece of road, so that I might sit at
                    the front and doze. At the places where we âout-spannedâ there were sometimes
                    rare plants and flowers, the festoons hanging from the bush-trees, nuts and
                    insects, such as we never see here; but after a little while I never looked at
                    themâI was too tired. I ate as much as I could, and then lay down on my<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7168-205"/> face under the waggon till the boy came to
                    wake me to âin-span,â and then we drove on again all night; so it went, so it
                    went. I think sometimes when I walked by my oxen I called to them in my sleep,
                    for I know I thought of nothing; I was like an animal. My body was strong and
                    well to work, but my brain was dead. If you have not felt it, Lyndall, you
                    cannot understand it. You may work, and work, and work, till you are only a
                    body, not a soul. Now, when I see one of those evil-looking men that come from
                    Europeânavvies, with the beast-like, sunken face, different from any Kaffir'sâI
                    know what brought that look into their eyes; and if I have only one inch of
                    tobacco I give them half. It is work, grinding, mechanical work, that they or
                    their ancestors have done, that has made them into beasts. You may work a man's
                    body so that his soul dies. Work is good. I have worked at the old farm from
                        the<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7168-206"/> sun's rising till its setting, but I
                    have had time to think, and time to feel. You may work a man so that all but the
                    animal in him is gone; and that grows stronger with physical labour. You may
                    work a man till he is a brute. I know it, because I have felt it. You will never
                    understand the change that came over me. No one but I will ever know how great
                    it was. But I was never miserable; when I could keep my oxen from sticking fast,
                    and when I could find a place to lie down in, I had all I wanted. After I had
                    driven eight months a rainy season came. For eighteen hours out of the
                    twenty-four we worked in the wet. The mud went up to the axles sometimes, and we
                    had to dig the wheels out, and we never went far in a day. My master swore at me
                    more than ever, but when he had done he always offered me his brandy-flask. When
                    I first came he had offered it me, and I had always refused; but now I<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7168-207"/> drank as my oxen did when I gave them
                    waterâwithout thinking. At last I bought brandy for myself whenever we passed an
                    hotel.</p>
                <p>âOne Sunday we âout-spannedâ on the banks of a swollen river to wait for its
                    going down. It was drizzling still, so I lay under the waggon on the mud. There
                    was no dry place anywhere; and all the dung was wet, so there was no fire to
                    cook food. My little flask was filled with brandy, and I drank some and went to
                    sleep. When I woke it was drizzling still, so I drank some more. I was stiff and
                    cold; and my master, who lay by me, offered me his flask, because mine was
                    empty. I drank some, and then I thought I would go and see if the river was
                    going down. I remember that I walked to the road, and it seemed to be going away
                    from me. When I woke up I was lying by a little bush on the bank of the river.
                    It was afternoon; all the clouds had gone, and the<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7168-208"/> sky was deep blue. The Bushman-boy was grilling ribs
                    at the fire. He looked at me and grinned from ear to ear. âMaster was a little
                    nice,â he said, âand lay down in the road. Something might ride over master, so
                    I carried him there.â He grinned at me again. It was as though he said, âYou and
                    I are comrades. I have lain in a road, too. I know all about it.â When I turned
                    my head from him I saw the earth, so pure after the rain, so green, so fresh, so
                    blue;âand I was a drunken carrier, whom his leader had picked up in the mud, and
                    laid at the roadside to sleep out his drunken booze. I remember my old life, and
                    I remember you. I saw how, one day, you would read in the papersââA German
                    Carrier, named Waldo Farber, was killed through falling from his waggon, being
                    instantly crushed under the wheel. Deceased was supposed to have been drunk at
                    the time of the accident.â There<pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7168-209"/> are those
                    notices in the paper every month. I sat up, and I took the brandy-flask out of
                    my pocket, and I flung it as far as I could into the dark water. The Hottentot
                    boy ran down to see if he could catch it; it had sunk to the bottom. I never
                    drank again. But, Lyndall, sin looks much more terrible to those who look at it
                    than to those who do it. A convict, or a man who drinks, seems something so far
                    off and horrible when we see him; but to himself he seems quite near to us, and
                    like us. We wonder what kind of a creature he is; but he is just we, ourselves.
                    We are only the wood, the knife that carves on us is the circumstance.</p>
                <p>âI do not know why I kept on working so hard for that master. I think it was as
                    the oxen come every day and stand by the yokes; they do not know why. Perhaps I
                    would have been with him still; but one day we started with<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7168-210"/> loads for the Diamond Fields. The oxen were very thin
                    now, and they had been standing about in the yoke all day without food, while
                    the waggons were being loaded. Not far from the town was a hill. When we came to
                    the foot the first waggon stuck fast. I tried for a little while to urge the
                    oxen, but I soon saw the one âspanâ could never pull it up. I went to the other
                    waggon to loosen that âspanâ to join them on in front, but the transport-rider,
                    who was lying at the back of the waggon, jumped out.</p>
                <p>ââThey shall bring it up the hill; and if half of them die for it they shall do
                    it alone,â he said.</p>
                <p>âHe was not drunk, but in bad temper, for he had been drunk the night before. He
                    swore at me, and told me to take the whip and help him. We tried for a little
                    time, then I told him it was no use, they could never do it. He swore louder and
                    called to the leaders to come on with their whips, and<pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7168-211"/> together they lashed. There was one ox, a black ox,
                    so thin that the ridge of his backbone almost cut through his flesh.</p>
                <p>ââIt is you, devil, is it, that will not pull?â the transport-rider said. âI will
                    show you something.â He glowered like a devil.</p>
                <p>âHe told the boys to leave off flogging, and he held the ox by the horn, and took
                    up a round stone and knocked its nose with it till the blood came. When he had
                    done they called to the oxen and took up their whips again, and the oxen
                    strained with their backs bent, but the waggon did not move an inch.</p>
                <p>ââSo you won't, won't you?â he said. âI'll help you.â</p>
                <p>âHe took out his clasp-knife, and ran it into the leg of the trembling ox three
                    times, up to the hilt. Then he put the knife in his pocket, and they took their
                    whips. The oxen's flanks quivered, and they foamed at the mouth.<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7168-212"/> Straining, they moved the waggon a few feet forward,
                    then stood with bent backs to keep it from sliding back. From the black ox's
                    nostrils foam and blood were streaming on to the ground. It turned its head in
                    its anguish and looked at me with its great starting eyes. It was praying for
                    help in its agony and weakness, and they took their whips again. The creature
                    bellowed aloud. If there is a God, it was calling to its Maker for help. Then a
                    stream of clear blood burst from both nostrils; it fell on to the ground, and
                    the waggon slipped back. The man walked up to it.</p>
                <p>ââYou are going to lie down, devil, are you? We'll see you don't take it too
                    easy.â</p>
                <p>âThe thing was just dying. He opened his clasp-knife and stooped down over it. I
                    do not know what I did then. But afterward I know I had him on the stones, and I
                    was kneeling on him. The boys dragged me off. I wish they<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7168-213"/> had not. I left him standing in the sand in the road,
                    shaking himself, and I walked back to the town. I took nothing from that
                    accursed waggon, so I had only two shillings. But it did not matter. The next
                    day I got work at a wholesale store. My work was to pack and unpack goods, and
                    to carry boxes, and I had to work from six in the morning to six in the evening;
                    so I had plenty of time. I hired a little room, and subscribed to a library, so
                    I had everything I needed; and in the week of Christmas holidays I went to see
                    the sea. I walked all night to escape the heat, and a little after sunrise I got
                    to the top of a high hill. Before me was a long, low, blue, monotonous mountain.
                    I walked looking at it, but I was thinking of the sea I wanted to see. At last I
                    wondered what that curious blue thing might be; then it struck me, it was the
                    sea! I would have turned back again, only I was too tired. I<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7168-214"/> wonder if all the things we long to seeâthe churches,
                    the pictures, the men in Europeâwill disappoint us so! You see I had dreamed of
                    it so long. When I was a little boy, minding sheep behind the âkopje;â I used to
                    see the waves stretching out as far as the eye could reach in the sunlight. My
                    sea! Is the idea always more beautiful than the real?</p>
                <p>âI got to the beach that afternoon, and I saw the water run up and down on the
                    sand, and I saw the white foam breakers; they were pretty, but I thought I would
                    go back the next day. It was not my sea.</p>
                <p>âBut I began to like it when I sat by it that night in the moonlight; and the
                    next day I liked it better; and before I left I loved it. It was not like the
                    sky and stars, that talk of what has no beginning and no end; but it is so
                    human. Of all the things I have ever seen, only the sea is like a human<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7168-215"/> being; the sky is not, nor the earth. But the
                    sea is always moving, always something deep in itself is stirring it. It never
                    rests. It is always wanting, wanting, wanting. It hurries on; and then it creeps
                    back slowly without having reached, moaning. It is always asking a question, and
                    it never gets the answer. I can hear it in the day and in the night; the white
                    foam breakers are saying that which I think. I walk alone with them when there
                    is no one to see me, and I sing with them. I lie down on the sand and watch them
                    with my eyes half shut. The sky is better, but it is so high above our heads. I
                    love the sea. Sometimes we must look down too. After five days I went back to
                    the town.</p>
                <p>âI had glorious books, and in the night I could sit in my little room and read
                    them; but I was lonely. Books are not the same things when you are living among
                    people. I cannot tell<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7168-216"/> why, but they are dead.
                    On the farm they would have been living beings to me; but here, where there were
                    so many people about me, I wanted some one to belong to me. I was lonely. I
                    wanted something that was flesh and blood. Once on this farm there came a
                    stranger; I did not ask his name, but he sat among the karroo and talked with
                    me. Now, wherever I have travelled I have looked for himâin hotels, in streets,
                    in passenger waggons as they rushed in, through the open windows of houses I
                    have looked for him, but I have not found himânever heard a voice like his. One
                    day I went to the Botanic Gardens. It was a half-holiday, and the band was to
                    play. I stood in the long raised avenue and looked down. There were many
                    flowers, and ladies and children were walking about beautifully dressed. At last
                    the music began. I had not heard such music before. At first it was slow and
                    even, like the everyday life, when<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7168-217"/> we walk
                    through it without thought or feeling; then it grew faster, then it paused,
                    hesitated, then it was quite still for an instant, and then it burst out.
                    Lyndall, they made heaven right when they made it all music. It takes you up and
                    carries you away, away, till you have the things you longed for; you are in
                    their own world. The walls about you break, and you spread out, you are shut in
                    on no side. I could not see anything while it was playing; I stood with my head
                    against my tree; but, when it was done, I saw that there were ladies sitting
                    close to me on a wooden bench, and the stranger who had talked to me that day in
                    the karroo was sitting between them. The ladies were very pretty, and their
                    dresses beautiful. I do not think they had been listening to the music, for they
                    were talking and laughing very softly. I heard all they said, and could even
                    smell the rose on the breast of one. I was afraid he would<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7168-218"/> see me; so I went to the other side of the tree, and
                    soon they got up and began to pace up and down in the avenue. All the time the
                    music played they chatted, and he carried on his arm the scarf of the prettiest
                    lady. I did not hear the music; I tried to catch the sound of his voice each
                    time he went by. When I was listening to the music I did not know I was badly
                    dressed; now I felt so ashamed of myself. I never knew before what a low,
                    horrible thing I, dressed in tancord, was. That day on the farm, when we sat on
                    the ground under the thorn-trees, I thought he quite belonged to me; now, I saw
                    he was not mine.</p>
                <p>âAt last they turned to go to the gate, and I walked after them. When they got
                    out he helped the ladies into a phaeton, and stood for a moment with his foot on
                    the step talking to them. He had a little cane in his hand, and an Italian
                    greyhound ran after him. Just when<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7168-219"/> they drove
                    away one of the ladies dropped her whip.</p>
                <p>ââPick it up, fellow,â she said; and when I brought it her she threw sixpence on
                    the ground. I might have gone back to the garden then; but I did not want music;
                    I wanted clothes, and to be fashionable and fine. I felt that my hands were
                    coarse, and that I was vulgar. I never tried to see him again.</p>
                <p>âI stayed in my situation four months after that, but I was not happy. I had no
                    rest. The people about me pressed on me, and made me dissatisfied. I could not
                    forget them. Even when I did not see them they pressed on me, and made me
                    miserable. I did not love books; I wanted people. When I walked home under the
                    shady trees in the street I could not be happy, for when I passed the houses I
                    heard music, and saw faces between the curtains. I did not want any of them, but
                    I wanted<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7168-220"/> some one for mine, for me. I could
                    not help it.</p>
                <p>âOnly one day something made me happy. A nurse came to the store with a little
                    girl belonging to one of our clerks. While the maid went into the office to give
                    a message to its father, the little child stood looking at me. Presently she
                    came close to me and peeped up into my face.</p>
                <p>ââNice curls, pretty curls,â she said; âI like curls.â</p>
                <p>âShe felt my hair all over, with her little hands. When I put out my arm she let
                    me take her and sit her on my knee. She kissed me with her soft mouth. We were
                    happy till the nurse-girl came and shook the little one, and asked her if she
                    was not ashamed to sit on the knee of that strange man. But I do not think my
                    little one minded. She laughed at me as she went out.</p>
                <pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7168-221"/>
                <p>âIf the world was all children I could like it; but men and women draw me so
                    strangely, and then press me away, till I am in agony. I was not meant to live
                    among people. Perhaps some day, when I am grown older, I will be able to go and
                    live among them and look at them as I look at the rocks and bushes, without
                    letting them disturb me, and take myself from me; but not now. So I grew
                    miserable; a kind of fever seemed to eat me; I could not rest, or read, or
                    think; so I came here. I knew you were not here, but it seemed as though I
                    should be nearer you; and it is you I wantâyou that the other people suggest to
                    me, but cannot give.â</p>
                <p>He had filled all the sheets he had taken, and now lifted down the last from the
                    mantelpiece. Em had dropped asleep, and lay slumbering peacefully on the skin
                    before the fire. Out of doors the storm still raged; but in a fitful manner, as
                    though growing half weary of itself.<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7168-222"/> He bent
                    over his paper again, with eager flushed cheek, and wrote on.</p>
                <p>âIt has been a delightful journey, this journey home. I have walked on foot. The
                    evening before last, when it was just sunset, I was a little footsore and
                    thirsty, and went out of the road to look for water. I went down into a deep
                    little âkloof.â Some trees ran along the bottom, and I thought I should find
                    water there. The sun had quite set when I got to the bottom of it. It was very
                    stillânot a leaf was stirring anywhere. In the bed of the mountain torrent I
                    thought I might find water. I came to the bank, and leaped down into the dry
                    bed. The floor on which I stood was of fine white sand, and the banks rose on
                    every side like the walls of a room. Above there was a precipice of rocks, and a
                    tiny stream of water oozed from them and fell slowly on to the flat stone below.
                    Each drop you<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7168-223"/> could hear fall like a little
                    silver bell. There was one among the trees on the bank that stood cut out
                    against the white sky. All the other trees were silent; but this one shook and
                    trembled against the sky. Everything else was still; but those leaves were
                    quivering, quivering. I stood on the sand; I could not go away. When it was
                    quite dark, and the stars had come, I crept out. Does it seem strange to you
                    that it should have made me so happy? It is because I cannot tell you how near I
                    felt to things that we cannot see but we always feel. To-night has been a wild,
                    stormy night. I have been walking across the plain for hours in the dark. I have
                    liked the wind, because I have seemed forcing my way through to you. I knew you
                    were not here, but I would hear of you. When I used to sit on the transport
                    waggon half-sleeping, I used to start awake because your hands were on me. In<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7168-224"/> my lodgings, night after night I have blown
                    the light out, and sat in the dark, that I might see your face start out more
                    distinctly. Sometimes it was the little girl's face who used to come to me
                    behind the âkopjeâ when I minded the sheep, and sit by me in her blue pinafore;
                    sometimes it was older. I love both. I am very helpless; I shall never do
                    anything; but you will work, and I will take your work for mine. Sometimes such
                    a sudden gladness seizes me when I remember that somewhere in the world you are
                    living and working. You are my very own; nothing else is my own so. When I have
                    finished I am going to look at your room doorââ</p>
                <p>He wrote; and the wind, which had spent its fury, moaned round and round the
                    house, most like a tired child weary with crying.</p>
                <p>Em woke up, and sat before the fire, rubbing her eyes, and listening, as it
                    sobbed about the<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7168-225"/> gables, and wandered away
                    over the long stone walls.</p>
                <p>âHow quiet it has grown now,â she said, and sighed herself, partly from weariness
                    and partly from sympathy with the tired wind. He did not answer her; he was lost
                    in his letter.</p>
                <p>She rose slowly after a time, and rested her hand on his shoulder.</p>
                <p>âYou have many letters to write,â she said.</p>
                <p>âNo,â he answered; âit is only one to Lyndall.â</p>
                <p>She turned away, and stood long before the fire looking into it. If you have a
                    deadly fruit to give it will not grow sweeter by keeping.</p>
                <p>âWaldo, dear,â she said, putting her hand on his, âleave off writing.â</p>
                <p>He threw back the dark hair from his forehead and looked at her.</p>
                <pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7168-226"/>
                <p>âIt is no use writing any more,â she said.</p>
                <p>âWhy not?â he asked.</p>
                <p>She put her hand over the papers he had written.</p>
                <p>âWaldo,â she said, âLyndall is dead.â</p>

                <head type="sub">GREGORY'S WOMANHOOD.</head>
                <p><hi rend="b">SLOWLY</hi> over the flat came a cart. On the back seat sat Gregory,
                    his arms folded, his hat drawn over his eyes. A Kaffir boy sat on the front seat
                    driving, and at his feet sat Doss, who, every now and again, lifted his nose and
                    eyes above the level of the splash-board, to look at the surrounding country;
                    and then, with an exceedingly knowing wink of his left eye, turned to his
                    companions, thereby intimating that he clearly perceived his whereabouts. No one
                    noticed the cart coming. Waldo, who was at work at his carpenter's table in the
                    waggon-house, saw nothing, till chancing to<pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7168-228"/>
                    look down he perceived Doss standing before him, the legs trembling, the little
                    nose wrinkled, and a series of short, suffocating barks giving utterance to his
                    joy at reunion.</p>
                <p>Em, whose eyes had ached with looking out across the plain, was now at work in a
                    back-room, and knew nothing till, looking up, she saw Gregory, with his straw
                    hat and blue eyes, standing in the door-way. He greeted her quietly, hung his
                    hat up in its old place behind the door, and for any change in his manner or
                    appearance he might have been gone only the day before to fetch letters from the
                    town. Only his beard was gone, and his face was grown thinner. He took off his
                    leather gaiters, said the afternoon was hot and the roads dusty, and asked for
                    some tea. They talked of wool, cattle, and sheep, and Em gave him the pile of
                    letters that had come for him during that seven months' absence, but of the<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7168-229"/> thing that lay at their hearts neither said
                    anything. Then he went out to look at the kraals, and at supper Em gave him hot
                    cakes and coffee. They talked about the servants, and then ate their meal in
                    quiet. When it was ended Gregory went into the front-room, and lay in the dark
                    on the sofa.</p>
                <p>âDo you not want a light?â Em asked, venturing to look in.</p>
                <p>âNo,â he answered; then presently called to her, âCome and sit here; I want to
                    talk to you.â</p>
                <p>She came and sat on a footstool near him.</p>
                <p>âDo you wish to hear anything?â he asked.</p>
                <p>She whispered, âYes, if it does not hurt you.â</p>
                <p>âWhat difference does it make to me?â he said. âIf I talk or am silent, is there
                    any change?â</p>
                <p>Yet he lay quiet for a long time. The light through the open door showed him to
                        her,<pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7168-230"/> where he lay, with his arm thrown
                    across his eyes. At last he spoke. Perhaps it was a relief to him to speak.</p>
                <p>To Bloemfontein in the Free State, to which through an agent he had traced them,
                    Gregory had gone. At the hotel where Lyndall and her stranger had stayed he put
                    up; he was shown the very room in which they had slept. The coloured boy who had
                    driven them to the next town told him in which house they had boarded, and
                    Gregory went on. In that town he found they had left the cart, and bought a
                    spider and four greys, and Gregory's heart rejoiced. Now indeed it would be easy
                    to trace their course. And he turned his steps northward.</p>
                <p>At the farm-houses where he stopped the âoomsâ and âtantesâ remembered clearly
                    the spider with its four grey horses. At one place the Boer-wife told how the
                    Englishman had bought milk, and asked the way to the next<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7168-231"/> farm. At the next farm the Englishman had bought a
                    bunch of flowers, and given half-a-crown for them to the little girl. It was
                    quite true; the Boer-mother made her get it out of the box and show it. At the
                    next place they had slept. Here they told him that the great bull-dog, who hated
                    all strangers, had walked in in the evening and laid its head in the lady's lap.
                    So at every place he heard something, and traced them step by step.</p>
                <p>At one desolate farm the Boer had a good deal to tell. The lady had said she
                    liked a waggon that stood before the door. Without asking the price the
                    Englishman had offered a hundred and fifty pounds for the old thing, and bought
                    oxen worth ten pounds for sixteen. The Dutchman chuckled, for he had the
                    âSalt-reim'sâ money in the box under his bed. Gregory laughed too, in silence;
                    he could not lose sight of them now, so slowly they would have to move with
                        that<pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7168-232"/> cumbrous ox-waggon. Yet, when that
                    evening came, and he reached a little wayside inn, no one could tell him
                    anything of the travellers.</p>
                <p>The master, a surly creature, half stupid with Boer-brandy, sat on the bench
                    before the door smoking. Gregory sat beside him, questioning, but he smoked on.
                    He remembered nothing of such strangers. How should he know who had been there
                    months and months before? He smoked on. Gregory, very weary, tried to wake his
                    memory, said that the lady he was seeking for was very beautiful, had a little
                    mouth, and tiny, very tiny, feet. The man only smoked on as sullenly as at
                    first. What were little, very little mouths and feet to him. But his daughter
                    leaned out in the window above. She was dirty and lazy, and liked to loll there
                    when travellers came, to hear the men talk, but she had a soft heart. Presently
                    a hand came out of the window, and a pair of velvet slippers touched his
                    shoulder, tiny slippers<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7168-233"/> with black flowers. He
                    pulled them out of her hand. Only one woman's feet had worn them, he knew
                    that.</p>
                <p>âLeft here last summer by a lady,â said the girl; âmight be the one you are
                    looking for. Never saw any feet so small.â</p>
                <p>Gregory rose and questioned her.</p>
                <p>They might have come in a waggon and spider, she could not tell. But the
                    gentleman was very handsome, tall, lovely figure, blue eyes, wore gloves always
                    when he went out. An English officer, perhaps; no Africander, certainly.</p>
                <p>Gregory stopped her.</p>
                <p>The lady? Well, she was pretty, rather, the girl said; very cold, dull hair,
                    silent. They stayed for, it might be, five days; slept in the wing over against
                    the âstoepâ; quarrelled sometimes, she thoughtâthe lady. She had seen everything
                    when she went in to wait. One day the gentleman touched her hair; she drew
                        back<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7168-234"/> from him as though his fingers
                    poisoned her. Went to the other end of the room if he came to sit near her.
                    Walked out alone. Cold wife for such a handsome husband, the girl thought; she
                    evidently pitied him. They went away early one morning, how, or in which way,
                    the girl could not tell.</p>
                <p>Gregory inquired of the servants, but nothing more was to be learnt; so the next
                    morning he saddled his horse and went on. At the farms he came to the good old
                    âoomsâ and âtantesâ asked him to have coffee, and the little shoeless children
                    peeped out at the stranger from behind ovens and gables; but no one had seen
                    what he asked for. This way and that he rode to pick up the thread he had
                    dropped, but the spider and the waggon, the little lady and the handsome
                    gentleman, no one had seen. In the towns he fared yet worse.</p>
                <p>Once indeed hope came to him. On the<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7168-235"/> âstoepâ of
                    an hotel at which he stayed the night in a certain little village, there walked
                    a gentleman, grave and kindly-looking. It was not hard to open conversation with
                    him about the weather, and then;âHad he ever seen such and such people, a
                    gentleman and a lady, a spider and waggon, arrive at that place. The kindly
                    gentleman shook his head. What was the lady like, he inquired?</p>
                <p>Gregory painted. Hair like silken floss, small mouth, underlip very full and
                    pink, upper lip pink but very thin and curled; there were four white spots on
                    the nail of the forefinger, the eyebrows very straight.</p>
                <p>âYes; and a rose-bud tinge in the cheeks; hands like lilies, and perfectly
                    seraphic smile.â</p>
                <p>âThat is she! that is she!â cried Gregory.</p>
                <p>Who else could it be? He asked where she<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7168-236"/> had
                    gone to. The gentleman most thoughtfully stroked his beard. He would try to
                    remember. Were not her earsâ. Here such a violent fit of coughing seized him
                    that he ran away into the house. An ill-fed clerk and a dirty barman standing in
                    the door-way laughed aloud. Gregory wondered if they could be laughing at the
                    gentleman's cough, and then he heard some one laughing in the room into which
                    the gentleman had gone. He must follow him and try to learn more; but he soon
                    found that there was nothing more to be learnt there. Poor Gregory!</p>
                <p>Backward and forwards, backward and forwards, from the dirty little hotel where
                    he had dropped the thread, to this farm and to that, rode Gregory, till his
                    heart was sick and tired. That from that spot the waggon might have gone its own
                    way and the spider another was an idea that did not occur to him. At last he
                        saw<pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7168-237"/> it was no use lingering in that
                    neighbourhood, and pressed on.</p>
                <p>One day, coming to a little town, his horses knocked up, and he resolved to rest
                    them there. The little hotel of the town was a bright and sunny place, like the
                    jovial face of the clean little woman who kept it, and who trotted about talking
                    alwaysâtalking to the customers in the tap-room, and to the maids in the
                    kitchen, and to the passers-by when she could hail them from the windows;
                    talking, as good-natured women with large mouths and small noses always do, in
                    season and out.</p>
                <p>There was a little front parlour in the hotel, kept for strangers who wanted to
                    be alone. Gregory sat there to eat his breakfast, and the landlady dusted the
                    room and talked of the great finds at the Diamond Fields, and the badness of
                    maid-servants, and the shameful conduct of the Dutch parson in that town to the
                    English <choice>
                        <orig>in-</orig>
                        <reg>inhabitants</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7168-238"/> habitants. Gregory ate his breakfast
                    and listened to nothing. He had asked his one question, and had had his answer;
                    now she might talk on.</p>
                <p>Presently a door in the corner opened and a woman came outâa Mozambiquer, with a
                    red handkerchief twisted round her head. She carried in her hand a tray, with a
                    slice of toast crumbled fine, and a half-filled cup of coffee, and an egg broken
                    open, but not eaten. Her ebony face grinned complacently as she shut the door
                    softly and said, âGood morning.â</p>
                <p>The landlady began to talk to her.</p>
                <p>âYou are not going to leave her really, Ayah, are you?â she said. âThe maids say
                    so; but I'm sure you wouldn't do such a thing.â</p>
                <p>The Mozambiquer grinned.</p>
                <p>âHusband says I must go home.â</p>
                <p>âBut she hasn't got any one else, and won't have any one else. Come, now,â said
                    the landlady.</p>
                <pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7168-239"/>
                <p>The Mozambiquer only showed her white teeth good-naturedly for answer, and went
                    out, and the landlady followed her.</p>
                <p>Gregory, glad to be alone, watched the sunshine as it came over the fuchsias in
                    the window, and ran up and down on the panelled door in the corner. The
                    Mozambiquer had closed it loosely behind her, and presently something touched it
                    inside. It moved a little, then it was still, then moved again; then through the
                    gap a small nose appeared, and a yellow ear overlapping one eye; then the whole
                    head obtruded, placed itself critically on one side, wrinkled its nose
                    disapprovingly at Gregory, and withdrew. Through the half-open door came a faint
                    scent of toilet vinegar, and the room was dark and still.</p>
                <p>Presently the landlady came back.</p>
                <p>âLeft the door open,â she said, bustling to shut it; âbut a darkey will be a
                    darkey, and never carries a head on its shoulders like<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7168-240"/> other folks. Not ill, I hope sir,â she said, looking
                    at Gregory when she had shut the bed-room door.</p>
                <p>âNo,â said Gregory, âno.â</p>
                <p>The landlady began putting the things together.</p>
                <p>âWho,â asked Gregory, âis in that room?â</p>
                <p>Glad to have a little innocent piece of gossip to relate, and some one willing to
                    hear it, the landlady made the most of a little story as she cleared the table.
                    Six months before a lady had come alone to the hotel in a waggon, with only a
                    coloured leader and driver. Eight days after a little baby had been born. If
                    Gregory stood up and looked out at the window he would see a blue gum-tree in
                    the grave-yard; close by it was a little grave. The baby was buried there. A
                    tiny thing, only lived two hours, and the mother herself almost went with it.
                    After a while she was better; but one day she got<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7168-241"/> up out of bed, dressed herself without saying a word
                    to any one, and went out. It was a drizzly day; a little time after some one saw
                    her sitting on the wet ground under the blue gum-tree, with the rain dripping
                    from her hat and shawl. They went to fetch her, but she would not come until she
                    chose. When she did she had gone to bed and had not risen again from it; never
                    would, the doctor said.</p>
                <p>She was very patient, poor thing. When you went in to ask her how she was she
                    said always âBetter,â or âNearly well!â and lay still in the darkened room, and
                    never troubled any one. The Mozambiquer took care of her, and she would not
                    allow any one else to touch her; would not so much as allow any one else to see
                    her foot uncovered. She was strange in many ways, but she paid well, poor thing;
                    and now the Mozambiquer was going, and she would have to take up with some one
                    else.</p>
                <pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7168-242"/>
                <p>The landlady prattled on pleasantly, and now carried away the tray with the
                    breakfast-things. When she was gone Gregory leaned his head on his hands, but he
                    did not think long.</p>
                <p>Before dinner he had ridden out of the town to where on a rise a number of
                    transport-waggons were out-spanned. The Dutchman driver of one wondered at the
                    stranger's eagerness to free himself of his horses. Stolen perhaps; but it was
                    worth his while to buy them at so low a price. So the horses changed masters,
                    and Gregory walked off with his saddle-bags slung across his arm. Once out of
                    sight of the waggons he struck out of the road and walked across the âveld,â the
                    dry, flowering grasses waving everywhere about him; half way across the plain he
                    came to a deep gully which the rain torrents had washed out, but which was now
                    dry. Gregory sprung down into its red bed. It was a safe place, and quiet. When
                    he had looked about him he sat<pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7168-243"/> down under the
                    shade of an overhanging bank and fanned himself with his hat, for the afternoon
                    was hot, and he had walked fast. At his feet the dusty ants ran about, and the
                    high red bank before him was covered by a network of roots and fibres washed
                    bare by the rains. Above his head rose the clear blue African sky; at his side
                    were the saddle-bags full of women's clothing. Gregory looked up half
                    plaintively into the blue sky.</p>
                <p>âAm I, am I Gregory Nazianzen Rose?â he said.</p>
                <p>It was also strange, he sitting there in that âslootâ in that up-country
                    plain!âstrange as the fantastic, changing shapes in a summer cloud. At last,
                    tired out, he fell asleep, with his head against the bank. When he woke the
                    shadow had stretched across the âsloot,â and the sun was on the edge of the
                    plain. Now he must be up and doing. He drew from his breast pocket a little
                    sixpenny looking-glass, and<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7168-244"/> hung it on one of
                    the roots that stuck out from the bank. Then he dressed himself in one of the
                    old-fashioned gowns and a great pinked out collar. Then he took out a razor.
                    Tuft by tuft the soft brown beard fell down into the sand, and the little ants
                    took it to line their nests with. Then the glass showed a face surrounded by a
                    frilled cap, white as a woman's, with a little mouth, a very short upper lip,
                    and a receding chin.</p>
                <p>Presently a rather tall woman's figure was making its way across the âveld.â As
                    it passed a hollowed-out ant-heap it knelt down, and stuffed in the saddle-bags
                    with the man's clothing, closing up the ant-hill with bits of ground to look as
                    natural as possible. Like a sinner hiding his deed of sin, Gregory started once
                    and looked round, but yet there was no one near save a âmeerkat,â who had lifted
                    herself out of her hole and sat on her hind legs<pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7168-245"/> watching. He did not like that even she should see, and when he rose she
                    dived away into her hole. Then he walked on leisurely, that the dusk might have
                    reached the village streets before he walked there. The first house was the
                    smith's, and before the open door two idle urchins lolled. As he hurried up the
                    street in the gathering gloom he heard them laugh long and loudly behind him. He
                    glanced round fearingly, and would almost have fled, but that the strange skirts
                    clung about his legs. And after all it was only a spark that had alighted on the
                    head of one, and not the strange figure they laughed at.</p>
                <p>The door of the hotel stood wide open, and the light fell out into the street. He
                    knocked, and the landlady came. She peered out to look for the cart that had
                    brought the traveller; but Gregory's heart was brave now he was so near the
                    quiet room. He told her he had come<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7168-246"/> with the
                    transport waggons that stood outside the town.</p>
                <p>He had walked in, and wanted lodgings for the night.</p>
                <p>It was a deliberate lie, glibly told; he would have told fifty, though the
                    recording angel had stood in the next room with his pen dipped in the ink. What
                    was it to him? He remembered that she lay there saying always, âI am
                    better.â</p>
                <p>The landlady put his supper in the little parlour where he had sat in the
                    morning. When it was on the table she sat down in the rocking-chair, as her
                    fashion was, to knit and talk, that she might gather news for her customers in
                    the tap-room. In the white face under the queer, deep-fringed cap she saw
                    nothing of the morning's traveller. The newcomer was communicative. She was a
                    nurse by profession, she said; had come to the Transvaal hearing that good
                    nurses were needed there. She had<pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7168-247"/> not yet
                    found work. The landlady did not perhaps know whether there would be any for her
                    in that town?</p>
                <p>The landlady put down her knitting and smote her fat hands together.</p>
                <p>If it wasn't the very finger of God's Providence, as though you saw it hanging
                    out of the sky, she said. Here was a lady sick and needing a new nurse that very
                    day, and not able to get one to her mind, and nowâwell, if it wasn't enough to
                    convert all the atheists and free-thinkers in the Transvaal, she didn't
                    know!</p>
                <p>Then the landlady proceeded to detail facts.</p>
                <p>âI'm sure you will suit her,â she added; âyou're just the kind. She has heaps of
                    money to pay you with; has everything that money can buy. She is asleep now, but
                    I'll take you in to look at her.â</p>
                <p>The landlady opened the door of the next room, and Gregory followed her. A table
                        stood<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7168-248"/> near the bed, and a lamp burning low
                    stood on it; the bed was a great four-poster with white curtains, and the quilt
                    was of rich crimson satin. But Gregory stood just inside the door with his head
                    bent low, and saw no further.</p>
                <p>âCome nearer! I'll turn the lamp up a bit, that you can have a look at her. A
                    pretty thing, isn't it?â said the landlady.</p>
                <p>Near the foot of the bed was a dent in the crimson quilt, and out of it Doss's
                    small head and bright eyes looked knowingly.</p>
                <p>Then Gregory looked up at what lay on the cushion. A little white, white face,
                    transparent as an angel's with a cloth bound round the forehead, and with soft
                    hair tossed about on the pillow.</p>
                <p>âWe had to cut it off,â said the woman,<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7168-249"/>
                    touching it with her fore-finger. âSoft as silk, like a wax doll's.â</p>
                <p>But Gregory's heart was bleeding.</p>
                <p>âNever get up again, the doctor says,â said the landlady.</p>
                <p>Gregory uttered one word. In an instant the beautiful eyes opened widely, looked
                    round the room and into the dark corners.</p>
                <p>âWho is here? Whom did I hear speak?â</p>
                <p>Gregory had sunk back behind the curtain; the landlady drew it aside, and pulled
                    him forward.</p>
                <p>âOnly this lady, ma'amâa nurse by profession. She is willing to stay and take
                    care of you, if you can come to terms with her.â</p>
                <p>Lyndall raised herself on her elbow, and cast one keen scrutinizing glance over
                    him.</p>
                <p>âHave I never seen you before?â she asked.</p>
                <p>âNo.â</p>
                <p>She fell back wearily.</p>
                <pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7168-250"/>
                <p>âPerhaps you would like to arrange the terms between yourselves,â said the
                    landlady. âHere is a chair. I will be back presently.â</p>
                <p>Gregory sat down, with bent head and quick breath. She did not speak, and lay
                    with half-closed eyes, seeming to have forgotten him.</p>
                <p>âWill you turn the lamp down a little?â she said at last; âI cannot bear the
                    light.â</p>
                <p>Then his heart grew braver in the shadow, and he spoke. Nursing was to him, he
                    said, a pleasure. He wanted no money: ifâ She stopped him.</p>
                <p>âI take no service for which I do not pay,â she said. âWhat I gave to my last
                    nurse I will give to you; if you do not like it you may go.â</p>
                <p>And Gregory muttered humbly, he would take it.</p>
                <p>Afterward she tried to turn herself. He lifted her. Ah! such a shrunken little
                    body, he<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7168-251"/> could feel its weakness as he touched
                    it. His hands were to him glorified for that service.</p>
                <p>âThank you! that is so nice. Other people hurt me when they touch me,â she said.
                    âThank you!â Then after a little while she repeated humbly, âThank you; they
                    hurt me so.â</p>
                <p>Gregory sat down trembling. His little ewe-lamb, could <emph>he</emph> hurt
                    her?</p>
                <p>The doctor said of Gregory four days after, âShe is the most experienced nurse I
                    ever came in contact with.â</p>
                <p>Gregory, standing in the passage, heard it and laughed in his heart. What need
                    had he of experience? Experience teaches us in a millennium what passion teaches
                    us in an hour. A Kaffir studies all his life the discerning of distant sounds;
                    but he will never hear my step, when my love hears it, coming to her window in
                    the dark over the short grass.</p>
                <p>At first Gregory's heart was sore when<pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7168-252"/> day by
                    day the body grew lighter, and the mouth he fed took less; but afterward he grew
                    accustomed to it, and was happy. For passion has <emph>one</emph> cry, one
                    onlyââOh, to touch thee, Beloved!â</p>
                <p>In that quiet room Lyndall lay on the bed with the dog at her feet, and Gregory
                    sat in his dark corner watching.</p>
                <p>She seldom slept, and through those long, long days she would lie watching the
                    round streak of sunlight that came through the knot in the shutter, or the
                    massive lion's paw on which the wardrobe rested. What thoughts were in those
                    eyes? Gregory wondered; he dared not ask.</p>
                <p>Sometimes Doss where he lay on her feet would dream that they two were in the
                    cart, tearing over the âveld,â with the black horses snorting, and the wind in
                    their faces; and he would start up in his sleep and bark aloud. Then<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7168-253"/> awaking, he would lick his mistress's hand almost
                    remorsefully, and slink quietly down into his place.</p>
                <p>Gregory thought she had no pain, she never groaned; only sometimes, when the
                    light was near her, he thought he could see contractions about her lips and
                    eyebrows.</p>
                <p>He slept on the sofa outside her door.</p>
                <p>One night he thought he heard a sound, and, opening it softly, he looked in. She
                    was crying out aloud, as if she and her pain were alone in the world. The light
                    fell on the red quilt, and the little hands that were clasped over the head. The
                    wide-open eyes were looking up, and the heavy drops fell slowly from them.</p>
                <p>âI cannot bear any more, not any more,â she said in a deep voice. âOh, God, God!
                    have I not borne in silence? Have I not endured these long, long months? But
                    now, now, oh, God, I cannot!â</p>
                <pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7168-254"/>
                <p>Gregory knelt in the door-way listening.</p>
                <p>âI do not ask for wisdom, not human love, not work, not knowledge, not for all
                    things I have longed for,â she cried; âonly a little freedom from pain! Only one
                    little hour without pain!â</p>
                <p>She sat up, and bit the little hand Gregory loved.</p>
                <p>He crept away to the front door, and stood looking out at the quiet starlight.
                    When he came back she was lying in her usual posture, the quiet eyes looking at
                    the lion's claw. He came close to the bed.</p>
                <p>âYou have much pain to-night?â he asked her.</p>
                <p>âNo, not much.â</p>
                <p>âCan I do anything for you?â</p>
                <p>âNo, nothing.â</p>
                <p>She still drew her lips quivering together, and motioned with her fingers toward
                    the dog who<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7168-255"/> lay sleeping at her feet. Gregory
                    lifted him and laid him at her side. She made Gregory turn open the bosom of her
                    night-dress, that the dog might put his black muzzle between her breasts. She
                    crossed her arms over him. Gregory left them lying there together.</p>
                <p>Next day, when they asked her how she was, she answered âBetter.â</p>
                <p>âSome one ought to tell her,â said the landlady; âwe can't let her soul go out
                    into eternity not knowing, especially when I don't think it was all right about
                    the child. You ought to go and tell her, Doctor.â</p>
                <p>So, the little doctor, egged on and on, went in at last. When he came out of the
                    room he shook his fist in the landlady's face.</p>
                <p>âThe next time you have any devil's work to do, do it yourself,â he said, and he
                    shook his fist in her face again, and went away swearing.</p>
                <p>When Gregory went into the bed-room he<pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7168-256"/> only
                    found her moved, her body curled up, and drawn close to the wall. He dared not
                    disturb her. At last, after a long time, she turned.</p>
                <p>âBring me food,â she said, âI want to eat. Two eggs, and toast, and meatâtwo
                    large slices of toast, please.â</p>
                <p>Wondering, Gregory brought a tray with all that she had asked for.</p>
                <p>âSit me up, and put it close to me,â she said; âI am going to eat it all.â She
                    tried to draw the things near her with her fingers, and re-arranged the plates.
                    She cut the toast into long strips, broke open both eggs, put a tiny morsel of
                    bread into her own mouth, and fed the dog.</p>
                <p>âIs it twelve o'clock yet?â she said, fingering the meat; âI think I do not
                    generally eat so early. Put it away, please, <emph>carefully</emph>,âno, do not
                    take it away,âon the side table. When the clock strikes twelve I will eat
                    it.â</p>
                <pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7168-257"/>
                <p>She lay down trembling. After a little while she said,</p>
                <p>âGive me my clothes.â</p>
                <p>He looked at her.</p>
                <p>âYes; I am going to dress to-morrow. I should get up now, but it is rather late.
                    Put them on that chair. My collars are in the little box, my boots behind the
                    door.â</p>
                <p>Her eyes followed him intently as he collected the articles one by one, and
                    placed them on the chair as she directed.</p>
                <p>âPut it nearer,â she said, âI cannot see it;â and she lay watching the clothes,
                    with her hand under her cheek.</p>
                <p>âNow open the shutter wide,â she said; âI am going to read.â</p>
                <p>The old, old tone was again in the sweet voice.</p>
                <p>He opened the shutter, and raised her up among the pillows.</p>
                <p>âNow bring my books to me,â she said,<pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7168-258"/> motioning
                    eagerly with her fingers; âthe large book, and the reviews and the plays; I want
                    them all.â</p>
                <p>He piled them round her on the bed; she drew them greedily closer, her eyes very
                    bright, though her face was white.</p>
                <p>âNow the big one off the drawers. No, you need not help me to hold my book,â she
                    said; âI can hold it for myself.â</p>
                <p>Gregory went back to his corner, and for a little time the restless turning of
                    many leaves was to be heard.</p>
                <p>âWill you open the window,â she said, almost querulously, âand throw this book
                    out? It is so utterly foolish. I thought it was a nice book; but the words are
                    merely strung together, they make no sense. Yesâso!â she said with approval,
                    seeing him fling it out into the street. âI must have been very foolish when I
                    thought that book nice.â</p>
                <pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7168-259"/>
                <p>Then she turned to read, and leaned her little elbows resolutely on the great
                    volume, and knit her brows. This was Shakespeareâit must mean something.</p>
                <p>âI wish you would take a handkerchief and tie it tight round my head, it aches
                    so.â</p>
                <p>He had not been long in his seat when he saw drops fall from beneath the hands
                    that shaded the eyes, on to the page.</p>
                <p>âI am not accustomed to so much light, it makes my head swim a little,â she said.
                    âGo out and close the shutter.â</p>
                <p>When he came back, she lay shrivelled up among the pillows. He heard no sound of
                    weeping, but the shoulders shook.</p>
                <p>When Gregory went to his sofa that night, she told him to wake her early, for she
                    must be up before breakfast. Nevertheless, when morning came, she said it was a
                    little cold, and lay all day watching her clothes upon the chair. Still<pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7168-260"/> she sent for her oxen in the country; they
                    would start on Monday.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon she told him to open the window wide, and draw the bed near
                    it.</p>
                <p>It was a leaden afternoon, the dull rain-clouds rested close to the roofs of the
                    houses, and the little street was silent and deserted. Now and then a gust of
                    wind eddying round caught up the dried leaves, whirled them hither and thither
                    under the trees, and dropped them again into the gutter; then all was quiet. She
                    lay looking out. Presently the bell of the church began to toll, and up the
                    village street came a long procession. They were carrying an old man to his last
                    resting-place. She followed them with her eyes till they turned in among the
                    trees at the gate.</p>
                <p>âWho was that?â she asked.</p>
                <p>âAn old man,â he answered, âa very old man; they say he was ninety-four; but his
                    name I do not know.â</p>
                <pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7168-261"/>
                <p>She mused a while, looking out with fixed eyes.</p>
                <p>âThat is why the bell rang so cheerfully,â she said. âWhen the old die it is
                    well; they have had their time. It is when the young die that the bells weep
                    drops of blood.â</p>
                <p>âBut the old love life?â he said; for it was sweet to hear her speak.</p>
                <p>She raised herself on her elbow.</p>
                <p>âThey love life, they do not want to die,â she answered, âbut what of that? They
                    have had their time. They knew that a man's life is three-score years and ten;
                    they should have made their plans accordingly! But the young,â she said, âthe
                    young, cut down, cruelly, when they have not seen, when they have not known,
                    when they have not foundâit is for them that the bells weep blood. I heard in
                    the ringing it was an old man. When the old dieâ Listen to the bell! it is
                    laughingââIt is right, it is right; he<pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7168-262"/> has had
                    his time.â They cannot ring so for the young.â</p>
                <p>She fell back exhausted; the hot light died from her eyes, and she lay looking
                    out into the street. By-and-bye stragglers from the funeral began to come back
                    and disappear here and there among the houses; then all was quiet, and the night
                    began to settle down upon the village street. When the room was quite dark, so
                    that they could not see each other's faces, she said,</p>
                <p>âIt will rain to-night;â and moved restlessly on the pillows. âHow terrible when
                    the rain falls down on you drop by drop!â</p>
                <p>He wondered what she meant. She moved again.</p>
                <p>âWill you presently take my cloakâthe new grey cloak from behind the doorâand go
                    with it. You will find a little grave at the foot of the tall blue gum-tree; the
                    water drips off the long, pointed leaves; you must cover it up with that.â</p>
                <pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7168-263"/>
                <p>Gregory assented, and there was silence again. It was the first time she had ever
                    spoken of her child.</p>
                <p>âIt was so small,â she said; âit lived such a little whileâonly three hours. They
                    laid it close by me, but I never saw it; I could feel it by me.â She waited;
                    âIts feet were so cold; I took them in my hand to make them warm, and my hand
                    closed right over them they were so little.â There was a tremor in the voice.
                    âIt crept close to me; it wanted to drink, it wanted to be warm.â She moved her
                    hand: âI did not love it; its father was not my prince; I did not care for it;
                    but it was so little.â Uneasily she moved upon her pillows. âThey might have
                    kissed it, one of them, before they put it in. It never did any one any harm in
                    all its little life. They might have kissed it.â</p>
                <p>Gregory thought he felt rather than heard some one sobbing in the room.</p>
                <pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7168-264"/>
                <p>Late on in the evening, when the shutter was closed and the lamp lighted, and the
                    rain-drops beat on the roof, he took the cloak from behind the door and went
                    away with it. On his way back he called at the village post-office and brought
                    back a letter. In the hall he stood reading the address. How could he fail to
                    know whose hand had written it? Had he not long ago studied those characters on
                    the torn fragments of paper in the old parlour? A burning pain was at Gregory's
                    heart. If now, now at the last, one should come, should step in between! He
                    carried the letter into the bed-room and gave it to her. When she had read it,
                    âGive me my desk,â she said; âopen it before me.â</p>
                <p>Then Gregory sat down in the lamp-light on the other side of the curtain, and
                    heard the pencil move on the paper. When he looked round the curtain she was
                    lying on the pillow with a flushed face, the hand writing quickly.<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7168-265"/> The open letter lay at her side; she glanced at it
                    with soft eyes. The man with the languid eyelids must have been strangely moved
                    before his hand set down those words:ââLet me come back to you! My darling, let
                    me put my hand round you, and guard you from all the world. As my wife they
                    shall never touch you. I have learnt to love you more wisely, more tenderly,
                    than of old; you shall have perfect freedom. Lyndall, grand little woman, for
                    your own sake be my wife!</p>
                <p>âWhy did you send that money back to me? You are cruel to me; it is not rightly
                    done.â</p>
                <p>She rolled the little red pencil softly between her fingers, and her face grew
                    very soft. Yetâ</p>
                <p>âIt cannot be,â she wrote; âI thank you much for the love you have shown me; but
                    I cannot listen. You will call me mad, foolishâthe world would do so; but I know
                    what I need and the kind of path I must<pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7168-266"/> walk
                    in. I cannot marry you. I will always love you for the sake of what lay by me
                    those three hours; we may be friends, but there it ends. I must know, see,
                    suffer, taste of life; I cannot be bound to one whom I love as I love you. I am
                    not afraid of the worldâI will fight the world. One dayâperhaps it may be far
                    offâI shall find what I have wanted all my life; something nobler, stronger than
                    I, before which I can kneel down. You lose nothing by not having me now; I am a
                    weak, selfish, erring woman. One day I shall find something to worship, and then
                    I shall be a nobler womanââ</p>
                <p>âNurse,â she said; âtake my desk away; I am suddenly so sleepy; I will write more
                    to-morrow.â She turned her face to the pillow; it was the sudden drowsiness of
                    great weakness. She had dropped asleep in a moment, and Gregory moved the desk
                    softly, and then sat in the chair watching. Hour after hour passed, but<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7168-267"/> he had no wish for rest, and sat on, hearing
                    the rain cease, and the still night settle down everywhere. At a quarter-past
                    twelve he rose, and took a last look at the bed where she lay sleeping so
                    peacefully; then he turned to go to his couch. Before he had reached the door
                    she had started up and was calling him back.</p>
                <p>âYou are sure you have put it up?â she said, with a look of blank terror at the
                    window. âIt will not fall open in the night, the shutterâyou are sure?â</p>
                <p>He comforted her. Yes, it was tightly fastened.</p>
                <p>âEven if it is shut,â she said, in a whisper, âyou cannot keep it out! You feel
                    it coming in at four o'clock, creeping, creeping, up, up; deadly cold!â She
                    shuddered.</p>
                <p>He thought she was wandering, and laid her little trembling body down among the
                    blankets.</p>
                <p>âI dreamed just now that it was not put up,â she said, looking into his eyes;
                    âand it crept right in and I was alone with it.â</p>
                <pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7168-268"/>
                <p>âWhat do you fear?â he asked tenderly.</p>
                <p>âThe Gray Dawn,â she said, glancing round at the window. âI was never afraid of
                    anything, never when I was a little child, but I have always been afraid of
                    that. You will not let it come in to me?â</p>
                <p>âNo, no; I will stay with you,â he continued.</p>
                <p>But she was growing calmer. âNo; you must go to bed. I only awoke with a start;
                    you must be tired. I am childish, that is all;â but she shivered again.</p>
                <p>He sat down beside her, after some time she said: âWill you not rub my feet?â</p>
                <p>He knelt down at the foot of the bed and took the tiny foot in his hand; it was
                    swollen and unsightly now, but as he touched it he bent down and covered it with
                    kisses.</p>
                <p>âIt makes it better when you kiss it; thank you. What makes you all love me so?â
                    Then dreamily she muttered to herself: âNot utterly<pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7168-269"/> bad, not quite badâwhat makes them all love me
                    so?â</p>
                <p>Rubbing, rubbing softly, with his cheek pressed against the little foot, Gregory
                    dropped to sleep at last. How long he knelt there he could not tell, but when he
                    started up awake she was not looking at him.</p>
                <p>The eyes were fixed on the far corner, gazing wide and intent, with an unearthly
                    light.</p>
                <p>He looked round fearfully. What did she see there? God's angels come to call her?
                    Something fearful? <emph>He</emph> saw only the purple curtain with the shadows
                    that fell from it. Softly he whispered, asking what she saw there.</p>
                <p>And she said: âI see the vision of a poor weak life, striving after good. It was
                    not cut short, and in the end it learnt, through tears and much pain, that
                    holiness is an infinite compassion for others; that greatness is to take the
                    common things of life and walk grandly<pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7168-270"/> among
                    them; that happiness is a great love and much serving. It was not cut short; and
                    it loved what it had learntâit loved!â</p>
                <p>Was that all she saw in the corner?</p>
                <p>Gregory told the landlady the next morning that she had been wandering all night.
                    Nevertheless, when he came in to give her her breakfast, she was sitting up
                    against the pillows, looking as he had not seen her look before.</p>
                <p>âPut it close to me,â she said, âand when I have had breakfast I am going to
                    dress.â</p>
                <p>She finished all he had brought her eagerly.</p>
                <p>âI am sitting up quite by myself,â she said. âGive me his meat;â and she fed the
                    dog herself, cutting his food small for him. She moved to the side of the
                    bed.</p>
                <p>âNow bring the chair near and dress me. It is being in this room so long, and
                    looking at that miserable little bit of sunshine that comes in through the
                    shutter that is making me so ill.<pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7168-271"/> Always that
                    lion's paw!â she said, with a look of disgust at it. âCome, dress me.â Gregory
                    knelt on the floor before her, and tried to draw on one stocking, but the little
                    swollen foot refused to be covered.</p>
                <p>âIt is very funny that I should have grown so fat since I have been so ill,â she
                    said, peering down curiously. âPerhaps it is want of exercise?â She looked
                    troubled and said again, âPerhaps it is want of exercise?â She wanted Gregory to
                    say so too. But he only found a larger pair; and then tried to force the shoes,
                    oh, so tenderly! on to her little feet.</p>
                <p>âThere,â she said, looking down at them when they were on, with the delight of a
                    small child over its first shoes, âI could walk far now. How nice it looks!â</p>
                <p>âNo,â she said, seeing the soft gown he had prepared for her, âI will not put
                    that on. Get one of my white dressesâthe one with the pink<pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7168-272"/> bows. I do not even want to think I have been ill. It
                    is thinking and thinking of things that makes them real,â she said. âWhen you
                    draw your mind together, and resolve that a thing shall not be, it gives way
                    before you; it is not. Everything is possible if one is resolved,â she said. She
                    drew in her little lips together, and Gregory obeyed her; she was so small and
                    slight now it was like dressing a small doll. He would have lifted her down from
                    the bed when he had finished, but she pushed him from her, laughing very softly.
                    It was the first time she had laughed in those long, dreary months.</p>
                <p>âNo, no; I can get down myself,â she said, slipping cautiously on to the floor.
                    âYou see!â She cast a defiant glance of triumph when she stood there. âHold the
                    curtain up high, I want to look at myself.â</p>
                <p>He raised it, and stood holding it. She looked into the glass on the opposite
                    wall. Such a<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7168-273"/> queenly little figure in its pink
                    and white. Such a transparent little face, refined by suffering into an almost
                    angel-like beauty. The face looked at her, she looked back, laughing softly.
                    Doss, quivering with excitement, ran round her, barking. She took one step
                    toward the door, balancing herself with outstretched hands.</p>
                <p>âI am nearly there,â she said.</p>
                <p>Then she groped blindly.</p>
                <p>âOh, I cannot see! I cannot see! Where am I?â she cried.</p>
                <p>When Gregory reached her she had fallen with her face against the sharp foot of
                    the wardrobe and cut her forehead. Very tenderly he raised the little crushed
                    heap of clothes and flesh, and laid it on the bed. Doss climbed up, and sat
                    looking down at it. Very softly Gregory's hands disrobed her.</p>
                <p>âYou will be stronger to-morrow, and then we<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7168-274"/>
                    shall try again,â he said, but she neither looked at him nor stirred.</p>
                <p>When he had undressed her, and laid her in bed, Doss stretched himself across her
                    feet and lay, whining softly.</p>
                <p>So she lay all that morning, and all that afternoon.</p>
                <p>Again and again Gregory crept close to the bedside and looked at her; but she did
                    not speak to him. Was it stupor or was it sleep that shone under those
                    half-closed eyelids. Gregory could not tell.</p>
                <p>At last in the evening he bent over her.</p>
                <p>âThe oxen have come,â he said; âwe can start to-morrow if you like. Shall I get
                    the waggon ready?â</p>
                <p>Twice he repeated his question. Then she looked up at him, and Gregory saw that
                    all hope had died out of the beautiful eyes. It was not stupor that shone there,
                    it was despair.</p>
                <p>âLet us go,â she said.</p>
                <pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7168-275"/>
                <p>âIt makes no difference,â said the doctor; âstaying or going; it is close
                    now.â</p>
                <p>So the next day Gregory carried her out in his arms to the waggon which stood
                    âinspannedâ before the door. As he laid her down on the âkartelâ she looked far
                    out across the plain. For the first time she had spoken that day.</p>
                <p>âThat blue mountain,â she said, âfar away; let us stop when we get to it, not
                    before.â She closed her eyes again. He drew the sails down before and behind,
                    and the waggon rolled away slowly.</p>
                <p>Very silently the great waggon rolled along the grass-covered plain. The driver
                    on the front box did not clap his whip or call to his oxen, and Gregory sat
                    beside him with folded arms. Behind them, in the closed waggon, she lay with the
                    dog at her feet, very quiet with folded hands. He, Gregory, dared not be in
                    there. Like Hagar, when she laid her treasure down in the wilderness,<pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7168-276"/> he sat afar off;ââFor Hagar said, Let me not see the
                    death of the child.â</p>
                <p>Evening came, and yet the blue mountain was not reached, and all the next day
                    they rode on slowly, but still it was far off. Only at evening they reached it;
                    not blue now, but low and brown, covered with long waving grasses and rough
                    stones. They drew the waggon up close to its foot for the night. It was a
                    sheltered, warm spot.</p>
                <p>When the dark night had come, when the tired oxen were tied to the wheels, and
                    the driver and leader had rolled themselves in their blankets before the fire,
                    and gone to sleep, then Gregory fastened down the sails of the waggon securely;
                    fixed a long candle near the head of the bed, and lay down himself on the floor
                    of the waggon near the back. He leaned his head against the âkartel,â and
                    listened to the chewing of the tired oxen, and to the crackling of the fire,<pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7168-277"/> till, overpowered by weariness he fell into a
                    heavy sleep. Then all was very still in the waggon. The dog slept on his
                    mistress's feet, and only two mosquitoes, creeping in through a gap in the front
                    sail, buzzed drearily round.</p>
                <p>The night was grown very old when from a long, peaceful sleep Lyndall awoke. The
                    candle burnt at her head, the dog lay on her feet; but he shivered; it seemed as
                    though his resting-place was growing cold. She lay with folded hands, looking
                    upwards; and she heard the oxen chewing, and she saw the two mosquitoes buzzing
                    drearily round and round, and her thoughts,âher thoughts ran far back into the
                    past.</p>
                <p>On her mind through those months of anguish a mist had rested; it was rolled
                    together now, and the old clear intellect awoke from its long torpor. It looked
                    back into the past; it saw the present; there was no future now. The old strong
                    soul gathered itself<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7168-278"/> together for the last
                    time; it knew where it stood.</p>
                <p>Slowly raising herself on her elbow, she took from the sail a glass that hung
                    pinned there. Her fingers were stiff and cold. She put the pillow on her breast,
                    and stood the glass against it. Then the white face on the pillow looked into
                    the white face in the glass. They had looked at each other often so before. It
                    had been a child's face once, looking out above its blue pinafore; it had been a
                    woman's face, with a dim shadow in the eyes, and a deep assurance. âWe are not
                    afraid, you and I; we will fight the world and conquer.â Now to-night it had
                    come to this. The dying eyes on the pillow looked into the dying eyes in the
                    glass; they knew that their hour had come. She raised one hand and pressed the
                    stiff fingers against the glass. They were growing very stiff. She tried to
                    speak to it, but she would never speak again. Only,<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7168-279"/> the wonderful yearning light was in the eyes still.
                    The body was dead now, but the soul, clear and unclouded, looked forth.</p>
                <p>Then slowly, without a sound, the beautiful eyes closed. The dead face that the
                    glass reflected was a thing of marvellous beauty and tranquillity. The Grey Dawn
                    crept in over it and saw it lying there.</p>
                <p>Had she found what she sought forâsomething to worship? Had she ceased from
                    being? Who shall tell us? There is a veil of terrible mist over the face of the
                    Hereafter.</p>

                <p>â<hi rend="b">TELL</hi> me what a soul desires, and I will tell you what it is.â
                    So runs the phrase.</p>
                <p>âTell me what a man dreams, and I will tell you what he loves.â That also has its
                    truth.</p>
                <p>For, ever from the earliest childhood to the latest age, day by day, and step by
                    step, the busy waking life is followed and reflected by the life of
                    dreamsâwaking dreams, sleeping dreams. Weird, misty, and distorted as the
                    inverted image of a mirage, or a figure seen through the mountain mist, they are
                    still the reflections of a reality.</p>
                <p>On the night when Gregory told his story,<pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7168-281"/> Waldo
                    sat alone before the fire, his untasted supper before him. He was weary after
                    his day's workâtoo weary to eat. He put the plate down on the floor for Doss,
                    who licked it clean, and then went back to his corner. After a time the master
                    threw himself across the foot of the bed without undressing, and fell asleep
                    there. He slept so long that the candle burnt itself out, and the room was in
                    darkness. But he dreamed a lovely dream as he lay there.</p>
                <p>In his dream, to his right rose high mountains, their tops crowned with snow,
                    their sides clothed with bush and bathed in the sunshine. At their feet was the
                    sea, blue and breezy, bluer than any earthly sea, like the sea he had dreamed of
                    in his boyhood. In the narrow forest that ran between the mountains and the sea
                    the air was rich that the scent of the honey-creeper that hung from dark green
                    bushes, and through the velvety grass little streams ran purling down into
                        the<pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7168-282"/> sea. He sat on a high square rock
                    among the bushes, and Lyndall sat by him and sang to him. She was only a small
                    child, with a blue pinafore, and a grave, grave, little face. He was looking up
                    at the mountains, then suddenly when he looked round she was gone. He slipped
                    down from his rock, and went to look for her, but he found only her little
                    footmarks; he found them on the bright green grass, and in the moist sand, and
                    there where the little streams ran purling down into the sea. In and out, in and
                    out, and among the bushes where the honey-creeper hung, he went looking for her.
                    At last, far off, in the sunshine, he saw her gathering shells upon the sand.
                    She was not a child now, but a woman, and the sun shone on her soft brown hair,
                    and in her white dress she put the shells she gathered. She was stooping, but
                    when she heard his step she stood up, holding her skirt close about her, and
                    waited for his coming. One hand she put<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7168-283"/> in
                    his, and together they walked on over the glittering sand and pink sea-shells:
                    and they heard the leaves talking, and they heard the waters babbling on their
                    way to the sea, and they heard the sea singing to itself, singing, singing.</p>
                <p>At last they came to a place where was a long reach of pure white sand; there she
                    stood still, and dropped on to the sand one by one the shells that she had
                    gathered. Then she looked up into his face with her beautiful eyes. She said
                    nothing; but she lifted one hand and laid it softly on his forehead; the other
                    she laid on his heart.</p>
                <p>With a cry of suppressed agony Waldo sprung from the bed, flung open the upper
                    half of the door, and leaned out, breathing heavily.</p>
                <p>Great God! it might be only a dream, but the pain was very real, as though a
                    knife ran through his heart, as though some treacherous murderer crept on him in
                    the dark! The strong man drew his breath like a frightened woman.</p>
                <pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7168-284"/>
                <p>âOnly a dream, but the pain was very real,â he muttered, as he pressed his right
                    hand upon his breast. Then he folded his arms on the door, and stood looking out
                    into the starlight.</p>
                <p>The dream was with him still; the woman who was his friend was not separated from
                    him by yearsâonly that very night he had seen her. He looked up into the night
                    sky that all his life long had mingled itself with his existence. There were a
                    thousand faces that he loved looking down at him, a thousand stars in their
                    glory, in crowns, and circles, and solitary grandeur. To the man they were not
                    less dear than to the boy they had been not less mysterious; yet he looked up at
                    them and shuddered; at last turned away from them with horror. Such countless
                    multitudes stretching out far into space, and yet not in one of them all was
                    she! Though he searched through them all, to the farthest,<pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7168-285"/> faintest point of light, nowhere should he ever say,
                    âShe is here!â To-morrow's sun would rise and gild the world's mountains, and
                    shine into its thousand valleys; it would set and the stars creep out again.
                    Year after year, century after century, the old changes of nature would go on,
                    day and night, summer and winter, seed-time and harvest; but in none of them all
                    would she have part!</p>
                <p>He shut the door to keep out their hideous shining, and because the dark was
                    intolerable lit a <choice>
                        <sic>csndle</sic>
                        <corr>candle</corr>
                    </choice>, and paced the little room, faster and faster yet. He saw before him
                    the long ages of eternity that would roll on, on, on, and never bring her. She
                    would exist no more. A dark mist filled the little room.</p>
                <p>âOh, little hand! oh, little voice! oh, little form!â he cried; âoh, little soul
                    that walked with mine! oh, little soul, that looked so fearlessly down into the
                    depths, do you exist no more for<pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7168-286"/> everâfor all
                    time?â He cried more bitterly: âIt is for this hourâthisâthat men blind reason,
                    and crush out thought! For this hourâthis, thisâthey barter truth and knowledge,
                    take any lie, any creed, so it does not whisper to them of the dead that they
                    are dead! Ah, God! God! God! for a Here-after!â</p>
                <p>Pain made his soul weak; it cried for the old faith. They are the tears that fall
                    into the new-made grave that cement the power of the priest. For the cry of the
                    soul that loves and loses is this, only this: âBridge over Death; blend the Here
                    with the Here-after; cause the mortal to robe himself in immortality; let me not
                    say of my Dead that it is dead! I will believe all else, bear all else, endure
                    all else!â</p>
                <p>Muttering to himself, Waldo walked with bent head, the mist in his eyes.</p>
                <p>To the soul's wild cry for its own there are many answers. He began to think of
                        them.<pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7168-287"/> Was not there one of them all from
                    which he might suck one drop of comfort?</p>
                <p>âYou shall see her again,â says the Christian, the true Bible Christian. Yes; you
                    shall see her again. <hi>âAnd I saw the dead, great and small, stand before God.
                        And the books were opened, and the dead were judged from those things which
                        were written in the books. And whosoever was not found written in the book
                        of life was cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death.</hi>â
                    Yes; you shall see her again. She died soâwith her knee unbent, with her hand
                    unraised, with a prayer unuttered, in the pride of her intellect and the
                    strength of her youth. She loved and she was loved; but she said no prayer to
                    God; she cried for no mercy; she repented of no sin. Yes; you <emph>shall</emph>
                    see her again.â</p>
                <p>In his bitterness Waldo laughed low:</p>
                <p>âHa, I have long ceased to hearken to your hellish voice.â</p>
                <pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7168-288"/>
                <p>But yet another speaks.</p>
                <p>âYou shall see her again,â said the nineteenth century Christian, deep into whose
                    soul modern unbelief and thought have crept, though he knows it not. He it is
                    who uses his Bible as the pearl-fishers use their shells, sorting out gems from
                    refuse; he sets his pearls after his own fashion, and he sets them well. âDo not
                    fear,â he says, âhell and judgment are not. God is love. I know that beyond this
                    blue sky above us is a love as widespreading over all. The All-Father will show
                    her to you again; not spirit onlyâthe little hands, the little feet you loved,
                    you shall lie down and kiss them if you will. Christ arose, and did eat and
                    drink, so shall she arise. The dead, all the dead, raised incorruptible! God is
                    love. You shall see her again.â</p>
                <p>It is a heavenly song, this of the nineteenth century Christian. A man might dry
                    his tears<pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7168-289"/> to listen to it, but for this one
                    thing,âWaldo muttered to himself confusedly;â</p>
                <p>âThe thing I loved was a woman proud and young; it had a mother once, who, dying,
                    kissed her little baby, and prayed God that she might see it again. If it had
                    lived the loved thing would itself have had a son, who, when he closed the weary
                    eyes and smoothed the wrinkled forehead of his mother, would have prayed God to
                    see that old face smile again in the Here-after. To the son heaven will be no
                    heaven if the sweet worn face is not in one of the choirs; he will look for it
                    through the phalanx of God's glorified angels; and the youth will look for the
                    maid, and the mother for the baby. âAnd whose then shall she be at the
                    resurrection of the dead?ââ</p>
                <p>âAh, God! ah, God! a beautiful dream,â he cried; âbut can any one dream it not
                    sleeping?â</p>
                <p>Waldo paced on, moaning in agony and longing.</p>
                <p>He heard the Transcendentalist's high answer.</p>
                <pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7168-290"/>
                <p>âWhat have you to do with flesh, the gross and miserable garment in which spirit
                    hides itself? You shall see her again. But the hand, the foot, the forehead you
                    loved, you shall see no more. The loves, the fears, the frailties that are born
                    with the flesh, with the flesh they shall die. Let them die! There is that in
                    man that cannot dieâa seed, a germ an embryo, a spiritual essence. Higher than
                    she was on earth, as the tree is higher than the seed, the man than the embryo,
                    so shall you behold her; changed, glorified!â</p>
                <p>High words, ringing well; they are the offering of jewels to the hungry, of gold
                    to the man who dies for bread. Bread is corruptible, gold is incorruptible;
                    bread is light, gold is heavy; bread is common, gold is rare; but the hungry man
                    will barter all your mines for one morsel of bread. Around God's throne there
                    may be choirs and companies of angels, cherubim<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7168-291"/> and seraphim, rising tier above tier, but not for one of them all does the
                    soul cry aloud. Only perhaps for a little human woman full of sin, that it once
                    loved.</p>
                <p>âChange is death, change is death,â he cried. âI want no angel, only she; no
                    holier and no better, with all her sins upon her, so give her me or give me
                    nothing!â</p>
                <p>And, truly, does not the heart love its own with the <emph>strongest</emph>
                    passion for their very frailties? Heaven might keep its angels if men were but
                    left to men.</p>
                <p>âChange is death,â he cried, âchange is death! Who dares to say the body never
                    dies, because it turns again to grass and flowers? And yet they dare to say the
                    spirit never dies, because in space some strange unearthly being may have sprung
                    up upon its ruins. Leave me! Leave me!â he cried in frantic bitterness. âGive me
                    back what I have lost, or give me nothing!â</p>
                <pb n="289" xml:id="VAB7168-292"/>
                <p>For the soul's fierce cry for immortality is thisâthis only:âReturn to me after
                    death the thing as it was before. Leave me in the Here-after the being that I am
                    to-day. Rob me of the thoughts, the feelings, the desires that are my life, and
                    you have left nothing to take. Your immortality is annihilation, your Here-after
                    is a lie.</p>
                <p>Waldo flung open the door, and walked out into the starlight, his pain-stricken
                    thoughts ever driving him on as he paced there.</p>
                <p>âThere must be a Here-after because man longs for it?â he whispered. âIs not all
                    life from the cradle to the grave one long yearning for that which we never
                    touch? There must be a Here-after because we cannot think of any end to life.
                    Can we think of a beginning? Is it easier to say âI was notâ than to say âI
                    shall not beâ? And yet, where were we ninety years ago? Dreams, dreams!<pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7168-293"/> Ah, all dreams and lies! No ground
                    anywhere.â</p>
                <p>He went back into the cabin and walked there. Hour after hour passed, and he was
                    thinkingâdreaming.</p>
                <p>For, mark you, men <emph>will</emph> dream; the most that can be asked of them is
                    but that the dream be not in too glaring discord with the thing they know. He
                    walked with bent head.</p>
                <p>âAll dies, all dies!â he muttered; âthe roses are red with the matter that once
                    reddened the cheek of the child; the flowers bloom the fairest on the last
                    year's battle-ground; the work of death's finger cunningly wreathed over is at
                    the heart of all things, even of the living. Death's finger is everywhere. The
                    rocks are built up of a life that was. Bodies, thoughts, and loves die: from
                    where springs that whisper to the tiny soul of man, âYou shall not dieâ? Ah, is
                    there no truth of which this dream is shadow?â</p>
                <pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7168-294"/>
                <p>He fell into perfect silence. And, at last, as he walked there with his bent
                    head, his soul passed down the steps of contemplation into that vast land where
                    there is always peace; that land where the soul, gazing long, loses all
                    consciousness of its little self, and almost feels its hand on the old mystery
                    of Universal Unity that surrounds it.</p>
                <p>âNo death, no death,â he muttered; âthere is that which never diesâwhich abides.
                    It is but the individual that perishes, the whole remains. It is the organism
                    that vanishes, the atoms are there. It is but the man that dies, the Universal
                    Whole of which he is part reworks him into its inmost self. Ah, what matter that
                    man's day be short!âthat the sunrise sees him, and the sunset sees his grave;
                    that of which he is but the breath has breathed him forth and drawn him back
                    again. That abidesâwe abide.â</p>
                <p>For the little soul that cries aloud for <choice>

                    and its beloved, there is no help. For the soul which knows itself no more as a
                    unit, but as a part of the Universal Unity of which the Beloved also is a part;
                    which feels within itself the throb of the Universal Life; for that soul there
                    is no death.</p>
                <p>âLet us die, beloved, you and I, that we may pass on forever through the
                    Universal Life!â In that deep world of contemplation all fierce desires die out,
                    and peace comes down. He, Waldo, as he walked there, saw no more the world that
                    was about him; cried out no more for the thing that he had lost. His soul
                    rested. Was it only John, think you, who saw the heavens open? The dreamers see
                    it every day.</p>
                <p>Long years before the father had walked there, and seen quires of angels, and a
                    prince of peace like unto men, but clothed in immortality. The son's knowledge
                    was not as the father's,<pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7168-296"/> therefore the dream
                    was new-tinted, but the sweetness was all there, the infinite peace, that men
                    find not in the little cankered kingdom of the tangible. The bars of the real
                    are set close about us; we cannot open our wings but they are struck against
                    them, and drop bleeding. But, when we glide between the bars into the great
                    unknown beyond, we may sail forever in the glorious blue, seeing nothing but our
                    own shadows.</p>
                <p>So age succeeds age, and dream succeeds dream, and of the joy of the dreamer no
                    man knoweth but he who dreameth.</p>
                <p>Our fathers had their dream; we have ours; the generation that follows will have
                    its own. Without dreams and phantoms man cannot exist.</p>

                <head type="sub">WALDO GOES OUT TO SIT IN THE SUNSHINE.</head>
                <p><hi rend="b">IT</hi> had been a princely day. The long morning had melted slowly
                    into a rich afternoon. Rains had covered the karroo with a heavy coat of green
                    that hid the red earth everywhere. In the very chinks of the stone walls dark
                    green leaves hung out, and beauty and growth had crept even into the beds of the
                    sandy furrows, and lined them with weeds. On the broken sod walls of the old
                    pigsty chick-weeds flourished, and ice-plants lifted their transparent leaves.
                    Waldo was at work in the waggon-house again. He was making a kitchen-table for
                    Em. As the long curls gathered in heaps before his plane, he<pb n="295" xml:id="VAB7168-298"/> paused for an instant now and again to throw one down
                    to a small naked nigger, who had crept from its mother who stood churning in the
                    sunshine, and had crawled into the waggon-house. From time to time the little
                    animal lifted its fat hand as it expected a fresh shower of curls; till Doss,
                    jealous of his master's noticing any other small creature but himself, would
                    catch the curl in his mouth and roll the little Kaffir over in the saw-dust,
                    much to that small animal's contentment. It was too lazy an afternoon to be
                    really ill-natured, so Doss satisfied himself with snapping at the little
                    nigger's fingers, and sitting on him till he laughed. Waldo, as he worked,
                    glanced down at them now and then, and smiled; but he never looked out across
                    the plain. He was conscious without looking of that broad green earth; it made
                    his work pleasant to him. Near the shadow at the gable the mother of the little
                    nigger stood churning. Slowly she raised<pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7168-299"/> and
                    let fall the stick in her hands, murmuring to herself a sleepy chant such as her
                    people love; it sounded like the humming of far-off bees.</p>
                <p>A different life showed itself in the front of the house, where Tant' Sannie's
                    cart stood ready inspanned, and the Boer-woman herself sat in the front room
                    drinking coffee. She had come to visit her step-daughter, probably for the last
                    time, as she now weighed two hundred and sixty pounds, and was not easily able
                    to move. On a chair sat her mild young husband nursing the babyâa pudding-faced,
                    weak-eyed child.</p>
                <p>âYou take it and get into the cart with it,â said Tant' Sannie. âWhat do you want
                    here, listening to our woman's talk?â</p>
                <p>The young man arose, and meekly went out with the baby.</p>
                <p>âI'm very glad you are going to be married, my child,â said Tant' Sannie, as she
                    drained the last drop from her coffee cup. âI wouldn't say<pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7168-300"/> so while that boy was here, it would make him too
                    conceited; but marriage is the finest thing in the world. I've been at it three
                    times, and if it pleased God to take this husband from me I should have another.
                    There's nothing like it, my child; nothing.â</p>
                <p>âPerhaps it might not suit all people, at all times, as well as it suits you,
                    Tant' Sannie,â said Em. There was a little shade of weariness in the voice.</p>
                <p>âNot suit every one!â said Tant' Sannie. âIf the beloved Redeemer didn't mean men
                    to have wives what did He make women for? That's what I say. If a woman's old
                    enough to marry and doesn't she's sinning against the Lordâit's a wanting to
                    know better than Him. What, does she think the Lord took all that trouble in
                    making her for nothing? It's evident He wants babies, otherwise why does He send
                    them? Not that I've done much in that way myself,â said<pb n="298" xml:id="VAB7168-301"/> Tant' Sannie, sorrowfully; âbut I've done my
                    best.â</p>
                <p>She rose with some difficulty from her chair, and began moving slowly toward the
                    door.</p>
                <p>âIt's a strange thing,â she said, âbut you can't love a man till you've had a
                    baby by him. Now there's that boy there,âwhen we were first married if he only
                    sneezed in the night I boxed his ears; now if he lets his pipe-ash come on my
                    milk-cloths I don't think of laying a finger on him. There's nothing like being
                    married,â said Tant' Sannie, as she puffed toward the door. âIf a woman's got a
                    baby and a husband she's got the best things the Lord can give her; if only the
                    baby doesn't have convulsions. As for a husband, it's very much the same who one
                    has. Some men are fat, and some men are thin; some men drink brandy, and some
                    men drink gin; but it all comes to the<pb n="299" xml:id="VAB7168-302"/> same
                    thing in the end; it's all one. A man's a man, you know.â</p>
                <p>Here they came upon Gregory, who was sitting in the shade before the house. Tant'
                    Sannie shook hands with him.</p>
                <p>âI'm glad you're going to get married,â she said. âI hope you'll have as many
                    children in five years as a cow has calves, and more too. I think I'll just go
                    and have a look at your soap-pot before I start,â she said, turning to Em. âNot
                    that I believe in this new plan of putting soda in the pot. If the dear Father
                    had meant soda to be put into soap what would He have made milk-bushes for, and
                    stuck them all over the âveldâ as thick as lambs in the lambing season?â</p>
                <p>She waddled off after Em in the direction of the built-in soap-pot, leaving
                    Gregory as they found him, with his dead pipe lying on the bench beside him, and
                    his blue eyes gazing out far<pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7168-303"/> across the flat,
                    like one who sits on the sea-shore watching that which is fading, fading from
                    him. Against his breast was a letter found in the desk addressed to himself, but
                    never posted. It held only four words: âYou must marry Em.â He wore it in a
                    black bag round his neck. It was the only letter she had ever written to
                    him.</p>
                <p>âYou see if the sheep don't have the scab this year!â said Tant' Sannie as she
                    waddled after Em. âIt's with all these new inventions that the wrath of God
                        <emph>must</emph> fall on us. What were the children of Israel punished for,
                    if it wasn't for making a golden calf? I may have my sins, but I do remember the
                    tenth commandment. âHonour thy father and mother that it may be well with thee,
                    and that thou mayest live long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee!â
                    It's all very well to say we honour them, and then to be finding out things<pb n="301" xml:id="VAB7168-304"/> that they never knew, and doing things in a
                    way that they never did them! <emph>My</emph> mother boiled soap with bushes,
                    and I will boil soap with bushes. If the wrath of God is to fall upon this
                    land,â said Tant' Sannie, with the serenity of conscious virtue, âit shall not
                    be through me. Let them make their steam-waggons and their fire-carriages; let
                    them go on as though the dear Lord didn't know what He was about when He gave
                    horses and oxen legs,âthe destruction of the Lord will follow them. I don't know
                    how such people read their Bibles. When do we hear of Moses or Noah riding in a
                    railway? The Lord sent fire-carriages out of heaven in those days: there's no
                    chance of His sending them for us if we go on in this way,â said Tant' Sannie
                    sorrowfully, thinking of the splendid chance which this generation had lost.</p>
                <p>Arrived at the soap-pot she looked over into it thoughtfully.</p>
                <pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7168-305"/>
                <p>âDepend upon it you'll get the itch, or some other disease; the blessing of the
                    Lord'll never rest upon it,â said the Boer-woman. Then suddenly she broke forth.
                    âAnd she eighty-two, and goats, and rams, and eight thousand morgan, and the
                    rams real angora, and two thousand sheep, and a shorthorn bull,â said Tant'
                    Sannie, standing upright and planting a hand on each hip.</p>
                <p>Em looked at her in silent wonder. Had connubial bliss and the joys of motherhood
                    really turned the old Boer-woman's head?</p>
                <p>âYes,â said Tant' Sannie; âI had almost forgotten to tell you. By the Lord if I
                    had him here! We were walking to church last Sacrament Sunday, Piet and I. Close
                    in front of us with old Tant' Trana, with dropsy and cancer, and can't live
                    eight months. Walking by her was something with its hands under its coat-tails,
                    flap, flap, flap; and its chin in the air,<pb n="303" xml:id="VAB7168-306"/> and
                    a stick-up collar, and the black hat on the very back of the head. I knew him!
                    âWho's that?â I asked. âThe rich Englishman that Tant' Trana married last week.â
                    âRich Englishman! I'll rich Englishman him,â I said; âI'll tell Tant' Trana a
                    thing or two.â My fingers were just in his little white curls. If it hadn't been
                    the blessed Sacrament, he wouldn't have walked so âsourka, sourka, courka,â any
                    more. But I thought, wait till I've had it, and thenâ. But he, sly fox, son of
                    Satan, seed of the Amalekite, he saw me looking at him in the church. The
                    blessed Sacrament wasn't half over when he takes Tant' Trana by the arm, and out
                    they go. I clap my baby down to its father, and I go after them. But,â said
                    Tant' Sannie, regretfully, âI couldn't get up to them; I am too fat. When I got
                    to the corner he was pulling Tant' Trana up into the cart. âTant' Trana,â I
                    said, âyou've married a Kaffir's dog,<pb n="304" xml:id="VAB7168-307"/> a
                    Hottentot's brakje.â I hadn't any more breath. He winked at me; he winked at
                        <emph>me</emph>,â said Tant' Sannie, her sides shaking with indignation,
                    âfirst with one eye, and then with the other, and then drove away. Child of the
                    Amalekite!â said Tant' Sannie, âif it hadn't been the blessed Sacrament. Lord,
                    Lord, Lord!â</p>
                <p>Here the little Bush-girl came running to say that the horses would stand no
                    longer, and still breathing out vengeance against her old adversary she laboured
                    toward the cart. Shaking hands and affectionately kissing Em, she was with some
                    difficulty drawn up. Then slowly the cart rolled away, the good Boer-woman
                    putting her head out between the sails to smile and nod. Em stood watching it
                    for a time, then as the sun dazzled her eyes she turned away. There was no use
                    in going to sit with Gregory: he liked best sitting there alone, staring across
                    the the green karroo; and till the maid had done churning<pb n="305" xml:id="VAB7168-308"/> there was nothing to do; so Em walked away to the
                    waggon-house, and climbed on to the end of Waldo's table, and sat there,
                    swinging one little foot slowly to and fro, while the wooden curls from the
                    plane heaped themselves up against her black print dress.</p>
                <p>âWaldo,â she said at last, âGregory has given me the money he got for the waggon
                    and oxen, and I have fifty pounds besides that once belonged to some one. I know
                    what they would have liked to have done with it. You must take it and go to some
                    place and study for a year or two.â</p>
                <p>âNo, little one, I will not take it,â he said, as he planed slowly away; âthe
                    time was when I would have been very grateful to any one who would have given me
                    a little money, a little help, a little power of gaining knowledge. But now, I
                    have gone so far alone I may go on to the end. I don't want it, little one.â</p>
                <pb n="306" xml:id="VAB7168-309"/>
                <p>She did not seem pained at his refusal, but swung her foot to and fro, the little
                    old wrinkled forehead more wrinkled up than ever.</p>
                <p>âWhy is it always so, Waldo, always so?â she said; âwe long for things, and long
                    for them, and pray for them; we would give all we have to come near to them, but
                    we never reach them. Then at last, too late, just when we don't want them any
                    more, when all the sweetness is taken out of them, then they come. We don't want
                    them then,â she said, folding their hands resignedly on her little apron. After
                    a while she added: âI remember once, very long ago, when I was a very little
                    girl, my mother had a work-box full of coloured reels. I always wanted to play
                    with them, but she would never let me. At last one day she said I might take the
                    box. I was so glad I hardly knew what to do. I ran round the house, and sat down
                    with it on the back steps.<pb n="307" xml:id="VAB7168-310"/> But when I opened
                    the box all the cottons were taken out.â</p>
                <p>She sat for a while longer, till the Kaffir maid had finished churning, and was
                    carrying the butter toward the house. Then Em prepared to slip off the table,
                    but first she laid her little hand on Waldo's. He stopped his planing and looked
                    up.</p>
                <p>âGregory is going to the town to-morrow. He is going to give in our bans to the
                    minister; we are going to be married in three weeks.â</p>
                <p>Waldo lifted her very gently from the table. He did not congratulate her; perhaps
                    he thought of the empty box, but he kissed her forehead gravely.</p>
                <p>She walked away toward the house, but stopped when she got half-way. âI will
                    bring you a glass of buttermilk when it is cool,â she called out; and soon her
                    clear voice came ringing out through the back windows as she<pb n="308" xml:id="VAB7168-311"/> sang the âBlue Waterâ to herself, and washed the
                    butter.</p>
                <p>Waldo did not wait till she returned. Perhaps he had at last really grown weary
                    of work; perhaps he felt the waggon-house chilly (for he had shuddered two or <choice>
                        <sic>hree</sic>
                        <corr>three</corr>
                    </choice> times), though this was hardly likely in that warm summer weather; or,
                    perhaps, and most probably, one of his old dreaming fits had come upon him
                    suddenly. He put his tools together, ready for to-morrow, and walked slowly out.
                    At the side of the waggon-house there was a world of bright sunshine, and a hen
                    with her chickens was scratching among the gravel. Waldo seated himself near
                    them with his back against the red-brick wall. The long afternoon was half
                    spent, and the kopje was just beginning to cast its shadow over the round-headed
                    yellow flowers that grew between it and the farm-house. Among the flowers the
                    white butterflies hovered and on the old âkraalâ<pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7168-312"/> mounds three white kids gamboled, and at the door of one of the huts an old
                    grey-headed Kaffir-woman sat on the ground mending her mats. A balmy, restful
                    peacefulness seemed to reign everywhere. Even the old hen seemed well-satisfied.
                    She scratched among the stones and called to her chickens when she found a
                    treasure; and all the while tucked to herself with intense inward satisfaction.
                    Waldo, as he sat with his knees drawn up to his chin and his arms folded on
                    them, looked at it all and smiled. An evil world, a deceitful, treacherous,
                    mirage-like world, it might be; but a lovely world for all that, and to sit
                    there gloating in the sunlight was perfect. It was worth having been a little
                    child, and having cried and prayed so one might sit there. He moved his hands as
                    though he were washing them in the sunshine. There will always be something
                    worth living for while there are shimmery afternoons. Waldo chuckled with
                        intense<pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7168-313"/> inward satisfaction as the old hen
                    had doneâshe, over the insects and the warmth; he, over the old brick-walls, and
                    the haze, and the little bushes. Beauty is God's wine, with which He recompenses
                    the souls that love Him; <choice>
                        <sic>he</sic>
                        <corr>He</corr>
                    </choice> makes them drunk.</p>
                <p>The fellow looked, and at last stretched out one hand to a little ice-plant that
                    grew on the sod wall of the sty; not as though he would have picked it, but as
                    it were in a friendly greeting. He loved it. One little leaf of the ice-plant
                    stood upright, and the sun shone through it. He could see every little crystal
                    cell like a drop of ice in the transparent green, and it thrilled him.</p>
                <p>There are only rare times when a man's soul can see Nature. So long as any
                    passion holds its revel there, the eyes are holden that they should not see
                    her.</p>
                <p>Go out if you will, and walk alone on the<pb n="311" xml:id="VAB7168-314"/>
                    hill-side in the evening, but if your favourite child lies ill at home, or your
                    lover comes to-morrow, or at your heart there lies a scheme for the holding of
                    wealth, then you will return as you went out; you will have seen nothing. For
                    Nature, ever, like the old Hebrew God, cries out, âThou shalt have no other gods
                    before me.â Only then, when there comes a pause, a blank in your life, when the
                    old idol is broken, when the old hope is dead, when the old desire is crushed,
                    then the Divine compensation of Nature is made manifest. She shows herself to
                    you. So near she draws you, that the blood seems to flow from her to you,
                    through a still uncut cord: you feel the throb of her life.</p>
                <p>When that day comes, that you sit down broken, without one human creature to whom
                    you cling, with your loves the dead and the living-dead; when the very thirst
                    for knowledge through<pb n="312" xml:id="VAB7168-315"/> long-continued thwarting
                    has grown dull; when in the present there is no craving, and in the future no
                    hope, then, oh, with a beneficent tenderness, Nature enfolds you.</p>
                <p>Then the large white snow-flakes as they flutter down, softly, one by one,
                    whisper soothingly, âRest, poor heart, rest!â It is as though our mother
                    smoothed our hair, and we are comforted.</p>
                <p>And yellow-legged bees as they hum make a dreamy lyric; and the light on the
                    brown stone wall is a great work of art; and the light through the leaves makes
                    the pulses beat.</p>
                <p>Well to die then; for, if you live, so surely as the years come, so surely as the
                    spring succeeds the winter, so surely will passions arise. They will creep back,
                    one by one, into the bosom that has cast them forth, and fasten there again, and
                    peace will go. Desire, <choice>
                        <orig>ambi-</orig>
                        <reg>ambition</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="313" xml:id="VAB7168-316"/> tion, and the fierce agonizing flood
                    of love for the livingâthey will spring again. Then Nature will draw down her
                    veil; with all your longing you shall not be able to raise one corner; you
                    cannot bring back those peaceful days. Well to die then!</p>
                <p>Sitting there with his arms folded on his knees, and his hat slouched down over
                    his face, Waldo looked out into the yellow sunshine that tinted even the very
                    air with the colour of ripe corn, and was happy.</p>
                <p>He was an uncouth creature with small learning, and no prospect in the future but
                    that of making endless tables and stone-walls, yet it seemed to him as he sat
                    there that life was a rare and very rich thing. He rubbed his hands in the
                    sunshine. Ah, to live on so, year after year, how well! Always in the present;
                    letting each day glide, bringing its<pb n="314" xml:id="VAB7168-317"/> own
                    labour, and its own beauty; the gradual lighting up of the hills, night and the
                    stars, fire-light and the coals! To live on so, calmly, far from the paths of
                    men; and to look at the lives of clouds and insects; to look deep into the heart
                    of flowers, and see how lovingly the pistil and the stamens nestle there
                    together; and to see in the thorn-pods how the little seeds suck their life
                    through the delicate curled-up string, and how the little embryo sleeps inside!
                    Well, how well, to sit so on one side taking no part in the world's life; but
                    when great men blossom into books looking into those flowers also, to see how
                    the world of men too opens beautifully, leaf after leaf. Ah! life is delicious;
                    well to live long, and see the darkness breaking, and the day coming! The day
                    when soul shall not thrust back soul that would come to it; when men shall not
                    be driven to seek solitude because of the crying out of their<pb n="315" xml:id="VAB7168-318"/> hearts for love and sympathy. Well to live long and
                    see the new time breaking. Well to live long; life is sweet, sweet, sweet! In
                    his breast pocket, where of old the broken slate used to be, there was now a
                    little dancing-shoe of his friend who was sleeping. He could feel it when he
                    folded his arm tight against his breast; and that was well also. He drew his hat
                    lower over his eyes and sat so motionless that the chickens thought he was
                    asleep, and gathered closer around him. One even ventured to peck at his boot;
                    but he ran away quickly. Tiny, yellow fellow that he was, he knew that men were
                    dangerous; even sleeping they might awake. But Waldo did not sleep, and coming
                    back from his sunshiny dream, stretched out his hand for the tiny thing to
                    mount. But the chicken eyed the hand askance, and then ran off to hide under<pb n="316" xml:id="VAB7168-319"/> its mother's wing, and from beneath it it
                    sometimes put out its round head to peep at the great figure sitting there.
                    Presently its brothers ran off after a little white moth, and it ran out to join
                    them; and when the moth fluttered away over their heads they stood looking up
                    disappointed, and then ran back to their mother.</p>
                <p>Waldo through his half-closed eyes looked at them. Thinking, fearing, craving,
                    those tiny sparks of brother life, what were they, so real there in that old
                    yard on that sunshiny afternoon? A few yearsâwhere would they be? Strange little
                    brother spirits! He stretched his hand toward them, for his heart went out to
                    them; but not one of the little creatures came nearer him, and he watched them
                    gravely for a time; then he smiled, and began muttering to himself after his old
                    fashion. Afterward he folded his arms upon his knees, and rested his<pb n="317" xml:id="VAB7168-320"/> forehead on them. And so he sat there in the yellow
                    sunshine, muttering, muttering, muttering, to himself.</p>
                <p>It was not very long after when Em came out at the back-door with a towel thrown
                    across her head, and in her hand a cup of milk.</p>
                <p>âAh,â she said, coming close to him, âhe is sleeping now. He will find it when he
                    wakes, and be glad of it.â</p>
                <p>She put it down upon the ground beside him. The mother-hen was at work still
                    among the stones, but the chickens had climbed about him and were perching on
                    him. One stood upon his shoulder, and rubbed its little head softly against his
                    black curls: another tried to balance itself on the very edge of the old felt
                    hat. One tiny fellow stood upon his hand, and tried to crow; another had nestled
                    itself down comfortably on the old coat-sleeve, and gone to sleep there.</p>
                <pb n="318" xml:id="VAB7168-321"/>
                <p>Em did not drive them away; but she covered the glass softly at his side. âHe
                    will wake soon,â she said, âand be glad of it.â</p>
                <p>But the chickens were wiser.</p>
