            The Fine Arts in

            During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, as the wealth of the middle class in the 
                        United States
                     increased, the market for art works of all kinds expanded. Museums sprang up, centers
                    of art instruction rose, and public buildings and monuments were constructed throughout the country,
                    broadening the field for painters, sculptors, and architects. The Centennial Exposition of 1876 at 
                        Philadelphia
                     had given the people of this country an opportunity to see the art of the world, and
                    thereafter it was usual for anyone who could afford it to go to Europe at least once and bring home
                    one or more copies of work of the old masters. In 
                        Indianapolis
                     local painters were also patronized, and homes of means usually displayed one or more
                    paintings by Jacob Cox or some other local artist.1
            
            People of 
                        Indianapolis
                     were of the general opinion that Hoosiers were artistic, and those of the Capital City
                    especially so. Yet homes of the period though indicating some artistic sense lacked any unified
                    planning to make it effective. Each owner sought to build something that would be the handsomest
                    thing of its kind in the city and at the same time be as nearly unique as possible. Certainly the
                    result was the greatest possible degree of variety and originality. Some houses resembled castles or
                    fortresses, others looked like martin boxes or pyramids. Some seemed all roof, others all gables,
                    and still others appeared to be piles of assorted bay windows. Exterior decorations were glaring and
                    unusual in

                     the extreme. One house was painted yellow with a red roof; a
                    dark green one displayed darker green shutters; other houses were pink and brown, red and white,
                    drab and green, and one literally showed all the colors of the rainbow. Cupolas, odd front doors,
                    and roof towers were distributed without much forethought. In the interior it was fashionable to
                    exhibit evidence of an artistic temperament. The young daughter of the household was encouraged to
                    develop her talents, and quantities of her work were on display in the parlors of her home and those
                    of her friends. Such examples were sure to include a magnificent oil painting on velvet, the current
                        craze.2 All felt that in this artistic atmosphere 
                        Indianapolis
                     presented a unique "blend of a superior town joining forces spiritually with
                    superior artist folk; forces so well knit that the changing ways of modern towns cannot defeat the
                    persistence of spiritual influence." And those influences are said still to exist among
                    teachers and some students active today.3
            
            Jacob Cox, veteran portrait and landscape painter of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , was still active in the eighties. After he came to the city in 1833, he was for nearly
                    twenty-five years the only painter there. There were some who came for brief periods to drift on to
                    other cities, but Cox stayed. His only absence was a short period in the forties when he maintained
                    a studio with John Dunn in 
                        Cincinnati
                    . His career in 
                        Indianapolis
                     helped develop in the public mind an appreciation for art works and to some extent
                    ability to produce them. His pupils were not numerous; probably the most distinguished among them
                    were Mrs. Lottie Guffin, his daughter Julia (who later married Albert S. White of 
                        Lafayette
                    ), and Henry W. Waugh. Cox's last portrait dated accurately was that of John
                    Coburn, painted in 1883; but his landscape painting continued for several years, and he was invited
                    to send this work to local exhibitions. His painting of "The Old Swimmin'
                    Hole" as idealized by James Whitcomb Riley was said to be one of his best.4 As younger and more vigorous men returned from the 
                        Paris
                     and Munich studios, Cox's work became less popular. During the last years of

                    Mrs. Jerome G. Whitcomb, on North 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Street. He died in 1892.5
            
            Mrs. Lottie Guffin enjoyed considerable success during the 1880's. Her paintings were much
                    admired by people in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and some of her pictures were sold abroad. She painted rapidly and conscientiously.
                    Most of her work was sold while still on the easel, so she rarely had any finished ones to show in
                    her studio. Her painting, "Lost," was sold to Mrs. Albert S. White (Julia Cox).6
            
            The first art school of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , the "Indiana School of Art," 1877-1879, had closed, probably as a
                    result of hard times,7 although William Forsyth suggested other reasons: that
                    pupils dropped out when they found art was really difficult; that the time was not ripe for the
                    school; that Hoosier art students left for European studios; and that the school lacked solid
                    financial backing.8 In any case it lacked both sufficient pupils and funds to
                    operate and, therefore, closed. But its effect lingered on. A spirit had been awakened. For a time
                    interested students continued to paint in John W. Love's studio under his guidance.9 His skill in drawing, the seriousness with which he regarded artistic
                    endeavor, so inspired his pupils that his influence did not end with his death, June 24, 1880, but
                    carried over from one generation of pupils to another. After his death the little group that had
                    clung so faithfully to their palettes and brushes since the closing of the art school, formed a club
                    which gave them a reason, a time, and place to carry on their work. They called it the
                    Bohé Club, an accidental shortening of "Bohemian" when a painter was
                    told to cut that word in half so he would have space to paint it on the door of their club room. The
                    regular members of this little club were: Frederick A. Hetherington, Thomas E. Hibben, Charles
                    Fiscus, Will Ebbert,

                     Frank Scott, William Forsyth, and Charles Nickoli. Associate
                    members were George Cottman, Clarence Forsyth, and Hartzell Stem. Since most of the arts were
                    represented, activities were quite varied, and much real work was done. Finally as members left the
                    city, married, or went into business of one kind or another, the club ceased to exist.10 Just when is not certain; William Forsyth, in his account, gave no date for its
                        demise.11 Nevertheless it served to nourish the artistic spirit which had
                    been stirred by the Love-Gookins art school, and helped provide a basis for the work of the Art
                    Association which was organized in 1883. It may be that some of the paintings done at the
                    Bohé Club by its members proved of material assistance in early exhibitions sponsored by
                    the 1883 Art Association.12
            
            James F. Gookins, who had left the art school before its closing, went afterwards to 
                        Terre Haute
                    , his home town, and opened a studio. In 1883 he served as assistant commissioner to the 
                        Vienna
                     Exposition; later, in 1887, he actively promoted the erection of a soldiers'
                    monument and was made secretary of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument Commission
                    of Indiana.13
            
            In January, 1880, Mrs. David Coffin and Miss Sue Ketcham canvassed the city to learn that public
                    sentiment favored reviving the art school.14 William M. R. French, director of
                    the Academy of Fine Arts of 
                        Chicago
                    , then responded to an invitation to give a lecture. He told his audience that art would
                    soon be a part of general education and recommended that a school be established. Free tuition would
                    be unwise, he said, and the school should be supported by a stock company with a sinking fund.15 Not long after this lecture an exhibition of paintings, the best works of art
                    from private collections in the city, was shown in the Vance Block. Genuine interest made it
                    necessary to extend the period of the showing.16 In the fall, Mrs. J. Cooley
                    Fletcher and her pupils displayed their work at Benjamin Harrison's

                     home and also at the State Fair.17 In 1881
                    and again in 1882, upon the invitation of Mrs. May Wright Sewall, Mrs. Nancy H. Adsit of
                            
                  Milwaukee, Wisconsin
               , delivered a series of illustrated lectures on art. At the
                    close of one of these, in March, 1883, Mrs. Sewall asked all who were interested to meet at her home
                    to discuss ways and means by which the art appreciation and enthusiasm aroused by the recent
                    activities—exhibits and lectures—could be given direction, purpose, and a
                    permanent form.18 As a result a committee was appointed to draw up a
                    constitution which was adopted at a meeting held May 7, 1883, at the Denison Hotel.19 On October 11, 1883, the Art Association was incorporated with a membership of
                        fifty-four.20
            
            The first officers were: president, Albert E. Fletcher; vice presidents, Mrs. Mary Sharpe Moore, Mrs.
                    Laurel Locke Fletcher, and Mrs. Mary Sanders Judah; recording secretary, Mrs. May Wright Sewall;
                    secretary, Miss Anna Dunlop; corresponding secretary, H. B. Palmer; and seven directors, including
                    Sue M. Ketcham, Thomas E. Hibben, and Rev. Nathaniel A. Hyde. The membership was divided into groups
                    of colorists, etchers, and students of the history and literature of art.21
            
            An art loan exhibition was planned for November, with Sue Ketcham as manager.22
                    After several weeks diligent search throughout the East, Miss Ketcham succeeded in collecting nearly
                    500 pictures from 137 different artists, including works of two local artists, William M. Chase and
                    Charles J. Fiscus. This collection was shown in the English Hotel through November, 1883, for an
                    admission fee of twenty-five cents. Some of the paintings were owned locally, but many were borrowed
                    from eastern artists and connoisseurs.

                     At the close of the exhibition the officers of the Art
                    Association planned to open a school.23
            
            On January 10, 1884, the second art school began with two instructors, Charles F. McDonald of the 
                        Chicago
                     Art League, and Sue M. Ketcham of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and with the business management in the hands of Miss Anna Dunlop, Henry S. Fraser,
                    and Mrs. May Wright Sewall.24 The school (an activity of the Art Association and
                    having no connection with those designated as "Indiana School of Art") moved from
                    the Denison Hotel into a lecture room at 
                        Plymouth
                     Church at the corner of 
                        Meridian
                     and the Circle.25 Soon more permanent quarters were found in 
                        Meridian
                     Hall in the English Block. Twenty-nine students were reported enrolled.26 To develop enthusiasm for art work and attract more pupils, sketch classes were taken
                    out into the woods,27 and during that first summer an excursion was made to Old
                    Point Comfort.28 These efforts availed little, for at the first annual meeting
                    receipts for the year were reported to be $3,390.16, with a cash balance on hand of only
                        $5.74.29 Sufficient funds were not forthcoming, and in 1886 this
                    school was forced to close.30
            
            After this time no art classes were maintained in 
                        Indianapolis
                     until Theodore C. Steele returned from Munich to open a private school in 1888 in the
                    old high school building, or Circle Hall, at Market and Circle streets, Henry Ward
                    Beecher's old church. In 1889 William Forsyth also returned from Munich and joined Steele
                    in his art instruction. Together they maintained the school but were about to abandon it as too much
                    of a financial burden, when interested persons came forward with contributions for its support. In
                    1891 it took the name of "Indiana School of Art," reminiscent of the Love-Gookins

                     school of 1877. Classes continued in the old Beecher church
                    until 1897 at which time that building was torn down to make way for the extension of the English
                    Hotel. In 1895 the Art Association received the John Herron bequest, and the life of the fine arts
                    in 
                        Indianapolis
                     entered a new phase. But that is another story.31
            
            Miss Sue M. Ketcham, after teaching a year or so, 1884-1886, left the Art Association school, but
                    continued to do much to keep up enthusiasm for the arts. She organized and conducted annual summer
                    tours to various places of interest in the East and to Europe. In 1890 she went to 
                        New York
                     to live and joined the Art Students League, the only art school in America recognized
                    abroad at that time. A prominent instructor there was William M. Chase of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , who had achieved national and international recognition.32
            
            In 1885 at 
                        Plymouth
                     Church, the second important exhibition of paintings was held. Under the direction of
                    T. E. Hibben, it presented seventy-one pictures by "Ye Hoosier Colony in
                    München." The catalog of the exhibit was illustrated with etchings from the
                    originals by the Bohé Club. (Unfortunately, no copies of this catalog appear to be
                    extant.) This Hoosier Colony was composed at first of T. C. Steele and William Forsyth, who were
                    joined later by J. Ottis Adams, Samuel Richards, August Metzner, and Miss Carrie Wolff.33 This occasion was a turning point in the affairs of art, for annual exhibits
                    were held regularly thereafter, and interest was so stirred in local artists and their work that
                    when the Hoosier Colony returned late in the eighties, sufficient patronage was available to insure
                    the permanence of art classes and exhibits. (In the mid-nineties Hamlin Garland first used the term,
                    "Hoosier Group," to designate certain Indiana artists who were exhibiting in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Chicago
                    .)
            The decade of the eighties, starting with the exodus from 
                        Indianapolis
                     of a number of artists of talent, seemed to be the

                     beginning of a barren period. Yet, in many respects, it was
                    rich with promise. Charles J. Fiscus went to 
                        Chicago
                    , and Frank Scott left for 
                        New York
                     and 
                        Paris
                    . Henry McGinnis and Louis Mueller later joined the Hoosier Colony in Munich, and Otto
                    Stark went to 
                        Paris
                     to study. Cox was almost the only professional artist left. In 1881 Richard Gruelle
                    came. Hibben and Hetherington of the Bohé Club were the first to execute etchings in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and, though amateur, their work was regarded as good.34 Later, as
                    the artists began to return from Munich, the promise of the decade showed signs of fulfillment.
            Many American painters returning from foreign study settled permanently in the East, but the Hoosier
                    artists returned to Indiana. In Munich, exhibits of the various countries had been shown in special
                    galleries and this national expression of art appealed to the Hoosiers. Why not, they thought, an
                    art of the 
                        United States
                    , or of Indiana? With this common idea, and close association to strengthen it, they
                    worked toward this end. The experience they gained in landscape painting during vacation periods in
                    the towns and villages of southern 
                        Germany
                     prepared the Hoosier artists for what was to be their prominent characteristic. They
                    found themselves enthusiastic about returning to Indiana and thought of going no further for
                    material, for they felt that a distinctive school of painting might be developed there.35 What made this thought so revolutionary was the fact that at that time
                    European scenes, whether well or poorly done, were extremely popular in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .36 Hoosier artists had a common background, for all but Metzner had
                    been pupils of Ludwig von Löfftz, a prominent teacher of painting in 
                        Germany
                     at that time. Local landscape work was not new, for John Love had held sketch classes
                    out of doors37 and Sue Ketcham had organized tours for similar work during the
                    summers since 1884. These returning artists were to have far-reaching influence on the home
                    community, for they had "gained culture in other ways than study at the academy. The

                     excursions into the surrounding country and into the mountains,
                    all added not only pleasure but to their knowledge and experience in their outlook on life. Besides
                    these things, and not the least influence in their development, was their association and sometimes
                    friendship with other students from every country in Europe in the academy and in the Anglo-American
                    Artists' Club—the latter a common meeting ground for all students, English and
                    American, who lived in Munich or happened to be passing through."38
            
            Theodore C. Steele, first to return from Munich in 1885, was born in 
                        Owen County
                    , Indiana, in 1847. He was early self-taught, spending some time in Battle Creek, 
                        Michigan
                    , before settling in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . In 1880 an opportunity to study in Europe came to him, and the next five years were
                    spent at Munich. During this time Herman Lieber rendered important assistance to young artists in
                    many ways. As Steele sent paintings back to Lieber, the latter would exhibit them in his gallery,
                    and as a result the painter had acquired a considerable reputation by the time he returned to 
                        Indianapolis
                    .39 In September, 1885, T. C. Steele and Sue Ketcham opened an art
                    school and according to reports the prospects seemed very good.40 The next year
                    Steele added to his residence at Talbott Place a studio, probably the first room built expressly and
                    exclusively for such a purpose in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .41
            
            Steele's pictures continued to grow in popularity, and the city took pride in his
                    achievements. Exhibitions of his work were well attended and some of his paintings received very
                    favorable comment.42 One of these, "The Boatman," had taken a
                    prize in the gallery at Munich and the 
                        German
                     government wished to buy it, but Steele refused the offer and brought it back to 
                        Indianapolis
                    .43 His portrait of Herman Lieber was much admired by friends who
                    saw it at Lieber's gallery. His "On the Muscatatuck" was purchased by the 
                        Boston
                     Art Club for $500.00. This was an important compliment, for 
                        Boston
                     had not formerly sent to the Middle West for

                    time taken notice of Steele, for during the year of his return from Munich, two of his pictures were
                    accepted for an exhibition of the 
                        New York
                     Academy of Art.45 The 
                        Indianapolis
                     Literary Club likewise complimented him by purchasing for $200.00 his
                    "Village of Cavendish," a 
                        Vermont
                     scene.46 Paintings shown at exhibitions in April and October, 1888,
                    displayed scenes from 
                        Vermont
                    : "A June Idyll," "Gladness of Spring," and
                    "The Village of Cavendish"; local scenes from 
                        Fall Creek
                    , "A November Day," and "A Late Summer Afternoon"; a
                    scene from southern Indiana, "The Oaks of 
                        Vernon
                    "; and some landscapes from Montgomery County near 
                        Crawfordsville
                    . The latter paintings showed distance with particular atmospheric conditions which much
                    interested him. In commenting on his own work, he stated, "Indiana has beauties which are
                    just as worthy of study as landscapes elsewhere. Hereafter I shall confine myself more to my own
                    state than in the past."47
            
            William Forsyth, 1854-1935, another of the Hoosier Colony, was born near 
                        Cincinnati
                    . Upon coming to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , he began studying with Barton S. Hays, but with little success. After visiting the 
                        New York
                     galleries, he returned to 
                        Indianapolis
                     to continue working alone. The Love-Gookins Art School opened then, most opportunely,
                    giving him the background he needed. Work with the Bohé Club followed, and in 1882 he was
                    admitted to the art school in Munich, where he remained until 1888. Study under Gyula Julius de
                    Benczur, Nikolaus Gysis, and von Löfftz perfected his technique, enabling him to achieve
                    honors in every Munich exhibit in which his pictures were shown, including a medal in 1885. Upon his
                    return to Indiana he was first associated with J. Ottis Adams in 
                        Muncie
                     and 
                        Fort Wayne
                    . In 1889 he came to 
                        Indianapolis
                     to join T. C. Steele, whose art school in Circle Hall, the old Beecher church, was then
                    in progress. He was successful as a painter, achieving national and international awards, and
                    exhibiting frequently in 
                  Boston, New York
               , and 
                        Philadelphia
                    , as well as in his home town, 
                        Indianapolis
                    . His work as a teacher was very highly

                     regarded, and he later joined the John Herron art faculty. His
                    paintings were in both water color and oil and were largely Indiana landscapes, with a few
                        portraits.48
            
            John Ottis Adams, 1851-1927, an important member of the Hoosier Colony in Munich, was born in 
                        Jackson
                     County, Indiana. Upon his return from Munich, he painted for a brief period in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , then removed to 
                        Brookville
                    . He is well remembered for his association with Steele, Forsyth, and Otto Stark at the
                    Hermitage near 
                        Brookville
                    , but more particularly with Steele. Adams continued at the Hermitage after the others
                    had left. His wife, Winifred, was also an accomplished artist.49
            
            Otto Stark, 1859-1926, native of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , is mentioned here because he was a contemporary of the above artists and was
                    associated with them as one of the Hoosier Group, though not specifically of the Hoosier Colony, for
                    he went to 
                        Paris
                     in 1884 to study under Gustave Boulanger. He returned to the 
                        United States
                     in 1887, first settling in 
                        Philadelphia
                    . After the death of his wife, he returned to 
                        Indianapolis
                     with his four children to take the position of art supervisor at Manual Training High
                    School in 1899. His work in 
                        Paris
                     was exhibited twice at the Salon, and showed a peculiarly American quality.50 The inspiration to paint landscapes of local color was no doubt a result of
                    association with the Barbizon painters, who were prominent in 
                        France
                     at that time, and prepared him to take his place later with other Hoosier painters who
                    were being similarly inspired in Munich.
            Richard Gruelle, 1851-1904, a self-taught artist born in Cynthiana, 
                        Kentucky
                    , began his career as a house painter in 
                        Illinois
                    , and worked for a time at surveying to help his family. From materials given him by a
                    friend he worked and studied portrait painting, later opening a studio in 
                  Decatur, Illinois
               . He did some work for a 
                        Cincinnati
                     firm, and in 1882 came to

                    . A visit in 1883 to the William T. Walters Collection at 
                        Baltimore
                     proved an important step in his career. His description of the collection which,
                    through Lieber's assistance, was published in Modern Art, gained for him
                    the commission to write the descriptive catalog for the Walters Collection. The result was Notes: Critical and Biographical (1895), now a rare and valuable publication.
                    During most of the years the Hoosier Colony was studying in Munich, Gruelle was painting landscapes
                    and portraits in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . By the time the colony returned from Munich, he was established and his works were
                    naturally included with theirs in exhibitions, so that he has always been considered as one of the
                    Hoosier Group. Probably his greatest picture was "The Drama of the Elements,"
                    which was purchased by Arthur A. McKain and placed in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Public Library. He was a popular painter and Forsyth suggested that perhaps more of
                    Gruelle's pictures were owned in 
                        Indianapolis
                     than those of any other artist.51 In 1887, the News, commenting on two of his pictures being shown in an exhibition, stated that these
                    "should not escape attention. Their merit is so decided and their promise so great that 
                        Indianapolis
                     cannot afford to pass them by. In these days of reaching for better things in art, his
                    work should have substantial recognition."52
            
            This little group of painters, so widely known after 1894 as the Hoosier Group, was the first in the
                    Middle West to recognize and express purely local conditions in their motifs and coloring. One
                    writer commented: "They never fail to delineate the native charm, devoting their time to

                    late autumn. These men never condescend to the general demand on the part of the public for work of
                    a popular nature; they are never accused of debauching public taste."53
                    The standards they set and the reputation they achieved have echoed down the years to blend with
                    those of the

                     County group which gradually rose to replace them. Steele took up residence in 
                        Brown
                     County in the early 1900's and others soon gathered there to form an
                    artists' colony.

            The Art Association held regular annual exhibits from 1883 to 1897, except in 1884. During those
                    years over one thousand paintings were shown, including a few masterpieces by American and foreign
                    artists. Minor exhibits of etchings, engravings, laces, fabrics, pottery, and casts were shown every
                    year, each exhibit lasting from three days to a week. By 1897, twenty-eight such exhibits had been
                    given, together with six courses of lectures and twenty-four separate talks.54
                    The annual exhibits were full-dress occasions with musical programs and refreshments. Single
                    admissions were usually twenty-five cents, and for the exhibit in 1887, season punch tickets were
                    sold, twenty admissions for four dollars.55 Although a large annual exhibit was
                    not shown in 1884, as noted above, specimens of the work of some of the pupils were shown and
                        enjoyed.56 In 1885 paintings, etchings, and engravings by Thomas B.
                    Glessing, which were owned by his widow, were featured at the annual exhibit. Included with these
                    were paintings by the actor, Joseph Jefferson.57 It was hoped many pictures
                    could be sold, for only in that way could the annual exhibits be maintained.
            A group of paintings brought from the gallery of the 
                        New Orleans
                     exposition proved an interesting feature of the showing of 1886. Again it was hoped
                    that some of the pictures would be purchased and remain permanently in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , for it was felt that the continual presence of good works of art was the best way to
                    foster this culture. To set an example, the Art Association purchased one of the paintings, executed
                    by Gustave Werthheimer of 
                        Paris
                    , titled "The Kiss of the Siren."58 This marine
                    picture depicted a beautiful feminine nude amidst the waves luring a boatman to his destruction. The
                    luscious flesh tones of the nude combined with the sea green of the waves to create what current
                    observers felt to be a most entrancing effect. Lengthy descriptions appeared in the newspapers, but
                    the Art Association presently regretted its choice. Sometime after the initial enthusiasm for the
                    painting had diminished, the picture was quietly removed from its place in the gallery and
                    disappeared; where,

                     no one inquired, and gradually it was all but forgotten. Later
                    reports indicate that it was finally disposed of by the Art Association, probably sold. The present
                    owner (1952) is a hotel at Wawasee, Indiana.59
            
            The 1887 exhibit included paintings by foreign masters, but the work of home artists compared well
                    with them. James B. Gookins, director of the first art school, gave some of the art talks during
                    this showing.60
            
            All the principal exhibitions held during the eighties used the Masonic Hall, except in 1888 when 33
                    South 
                        Meridian
                     was the scene of the display. The Propylaeum, built on North Street in 1891, then
                    became the main exhibition gallery of the Art Association until its own quarters were established in
                    1895 at the old Tinker homestead at Talbott Place, Sixteenth and 
                        Pennsylvania
                     streets, former residence of T. C. Steele. By 1906 the buildings of the John Herron Art
                    Institute had been constructed on these grounds.61
            
            The Art Association began with fifty-four members in 1883, and by 1895 had 217 members, including
                    thirteen life members. By that time about 200 pictures had been purchased by private persons in the
                    city through the Art Association, which had bought as a nucleus of its own collection seventeen
                    pictures by William M. Chase, Harry Chase, Gustave Werthheimer, Walter Shirlaw, and others.62
            
            William Merritt Chase, born in 1849 in 
                        Nineveh
                    , Indiana, actually spent little of his time in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , but his early art training was received there with Barton S. Hays and Jacob Cox, so
                    the city claims him. He spent several years studying in Munich, then returned to the Hoosier capital
                    to open a studio for a brief period.63 In the late eighties he removed to 
                        New York
                     where he taught at the Art Students League. Sue Ketcham, writing of this school in an
                    article in the News in 1888, paid high praise to Chase, stating that he was an
                    ideal artist and gentleman, and that his success as a teacher was largely due to his sincerity and
                    directness. Students felt it an honor to be admitted to his classes and a

                    His paintings, especially his portraits, were considered by eastern critics to be of higher quality
                    than those of any other Hoosier artist of that time.
            Barton S. Hays, born 1826, came to 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1858, and remained there until 1882. He painted animals, panoramas, and, as he
                    traveled over the countryside, often made and sold paintings on the spot. He should be remembered as
                    the instructor of John W. Love and William M. Chase.65
            
            Frank Edwin Scott, pupil of John W. Love, and member of the Bohé Club, left 
                        Indianapolis
                     to take up permanent residence elsewhere. Trial drawings made in the Bohé
                    Club admitted him to the Art Students League in 
                        New York
                    . Later he went to live in 
                        France
                     in the house where Millet was born, and achieved some reputation as a painter of 
                        Paris
                    .66
            
            Charles Fiscus died at the early age of twenty-three, but his work had already attracted much
                    attention. He received instruction at the Love-Gookins school but was otherwise self-taught. A true
                    Hoosier artist, he loved nature and left a portfolio of sketches of Hoosier scenery. It was thought
                    he would take a position as instructor in the new Art School of 1884, but this was prevented by his
                    untimely death.67
            
            Professional women artists of this period were not numerous, nor did many of them achieve wide
                    recognition. Women furnished the majority of the art students, and were always among the brightest
                    and most capable. Though few of them advanced out of the amateur or semi-professional category, they
                    have been the mainstay of the Art Association.68 In addition to Sue Ketcham,
                    other women artists of the period included Emma B. King, Ada Cummingore, Julia Sharpe, Mary Yandes
                    Robinson, Bessie Hendricks, Tempe Tice, Estelle P. Izor, Margaret Rudisill, Elizabeth Stevenson, and
                    Mrs. William Forsyth.69
            
            Another art was growing in the eighties which was in later years to have important influence on the
                    technique of painting, and vice versa. After the development of the dryplate

                     process in 1897, societies in amateur photography grew rapidly.
                    The perfection of the new celluloid film, then in process, and improvements in finishing aided
                    greatly in making photography cheaper and more convenient so that it soon became a popular hobby.70 The effect of photography on the style, composition, and technique of
                    painting has been tremendous. Photography was becoming an art in 
                        Indianapolis
                     as well as elsewhere, and there were indications that photographers of the Hoosier
                    capital ranked high among those of the nation. In 1882 the city entertained the third annual
                    convention of the Photographers' Association of America. At that time 
                        Indianapolis
                     could boast of thirty-two photographers and twenty-two galleries.71
            
            Berry Sulgrove wrote in the early eighties that in the field of sculpture 
                        Indianapolis
                     had done little and promised little.72 A review of this decade must
                    confirm his conclusion if progress in sculpture be compared with that in the other arts. By 1890, in
                    public sculptured works, 
                        Indianapolis
                     possessed only four statues in addition to the partly finished Soldiers' and
                    Sailors' Monument in Circle Park. In 1880 there had been one statue, that of Benjamin 
                        Franklin
                    , standing above the main doorway of the 
                        Franklin
                     Insurance Building on the southeast corner of Market and Circle streets. John Mahoney,
                    its sculptor, born in 
                        Wales
                     in 1855, had been inspired by the Rogers statuary at the 1873 Indiana Exposition, and
                    the 
                        Franklin
                     statue resulted. In 1878 after some time spent in work with marble, he found an
                    opportunity for European study. Upon his return he executed several other statues for
                            
                  Philadelphia, Springfield, Illinois
               , and 
                        Cincinnati
                    . In 1889 he returned to 
                        Indianapolis
                     and opened a studio in a stable on Elm Street, relying on small commercial work and
                    occasional commissions for a livelihood. But for a personality conflict with the architect, Mahoney
                    would have been awarded the contract for the "War" and "Peace"

            The design for the statue of Oliver P. Morton, Indiana's Civil War governor, was chosen in
                    September, 1880, and the contract awarded to 
                        Franklin
                     Simmons. The sculptor was an American from 
                        Maine
                    , a renowned artist, and at the time his model was chosen for the Morton statue he had
                    to his credit many fine statues of prominent Americans, as well as other works of art. Soon after
                    Morton's death Simmons made a model of the Governor, and later, at the time he received the
                    commission to do the work, made another model. The statue, cast in bronze and executed in 
                        Rome
                    , took two years to make and cost the city a total of $12,500. It stands
                    eight feet, four inches high, weighs 2,100 pounds, and shows Morton in the pose of debate, an aspect
                    most familiar to his friends and acquaintances. It was placed on a seventeen-foot granite pedestal
                    in the Circle and unveiled January 15, 1884, with the Hon. Richard W. Thompson giving the principal
                    address as a part of an appropriate program.74
            
            In 1887 the city acquired the statue of Schuyler Colfax, executed by Lorado Taft and placed in
                    University Square; in 1890 the statue of Thomas A. Hendricks by Richard Henry Parks of Florence, 
                        Italy
                    , was placed on the Capitol grounds.75
            
            The statuary for the State House was not to be an exhibition of "high art," but was
                    expected to be more of an architectural order, to be commemorative, to set off the building, and
                    fill a vacancy or complete an outline.76 Eight solid Carrara marble statues of
                    heroic size, executed by Alexander Doyle of 
                        New York City
                    , were placed inside the dome in 1886. These figures represented law, oratory,
                    agriculture, commerce, justice, liberty, history, and art.77 But the dome was
                    purposely designed as a memorial to be dedicated to the great men of Indiana, and the State House
                    Commissioners hoped this thought would be carried into effect in the future.78
            
            From the standpoint of the artistic plan of the city as a whole, the Soldiers' and
                    Sailors' Monument was perhaps the crowning achievement of this golden age of

                     culture. Standing in the center of the city, it has constituted
                    a cynosure for all who have dwelt or travelled there. At a focal point in the plan of the city from
                    which main arteries of midwestern transportation radiate, the Monument was regarded by those who
                    designed it as the heart of the nation.
            The Circle had always been something of a problem. Early and somewhat unfortunately the site of the
                    Governor's Mansion, it was later suggested as a location for a combined public library and
                    memorial building. For a brief period, 1884-1888, Morton's statue alone graced the Circle.
                    In 1887, Professor H. J. Schonacker in a public address in 
                        Indianapolis
                     made a plea for a monument to commend the loyalty and services of the soldiers and
                    sailors of Indiana, one that would be a real work of art, for as such it would be an important means
                    of education. As an illustration he reminded his audience that the work of Thomas Nast, cartoonist,
                    had been influential in putting Boss Tweed behind bars. He complained that the statue of Governor
                    Morton did not really do him justice, for the pedestal was too low. Efforts were already in progress
                    to influence the legislature to appropriate $200,000 for a soldiers'
                        monument.79 Shortly a bill was introduced in the legislature specifying that
                    a monument be erected in Circle Park, but not restricting the type of memorial it should be. A
                    writer in the Journal felt some apprehension as to what might then become of
                    Morton's statue and suggested that if it must be removed from the Circle, it might be
                    located in University Park.80 Eventually it was decided to incorporate the
                    statue into the monument in the Circle, so it was moved to the southeast corner to represent one of
                    the four periods of Indiana's history, while John Mahoney was commissioned to execute
                    statues of George Rogers Clark, William Henry Harrison,81 and James Whitcomb, to
                    be arranged in the other three corners to commemorate their respective periods of the
                    state's history.
            The monument commission approved the design submitted by Bruno Schmitz, who was brought from 
                        Germany
                     to serve as architect for the memorial. Since the sculptural

                            Times related that Mahoney's first model of the Harrison statue
                            was not accepted unanimously; but when he draped a cloak around it, all the Monument
                            commissioners approved.

                     detail was expected to be somewhat more artistic than might be
                    within the capabilities of Schmitz, the commission sought the services of Frederick William
                    MacMonnies, the most outstanding sculptor in America at that time. Criticism of the designs he
                    offered caused him to give up his contract; then some persons desired that John Mahoney be given the
                    work, but the latter could not get along with one of the architects, so the work was left for Bruno
                    Schmitz, whose forte was architecture, not sculpture. Apparently, then, Schmitz sought out Rudolph
                    Schwartz, his former pupil in 
                        Germany
                    , and brought him to 
                        Indianapolis
                     to execute the sculptural detail of the Monument.82 William Forsyth
                    agreed with this general statement and further pointed out that Schwartz made the soldier figures
                    which stand at the entrances to the Monument.83 Mary Q. Burnet specifically
                    stated that Schwartz was commissioned, after winning in sharp competition, to do "The
                    Return Home" and "The Dying Soldier" figures just above the cascades, as
                    well as the single soldiers and sailors at the entrances. She also stated that the
                    "War" and "Peace" groups were designed by Herman N. Matzen, and
                    carved by Rudolph Schwartz.84 Anton Scherrer, architect and son of Adolf
                    Scherrer, the State House architect, relates that Herman N. Matzen did the high reliefs of the
                    "Peace" and "War" groups.85 The card
                    describing the Monument and issued by its board of control says simply that Rudolph Schwartz was
                    sculptor of the stone work and George T. Brewster of the bronze work. Thus it is not clear just how
                    much of the designing or execution of sculptural detail was done by Schwartz.
            Preliminary construction was begun on the Monument in 1888, and its thirty-foot-deep foundation was
                    completed by October.86 In the spring the superstructure was started, the
                    scaffolding surrounding the Circle rising ever higher, from 75 feet to 105 feet.87 By summer it was ready for the cornerstone laying, and an elaborate ceremony was held
                    August 22, 1889.88 The work continued for another decade and longer,

            Although it has been much criticized both in artistic detail and in general aspect, it is noteworthy
                    that Thomas E. Tallmadge, an authority on architectural design and author of well-known works on the
                    architecture of 
                        England
                     and America, admired the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument and once
                    commented that its design created an atmosphere in the city which seemed quite European in
                        effect.90
            
            It has been further suggested that even though Indiana and midwestern soldiers' monuments
                    might be poorly conceived and badly executed, still they compare well with such monuments in 
                        New York
                     state and in New 
                        England
                    ; further, that some effort was made to utilize local talent in these projects; and that
                    in any case the materializing of the desire to honor our soldier dead is a part of our national
                    growth. Even if too little time and money were given for the best thought and production, it is but
                    part of the development of our new and recent civilization.91
            
            A modern architect writing of this period declares that in the eighties "our architectural
                    styles were a riot of unrest."92 But such form and pattern as there was
                    may be said to display the Romanesque style which was revived in America after the Centennial
                    Exposition of 1876. The hero of this revival was Henry Hobson Richardson, whose designs were widely
                    imitated throughout the country. The best material for this style was stone, but stucco and terra
                    cotta were both used as substitutes, as well as shingles cut into various patterns. Special features
                    of the Romanesque were rounded arches, rounded towers, and, especially in wooden houses, corner
                    towers and porte cochères. Churches in this style exhibited towers with dome-like cupolas
                    instead of spires. The buildings were square, with the pulpit, organ, and choir tucked into a
                    corner, the floor bowl-shaped, and pews curved. It was the "age of cat-a-corner."
                    Homes often had golden oak floors, woodwork, and furniture, with highly polished varnished finish.

                    porch…. Softer colors, tints of yellow and brown and orange have crept in here and there
                    in twenty years or so, and doors and windows and their casings,… porch posts and
                    ornaments are colored differently from the outside walls…. Frame cottages with light
                    yellow or grayish walls and chocolate brown ‘trimmings’… are a late

            A writer in the Sentinel stated that more attention was being paid to art in
                    buildings in the West, and 
                        Indianapolis
                     was far in advance of most cities its size. Homes in Queen Anne style were in high
                    favor, but Gothic and classic or French Renaissance were also used. Terra cotta was much in vogue,
                    and was often combined with brick. Stained and beveled glass was also popular.95
            
            
               
                        Indianapolis
                     was regarded as a "city of homes" with its quiet streets and
                    comfortable houses surrounded by shrubbery and spacious lawns. No apartment houses had yet been
                    constructed, and the number of boarding houses was small. More people owned their homes in the
                    Hoosier capital than in the other cities of the state. By the end of the decade more were being
                    built and a similar increase was noted in the construction of business buildings, while real estate
                    values were advancing.96
            
            Homes of a more pretentious nature were built during the seventies, but fewer of this type during the
                    eighties. Homes of prominent citizens typified the domestic architecture considered to be in good
                    taste from 1880 to 1890. The home of James 0. Woodruff in Woodruff Place was built probably

                     during the late seventies, and while it was not the sort of
                    home commonly found in 
                        Indianapolis
                     at that time, it embodied ideals that other citizens tried to emulate. Booth
                    Tarkington, in his The Magnificent Ambersons, described the Woodruff home in
                    detail, calling it the home of Major Amberson. Although the author did not claim it to be an
                    accurate description, it is true to the spirit of the times.
            "This house was the pride of the town. Faced with stone as far back as the dining-room
                    windows, it was a house of arches and turrets and girdling stone porches: it had the first
                    porte-cochère seen in that town. There was a central ‘front hall’
                    with a great black walnut stairway, and open to a green glass skylight called the
                    ‘dome,’ three stories above the ground floor. A ballroom occupied most of the
                    third story; and at one end of it was a carved walnut gallery for the musicians. Citizens told
                    strangers that the cost of all this black walnut and wood-carving was sixty thousand dollars. Sixty
                    thousand dollars for the wood-work alone! Yes, sir, and hardwood floors all over
                    the house! Turkish rugs and no carpets at all, except a Brussels carpet in the front
                    parlour—I hear they call it the "reception-room." Hot and cold water
                    upstairs and down, and stationary washstands in every last bedroom in the place! Their
                    sideboard's built right into the house and goes all the way across one end of the dining
                    room. It isn't walnut, it's solid mahogany! Not veneering—solid
                        mahogany!"97 Although some of the houses had bathrooms, these were
                    not common. Some rooms were especially designed for servants' quarters. Always at the rear
                    could be found the stable which was usually large enough to house the family carriage, victoria,
                    coupé, run-a-bout, or other vehicles. The Major's was of brick, with four rooms
                    upstairs for the hired men and their families. The Major also had a greenhouse, but this was
                    probably unusual.98
            
            Among the public buildings erected during the eighties were English's Opera House and the
                    Denison Hotel, opened in 1880; the English Hotel in 1884; Tomlinson Hall, 1885; Young Men's
                    Christian Association in 1886; new Union Station and State House completed in 1888; 
                        German
                     Evangelical Reformed Church on East Merrill Street, 1889; and the Propylaeum,
                    1889-1890.

            The English building was begun in 1880 in the northwest segment of the Circle, with the Opera House
                    the first portion to be completed. William H. English contemplated a later extension of the
                    building, part of which might possibly serve as a public library.99 He went on a
                    tour of buildings in the East to decide on the style and arrangement, and at that time announced
                    that his son, William E. English, would manage the theater, with J. L. Saphere from the East as his
                    assistant. Construction of the theater was planned to begin in April,100 and the
                    building was expected to be ready for use by September 1.101 The elder English
                    decided to follow the design of the Grand Opera House in 
                        New York
                    , but to build his theater larger. Then, as he contemplated his project, the idea grew
                    and he decided to build up the entire front of that segment of the Circle, making it into an elegant
                    hotel, superior to anything then in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . He also considered locating a wholesale drug firm there.102
            
            Many difficulties arose in the course of construction, and W. H. English sometimes dealt with his
                    contractors in a high-handed manner to secure prompt action in completing the work. He insisted on
                    the newest and best available type of equipment in such matters as the hydraulic elevator. Later,
                    Manager William E. English reported with satisfaction that stars performing in the theater
                    pronounced it the best one in the West.103
            
            The Denison Hotel opened in 1880 under the management of H. B. Sherman.104 Its
                    rich decoration, mirrors and chandeliers, in fact, all its detail, were considered to be in
                    exquisite taste.105 In 1881 the Bates House was enlarged and remodeled with the
                    addition of a new entrance for ladies, a passenger elevator, a new dining room and ordinary, and new
                    ground-floor offices. The new management, W. G. Sherman, modestly declared it to be the finest hotel
                    in the West.106 The

                    with the Opera House covered over half that quadrant of the Circle.107
            
            Tomlinson Hall, erected in 1885, was made possible by the estate of Stephen D. Tomlinson. He had
                    bequeathed the sum of $150,000 in trust to the city for the construction of an assembly
                    hall to belong to 
                        Indianapolis
                    . After his death it was proposed, in 1881, to convert this fund into cash and build a
                    combination city hall and market house.108 This was completed in 1885. The upper
                    story with its fifty-foot ceiling was designed as a public assembly hall which would seat 5,000. Its
                    stage seated 500. This proved a boon to the city, creating a place where political conventions could
                    gather, and making possible the large May Festivals of the eighties and nineties.109 The lower floor, used as a market house, developed into an institution which became a
                    unique part of 
                        Indianapolis
                     community life. The building was designed and erected under the supervision of D. A.
                    Bohlen, an architect who had worked in Francis Costigan's office, and who also built St.
                    John's Cathedral and the Roberts Park Church.110
            
            In 1886 an important event occurred in the architectural history of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . A chapter of the Western Association of Architects was organized in the city, and an
                    exhibition of designs was planned for January, 1887, in an effort to interest citizens of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Plans were also made to ask the legislature to pass a law establishing the status of
                    architects. Guests were taken on a tour of the city, and it was reported they were pleased with the
                    architectural styles they saw. It may be pointed out that the tour ended with a drive through Crown
                    Hill Cemetery, then considered indispensable as part of any general program of entertainment.111 In 1886 a new Young Men's Christian Association building was under
                    construction, supervised by architect Louis Gibson.112
            
            A curious building was proposed and erected in the city in 1888. Because of the large volume of
                    business caused by

                     the political campaign, the State Fair, legislative sessions,
                    the Soldiers' Monument construction, and the excitement over the discovery of natural gas,
                    it seemed only good business to provide some unique form of entertainment for the crowds. Several
                    persons thought seriously of promoting a cyclorama, a circular building peculiarly adapted to an
                    exhibition that would at once be artistic, dramatic, historical, and highly exciting. Some thought
                    it might interfere with the business of the theaters, though no one was deeply concerned about that.
                    Remarkably lifelike battle scenes were depicted in such arenas in other cities, and were highly
                    successful. Accordingly, permission was secured and the building was erected on West Market Street.
                    It was constructed of brick, 400 feet in circumference, 50 feet high at the edge, and 100 feet high
                    at the center of the dome. At the grand opening in May, 1888, the "Battle of 
                        Atlanta
                    " was shown to visitors for fifty and twenty-five cents admission. Natural
                    scenery, trees and shrubs, were placed in front of painted scenery, blending with it in a manner
                    which presented an illusion of distance, making the whole scene remarkably real. The details were
                    authentic, and J. F. Gookins, T. C. Steele, and Rev. N. A. Hyde were much impressed with it.113 Those who afterwards recalled visiting the Cyclorama regarded it as an
                    exciting experience, for it seemed that the actual event had been brought to a reality before their
                        eyes.114 The building was later razed to make way for the Terminal
                        Station.115
            
            In 1888-1889 the Propylaeum was built on North Street opposite the Blind Asylum. It was constructed
                    by architects Adolph Scherrer and W. Scott Moore, of Indiana limestone in the prevailing Romanesque
                    style. Its assembly hall seated 600 people, and other rooms were used as parlors, committee rooms,
                    offices, dining room, and kitchen. It continued to serve as a meeting place for clubs, as an art
                    gallery, banquet and lecture hall, as well as provide a place for dramatic entertainments, concerts,
                    and private social affairs, until 1924 when it was torn down to make way for the War Memorial.116

            The completion of the State House was probably the most notable architectural work of the decade. It
                    proceeded under the watchful eye of Adolf Scherrer, who had become supervising architect after Edwin
                    May's untimely death in February, 1880.117
            
            Vexatious lawsuits plagued the builders. Notwithstanding the care taken by the commissioners to
                    examine thoroughly every plan submitted to them, the disappointed architects instituted suits to
                    restrain progress of the work on the State House. Though they also enlisted some newspapers in their
                    cause, their efforts were in vain and work proceeded.118 The usual delays caused
                    by cold weather and occasional failure of machinery held up operations at intervals.119 After some five years of work there was discussion concerning the mistakes in judgment
                    of the original planners, and there seemed to be some possibility that the contractors might throw
                    up the job. It was recognized to be impossible to complete the work according to the original
                    estimate, due to the increased cost of labor.120 In 1883 the commissioners
                    decided to abandon the contract entirely and gave notice to the contractors. After considerable work
                    making new plans with new specifications by the supervising architect and his assistants, work was
                    resumed. This had, of course, involved a delay of several months and added expense for new plans,
                    thus postponing the date of completion of the building. Work had been suspended so long that it was
                    nearly the last of September when it was resumed, and cold weather arrived before much was
                    accomplished that season.121 Thereafter work proceeded without serious
                    interruption.
            In 1887 part of the building was occupied, enabling the legislature to convene there for the first
                        time.122 In 1888 the rest of the building was finished and occupied, and by
                    October 2, the work was considered completed and accounts were closed.123 The
                    total expense as reported by the commissioners

                     was $2,099,794.66, leaving an unexpended balance of
                        $10,160.90.124 This fact has long been a source of pride to the
                    state. As early as 1884 when it was anticipated under the changed plan of construction that the work
                    could be completed within the sum allowed, an 
                        Indianapolis
                     paper gratefully copied this comment from the 
                        Boston
                    
                    Journal: "They have a queer way of doing things out in Indiana. The sum
                    of $2,000,000 was appropriated for a new State House, which is now near completion, and
                    the prospect is that the cost will be $136,000 less than the appropriation! The
                    architects and contractors have made a mistake somewhere. They should go to 
                        Albany
                     or 
                        Washington
                     and take a few lessons. Such honesty is phenomenal."125
            
            The entire work had taken more than ten years, from September, 1877, when instructions were issued to
                    architects, to October, 1888, when the final report was made. It housed the various state
                    departments, including the State Library; it was heated by steam, ventilated by four huge fans, and
                    was lighted by artificial gas, though it was also wired for electricity.126 The
                    architecture combined the best forms of Greek and Roman classic styles. On the first floor columns
                    were of Doric order, on the second, Ionic, and on the third, Corinthian, with marble corridors
                        throughout.127 The exterior lines show the influence of Romanesque style
                    which was currently considered beautiful and practical.
            The Inland City was in 1890 dominated by the new State House and the Soldiers' Monument
                    still under construction, and it might be expected that future artistic developments would be
                    strongly influenced thereby. Yet somewhat primitive characteristics continued in evidence; for
                    example, the lamplighter still made his rounds each night with his ladder, lighting the
                    old-fashioned oil lamps.128 Lawns were still enclosed by picket fences, but
                    these began to disappear after the political campaign of 1888 when so many souvenirs were taken from
                    Benjamin Harrison's fence as almost to wreck it.129 Doubtless some
                    other sentiment was attached to these

                     fences in certain quarters, particularly on the south side
                    where more Germans lived; for it has been claimed that it was customary for a father to paint his
                    gate a certain color to announce the marriageable status of his daughters—blue if any
                    were single, and white if none remained unmarried.130 But as the fences
                    disappeared, so, to a great extent, did the old provincialism vanish. As other influences poured in
                    during the nineties, the Inland City of the Golden Age began to fade, or to be subdued by an overlay
                    of metropolitan superstructure, and a great midwestern manufacturing and transportation center came
                    into focus.

            Southern Migration to Northern Indiana Before 1850
            Elfrieda Lang∗
            It has been the general consensus of opinion among a number of historians that southerners did not
                    penetrate into the wilderness north of the National Road during the first part of the nineteenth
                    century. According to Frederick J. Turner, "The Old National road was built piecemeal, and
                    too late, as a whole, to make a great artery of trade throughout the Middle West…; but it
                    marked the northern borders of the Southern stream of population, running, as this did, through
                            
                  Columbus, Indianapolis
               , and Vandalia."1 Lois K.
                    Mathews held a similar view, stating that the settlement of 
                        Illinois
                     and Indiana was "the history of a frontier pushed north by Southerners, and of
                    settlement by 
                        Puritan
                     stock working down from the North toward the centre, where both met and strove for
                    supremacy in state councils,"2 When Henry M. Flint traveled from 
                        Philadelphia
                     to 
                        St. Louis
                     in 1837, he related that southerners had located in the lower half of 
                        Illinois
                     and Indiana.3
            
            Upon consulting statistics compiled from the Original Census Returns, these views do not appear
                    valid. Although records giving nativity before 1850 are few and incomplete, with what information
                    was available it was discovered that at least 167 southerners had settled north of the Wabash River
                    in Indiana between 1820 and 1830. In the next decade this number had increased to 5,296. By 1850,
                    however, 11,920 Kentuckians, North Carolinians, Virginians, Marylanders, and others from the South
                    had chosen the northern Indiana wilderness.4

                        which in some instances contained biographical sketches. These names were then checked against

            Hence, this region of the Middle West had not been avoided by the southerners. Because of soil
                    exhaustion Virginians may have left their native state in "utter hopelessness of bettering
                    their condition" for new and strange homes in "the far West." By 1836 the
                    epidemic of emigration had spread with such rapidity as to threaten the "entire
                    depopulation of extensive neighborhoods, once the garden spots of 
                        Virginia
                    ." One exaggerated account referred to this emigration as a pestilence which
                    emptied the towns, villages, and country at large "not only of those who might justly be
                    called the warts and cancerous ulcers of the body politic," but of thousands of the best
                    and most valuable citizens.5
            
            The Old Dominion, however, had a partner in this predicament, for a similar situation prevailed in
                    the adjoining state of 
                        Maryland
                    . An account in the

                    Gazette stated that in 1836-1837, over a period of eighteen months, nearly one and
                    one-half million dollars were carried out of Charles and St. Marys counties. Marylanders began to
                    blaze trails in the northern part of the Hoosier State before 1830, and on September 24, 1833, a
                    colony of about thirty arrived from 
                        Maryland
                     to begin anew in 
                        Allen County
                    . These pioneers chose an area in Aboite Township which was known as the 
                        Maryland
                     settlement.6 One may assume that some other Marylanders who left
                    their native surroundings in 1836-1837 probably located in northern Indiana, especially since a
                    settlement had already been founded there, bearing the name of the state from which they had
                    removed.
            While some sought new homes because of soil exhaustion, the Quakers and Moravians took to the road
                    because of their dislike for slavery. Since this institution had "enervating and paralyzing
                    effects" upon the white population, many crossed the 
                        Ohio
                     River. In a number of counties in 
                        Maryland
                     where there was a decided increase of slaves, the white population 
                  Census which records nativity. This method has flaws because it does not include every
                            resident of northern Indiana before 1841 since some individuals moved away or died. All
                            statistics in this study have been compiled from the 1850 Original Census Returns.

                     showed a comparable decrease.7 There was
                    the hope among some who did not emigrate that the large estates would be divided into small farms
                    and every mother's son, as in New 
                        England
                    , would put his own hand to the axe and the plow, every mother's daughter would
                    give up her silks and her satins and "betake herself to the churn and wheel," and
                    when every man, as in New 
                        England
                    , would make his own cheese and drink his own cider.8
            
            Finances or loyalty to native soil prevented some from migrating. Numerous and various reasons as
                    well as destinations might be cited for those who sought new homes. On the other hand, there were
                    those who had no destination in mind but just moved along with their earthly possessions until
                    favorably impressed with an area to locate. A North Carolinian traveling toward the West in 1835,
                    when asked where he was going, answered, "No where in pertick'lar. Me and my wife
                    thought we'd hunt a place to settle. We've no money, nor no
                    plunder—nothin' but just ourselves and this nag—we thought
                    we'd try our luck in a new country."9 Some who chose northern
                    Indiana may have been of the same mind as the man from 
                        North Carolina
                    .
            Those who had a definite goal possibly chose the shortest route. In all likelihood others just
                    started out in the hope that they might meet someone else who could recommend a fertile area in the
                    new country. Among the ways to the West from the South was a road from 
                        Baltimore
                     to Harper's Ferry which followed between the walls of the Appalachian and Blue
                    Ridge mountains to Fort Chissel, where it united with a highway from 
                        Richmond
                    . At the blockhouse in the Holston Valley near Abingdon, 
                        Virginia
                    , it joined the Wilderness Road and proceeded westwardly to 
                        Cumberland
                     Gap. At this point it changed its course to the northwest toward the Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                    , from whence the traveler could pass through Indiana to 
                        Vincennes
                    . The latter part of the route was known as

                    , Thorntown Trace served as a connecting link between southern and northern Indiana.
            Nevertheless, there is evidence that the National Road was not only a popular highway for immigrants
                    from 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , but also for southerners. The largest percentage of children born to parents who were
                    natives of the South and who settled in northern Indiana made their entrance into the world in the
                    Buckeye State.11 One may, therefore, assume that the National Road was an
                    important thoroughfare for southerners who chose the area beyond the Wabash River in the Hoosier
                    State.
            On the basis of the 1850 Original Census Returns, it is possible to determine through which states
                    pioneers traveled by the birthplace of children born during the trek to the new land. Many made
                    their entrance to the Hoosier State through 
                        Ohio
                    . Several families living in 
                  Peru, Miami County
               , followed this path. In the case of one
                    family the parents were born in 
                        Virginia
                    ; three children, nine, eight, and three, in 
                        Ohio
                    ; and the youngest of four months, in Indiana. The parents of another family, also
                    natives of 
                        Virginia
                    , had four children: twelve, ten, nine, and five, born in 
                        Ohio
                    ; and three children: four, two, and two months, born in Indiana. As for a third family,
                    it is not so easy to determine just when they arrived, as the parents and oldest child sixteen years
                    of age were born in 
                        Virginia
                     and three who were thirteen, eleven, and six years of age were born in 
                        Ohio
                    .
            One farmer and his wife from 
                        Kentucky
                     came by way of 
                        Ohio
                     to 
                        Jackson
                     Township, 
                        Cass County
                    . Three children, twenty-three, twenty-two, and nineteen, were born in 
                        Ohio
                    ; and a set of twins, seventeen, and a twelve-year-old, in Indiana.

                        Maryland
                    , were the parents of four children, twenty-one, sixteen, fourteen, and seven, born in 
                        Ohio
                    ; but in 1850 they were living in Adams Township, 
                        Cass County
                    , Indiana.

                        North Carolina
                    . The first child, nineteen, was born in 
                        North Carolina
                    ; the next two, seventeen and sixteen, in 
                        Ohio
                    ; the third, fourteen, in 
                        Michigan
                    ; and the four youngest, eleven, ten, seven, and four, in Indiana.

                        Concord
                     Township, 
                        Elkhart
                     County, is worth relating. The father was born in 
                        South Carolina
                    ; the mother in 
                        Virginia
                    ; the oldest child, sixteen, in 
                        Wisconsin
                    ; the next two, fourteen and thirteen, in 
                        Illinois
                    ; and the fourth, ten, in Indiana.
            Some families apparently had not planned to settle in Indiana, since they by-passed this state for 
                        Illinois
                     and lived there from five to ten years before removing to the Hoosier State. A southern
                    family living in 
                        Michigan
                     City first chose 
                        Illinois
                    . The father was born in 
                        Virginia
                    , the mother in 
                        Kentucky
                    , four children ranging from seventeen to six in 
                        Illinois
                    , and one, four, in Indiana.
            A United Brethren minister either suffered from the Wanderlust or felt the Lord was
                    calling him to a new field of labor from time to time. He was a native of 
                        Maryland
                    , chose a wife from 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , then went to 
                        Ohio
                    , where he stayed for a year or more, then crossed the line into Indiana. After five
                    years among the Hoosiers he must have felt that 
                        Michigan
                     might have more fertile fields. In only a short time, however, he discovered that it
                    would be better to return to Indiana, and so settled in 
                        Middlebury

            The distribution of southerners in counties north of the Wabash River is worth noting. Probably
                    because of its location and accessibility from the South, Wabash County had the largest number of
                    southerners in northern Indiana—1,490, out of a possible 11,920. Southern states well
                    represented  in this county were: 
                        Virginia
                     with 640, 
                        Kentucky
                     with 361, 
                        North Carolina
                     with 238, and 
                        Maryland
                     with 160.
            Two other counties, Miami and Cass, just west of 
                        Wabash
                    , numbered over, a thousand southerners among their population. Miami also became the
                    choice of many from 
                  Kentucky, North Carolina
               , and 
                        Maryland
                    , while Cass fostered a generous sprinkling of natives from 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Maryland
                    . No doubt the 
                        Michigan
                     Road made these three counties easily accessible to immigrants from the South.
            Strangely enough, LaPorte ranked fourth with 924, of which over 62 per cent were from 
                        Virginia
                    . This is worthy of observation, since this county also had the largest number of New
                    Englanders and inhabitants from 
                        New York
                    . Apparently the Virginian or Kentuckian in this county did not confuse the Yankee
                    peddler of cheap merchandise with the substantial New 
                        England
                     farmer or businessman.
            The southerners in 
                  Kosciusko, St.
                            Joseph, Elkhart, Whitley
               , Noble, LaGrange, 
                        De Kalb
                    , Allen, and 
                        Steuben
                     were mostly natives of 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        Maryland
                    . One might, therefore, assume that entrance into these counties was made by some route
                    from central or northern 
                        Ohio
                    . It is likely that the National Road was used by a large number and then some trail
                    followed which intersected with the great highway. In Indiana the 
                        Quaker
                     Trace connected with the National Road at 
                        Richmond
                     and went in a northwardly direction to 
                        Allen County
                    . No doubt, 
                        Wayne
                    's Trace from 
                        Ohio
                     into this county was also used. The Maumee and St. Marys rivers in all likelihood were
                    the choice of those who made part of the trek by water. If the immigrant proceeded as far north as
                    the present site of 
                        Toledo
                    , he may have continued his journey into Indiana on the Vistula Road. Moreover, if the
                    newcomer had a definite place of settlement in mind, such as 
                        St. Joseph
                     County which was traversed by the 
                        Michigan
                     Road, he probably went as far west as 
                        Indianapolis
                     on the National Road.
            On the other hand, the southerners in 
                        Fulton
                    , White, 
                        Jasper
                    , Marshall, and 
                        Pulaski
                     counties were mostly from 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                    . This would seem to indicate that highways which led from 
                        Kentucky
                     into the Hoosier State were used. In the case of Fulton and Marshall counties, the 
                        Michigan
                     Road perhaps was the popular route. A water route of which the 
                  Ohio, Wabash
               , and
                    Tippecanoe rivers were the main arteries may have been preferred means of transportation for some
                    who settled in White and 
                        Pulaski
                     counties.  Then, too, there were traces which
                    linked with more important trails.
            Both Lake and Starke counties had fewer than a hundred from the South. Since Lake had a large New 
                        England
                     population, it is possible that it was not sought by southerners. The ague-infested
                    swamps in Starke County, no doubt, served to turn the eyes of the southern immigrant to other
                    regions.
            Despite the fact that Virginians constituted more than half of the southern population for the area
                    under consideration, in 
                        De Kalb
                     and LaGrange counties natives from 
                        Maryland
                     surpassed the number from 
                        Virginia
                    . The latter, indeed, was represented in all counties. On the other hand, there were
                    also numerous inhabitants from 
                        Maryland
                     in Allen, Cass, Miami, and Wabash counties. Likewise, North Carolinians made an
                    impression by their numbers in Miami and Wabash counties. But 
                        Kentucky
                     ranked next to 
                        Virginia
                     and her immigrants were prevalent in Cass, 
                        Fulton
                    , Marshall, Miami, 
                        Wabash
                    , and White counties.
            Because of inadequate records, the complete story of just when and in what numbers southerners began
                    to locate in northern Indiana may never be told. Since national and local conditions stimulated or
                    retarded emigration, it would be erroneous to conclude that many people emigrated when the business
                    cycle was at its lowest ebb. In a number of cases, it was necessary to save some money before the
                    journey to a new settlement could be undertaken. Moreover, the land sales may serve somewhat as a
                    measuring stick for emigration. In 1818 a high mark was recorded for the country as a whole, but by
                    1819 there was a noticeable reduction. Obviously, the panic of that year in its early stages must
                    have effected this decline. Emigration in the thirties increased and northern Indiana became more
                    popular. Likewise, by 1836 the land sales had reached a peak. The following year, however, another
                    panic made its inroads, and for the next five years a sharp decrease in land sales was noted.12 After the country had recuperated from this hardship, many again sought new
                    areas in the hope that such an event might be averted in the future.
            Young and old became victims of the "migrant fever."

                     An investigation of the ages of southerners in northern Indiana
                    revealed that 86 per cent were above the age of twenty. The largest number, 9,279, were between
                    twenty and sixty years of age, in the most productive period of their lives.
            These energetic southerners engaged in numerous occupations, but the majority were farmers. Many took
                    an interest in civic affairs and a number were active in state government. From 1825 to 1850
                    thirty-two southerners were in the Indiana house of representatives and nine in the state senate. In
                    the lower house fifteen were natives of 
                        Kentucky
                    ; ten, of 
                        Virginia
                    ; four, of 
                        Tennessee
                    ; and one each, of the 
                  District of Columbia,
                            Maryland
               , and 
                        North Carolina
                    . Four in the upper house were from 
                        Kentucky
                    ; two from 
                        North Carolina
                    ; and one each from 
                  Maryland, Tennessee
               , and 
                        Virginia
                    . Among the representatives thirteen were farmers; seven, lawyers; five, merchants;
                    three, physicians; one, an innkeeper; one, a minister; one, a tanner; and one did not list an
                    occupation. Of the nine senators, three were lawyers; two, farmers; two, merchants; one, a minister;
                    and one failed to give his occupation.13
            
            When the constitutional convention of 1850 met, seven southerners from northern Indiana held seats in
                    this body. No two men were of the same age, and they represented seven different occupations. Four
                    were Virginians; one, a Marylander; one, a North Carolinian; and one, a Tennessean. One of these men
                    had been in the state twenty-seven years; three, sixteen; one, fifteen; one, eleven; and another,
                    only four.14 James W. Borden, Daniel Crumbacker, and Edmund D. Taylor took an
                    active part in debates while Samuel J. Anthony, John A. Graham, Jonathan Harbolt, and Hugh Miller
                    only submitted resolutions and made motions.
            Southerners of northern Indiana were active in the political life of the state, represented numerous
                    occupations, followed different routes into the Hoosier State, and had settled in this region of the
                    Middle West before 1830.

                        German
                     instruction may in a measure account for the static condition of 
                        German
                     enrollment figures in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     public schools for the years 1888 to 1890. Of 2,566 pupils who began 
                        German
                    , 1,945 were still enrolled at the close of the year 1888, whereas in 1891-1892, 2,491
                    began the study, and 1,948 remained.1 The number of schools that offered 
                        German
                     had, however, increased during that same period from fourteen to nineteen.2 In the annexes the method of using geography and history as a means of

                        German
                     was still being pursued with "very good results both in the acquisition of
                    knowledge in the subjects taught and in the practical use and understanding of the 
                        German
                     language."3 The supervisor of 
                        German
                     had up to this time been obliged also to carry on his work of teaching every morning in
                    High School No. 1, which made it impossible for him to inspect those 
                        German
                     classes which were held during the morning; therefore on June 3, 1892, it was voted to
                    relieve him of his teaching in order to enable him to devote his entire time to supervision. This
                    was a forward step designed to improve the work in the 
                        German
                     department.4
            
            The added dignity did not devolve upon Charles E. Emmerich, however, because he was made principal of
                    the newly opened High School No. 2, but rather upon O. Spehr of 
                  Milwaukee, Wisconsin
               ,
                    whose appointment took effect in September of that same year.5 Apparently he was

                     but made no innovations, for during the two years that he was
                    supervisor, there is only one item in the Minutes of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Board of School Trustees concerning 
                        German
                    , and that was a recommendation for a new translation of the textbook in geography.6 Although the matter was made a special order for the next meeting of the
                    board, it was not presented then, possibly because at that meeting Spehr resigned. No reason was
                        mentioned.7 The committee on 
                        German
                    , music, and drawing was granted expenses to visit other cities in order to interview
                    prospective candidates. On September 7, 1894, Robert Nix of New Ulm, 
                        Minnesota
                    , was appointed. With the advent of a new supervisor, the scope of his work was
                    enlarged; he was now not only to be supervisor of 
                        German
                     in the district schools, but in the high schools as well, and was to be so designated
                    in the Manual of the Public Schools of 
                            Indianapolis

            During the next decade and more there is little in the minutes regarding 
                        German
                    . It was having a steady growth, indicated by the petitions coming in from more and more
                        schools.9 The board consigned details to the supervisor and concerned itself
                    for the most part only with the petitions, a mere formality, and with the acquisition of more rooms
                    in which to teach the 
                        German
                    .10 The granting of the petition sometimes depended upon the space
                        available.11

                        Nix are from Der tägliche Telegraph (henceforth cited as Telegraph), October 17, 1910: Nix was born February 1, 1854, in
                                
                     Cleveland, Ohio
                  ; two years later he moved with his family to New
                        Ulm, 
                            Minnesota
                        . In 1880 he graduated from the University of 
                            Minnesota
                        . After teaching there a year, he went to 
                            Germany
                         to study at Berlin and Leipzig. From 1883 to 1894 he was principal of the New Ulm
                        public schools.

                  11 See, for example, Minutes, February 14, 1911, in which is stated:
                        "Messrs. H. E. Hagley and Earhard, M. D., appeared before the Board in behalf of
                        patrons at school 41, relative to the possibility of securing the teaching of 
                            German
                         in school 41. There is a growing demand for the introduction of teaching the 
                            German
                         Language in said building. If it cannot be provided for the second half of
                        1910/1911 on account of lack of room in the building, they want some assurance that it be
                        provided at the beginning of 1911/1912. The question was referred to the Superintendent of
                        Schools."
            
            
            The first drastic revision of the rules took place in 1900. They were greatly shortened and made to
                    read as follows:
            "Instruction in 
                        German
                    :
            "Section 1. There shall be appointed a Supervisor of 
                        German
                     instruction in the Public Schools who shall devise such plans as may be expedient or
                    necessary for furthering instruction in his department. He shall have immediate control of the 
                        German
                     teachers and teaching, giving directions respecting the lessons, books and other
                    matters pertaining to instruction in the 
                        German
                     language and literature. He shall examine the different schools and classes at the
                        end1 of every term, and shall, when desired, report to the superintendent of
                    schools detailed information concerning the teachers, pupils, classes, and methods of instruction.
            "Section 2. No teacher shall be deemed competent to instruct in the 
                        German
                     department unless proficient in English.
            "Section 3. Instruction in 
                        German
                     shall begin in the second year.
            "Section 4. The assignment of the 
                        German
                     classes to places upon the general program of the school shall be a matter of agreement
                    between the supervising principal and the supervisor of 
                        German
                    , subject to appeal to the superintendent of schools. The instruction in the 
                        German
                     language must adapt itself to the English classes.
            "Section 5. The classes in 
                        German
                     shall be formed at the beginning of the school year terms, and no pupil shall be
                    admitted to them later, except after due examination and approval by the supervisor of 
                        German
                    ."12
            
            Under Nix's supervision, 
                        German
                     instruction made great strides. By 1902, it was being taught in thirty-four district
                    schools and in both high schools. There were 375 
                        German
                     classes with 6,170 pupils in the district schools; twenty-five classes with 458 pupils
                    in the high schools. Five teachers of 
                        German
                     were employed in the latter, and thirty-seven, including two substitutes, in the
                    former." In his report on

                     in the district schools for that year, Nix stated: "In
                    all classes 
                        German
                     is the principal medium of communication. The entire course is based on the spoken
                    language. The vocabulary, work forms, and constructions learned orally are reviewed in the form of
                    exercises in reading, writing, and translation. The systematic study of 
                        German
                     grammar is begun in the sixth grade."14 In the high
                    schools two groups of four year courses ran parallel to each other, courses for those who had
                    completed the seven years of 
                        German
                     in the grades, and alternate courses for those who began their 
                        German
                     in high school.15
            
            Not only was the supervisor interested in the pupils, but he also kept in close touch with the
                    teachers under his direction. During the year 1902, for instance, thirty-five meetings for teachers
                    of 
                        German
                     were held. The supervisor further directed the examinations which the teachers had to
                    take. They were of two kinds: one for the license to teach 
                        German
                    , the other for those already licensed. The former was held twice a year, in August and
                    May. Of the thirty-one applicants who took the examinations in 1902, only twelve, four men and eight
                    women, obtained the required average of 75 per cent.16 The three highest, all
                    men, were native Germans, trained in either a teachers' seminary, or at various 
                        German
                     universities; four others had immigrated to the 
                        United States
                     at an early age and like the remaining five candidates had had their training at
                    American universities and normal schools, or were merely graduates of an 
                        Indianapolis
                     high school.17
            
            Nix deplored the fact that in many buildings stress for school accommodations had made it necessary
                    to place the 
                        German
                     classes in small and inadequate rooms. He recommended

            From 1902 to 1909 the enrollment in 
                        German
                     seemed to be keeping pace with the increasing population of the city of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The 375 classes in the district schools of 1902 had increased to 404 by 1909, and the
                    number of classes in the high school had almost doubled, from twenty-five to forty-seven.19 Serving the grades were forty-two 
                        German
                     teachers, while eight taught in the two high schools. On February 19, 1909, 2,094 out

                        German
                     parentage. Sixty of these had been born in 
                        Germany

                        German
                     in the district schools for the year 1908/1909 was $28,142.58. This amount
                    included teachers' and substitutes' salaries, sick pay, four-fifths of the salary
                    of the Supervisor of

            In discussing the methods of teaching 
                        German
                    , Nix said: "In Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre, one of the
                    supervisors of the Pedagogical Province informs Wilhelm that each of the modern languages taught is
                    spoken in turn for an entire month. ‘This practice,’ continues the supervisor,
                    ‘is based on the principle that nothing is learned outside of the element that is to be
                    conquered. We regard our pupils as so many swimmers who perceive with astonishment that they are
                    lighter than the element which threatened to swallow them, and that they are buoyed up and sustained
                    by it.’
            "The principle thus stated by Goethe has been successfully applied in the various methods of
                    modern language teaching

                     that are gradually superseding the translation method in
                    European and, to a certain extent, in American schools. The feature common to these recent methods
                    consists in using the medium of communication between teacher and pupil. The most flexible as well
                    as the most comprehensive of the methods in question is known as the ‘direct’
                    method. The teacher using this method endeavors to equip the pupil with a practical vocabulary, to
                    develop in him what the Germans call ‘Sprachgefühl,’ and to
                    introduce him, at as early a stage as possible, to the study of the life and literature of the
                    people whose language is taught. In the attainment of these ends, the most valuable traits of the
                    other methods can readily be utilized.
            "In the teaching of 
                        German
                     in the district and high schools of 
                        Indianapolis
                     the direct method is used, with such modifications and extensions as the age and
                    progress of the pupils seem to demand. The following features of other methods are included in the
                    work: Great importance is attached to correct pronunciation' and to the part which the ear
                    takes in the acquirement of language ('reform' method); the conversational
                    exercises ('natural' method) are arranged in series based on the association of
                    ideas ('psychological' method); grammar is taught inductively; and translation is
                    restricted, in general, to the most difficult passages of the texts that are studied."22
            
            The books in use supplied the material for oral work and enabled the teacher to conduct continuous
                    and systematic reviews in the form of exercises in reading and writing. Objects and pictures were
                    used freely. Work in the grades was functional. "The child's life and surroundings
                    in school and home" furnished "the main topics for the dialogues in the primary
                    grades." In reading and writing, the Latin (English) characters were used exclusively for
                    one and a half to two years, after which 
                        German
                     print and script were introduced. Reading was preceded by oral work. In the review the
                    story was read wholly or in part in dialogue form, sometimes even dramatized by the pupils, who then
                    memorized and acted out the several parts. Beginning with the sixth grade, the written exercises
                    were given the form of letters addressed to friends 
                  
                     22

                     and relatives.23 The systematic study of 
                        German
                     grammar was begun in the fifth grade. In all grades poems were memorized, stories
                    dramatized and acted, enlivened by the singing of 
                        German
                     songs.
            According to the Laws of Indiana, 1907, 
                        German
                     was specified among the subjects mandatory in the high school.24 As
                    has been stated, there were two kinds of courses in 
                        German
                     in the high schools of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , one for those pupils who began their 
                        German
                     there, and another for those who had completed the seven-year course in the elementary
                        schools.25 For the beginners the work was designed to give grammatical
                    knowledge in a natural way. Emphasis was laid upon correct pronunciation, practice of the ear in
                    dictation, free composition and independent oral and written expression. This was augmented by a
                    reading course arranged to give acquaintance with 
                        Germany
                    , with the nature and customs of the people, with 
                        Germany
                    's culture and with her intellectual life. Those pupils, however, who had
                    completed the seven years in the grades were offered advanced 
                        German
                    . This was essentially "a continuation and extension of the work done during
                    the previous years."26 That the work was thorough was evidenced by the
                    fact that "each year a number of those who had completed the advanced four-year course,
                    passed the examination for the license to teach 
                        German
                     in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     district schools."27 Those who went to college obtained
                    advanced standing there.28

                        verbs—strong, weak, irregular—were inflected in the present indicative
                        active, while important single forms of more than a hundred verbs were used. Prepositional
                        phrases, the direct and the indirect object, and the different types of work-order were
                        introduced early in the course. In the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades, two books of 
                            German
                         fairy tales and legends, and one or two of the following texts were studied: Hauff,

                  28 The author speaks from personal experience here, for, after completing
                        the 
                            German
                         "A" courses at Shortridge High School, she entered Indiana
                        University in the fall of 1910 with Junior standing in 
                            German
                        .
            
            
            Nix prefaced his outline of the courses of study in the high schools with the words: "By the
                    intensive study of a number of master works, the pupil's mind is brought into contact with
                    some of the greatest minds that directed the development of 
                        German
                     thought and 
                        German
                     ideals, and influenced in so remarkable a degree the highest intellectual life of the
                    American people. To give the pupil an insight into modern 
                        German
                     life, with its customs and manners, its joys and sorrows, and to render him more
                    proficient in everyday conversation, the study of the classics alternates to some extent with the
                    reading of modern fiction and plays. Those pupils who begin 
                        German
                     in the high schools are offered courses of two, three, and four years, corresponding
                    substantially to the three ‘national grades’ recommended by the Committee of
                    Twelve of the Modern Language Association and adopted by the College Entrance Examination Board.
                    While the direct method dominates the instruction, there is sufficient practice in translation to
                    enable the pupils to pass the examinations in 
                        German
                     required for admission to a number of college courses. During the first three
                    semesters, a beginner's book is used, which assists in classifying and reducing to the form
                    of paradigms and rules the facts of the language that have been acquired through oral
                        exercises."29
            
            In the high schools a 
                        German
                     club was made up from the advanced classes. Programs were varied; lectures were
                    delivered in 
                        German
                     on a wide range of subjects, for example during the year 1908-1909, 
                        German
                     mythology was considered and several of Wagner's masterpieces were explained.
                    Proceeds from entertainments given under the auspices of the club were used to decorate the 
                        German
                     class rooms in typical style. According to the supervisor: "The 
                        German
                     teachers hoped to contribute through these agencies, to the ideal realm of intellect in
                    which 
                        Germany
                     and America shall unite in solving the problems of humanity."30
            
            On October 25, 1910, Superintendent of Schools Calvin N. Kendall reported the death of Robert Nix:
                    "I announce

                            in the two parallel courses in high school is listed.

                     Ibid., 128-129. An item in the Minutes, November
                            24, 1908, corroborates the statement in the Annual Report about the
                            decorating of class rooms: "Superintendent Kendall recommended…. that
                            Peter Scherer, teacher of 
                                German
                             in Shortridge High School be granted permission to decorate his class room, to
                            be designated in the future as the ‘
                                German
                             Room’ of the Shortridge High School." The report was
                            concurred in.
               
                     with great sorrow the death of Mr. Robert Nix, director of 
                        German
                    , on October 16. For 16 years Mr. Nix had been the director of 
                        German
                    . He carried on the work of his department with great intelligence, with energy, with
                    good judgment and with devotion. It was fortunate that this important department of the schools was
                    under such capable leadership. Mr. Nix's work with his teachers was positive and
                    constructive.
            "It is perhaps not generally known that he was one of the ablest scholars that has ever been
                    connected with the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Public Schools. He was a graduate of the University of 
                        Minnesota
                    , and held degrees from 
                        German
                     universities. He was always a student. He was a man of excessive modesty which was no
                    small part of his personal charm. He had unusual executive ability which added greatly to the worth
                    of one in his position. His influence upon the school system was always salutary. We had in him a
                    highly creditable representative of the teaching profession. His death is a loss which cannot easily
                    be made good."31
            
            The Telegraph in its tribute to Robert Nix pointed out that he had carried the 
                        German
                     department to a height which evoked the unrestricted praise of all schoolmen.32
            
            Two months after Nix's death Superintendent Kendall announced the appointment of Peter
                    Scherer as Director of 
                        German
                    . Since September, 1901, Scherer had been a teacher of 
                        German
                     in High School No. 1.33 He was a worthy successor to Nix, for under
                    his direction 
                        German
                     continued its vigorous growth. Among his other accomplishments he raised and
                    standardized the requirements for a teacher's license in 
                        German
                    .
            On May 20, 1915, Scherer had submitted to the superintendent, J. G. Collicott, as part of a long
                    report, the following article dealing with changes in the licenses and salary schedules 
                  
                     31 Minutes, October 25, 1910.

                     33 Minutes, December 13, 1910. For Scherer's appointment as
                            teacher of 
                                German
                             in High School No. 1 and in the grades, see ibid., September
                            20, 1901. Peter J. Scherer was born in Wiesbaden, 
                                Germany
                            , in 1864. He had his college training at Wiesbaden and Frankfurt am Main and
                            taught at both places. Married in 1890, he came to the 
                                United States
                             in 1892 and first settled at 
                        Nashville, Tennessee
                     ,
                            where he taught modern languages. In 1895 he came to 
                                Indianapolis
                            . Until September, 1901, he conducted a private school in 
                                German
                             and French, piano and violin, at the old Propylaeum. The Telegraph, December 14, 1910, carried a column on the first page announcing
                            Scherer's succession to Nix.

            This new system did away with the yearly examination, the result of which, as Scherer said,
                    "might raise or lower the teacher's grade," and thereby determine his
                    salary for the coming year, a practice "not in accord with the rule that a salary increase
                    shall be determined upon the basis of experience or responsibility or both."34
            
            Petitions for the teaching of 
                        German
                     at additional schools and repeated requests for more room in which to teach that 
                        German
                     continued to be almost the only items referring to 
                        German
                     recorded in the minutes of the board of school trustees until 1917. The petitions were
                    usually referred to the superintendent of schools and by him to the board; if the supervisor of 
                        German
                     had approved the petition, it was granted.35
            
            Again the introduction of 
                        German
                     into a school sometimes depended upon the space available for such instruction,
                    evinced, for instance, by the following entry in the minutes: "Messrs. H. E. Hagley and
                    Earhard, M. D., appeared before the Board in behalf of patrons at school 41, relative to the
                    possibility of securing the teaching of 
                        German
                     in school 41. There is a growing demand for the introduction of teaching the 
                        German
                     Language in said building. If it cannot be provided for the second half of 1910/1911 on

                             teachers had been from $500.00-$900.00 (compare Minutes,
                            June 13, 1911). The range in salaries for other teachers at this time was: regular grade,
                            $500.00-$875.00; industrial training-shop,
                            $900.00-$1,350; cooking and sewing,

                            superintendent shows the procedure: "Relative to a petition from a number of

                             in School 51, I beg to submit the following report: 
                        That the petition is in compliance with the Indiana Law, Section 125.
                        That from 80% to 85% of the Graduates of that school go to High School.
                        That there are rooms suitable for 
                                        German
                                     instruction available in the building.
                        Should the board decide to introduce 
                                        German
                                     into School No. 51, I recommend that it be started in September, 1914,
                                    in the second and third grade."
                     
                  
               
                     room in the building, they want some assurance that it be
                    provided at the beginning of 1911/1912."36
            
            A few random selections will further illustrate the increasing need for more room as the demands for 
                        German
                     multiplied: "A report of a committee of investigation relative to 
                        German
                     instruction in the Public Schools, which had no complaint to make except that 31 and 35
                    do not offer sufficient room facilities."37 Another: "Request
                    that the lower grades in main building at No. 57, in main building now half days, be put in upper
                    room of purchased building and the room so vacated in main building be used for 
                        German
                     purposes; which plan was approved."38 Again, a letter from
                    Scherer to Superintendent Collicott read: "The 
                        German
                     classes in School No. 14 meet in a house west of the main building. The distance is
                    about fifty feet. The passage is made possible by means of a board walk. When leaving either
                    building in inclement weather the teachers give the children ample time to put on their wraps. Since
                    March 9th, arrangements have been made that the children in the second grade, two classes, and
                    another class, need not leave the main building for their 
                        German
                     instruction. This is the best that can be done under the present crowded conditions.
                    The other nine 
                        German
                     classes must go to the house."39 And as late as September,
                    1916: "Request of the Director of Modern Languages for arrangement of space in one of the
                    cottages on the grounds to be used for excess classes in 
                        German
                    . Request granted."40
            
            During the year 1915, there were three other bits of information dealing with 
                        German
                     in the minutes: In June it was stated that forty-three 
                        German
                     teachers were receiving automatic increases of salary.41 In October
                    the board granted a request for printing pamphlets for supplementary work to be used by the
                    beginning classes of 
                        German
                     in the high schools.42 At the beginning of the school year,
                    Scherer's title

                            $50.00 and $75.00. The pamphlets were then, to be sold at five cents a
                            copy and the money refunded to the board.

                        German
                     had been changed to Director of Modern Languages.43
            
            Since Scherer's report to the superintendent at the end of June, 1916, was the last one made
                    before World War I, and since it gives a comprehensive picture of the status of 
                        German
                     in the public schools of 
                        Indianapolis
                     at that time, portions of it are included here:
            "The aim of the 
                        German
                     department is to acquaint the pupils with the history, customs, manners, and ideals of
                    the 
                        German
                     people through a knowledge of their language and literature.
            "The ‘direct method’ with some modification is used in teaching the
                    subject. That is to say, 
                        German
                     is, as far as practical, the language of the class room.
            "Inasmuch as singing forms a vital part of 
                        German
                     life, all the classes are taught the most familiar 
                        German
                     songs and are permitted to sing them at intervals throughout the year.
            "Another important feature of the 
                        German
                     work is the programs arranged throughout the year for the benefit of the pupils and
                    patrons. The most important of these are the ‘Weihnachtsfeier’ in which the
                    idea of the 
                        German
                     Christmas Celebration is carried out; the 
                        German
                     play, which is given before the school annually as an auditorium exercise; and the
                    ‘Waldfest’ which is given in one of the parks of the city each spring.
            "1. Schools in which 
                        German
                     is offered. 
                        German
                     is offered as a branch of study in the public high schools, and in the public
                    elementary schools of all districts in which a demand for such instruction was made conformably to
                    the state law.
            "2. Number of schools, classes and teachers. During the year 1915-1916, 
                        German
                     was taught in forty-one district schools and in the high schools. In February, 1916,
                    there were 476 
                        German
                     classes in the district schools, and 85 in the high schools. The district school
                    classes in 
                        German
                     were taught by forty-four teachers and six substitutes; in the high schools, 
                        German
                     was taught by fifteen teachers….
            "3…. In June 1916, 332 graduates from the elementary schools had completed the 
                        German
                     course; 273 received high school credit; 288 will go to high school; 271 enrolled in
                    the advanced course of 
                        German
                     in the high schools….
            
               
                  43
                  Ibid., September 26, 1916.
            
            
            "6. Elementary 
                        German
                     in the District Schools. In the district schools of 
                  Indianapolis, German
                is begun
                    as an optional study in the second year, and continued to the end of the eighth year. It is a
                    well-known fact, that one who begins a modern language in childhood will acquire a thorough
                    knowledge. In childhood the organs of speech are in a plastic condition. Good habits are easily
                    formed; bad habits are easily corrected. Because the mind acts more naively and the memory is more
                    tenacious, forms of expression are readily mastered as simple facts. Later, when the mind grows
                    stronger and more rigid, when the period of analyzing and reasoning begins, and speech habits in the
                    mother tongue have been fixed, it is difficult to acquire even a fairly good pronunciation, and
                    thinking in the foreign language becomes a difficult task. ‘With the dawn of puberty
                    certain linguistic possibilities are lost beyond the power of retrieval. This, I think, is the
                    consensus on the continent and most here realize that we begin too late.’ (G. Stanley
                    Hall, Some Psychological Aspects of the Teaching of the Modern Languages.) The time alloted to 
                        German
                     in the district schools is from twenty-five to thirty minutes daily. 
                        German
                     is the language in the class room. Books, objects and pictures supply the material for
                    oral and aural work, reading and writing. In the primary grade the child's life and
                    surroundings in school and home furnish the principal subjects….
            "The systematic study of grammar is begun in the fifth grade. In this grade the children
                    become acquainted with little 
                        German
                     stories and fairy tales…. In all grades poems are memorized, stories
                    dramatized and acted and the singing of 
                        German
                     songs enliven the class-room work and enrich the lives of the children.
            "7. Advanced 
                        German
                     in the High Schools (3 1/2 years). Pupils who have completed the seven-year course in 
                        German
                     in the district schools with a high school credit are offered 3% years of advanced 
                        German
                     in the high schools. This work is a continuation and extension of the work in the
                    grammar grades. In the application of the direct method, translation is the exception, and not the
                    rule, because the ‘Sprachgefühl’ has been developed to such a
                    degree, and the vocabulary is of such wide range, that the subject matter can be treated in the
                    foreign vernacular.
            "Each year a number of those who completed the  advanced
                    courses pass the written and oral examinations for license to teach 
                        German
                     in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     district schools. Those who go to college will obtain advanced standing in the 
                        German
                     department there.
            "The object of this course is to bring the pupil's mind through the intensive study
                    of a number of classics, modern fiction and plays into contact with some of the greatest minds in 
                        Germany
                    , to give the pupil an insight into modern 
                        German
                     life, with its customs and manners, its joys and sorrows, and to render him more
                    proficient in every day conversation. He then will ‘feel the spirit of another nation,
                    share its aspirations, understand its points of view, and thus strengthen the fraternal bonds and
                    increase the motives of peace and good will.’ (Stanley Hall)
            "8. Elementary 
                        German
                     in the High Schools. In the courses offered to pupils who begin 
                        German
                     in the high schools, the direct method dominates the instruction. There is, however,
                    sufficient practice to enable the pupils to pass the examinations in 
                        German
                     required for admission to colleges where the direct method does not
                        prevail."44
            
            Peter Scherer's report was in reality the swan song for 
                        German
                     instruction in 
                        Indianapolis

                            9 classes in Shortridge High School and Technical High School. In September, 1916, French
                            was introduced in Technical High School. [The author taught this first class.] Spanish was
                            introduced in Manual Training High School and Technical High School in September, 1916. In
                            Shortridge High School Spanish had been taught for the last two years. In October, 1916, 105
                            pupils were enrolled in six classes, in the three high schools." The report was
                            signed: "Peter Scherer, Director of Modern Languages." The last complete
                                Course of Study in

                     when the school board received a letter from the American
                    Rights Committee. The letter read: "To the Board of School Commissioners of the City of 
                        Indianapolis
                    ,
            "We have been reliably informed that the children in at least some of the public schools in
                    the City of 
                        Indianapolis
                     have been and are being permitted and required to sing the ‘Star Spangled
                    Banner’ and other patriotic songs in the 
                        German
                     language.
            "The language of the 
                        United States
                     of America is the English language. The ‘Star Spangled Banner’
                    and ‘America’ are national songs and should be invested with the same high
                    quality of affection and respect that is paid to the flag. They should no more be used as mere
                    exercises for the instruction of children in foreign languages than the flag should be used for
                    commercial purposes. They should be invested with only the highest patriotic significance, and such
                    school children as do not know the English words of these songs should be required to learn them and
                    be taught their meaning. We decidedly oppose the teaching of American children to sing American
                    patriotic songs in a foreign language at any time, but for American children to be taught to sing
                    the ‘Star Spangled Banner,’ ‘America’ and other
                    patriotic songs in 
                        German
                     when the 
                        United States
                     is at war with 
                        Germany
                     is an impropriety so glaring that it would be ludicrous, if it concerned matters less
                    grave. Section 6582a Burns Annotated Indiana Statutes 1914 (being section 1 of an Act in force April
                    5, 1909) provides that the State Board of Education require the singing of ‘The Star
                    Spangled Banner’ in its entirety in the schools of the state of Indiana upon all
                    patriotic occasions. It is unbelievable that the Legislature, when it enacted this law, intended
                    that our national songs should be sung by our children in a foreign language.
            "We do not, of course, know that this practice has been sanctioned by your Board. We request
                    that the Board make an immediate investigation of the facts and that if they are found to be as
                    stated in the first paragraph of this letter, then, on behalf of this organization, which consists
                    of about five hundred American citizens and tax payers of this City, we demand that the practice be
                    abandoned forthwith and never resumed."
            The signers of this letter were: Booth Tarkington, Frank S. Fishback, Garvin M. Brown, Samuel D.
                    Miller,  Henry W. Bennett, Charles S. Lewis, Alex R. Holliday,
                    Maurice E. Tennant, Hugh McK. Landon, and A. M. Gloss-brenner.45
            
            Very noticeable in the minutes of the board, after war was declared, was the fact that delegations
                    petitioning the board for enlarged school quarters or for a new building no longer included
                    "and that 
                        German
                     be taught" in their request. Instead there were requests that certain
                    partitions be removed, partitions, no doubt, which had been put into rooms in recent years to create
                    more space for instruction in 
                        German
                    .46
            
            On September 11, 1917, the Täglicher Telegraph und Tribune carried a
                    short article which announced the abolition of 
                        German
                     in the public schools of 
                        Hoboken
                    , the only city in Hudson County, perhaps even in all 
                        New Jersey
                    , in which 
                        German
                     had been taught in the elementary schools.47 The paper made no
                    comment but the brief notice "cast its shadow before." An editorial in the same
                    paper on October 1, 1917, said that Scherer had prepared a brochure containing remarks made by
                    English and American specialists on the practicality of the study of foreign languages.48
                    
                        German
                     was on the defensive.
            On January 29, 1918, at the meeting of the board of trustees, Commissioner Clarence E. Crippin
                    introduced the following resolution:
            "Whereas, The second semester of the public schools of the city of 
                        Indianapolis
                     will be begun as soon as the fuel situation will permit; and
            "Whereas, The beginning of a school semester is the natural and most favorable time for the
                    commencement or discontinuance of studies by the pupils
            "Whereas, For many years the 
                        German
                     language has, to the exclusion of all other modern foreign languages, been ordered by
                    law to be taught in the graded schools of 
                        Indianapolis
                    ; and
            "Whereas, A state of war exists between the Government of the 
                        United States
                     and the Imperial Government of 
                        Germany
                    ,

                     48
                     Ibid., October 1, 1917. The paper remarked:
                            "Bekanntlich sind gerade in der jetzigen Zeit viele Stimmen gegen den deutschen
                            Unterricht laut geworden."
               
                     and in consequence thereof many of the pupils have asked to be
                    excused from the further study of 
                        German
                     and parents of pupils have expressed a desire that the teaching of the 
                        German
                     language be discontinued in the graded schools of 
                        Indianapolis
                    ; therefore be it
            "Resolved, By the Board of School Commissioners of the City of 
                        Indianapolis
                     that the teaching of the 
                        German
                     language in the graded schools of the school city of 
                        Indianapolis
                     be and hereby is discontinued from and after the date of the adoption of this
                    resolution by the said board of School Commissioners and be it further
            "Resolved, That the Board of School Commissioners of the City of 
                        Indianapolis
                     subscribes to the belief that the public schools should teach our boys and girls the
                    principle of one nation, one language, and one flag, and should not assist in perpetuating the
                    language of an alien enemy in our homes and enemy viewpoints in the community; and be it further
            "Resolved, By the Board of School Commissioners of the City of 
                        Indianapolis
                     that the teachers now employed and under contract to teach the 
                        German
                     language in the graded schools of 
                        Indianapolis
                     be assigned to other duties by the superintendent of public schools until such
                    contracts shall have expired; and be it further
            "Resolved, That because and in consequence of the foregoing resolutions, the position of
                    director of languages in the grade schools be and hereby is discontinued, and that the occupant of
                    this position shall be assigned by the Superintendent of Schools to other duties during the life of
                    his contract."49
            
            The resolution was adopted. There was only one dissenting vote, that of Theodore Stempfel. His reply
                    to the resolution was in part as follows: "This resolution has been introduced on account
                    of the present political and international situation. It is my opinion that this makes it more than
                    otherwise important that we, as school commissioners, should be absolutely free from bias and
                    passion and treat the large question involved from a broad and constructive educational standpoint.
                    Any radical change we may make in the curriculum of our schools will affect the education of the
                    children of our city, not only for the present time, but also for the 
                  
                     49Minutes, January 29, 1918.
               
                     future. It is the easiest thing in the world to destroy. It
                    would not require any thought whatever, but only a prearranged vote of three members of this board,
                    to eliminate with one stroke from the school curriculum any subject which for years has been taught
                    in our schools with good results. By passing this resolution offered, you are heartlessly destroying
                    what has been successfully built up by the conscientious work of teachers for half a
                    century;…. You are doing precisely the opposite of the advice given by the 
                        United States
                     Commissioner of Education, and by leading educators of our own country and
                        abroad…."50 This protest was ordered spread on the
                    minutes, but there is no record of its having produced a reconsideration of the step taken. As far
                    as the majority members of the school board were concerned, 
                        German
                     was irrevocably dropped from the curriculum of the forty-six grade schools in which it
                    was being taught at the time.
            This time the Telegraph was not able to take up the fight for 
                        German
                     instruction as it had done in 1867, 1869, and 1890. This time 
                        German
                     newspapers, too, were in just as much danger as 
                        German
                     instruction, and it wasn't long until they went the same way. A brief
                    editorial stating that the action was no surprise was the only comment the Telegraph ventured.51
            
            Even after the drastic action of putting 
                        German
                     out of the elementary schools, complaints continued to be made to the
                    board. The 
                        United States
                     was at war with 
                        Germany
                     and at that time knowledge of the enemy's language was considered a liability,
                    not an asset; hence the many criticisms hurled at the instruction of 
                        German
                     which are recorded in the minutes were to be expected. On March 12, for instance, the
                    board had sent out notices to all principals that the poem, "Kaiserblumen," in the
                    third reader, was not to be read or studied by the children. It was suggested that it be eliminated
                    by pasting together the pages on which it was written. By way of contrast, on that same date the
                    board received a letter from the Robert Nix Memorial Association of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , asking that the board transmit the association's entire income to the
                    Teachers' Pension Fund, since the body of teachers from which the association's
                    membership came no longer existed. The board wrote a letter of thanks in reply,

                     saying in part: "…your generous donation is
                    worthy of the high civic ideals always characterizing your esteemed Association…. this
                    disposition… will be an incentive and an inspiration leading to a more unselfish type of
                    citizenship and to a more enlightened and liberal public spirit among all classes of our people in
                    this community. The Board regrets that circumstances have caused the dissolution of an Association,
                    the value of which both educationally and socially, has been established here for so many
                    years." On April 9, 1918, the following resolution was received and was adopted by the
                    unanimous vote of the board:
            "Whereas, complaints have been made by various patriotic societies of the City of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Indiana, relative to the use of a certain text-book in the 
                        German
                     language known and entitled as ‘Beginners 
                        German
                    ’ and written or compiled under the directions of Professors Max Walter and
                    Carl A. Krause, which said text-book is alleged to be pro-
                        German
                     in its tendencies, teachings and influence, and which was adopted and selected for use
                    in the Schools of Indiana, by a former Board of School Book Commissioners, and Whereas, the Board of
                    School Book Commissioners of the City of 
                        Indianapolis
                     is desirous of protecting the youth of the city from all influences inimical to the
                    principles of patriotism and true Americanism, and of keeping unsullied and pre-eminent in their
                    minds and hearts, their devotion to our country and its matchless institutions:
            "Therefore be it resolved, by the Board of School Commissioners of the City of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Indiana, that the Honorable Board of School Commissioners for the State of Indiana be
                    requested to select and adopt such books for the use of classes in 
                        German
                    , and otherwise, as shall not be susceptible to the criticism heretofore described, and
                    which shall, in addition to the specific instruction intended, awaken and nourish those patriotic
                    impulses and love of country, so essential to the maintenance of an enlightened and democratic form
                    of government, and to the perpetuity of our great Republic."52
            
            Shortly after this, June 14, the Marion County Council of Defense submitted the following resolutions
                    to the board: "Whereas the teaching of 
                        German
                     in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     public schools has been unduly promoted at great expense to the tax payers, while the
                    teaching of French and Spanish languages 
                  
                     52Minutes, April 9, 1918.
               
                     has been neglected and not given the attention that the
                    interest of our country demands, and
            "Whereas, the teaching of the French language was by the old Board of School Commissioners
                    placed entirely under the direction of the Supervisor of the 
                        German
                     language,
            "Therefore be it resolved that the Marion County Council of Defense request that the Board
                    of School Commissioners take the teaching and supervision of the French language out from under the
                    control and direction of the 
                        German
                     Supervisor and place it under the supervision of a competent person who is of known
                    American loyalty and by birth and training in sympathy with the French people who have made such
                    magnificent and supreme sacrifices in the cause of human Liberty and Freedom.
            "Be it further resolved, that the Marion County Council request the said Board to
                    incorporate in all contracts with teachers a clause as follows: This contract is entered into upon
                    the representation of the teacher by whom it is signed that he or she has been, is now, and will
                    continue to be thoroughly loyal to the 
                        United States
                     and the nations joined with her in the present world struggle for human liberty and
                    democracy, and it is mutually agreed that any act, utterance, or association with others on the part
                    of said teacher, tending to inculcate or aid in the support of, or admiration for the 
                        German
                     Kaiser or the existing Government, or Kultur of 
                        Germany
                    , shall be sufficient cause for the termination of this contract." Again the
                    board concurred.
            Eleven days later there was a protest from L'union Fraternelle Franchise against the
                    appointment of Peter Scherer as Supervisor of French, he being of 
                        German
                     birth, education, and training and formerly employed as Supervisor of 
                        German
                    . The president of the board assured the petitioners that their petition would receive
                    consideration. The following month a delegation composed of Carl Lieber, Clemens Vonnegut, and
                    George Mueller "appeared before the board, in behalf of Mr. Scherer, asking that he be
                    retained in the position in which he had been employed the preceding year." The board
                    solved its dilemma by means of the following resolution by Clarence E. Crippin:
            "Whereas, it is considered advisable by the Board of School Commissioners of the City of 
                        Indianapolis
                     to reorganize the Department for the teaching of Modern Foreign Languages in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Public Schools.
            
            "Therefore, be it resolved, by the Board of School Commissioners that the position known as
                    ‘Director of Modern Languages,’ be, and the same hereby is, now abolished. Be
                    it further resolved that Mr. Peter Scherer be, and he hereby is, employed as ‘Supervisor
                    of 
                        German
                    ’ in the High Schools of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , to re-organize and consolidate the remaining classes in High School 
                        German
                     during the semester ending on or about February 1, 1919."
            This resolution "was adopted by a full affirmative vote of all of the members of the board,
                    although Commissioner Tutewiler being absent, communicated her vote in favor of the resolution
                    through Commissioner Crippin." After the resolution was adopted, the following clause of
                    loyalty was inserted into the teacher contracts: The undersigned teacher further agrees that
                    disloyalty to the 
                        United States
                     of America on the part of the teacher either in spoken or written word or act, shall be
                    ground for the teacher's discharge "for cause" within the meaning of that
                    term as used herein.
            Peter Scherer was placed in charge of 
                        German
                     in the high schools only, but that, too, was an untenable position, for now there was
                    only a pitiful remnant of 
                        German
                     left in the high schools. At Shortridge High School in September, 1918, the enrollment
                    was a mere 31, whereas in June, 1915, it had reached an all time high of 703, and in June, 1917, it
                    had still been 520.53 Technical High School reached its highest peak in
                    1916-1917 with an enrollment of 1,178, of which only 112 were left in September, 1918.54 With such rapid decreases in one short year, it scarcely needed the action of the
                    legislature, which, with a sweeping gesture, rooted out 
                        German
                     instruction from all grade schools of the state, public and private, on February 25,
                    1919, and from the state's high schools on March 13.55
            
            
               
                  53 The records at Shortridge High School show the following:

                  Laws of Indiana, 1919, p. 50: "Section 1. Be it enacted by the general assembly of the State of Indiana, That all
                        subjects and branches taught in the elementary schools of the State of Indiana…shall

            When we look back over the years and see the untold number of hours of labor which went into the
                    building up of 
                        German
                     instruction in the public schools of the city of 
                        Indianapolis
                    —hours and labor contributed by men and women who worked for love as well as
                    for pay, men and women who wearied, but never despaired, since they were inspired by an unshakable
                    faith in all that was best in 
                        German
                     culture—we realize that much was lost when 
                        German
                     was banned from the schools of Indiana.
            Now the circle is complete. Once again in the history of education, not just in one state but all
                    over America, efforts are being made to make our country language-conscious and to begin teaching
                    modern languages in the grades. Methods, aims, and immediate objectives advocated are quite similar
                    to those in use during the flowering of 
                        German
                     instruction between 1869 and 1919, despite a change in the terminology descriptive
                    thereof. Boys and girls of a bygone day, who began their 
                        German
                     in the second grade and continued it through high school, acquired a competence in the
                    spoken language and in reading, a proficiency in writing letters and free compositions, as well as
                    an insight into another culture, an insight progressively brought about by area studies, song,
                    verse, lore, and literature. The circle is complete, but it has sprung its bounds.
                    America's leadership in the world today has widened the outlook to include foreign language
                    in the

                        Indianapolis
                     hoped that through a knowledge of 
                        German
                     culture in the broad sense of the word they might contribute "to the ideal

            "The Boggstown Resolutions"
            A correspondent to the Indiana Magazine of History recently asked about the story
                    of a township in an Indiana county which early in 1861 declared that in the event the Union was
                    divided and the township was required to cast its lot with one or the other portion, it chose to be
                    attached to the Southern Confederacy. Accordingly, we are printing the account of the meeting that
                    drew up "The Famous Boggstown Resolutions," written by William R. Norris,
                    secretary of the Boggstown Convention, as it appears in Brant & Fuller, History
                        of Shelby County, Indiana (
                        Chicago
                    , 1887), 322-331.
            Edward H. Chadwick's History of Shelby County, Indiana (
                        Indianapolis
                    , 1909), 99-103, also contains a description of the meeting, taken from this same
                    account by William R. Norris.
            A search of some contemporary newspapers does not yield any corroboration of this event. The Indiana Magazine of History would welcome further information about it.
            The following is Norris' account and the resolutions:
            "The meeting of the citizens of Sugar Creek Township, that assembled at the school-house in
                    Boggstown, on Saturday, the 16th day of February, 1861, was the most notable one that ever met in
                    the history of that township. It had been well advertised throughout the township by written notices
                    posted up in all public places the week before, and a general turnout of the citizens was secured.
                    The school-house was full and overflowing. The evening was mild, but cloudy and threatening,
                    somewhat in keeping with the disturbed condition of the country at that time. The meeting was
                    promptly organized at I o'clock P.M., by the selection of W. C. E. Wanee for president or
                    chairman, and Wm. R. Norris as secretary, both citizens of 
                        Shelbyville
                     now, but who were then residents of ‘Old Sugar Creek.’ At this
                    time Sugar Creek Township possessed more debating talent to the square inch, and a better knowledge
                    of parliamentary rules and usages, than any other township in the 
                        United States
                    . Debating had been assiduously cultivated at Boggstown as the central point of the
                    township for years and years, until everybody that would talk or wanted to talk, could talk. All the
                    questions of the day  current in debating societies had been
                    discussed time and again by the debating society that flourished at Boggstown permanently, and it
                    took in the entire township. The consequence was that the old farmers and their boys were all
                    debaters, and all took a pride in extemporaneous speaking. Hence a lively time was expected, as it
                    was anticipated that the last resolution would provoke bitter opposition from the Republicans
                    present, and there was a general turnout of them as well as the Democrats, who were in a large
                    majority in the township, being then about three to one.
            "On motion, W. C. E. Wanee, Dr. J. W. Smelser and Wm. R. Norris, were appointed a Committee
                    on Resolutions. The committee retired behind the school-house for consultation. Dr. Smelser drew
                    from his, coat pocket the Resolutions ‘cut and dried’ already written out,
                    they had been prepared by him and a cousin of his, Mr. Fullalove, of 
                        Louisville
                    , Ky., who had been visiting his, Dr. Smelser's, family for some two or three
                    weeks, and who was very desirous to have them adopted by the meeting, that he might take them back
                    home with him as the popular expression of the true sentiment of the people in a township like Sugar
                    Creek, situate in the heart of Central Indiana. The debate was opened by Dr. Smelser, who read the
                    resolutions and supported them in a speech of probably fifteen or twenty minutes. Smelser was a good
                    speaker, well informed and thoroughly posted on the political news of the day, and as he eloquently
                    urged the passage of the resolutions, especially the last one, the attention of the audience was
                    intense, you could have heard a pin drop, the silence was so complete; he was followed by Norris who
                    advocated the resolutions likewise and urged upon the meeting the propriety of adopting them entire
                    and especially the last one as the most important of all. Mr. Wanee, the chairman of the meeting
                    then rose, and drawing from his pocket a small book, said: ‘My friends, we are all met
                    here to-day for a common purpose, not as party men, but for the consideration of the great questions
                    that now disturb our common country and threaten this lovely land with all the horrors of civil war.
                    I will thereby read you, some extracts from this little book I hold in my hand, which is a laconic
                    work, on the horrors and terrors of war. I think the writer so much better expresses and describes
                    the horrors and evils than anything that I myself could offer, that I will read it to you, his essay
                    on war.’  He then read from the book an exceedingly
                    well written description of the calamities caused by war. This occupied about ten minutes, as Mr.
                    Wanee read very slowly and impressively, he being an excellent reader. Three speeches had now been
                    made in behalf of the resolutions, and all of them by the Committee on Resolutions, and it begun to
                    look like there would be no opposition to the passage of the resolutions, but at this juncture Dr.
                    Wm. G. McFadden, a young physician and Republican, who then lived about two and a half miles north
                    of Boggstown, on the old McFadden homestead, the Doctor is now and has been a well known citizen of 
                        Shelbyville
                     for many years, arose from his seat in the audience and requested the secretary to
                    re-read the resolutions and particularly the last one, as he thought that he had some objections to
                    the last one. The secretary complied, reading the resolutions deliberately and the last one very
                    slowly, word by word.
            "Dr. McFadden then proceeded to state his objections to the last resolution, saying, that he
                    thought it inexpedient in the present disturbed condition of political opinion, and in view of the
                    heated and exasperated feelings of the southern people, especially the slave holders, to pass such a
                    resolution, as it would in his judgment already add fuel to the flame so fiercely burning in all the
                    states south of the 
                        Ohio
                     River. That would encourage them and make them believe that they had abundance of
                    sympathy and support right here in Indiana, and it might be the cause of precipitating a dissolution
                    of the Union, they expecting in that event that Indiana and other western states would go with them,
                    and form a new confederation that would embrace the Southern States, the Western States, 
                        New York
                     and 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , and would leave the Yankee or New 
                        England
                     States out in the cold. That for his part he preferred keeping all the states together
                    and not permitting any division of the Union, and that, if necessary to keep them in, he should be
                    in favor of the government using coercion, much as he deprecated war, and civil war above all wars.
                    The young Doctor's speech made a profound impression, and was received with many marks of
                    approval by the Republicans present, whilst the Democrats looked somewhat uneasy for fear the
                    resolution would encounter decided opposition. At this point, Secretary Norris sprang to his feet
                    and commenced a rapid argument in favor of the resolution, enumerating the many geographical,
                    commercial and business  advantages that would enure to our
                    people by going with the South in case of a dissolution of the Union. He said amongst other things
                    that the whole 
                        Mississippi
                     valley should go together, that God Almighty and nature designed them to be one and
                    indivisible, that as waters of our State flowed to the 
                        Mississippi
                    , and the 
                        Mississippi
                     to the Gulf—nature herself had pointed out our destiny—that as
                    for his part he was born with southern blood in his veins, that he could never go back on his native
                    State, old 
                        Kentucky
                    , that he had lived as they were all well aware, for more than two years quite recently,
                    in the Land of the Border Ruffians, Western 
                        Missouri
                    , right in the hot-bed of negro slavery, where they all owned slaves—that to
                    his certain knowledge western 
                        Missouri
                     was a perfect nigger's paradise, that the slaves were well treated, many of
                    them better than they deserved. That from his knowledge of southern slave holders he would much
                    prefer going with them if they did secede and leave the Union, to allying himself to the
                    hypocritical, cunning, crafty, foxy, blue-bellied Yankees of the New 
                        England
                     States—and a great deal more was said by the secretary in the same vein.
            "Dr. Smelser followed with an earnest appeal in behalf of the South, stating that he had
                    been in slave states, that he knew the condition of the niggers in 
                        Kentucky
                     was much preferable to that of many poor white men in the North, and a thousand times
                    better than the condition of the overworked and underpaid operators in the factories of the Yankee
                    States. That he would prefer, infinitely prefer, a union with Southern slaveholders to a union with
                    the hypocritical Pharisees of New 
                        England
                    , the cold-blooded calculating Yankees, whose only God was money, who first stole the
                    niggers from Africa and sold them to the south, and who now wanted to free the niggers, so that they
                    could get them to come North and work for them, and wait on them for little or nothing, pay them off
                    in old clothes and cold victuals, whilst pretending to be their friends—they would rather
                    steal a nigger from a good comfortable home where he was well treated and taken care of, than to pay
                    some poor white man good living wages to do their drudgery. The Yankees were nearly all
                    Abolitionists, and he hoped that Caleb Cushing, Ben 
                        Butler
                     and all such good Democrats, who were willing to stand by the south in protecting their
                    rights to their slave property would move out, and go to the south or west, where the people would
                    welcome  them with warm hearts and open hands. The Doctor said
                    much more in a similar strain, advocating the passage of the resolution with vehement eloquence. He
                    sat down and Dr. McFadden undertook to reply, by saying that he had no love for the Yankees nor the
                    Abolitionists, but he thought the resolution was premature and imprudent in view of the excited
                    condition of the public mind both north and south, that it might hasten a dissolution of the Union
                    much sooner than we anticipated, etc.
            "At this stage of the discussion, Homer Palmeter, an old man, and a 
                        Jackson
                     Democrat, who read the 
                  
                            New York
                         Day Book, an ultra fire-eating, Democratic paper, morning, noon and night,
                    took the floor. He was an old man whose soul absorbing passion was politics, and who kept posted on
                    its every kaleidoscopic phase. He said amongst other things, ‘Mr. President, we hear much
                    said about coishun (coercion) in the papers, they're full of it, both Dimekratic and
                    Rippublican. I say Mr. President, let's bring it right home to ourselfs. How would you, Mr.
                    President, like to be coished (coerced, he meant). I know you wouldn't. We all know you
                    wouldn't. Now if it isn't right to coish (coerce) a man, it ain't right
                    to coish (coerce) a State. What's right between man and man is right between States and
                    States. "Do as you would be done by," is the golden rule of Holy Writ, laid down
                    by Christ himself, and don't undertake to coish (coerce) our Southern brithrin.’
                    He then launched into a philippic against the Abolitionists for agitating the slavery question and
                    disturbing the harmony of the people and the States.
            "Speeches were also made by many others, as the Secretary persisted in calling on every one
                    present for an expression of opinion. The two brothers, 
                        Washington
                     and John McConnell, made temperate and logical speeches in favor of the resolutions.
                    Young Robert McConnell, eldest son of John McConnell, warmly endorsed the resolutions. Armstrong
                    Gibson advocated them in an impulsive manner. David Smith earnestly favored their adoption and
                    thought it was high time to cut loose from the meddlesome and accursed Abolitionists of the Yankee
                    States. He was followed by Adam Smith, his brother, who has distinguished himself of late years in
                    advocating the theory that the earth stands still and the ‘sun do move’ around
                    it, in numerous debates with some of the scientific men of the age. Uncle Adam said:
                    ‘Gentlemen, I have  been much interested in the
                    discussion of the resolutions, and I for one, am emphatically in favor of their adoption. If it
                    comes to a sepperation of the States I prefer to go with the Southern nigger drivers all the time to
                    agoin' with the Blue-Bellied Yanks. By Griddy them's my sentiments,
                    gentlemen.’
            "A number of other short speeches were made, by Chairman Wanee, Secretary Norris, Dr.
                    Smelser, Homer Palmerton and others. The large and influential relationship of the Johnstons and
                    Carsons, who comprised the bulk of the Republican voters of the township, were out in full force,
                    and they at first supported Dr. McFadden, the Union-at-all-hazards champion, in his determined
                    opposition; but they were gradually won over to the affirmative by the continued argument and
                    persuasion of the Democrats, until finally Dr. McFadden was left solitary and alone in his
                    opposition. As a last despairing effort, he said: Gentlemen, the people of New 
                        England
                     are not all Abolitionists, and they are not as bad as has been represented. The Yankees
                    were good soldiers in the War of the Revolution, they helped us mightily to achieve our
                    independence. The Revolution, you remember, began at 
                        Lexington
                     and Bunker Hill. I for one am not willing to give up "Yankee Doodle, 
                        Lexington
                     and Bunker Hill." At this point the secretary, who was familiarly known as
                    Dick Norris, called upon his fast friend and bosom crony, Ben Farmbrough, the great trading man of
                    the township, for an expression of his sentiments. Ben, surnamed ‘Old Sly,’
                    slowly rose to his feet, and in his peculiarly quaint and comical tone, said: ‘Gentlemen,
                    you all know I'm not speech maker; but at sich a time as this I thinks it stands every man
                    in hand to impress his sentiments. I know the Southerners well; I hev traded in Old Kaintuck; I hev
                    bot stock thar, and I hev sold stock thar. Whatever a Kaintuckian tells you, you can depend on;
                    he's fair and squar; his word's as good as his bond. I speak what I know; I hav et
                    at thar tables, staid at their houses of nights, and had lots o’ deelins with
                    'em, and thars not a more cleverer or a more honorabler set of people on the face of the
                    urth than they ar. As for the blue-belli'd Yanks, I've hed deelins with them too;
                    an you've got to watch ‘em all the time, watch ‘em as well as pray,
                    for prayin wont do no good; they'll cheet you enny how if they git the least chance, an if
                    they don't they make a chance. I tel you the Devil will never git  his own until he gits the Yanks, and he'll be mighty loth to
                    claim 'em for he knows 'em too well; he knows they wouldn't be in hell
                    six months before they cheet him out of his kingdom and set up a government of their own. No,
                    he'll not take 'em in if he can help it, he'll just shut the door in
                    their faces and tel ‘em thro’ the keyhole that he don't want em, for
                    'em to go on still lower down, and set up a kingdom of their own, and cheet it out among
                    themselves. If we had the few good Dimekrats out o' New 
                        England
                    , I would say, go to thunder, we don't want to be associated with you
                    dead-beets and everlastin cheets no longer. I fer one am fer the south. Them's my
                    sentiments.’
            "It is needless to remark that Ben's speech brought down the house, and that a
                    motion was thereupon made to vote for the resolutions. The chairman put the question, shall the
                    resolutions pass, it was answered from all parts of the room as well as out doors by a stentorian
                    yes. He then said, are there any opposed to the resolution. Dr. McFadden rose and said, I vote no
                    against the last resolution; he was feebly seconded by two others, whose names I have forgotten, and
                    one young man, 
                        Washington
                     Andrews, refused to vote either way. The chairman declared the resolutions passed by a
                    large majority, nearly unanimous—he regretted that it wasn't entirely unanimous,
                    but the minority, no matter how small their numbers, were entitled to vote their sentiments.
            "The resolutions as passed by the meeting were taken to 
                        Louisville
                    , Ky., the next Monday by Mr. Fullalove, Dr. Smelser's cousin, and by him
                    furnished to the 
                        Louisville
                     papers, with a report of the meeting. The resolutions were published in the papers of
                    that city, with glowing comments by the editors, who represented that this was a true exponent of
                    the sentiments of the Western States, and that Sugar Creek Township had simply taken the initiative
                    in giving voice to their sentiments. That Sugar Creek Township was situated in Shelby County, the
                    home of the distinguished Democratic politician the Hon. Thomas A. Hendricks, and that no doubt
                    these resolutions were a true reflex of the sentiments prevailing not only in Indiana, but in all
                    the Western States. They were published all over the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific and
                    from the Lakes to the Gulf, and were circulated broadcast over the entire South. There is no doubt
                    that they proved an important factor in stimulating the spirit of secession and hastening the advent
                    of the inevitable conflict.’
            
            "The Volunteer of March 7, 1861, contained this article: ‘The
                    following are the resolutions passed by the Sugar Creek union meeting on the 16th. The first and
                    second resolutions were passed unanimously, and the third by three or four dissenting voices. The
                    meeting was about equally composed of Democrats and Republicans.’

            "There were no further attempts to hold Union meetings in Shelby County for some time, and
                    things drifted along in this manner until the firing on Fort Sumter brought about the crisis.
                    Nothing can well exceed the excitement occasioned by that first act of the rebellion. Public
                    meetings were held in most of the villages and hamlets throughout the North, at which speeches were
                    made and resolutions passed, denouncing the secession movement in unmeasured terms. The
                    President's call for 75,000 volunteers was responded to with alacrity. No portion of the
                    country was more prompt in stepping forward in defense of the Union than was Shelby

            These concluding volumes of the Theodore Roosevelt letters cover Roosevelt's hunting trip to
                    Africa, his triumphant visits to the countries and royal courts of western Europe, his break with
                    Taft, his campaign for the Republican nomination in 1912 and his defeat, the organization of the
                    Progressive party, the election of 1912, his South American expedition in 1914, the liquidation of
                    the Progressive party, Roosevelt's opposition to American neutrality after 1914 and his
                    attempts to arouse the country to the 
                        German
                     threat, his campaign for American military preparedness, his part in the presidential
                    campaign of 1916, his earnest endeavors to get into the war himself as an organizer of four
                    divisions and how he was rebuffed, his furious hatred of Wilson, his ideas of a proper peace
                    settlement after the war, his part in the congressional elections of 1918, and the increasing
                    convergence of all the anti-Wilson forces around the name and activities of Roosevelt—a
                    convergence which probably would have made him the victorious Republican nominee for President in
                    1920 had he lived and had his health permitted. These final volumes are edited with the wit and
                    insight which characterized the editing of the previous six volumes.
            Roosevelt was both an ambitious opportunist and a sincere believer in causes (what politician of the
                    first rank is not?), but in Roosevelt both the opportunism and the belief in causes are much more
                    pronounced than is usual. This is what makes him so paradoxical and so controversial a figure. The
                    revisionist view of Roosevelt, popular after his death and reflecting the inevitable reaction from
                    his personal popularity while he lived, had emphasized his opportunism. The current rehabilitation
                    of Roosevelt rightly emphasizes his strong and remarkably coherent and consistent philosophy.
            Roosevelt's campaign for the nomination against Taft, his organizing of the Progressive
                    party, his remaining in the race against Wilson, and his liquidating of the Progressive party can be
                    put down as evidence of Roosevelt's vaulting  ambition,
                    of his determination to "rule or ruin." But these letters and other evidence can
                    be used to make a convincing case for the other side. There can be no doubt that Roosevelt was a
                    sincere social-minded and national-minded democrat. He was sincerely shocked by Taft's
                    ineptitude and truckling to the conservatives in the Republican party. He honestly believed that he
                    represented the rank-and-file progressive views of the average American of around 1910 and 1912,
                    that the Republican party had a better chance of winning in 1912 and of advancing acceptable
                    progressive principles with him as the nominee than it had with Taft or LaFollette as the nominee.
                    Also, his contention that the Democratic party was the party of the "rural
                    toryism" of the South and the victim of its antiquated states-rights doctrines was no pose.
                    The split in the Republican party had already occurred before the nomination of the progressive
                    Wilson took place. Indeed, it is not improbable that Roosevelt's impending candidacy on the
                    Bull Moose ticket prodded the Democrats into rejecting the more conservative Champ Clark and
                    nominating Wilson. (In a sense, Roosevelt played in the rise of Wilson the role Douglas played in
                    the rise of 
                        Lincoln
                    , although Roosevelt would be exasperated at this comparison, since he loathed Douglas,
                    came to loathe Wilson, and on almost every other page of his letters compares himself to 
                        Lincoln
                    .) After Wilson's nomination it would have been difficult for Roosevelt to
                    retire, even had he desired to do so, for he had made too many commitments to his associates and
                    followers; besides, he still earnestly believed that Wilson's program was too states-rights
                    oriented, that it lacked a Hamiltonian centralization which alone could make it effective. Moreover,
                    there was real wisdom in Roosevelt's scuttling of the Progressive party after 1914. He saw
                    earlier than the other Progressive leaders the impact of the World War on domestic politics, how the
                    war and postwar atmosphere would not be conducive to the growth of the Progressive party. He
                    discerned, too, what Beveridge and other Progressive leaders chose to ignore, that the Progressive
                    party, in spite of its remarkable showing in 1912, had not elected enough congressional, state, and
                    local officials, that it had not taken sufficient root in the precincts and localities to allow it
                    to become a major party.
            Theodore Roosevelt was one of the few Americans of his time who understood the international balance
                    of power. He  warned, particularly in his long and vivid letter
                    to George Otto Trevelyan describing his travels in Europe in 1910, that the new and astonishing
                    industrial efficiency of 
                        Germany
                     and 
                        Japan
                    , belatedly built on feudal class structures and combined with anachronistic
                    authoritarian traditions, might lead to wars of aggression for which Britain and America were
                    unprepared. His insights into 
                        Germany
                    's industrial and social structure anticipated by many years the brilliant
                    interpretations of Thorstein Veblen's Imperial 
                            Germany
                        . Roosevelt believed that the world situation required and would continue to
                    require a close paralleling of British and American foreign policies, with universal military
                    service in both countries; and he even suggested, as early as 1914, that after the defeat of 
                        Germany
                     the Western powers might have to rebuild 
                        Germany
                    , with safeguards, to stand against Russia and the Slavs.
            However, along with this clear-headedness about the balance of power, Roosevelt was singularly blind
                    to some other aspects of international relations. He did not understand at all the anti-imperialist
                    revolutions, already taking place in his own day in 
                        Mexico
                     and in Sun Yat-sen's 
                        China
                    . He did not understand the strength (and the underlying reasons for it) of the
                    collectivist movements in the Europe of his own day, and he did not at all understand or anticipate
                    the strength (and the underlying reasons for it) of the collectivist movements inside the
                    anti-imperialist revolutions of his day and a later day. Finally, Roosevelt was almost completely
                    unprepared for the growing tendency of all nations, both old and new, to cooperate, even federate,
                    in international organizations.
            There is no denying that Roosevelt, because of a mixture of personal ambition, hatred for Wilson, and
                    sincere belief in nationalism, encouraged some dangerous tendencies in American life. He led the
                    pack in the domestic anti-
                        German
                     hysteria of 1914-1918. He was for loyalty oaths, the dismissing of teachers, the
                    banning of books. He would investigate historians like Robinson, Beard, and Shotwell; he would expel
                    LaFollette from the Senate; he would hang Viereck. After the October Revolution in Russia, he also
                    led the anti-Communist hysteria. He would send an American army to Russia to back the Cossacks and
                    the counter-revolution. His domestic enemies became Bolshevists, no better than Dantans,
                    Robespierres,  Marats, Lenins, Trotskys. He was not content
                    merely to cast out the I.W.W. or even Debs, Berger, and Hillquit as Communists. To this category,
                    from time to time, he consigned the Nonpartisan League, Hearst, LaFollette, 
                        Fremont
                     Older, Amos Pinchot, Rudolph Spreckels, Felix Frankfurter, 
                        Newton
                     Baker, Woodrow Wilson. His hatred of Wilson knew no bounds. To Roosevelt, Wilson was
                    callous, perfidious, sinister; he was an empty rhetorician and a hypocrite; he was without
                    intellect, morals, or patriotism; he was a pacifist and even a traitor; he was by all odds- the
                    worst President in American history, much worse than James Buchanan. In numerous private letters to
                    British and French officials and leaders, Roosevelt, in the midst of the war, spewed out his savage
                    characterizations of the President. Often he would preface such letters with: "I hope the
                    censor won't see this." When Roosevelt's correspondents would suggest
                    that perhaps Wilson's timing of America's entry into the war was sound, that at
                    least he carried with him a fairly united nation, Roosevelt would reply that the nation was more
                    unified for war at the time of the sinking of the "Lusitania" than it was in 1917.
                    When Roosevelt's correspondents would hint at Wilson's brilliant use of the
                    pre-armistice negotiations with 
                        Germany
                     to talk directly to the 
                        German
                     people and undermine the Hohenzollern regime, Roosevelt would reply that Wilson was
                    merely attempting to doublecross the Allies, make a soft peace with 
                        Germany
                    , and win personal glory for himself. This "outrageous plan" of
                    Wilson, Roosevelt maintained, miscarried only because of the Republican congressional victory of
                    1918.
            By 1918 Roosevelt had become the symbol and the converging point of the anti-Wilson reaction. For
                    this role he was a "natural": his flaming hatred of Wilson, his shrill
                    anti-Bolshevism, his intense nationalism. It is safe to say that the "pro-
                        German
                     isolationists" whom Roosevelt so severely castigated during the
                    war—the LaFollettes, the Hearsts, and the Vierecks—would have been
                    Roosevelt's allies by 1920, united by their common anti-Wilsonism and their nationalism.
                    Indeed, even during the war itself Roosevelt was flirting with some extreme opponents of the war,
                    among them Tom Watson of 
                        Georgia
                     and Ernest Lundeen of 
                        Minnesota
                    . This was a foretaste of what would have come on a large scale had Roosevelt lived
                    until 1920. As early as 1918, Roosevelt was  preparing to wage
                    the campaign of 1920 on the issue of nationalism versus internationalism. In a letter to Beveridge,
                    Roosevelt gave assurances that anything he (Roosevelt) said which indicated sympathy for
                    internationalism was merely "a platonic expression" designed to mollify Taft and
                    other internationalists in the Republican party. And yielding to expediency on a measure which would
                    have been consistent with nationalism but not with isolationist nationalism, Roosevelt, usually so
                    clear-headed on the balance of power, indicated that he would oppose any American-British-French
                    alliance designed to protect 
                        France
                     from renewed 
                        German
                     aggression.
            Had Roosevelt lived on to 1920 and been elected President, it is possible that the conservative
                    reaction in the 
                        United States
                     would have been given a more articulate, decisive, and ideological orientation. On the
                    other hand, Roosevelt in power probably would have relaxed, become more objective. His bite was
                    never as formidable as his bark. There was something Gallic about Roosevelt. Like the politicians of
                    the Third French Republic, he liked to engage in polemics, personal controversies, fierce
                    journalistic onslaughts. In deeds French politicians are apt to be much more moderate than in words.
                    Roosevelt resembles Clemenceau; there was a strong similarity of outlook, manner, and methods.
            These letters testify that after 1910 Roosevelt was more frustrated than even the general public
                    supposed. They also testify to what the public did not suspect: that after 1910 Roosevelt was a
                    tired and in some ways a prematurely old man, that after 1914 he was a sick man.
            The eight volumes of letters reveal that Roosevelt was a man of considerable intellectual stature.
                    His first love was not biology but history, and while his earlier works, like the Thomas Hart 
                            Benton
                        
               , were often superficial, had he gone into history writing as a profession, as
                    he once contemplated when he was Vice-President and saw little prospect of political advancement, he
                    might have developed into a historian in the grand manner. His description of the various stages of
                    historical development of the peoples along the Nile in his day and his account of the royal courts,
                    dynasties, aristocracies, and plain peoples of Western Europe in 1910 show much historical insight
                    and narrative power. Roosevelt the reader of literature and history was never as cock-sure as
                    Roosevelt the public man. (The years he occupied the Presidency, the  years in which he read less, were the years of his most irritating
                    intellectual cock-sureness.) Intellectually, Roosevelt showed considerable capacity for objectivity
                    and for changing his mind. In a letter to William E. Dodd, Roosevelt, always antagonistic to
                    Jefferson, reveals a genuine interest in Dodd's favorable interpretation of Jefferson; and
                    in Roosevelt's later life he largely rejected the racist theories of Lothrop Stoddard and 
                        Madison
                     Grant, theories with which in earlier life he had flirted.
            Students of Indiana history will be interested in the interchange of letters between Roosevelt and
                    famous Hoosiers like William D. Foulke, Lucius B. Swift, Charles W. Fairbanks, Will Hays, John W.
                    Foster, and Albert J. Beveridge. There is a series of curious and impudent letters between Foster
                    and Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Beveridge were never really close, not nearly so close as their
                    political collaboration would seem to justify, but in the final years both men were brought closer
                    together by their mutual distaste for Wilson, their hostility to internationalism, and
                    Roosevelt's genuine appreciation of Beveridge's first two volumes of The Life of John Marshall.

            One finishes James D. Horan's long account of his search for new material with the feeling
                    that industry rewarded him. He had the use of the Baker-Turner Papers in the War Records Office of
                    the National Archives, which he says were still under lock and key when he first sought access to
                    them in 1951. While some documents dealing with the conspiracies in the North during the Civil War
                    were published in the Official Records of the war, the bulk of them were not.
                    Horan also used the papers of Thomas H. Hines, the hero of his book, that are in the Margaret I.
                    King Library of the University of 
                        Kentucky
                    , as well as some letters that passed between Hines and Nancy Sproule—whom
                    Hines married during the war—that are privately owned.
            Thus Horan had very important sources not used by Mayo Fesler for his basic study, "Secret
                    Political Societies  in the North during the Civil
                    War," that filled the September, 1918, number of the Indiana Magazine of
                        History. (That excellent article is cited in Horan's bibliography but with the
                    author's name incorrectly given as Fesley.) Nor were the two sources described open to
                    George Fort 
                        Milton
                     when writing his very readable Abraham 
                            Lincoln
                         and the Fifth Column, which appeared in 1942, nor to Professor Wood Gray,
                    whose well-documented The Hidden Civil War—The Story of the Copperheads
                    was published the same year.
            In view of what was previously known about the conspiracies, one reads with surprise the words,
                    "A Discovery in History," below the title of Horan's work. He certainly
                    did not discover Hines, for that plotter is a prominent character in both the 
                        Milton
                     and the Gray books. Gray in fact states that Hines' "wartime exploits
                    would merit the pen of an E. Phillips Oppenheim"—as Horan himself notes.
            Horan is a newspaper man and novelist and he understands how to handle dramatic material and how to
                    write a lively story. Immediately, however, one is forced to feel that he lacks precise background
                    knowledge, wrote in haste, and did very inadequate checking.
            The book opens in the last of April, 1861, when the "Buckner Guides," captained by
                    Hines, rode south from 
                  Lexington, Kentucky
               , on the Newtown pike. About noon the
                    little cavalcade turned into a side road, splashed across a creek, and rode up a little hill. The
                    wind apparently being in a friendly quarter, the riders were greeted with "the savory odor
                    of frying bacon and pork roasting over a spit." From the eminence, the camp of General
                    Albert 
                        Sidney
                     Johnston "spread before them." Pleasing details of the camp are
                    given; then one reads: "'Please tell General Johnston Buckner's Guides
                    are reporting for duty,’ Hines told the orderly who greeted them."
            That is pure fiction. In April, 1861, Albert 
                        Sidney
                     Johnston was in 
                        California
                    . He reached 
                        Nashville
                     on September 14, and after spending some time at 
                  Columbus, Kentucky
               , where
                    the Confederates erected a great work in the hopes of closing the 
                        Mississippi
                    , he went to 
                        Bowling Green
                    , arriving on October 28. He never had a camp near 
                        Lexington
                    . (The biography of Johnston by his son is a standard work.)
            In the section devoted to sources for the different chapters, Horan writes: "The description
                    of Buckner's Guides,  who joined General Albert 
                        Sidney
                     Johnston's command in April, 1861, is taken from the long, unpublished story
                    of Hines' life by Doctor James Blanton, 
                        Cumberland
                     County, 
                        Virginia
                    , [written?] in 1864, hereafter known as the Blanton Mss. Much of the material was
                    contributed by Hines, General John Hunt Morgan and a Captain Cunningham. Blanton was probably trying
                    to sell the story to the Atlantic Monthly."
            
            It looks as if the doctor compounded a strange concoction. And what about the trustworthiness of
                    Hines, if he contributed extensively to Blanton's piece? On the copy of the Atlantic Monthly article for July, 1865, entitled "The 
                        Chicago
                     Conspiracy," that is in the Hines Papers—one page of which Horan
                    reproduces—there are marginal notes by Hines. Apparently he made no repudiating comments
                    on the Blanton Manuscript. It may be noted that on page 78 Horan states that Dr. Blanton was a local
                    historian of 
                  Lexington, Kentucky
               ; so one can stop blaming 
                        Virginia
                    .
            In treating Morgan's raid, Horan says, "
                        Indianapolis
                     was Morgan's for the taking but for some reason he turned east from 
                        Salem
                    ." A few sentences later he says, "With pursuit hot on their trail,
                    and no Copperhead underground army to aid them, the Confederate raiders were now averaging
                    twenty-one hours a day in the saddle." If Morgan was trying to get away, why speak as if
                    there were mystery in his eastward turn?
            Horan says, "Only eleven hundred raw recruits answered Governor Morton's call to
                    arms." That is not what Lew Wallace—summoned by Morton to take command of the
                    situation—whom Horan seems to use as a source, says in his Autobiography. The Hoosier general states that within twenty-four hours 65,000 men responded
                    to Morton's call "with arms," and cites the report of the Adjutant
                    General of Indiana. As to the 1100—that was the number of men that Wallace says he
                    entrained, with provisions, on the evening of July 10 [11?] at 
                        Indianapolis
                     for 
                        Vernon
                    . Wallace also points out that Morgan did not even attack General John Love and his
                    State Legion at 
                        Vernon
                    . He sent a surrender demand, but getting a sharp refusal, Morgan decided he had
                    business in 
                        Ohio
                    .
            Why must we eternally have the picture of the Indiana capital saved by a quirk of the invader? Why
                    could not Horan have elaborated on the truth, which he seems to have  seen? Of course it makes one quiver to think of the helpless Hoosier
                    city just waiting to be plucked—almost asking for it. But there is plenty of high drama
                    in General Hobson's splendid pursuit of Morgan with 2500 well seasoned, well armed, cavalry
                    in blue, as well as in Love and his Legion, and in the brand new 102nd, 103rd, and 104th Infantry
                    regiments, that did not stay to defend 
                        Indianapolis
                    , but went to meet Morgan, and finding him gone, joined in the pursuit.
            Horan gives a "Timetable" in the front of his book, as a device to help the reader.
                    But he failed to consult a timetable himself, and he is badly confused when on page 41 he links
                    Morgan's raid into Indiana and 
                        Ohio
                     with his absence from the battle of 
                        Murfreesboro
                    . That battle occurred six months before the raid across the 
                        Ohio
                     and while Morgan was on a short raid into 
                        Kentucky
                    . It was pursuant to General Bragg's orders, not contrary to them, that Morgan
                    was away "when Rosecrans rolled out" (of 
                        Nashville
                    ), as Horan picturesquely puts it.
            On page 79 Horan has Hines arrive in 
                        Toronto
                     on April 20, 1864, with orders from the Confederate Secretary of War to work with the
                    Mission to 
                        Canada
                    . He had gone by land, and on May 29 he met Commissioners 
                        Clay
                     (Clement C.) and Thompson (Jacob) in 
                        Montreal
                     (page 84). The commissioners had left 
                        Richmond
                     on May 3 and had run the blockade to Bermuda, where they took ship for 
                        Canada
                    . Thompson went to 
                        Toronto
                     with Hines and the latter spent considerable time rounding up escaped Confederate
                    prisoners. Forgetting when the conspirators reached 
                        Canada
                    , Horan says (page 88), "In the winter [italics mine] of
                    1864, when he returned to 
                        Toronto
                    , Hines was horrified to learn how easy it was to get gold out of Thompson."
            On page 83 we read: "On May 9, Morgan and his troopers had defeated the Union columns
                    marching on Saltville, in Western 
                        Virginia
                    …. That night in the bar at the Queen's in 
                        Toronto
                     men in ragged gray lifted their glasses to toast the gallant Morgan and roar out the
                    words of ‘The Raiders Ride Tonight’"
            The Confederates did use some submarines. But it is not in the record that they had radios, and it is
                    absurd to assume that there was a telegraphic report in 
                        Toronto
                     of a minor action near Wytheville, 
                        Virginia
                    , on the very day it took place.
            
            The Federals also did some rapid communicating. According to Horan, Colonel Jeffrey Sweet, commanding
                    the Confederate prisoner of war camp in 
                        Chicago
                    , learned the final details about the planned liberation of prisoners about midnight of
                    November 7-8, 1864 (page 190). The coup was to take place the next day, November 8, Hines being the
                    mastermind in the plans. Sweet wrote a dispatch to Brigadier General John Cook in 
                        Springfield
                    , outlining the plot and asking for re-enforcement, since he had only 800 troops to
                    guard 8000 to 9000 prisoners. He was afraid, however, to use the telegraph, and Horan says (page
                    191), "Sweet sent the message to 
                        Springfield
                     by a special courier on horseback." The courier must have made it, for we read
                    on page 199 (the time now being the 8th), "Additional troops arrived during the morning to
                    augment Colonel Sweet's men."
            Horan not only gives the wrong volume, but the wrong series of the Official Records
                    for Sweet's dispatch. It was not written near midnight on November 7, but at 8:30 P.M. on
                    November 6. Sweet explained that he was using a messenger, partly because he was afraid of the
                    telegraph, and partly because he could write more at length. Presumably the courier rode comfortably
                    behind an iron horse on the 
                        Chicago
                     and A#2 R.R. General Joseph Hooker, in Sandusky at the time, had to make the final
                    decision, and on November 7 he telegraphed Sweet, "I have directed General Cook to
                    re-enforce you with two companies from 
                        Springfield
                    , to join you as early as sundown tomorrow." Cook, on his part, telegraphed
                    that the governor had directed that the militia of 
                        Chicago
                     should be held subject to Sweet's orders, and he told Sweet to command them at
                    once. So everything had been well provided for before Horan's messenger started his
                    180-mile gallop.
            Horan's book will probably have more readers than those by 
                        Milton
                     and Gray, because he has made the story vivid. He states that in the writing, it was
                    "the novelist versus the historian," and that though he felt the
                    "creative urge" he restrained himself; "at every step the historian would
                    silently point to the facts." Such a statement should have obligated the author to more
                    than ordinary care. In view of errors such as have been pointed out—and more that were
                    passed over—the assurance that even the conversations with which the book abounds-are not
                    "Actionized," but are based on documents of some kind, is not impressive.
            
            Undoubtedly Horan was in possession of fresh material, and his book is made more interesting by
                    reproductions of some of it. It is a pity that the manuscript was not carefully edited and checked,
                    for Horan might have made a really valuable contribution. Inasmuch as the book was not adequately
                    checked, the most appealing character in it turns out to be Colonel Sweet's midnight rider.
                    He is a veritable Paul Revere, who shouts a warning even to a drowsy reader.

               Era of the Oath: Northern Loyalty Tests During the Civil War and Reconstruction.
                    By Harold Melvin Hyman. (

            Throughout the Civil War the 
                        United States
                     government wrestled with the problem of setting up tests which would prove the loyalty
                    of its citizens, and when the war was over and the Reconstruction period set in, the problem
                    remained as vital as ever. In the one period, loyalty and the knowledge of who was loyal were
                    necessary to win the war; in the other, they were equally necessary to win the peace.
            The authorities never got beyond the oath of allegiance in their quest for a test, but for
                    twenty-three years, from 1861 to 1884, which might be called the "Era of the Oath"
                    in American history, they devised one oath after another and fought over methods of applying it. By
                    the first few months of the war, the old oath of allegiance had come to be considered insufficient,
                    and although the executive departments had devised new oaths or had reapplied the old oaths,
                    Congress in August, 1861, passed a law setting up a uniform new oath. The next year Congress devised
                    an oath for jurors, but by far the most important of the oaths Congress adopted was the famous
                    "Ironclad Test Oath," passed on July 2, 1862. This was the oath which became so
                    important in Reconstruction times, for it not only related to present and future loyalty, but also
                    included past loyalty.
            It was this oath which became the most potent weapon in the hands of the Radicals in establishing
                    their control over the South. It was a great political weapon in the fight between the Radicals and
                    President Johnson. The President attempted  to build his
                    reconstruction program on present and future loyalty, but if this oath were applied, the base of his
                    government crumbled; for nearly all southerners had given aid and comfort to the Confederacy. The
                    Radicals by administering this oath sifted out of the South for the foundation of their governments
                    the unterrified southerners who had never bowed the knee to Davis.
            Practically everybody in the North and in the South at one time or another was required to take an
                    oath. If he were a federal official, a soldier or sailor, a member of Congress, a state official, a
                    postmaster, a steamboat captain, a country merchant, or whoever he might be, sooner or later he was
                    confronted with an oath to take.
            What was the purpose of all this oath-taking? Apart from the politics which was mixed up with it
                    during the Reconstruction, it was an attempt to establish a person's loyalty. Was the oath
                    a success in establishing loyalty? The author concluded that it was not. An investigation of the
                    facts of a person's life would have been a much more potent method, for many people were
                    willing to take an oath lightly with many mental reservations. Yet that person was accepted, whereas
                    the conscientious person who put the sanctity of an oath above all else, and refused to take it, was
                    rejected. It is an interesting fact that John F. Potter, a 
                        Wisconsin
                     Congressman, headed a committee to ferret out the disloyal, but its methods gained for
                    the committee a reputation reminiscent of a present-day committee headed by another 
                        Wisconsin
                     member of Congress.
            Harold M. Hyman, the author of this book, has made a remarkably complete and scholarly study of the
                    oath. He has presented his vast body of factual material in a logical and readable arrangement and
                    has throughout shown a mastery of his subject.

            The role of British politics in the imperial convulsion of 1763-1783 has been described by many
                    historians, but by  none as succinctly and accurately as by
                    Charles R. Ritcheson. Twenty-five years ago Sir Lewis Namier published his classic description of a
                    fractured political system, and if Ritcheson has not improved on that picture, he has, unlike
                    virtually all of his predecessors, utilized it in his narrative. As an analysis of the American
                    problem in British politics this modest volume is incomparably better than anything in print. It
                    incorporates the latest available research and makes use of manuscript sources not hitherto open to
                    workers in the Revolutionary vineyard.
            The broad outlines of the story are well known. George Grenville stirred the sleeping dragon of
                    discontent, and Rockingham won but a Pyrrhic victory in 1766. Chatham's ministry was
                    disastrous and North hardly the man to teach George III the beauties of a "federal
                    empire." Neither America nor the Opposition could unseat North's majorities,
                    however, and too late he extended the hand of conciliation. Within this framework Ritcheson
                    carefully elucidates the development of American policy by the shifting ministries of 1763-1778, and
                    describes the manner in which factional antagonisms weakened and ultimately defeated each succeeding
                    effort. For perhaps the first time in one volume Grenville, Pitt and Shelburne, Rockingham and
                    Burke, all receive equally fair treatment. Ritcheson demonstrates clearly that British statesmen
                    were very much aware of the problems of empire and that the best made every effort, according to
                    their views, to implement one solution or another. Their programs, which are the author's
                    chief concern, are judiciously described and North's conciliatory proposals carefully
                    evaluated. The terminal point of 1778 is selected on the ground that the dispatch of the 
                        Carlisle
                     Commission "represented the end of an historical process, which had begun with
                    the first impact of the American problem on British politics" in 1763. Ritcheson credits
                    the destruction of the old Empire to "the splintered condition of the Whig Party"
                    and the rise of "a new conservatism" that could not comprehend "the only
                    permanent solution of the tangled problem… the federal principle."
            As far as "American" politics (i.e. policy) was a predominating element in
                    factional intrigue (and to the extent that British imperial policy contributed to the emergence of
                    the American nation) Ritcheson's work may stand unchallenged.  The boundaries, unfortunately, are far from clear, and the complexities
                    of personal politics cannot be illuminated by a few swift strokes. Ritcheson's characters
                    move across the scene with great precision but without that clash of personality with which the
                    period was replete. Brevity in historical writing is often a blessing, but had the author availed
                    himself of greater pen-room he would have secured a better perspective. It is not sufficient to
                    point out that factions differed on American issues; there were factions long before 1763, and they
                    remained at odds long after 1778 for good English reasons. Ritcheson but mentions in passing those
                    matters which often threatened to obscure the American problem altogether. Still less does he
                    delineate the "new conservatism" which provided North with majorities after 1770.
                    This new conservatism ofttimes appears old King writ large. It was the King, not Lord North, who
                    rose above Saratoga's stricken field, and it was the reaction of 1780, not 1770, that
                    enabled George to weather Yorktown. As neither British imperial politics nor the American Revolution
                    ended in 1778, the subject may be considered open for further discussion.
            In brief, though "The American Problem in British Politics" might have been a more
                    accurate title, this book will stand forth with pride of place between Alvord's and
                    Harlow's massive volumes as a work of sound scholarship and lasting merit.

               The Harmony Society: A 19th Century American Utopia. By Christiana F. Knoedler. (
                        New York
                    : Vantage Press, 1954, pp. xi, 160. Illustrations and index. $3.00.)
            Christiana Knoedler, in this little book, has recreated the life of one of the most interesting of
                    the many socio-religious communities that were established on the frontier early in the nineteenth
                    century. The book is scarcely a history of the Rappites or a reminiscence of the way of life of the
                    Harmony Society in its declining years. It is rather a combination of brief historical or background
                    chapters and sketches of biographical or descriptive nature. The author, after all, is describing
                    her own beloved home and the experiences, in part, of her own family and its associates. When she
                    writes:  "Often as I sit at the organ, softly playing
                    the prelude for the service in fancy I see the meetings of years gone by," she indicates
                    the method by which the book was written. As some episode, individual, or landmark occurs to her, it
                    is lovingly described, given a chapter title, and fitted into her book.
            The Harmony Society, fortunately, has had rather more written about it than have many of the
                    communitarian settlements. Its longevity and economic success, its connection with Robert Owen, its
                    colorful leader, all combined to make it interesting, and the contemporary material for many
                    episodes in its history is ample. The Society has been fortunate, too, in having two fairly detailed
                    histories written nearly eighty years apart by men long intimately connected with the settlement:
                    Dr. Aaron Williams, whose book, The Harmony Society, was published in 1866, and
                    Dr. John Duss, one of the Society's last trustees whose account (published in 1943) covered
                    its whole span from its 
                        German
                     origin to its dissolution in 1905.
            This new book adds nothing to the evidence already available for the history of the Rappites. Its
                    value lies in its intimacy and in its detail. Other books on American communities have given this
                    society its place among the nineteenth century experiments or "Utopias." All that
                    can be discovered, probably, about George Rapp and the society he founded has been published. Their
                    place in the group of communities with religious or social objectives—or
                    both—is secure. In the period when the Harmony Society flourished, Utopianism and
                    perfectionism were marked phenomena of American life. This account adds a little more detail for the
                    social historian and furnishes, with its profuse illustrations, one more reminder of a past when
                    America was willing to permit a wide variety of social experimentation.

               Central High School, Its First Hundred Years, is as the title says, the history of
                    a specific high school that finished its first century in 1954. Known for sixty-four years, from  its founding in 1854, as the 
                        Evansville
                     High School, it acquired the name Central in 1918 when the city's growth
                    required another high school, and has retained the name Central now that 
                        Evansville
                     has four secondary schools.
            The 225-page book is more than a work of interest merely to Central graduates. It gives a clear
                    picture of life in 
                        Evansville
                     from 1850 to the present. It is a valuable history of secondary education in Indiana,
                    substantiated by statute and contemporary reference, and copiously illustrated with period pictures
                    and reprints. The author states in his preface: "My sources have been newspaper files from
                    1850; 
                  
                            Evansville City
                         Directories from 1858; the minutes of the Board of School Trustees from 1865;
                    the public school payroll books from 1875; the enrollment records, with principals' and
                    teachers' names, from 1859; previous histories of 
                        Evansville
                    ; and numerous unpublished letters and manuscripts referring to the early days of our
                    public school system. Recollections of early students and old citizens are useful as clues for
                    further study; but, unless I have so stated in the text, I have not accepted anything undocumented
                    by contemporary printed or written record…. I shall be grateful to have errors or
                    additional information called to my attention, preferably in writing so that the note can be filed.
                    All corrections and additions will be entered in an annotated copy kept in the school records
                    room."
            The thirty-five chapters deal with legal, economic, social, and political conditions aiding and
                    hindering the establishment and development of a public high school, and with specific discussion of
                    buildings, locations, faculty, students, boards of education, curriculum, five wars, athletics,
                    music, drama, parent-teacher relations, and alumni. An appendix of six sections gives lists of
                    principals, oldest living alumni, distinguished alumni, officers of PTA and Student Government,
                    current faculty, the Centennial Class of 1954, national affiliations, publications, benevolences,
                    honors and awards, and a chronological table of important events of the first hundred years.
            The research done for the book withdraws a previous belief that Central is the oldest high school in
                    Indiana, but substantiates its claim to two important firsts: (1) "Central of 
                        Evansville
                     is the first free public high school in Indiana to remain in continuous existence,
                    never having closed during its  hundred years of
                    existence." (Preface); (2) "The first known junior high school now an accepted
                    part of secondary education, was established in Central in 1912." (p. 51)
            Credit for (1) is given "to the courageous first Board of School Trustees" for
                    "the momentous decision" in 1854 to establish a high school, and especially to H.
                    Q. Wheeler, head of the board. "There is no doubt that it was the sincerity and zeal of H.
                    Q. Wheeler which swayed his colleagues to… the idea." (p. 25) It was Wheeler who
                    the previous year "was actually the father of the plan for free education for all"
                    when the first free public grade schools were opened in 
                        Evansville
                     in 1853. (p. 15)
            Credit for (2), the junior high school, goes to Ernest P. Wiles, principal of Central from 1910 to
                    1916. Wiles became interested in the junior high school theory while doing graduate work at 
                        Columbia
                     University before coming to 
                        Evansville
                    . Meyer says: "Attendance beyond the eighth grade was optional with the
                    students in those days, and each year hundreds of them rejected the chance to enter high school.
                    Principal Wiles knew that those boys and girls needed the high school. The problem was to get them
                    into the school before the ninth grade, thus interesting them in the activities of the high school
                    so that they would be eager to stay through the next four years. He succeeded in convincing the
                    Board of the merits of his plan and got them to agree to make the radical move. Thus
                        was born the junior high school movement, not only for 
                            Evansville
                         but for the entire 
                            United States
                        ." (p. 51)
            Letters from Wiles, who is now past eighty years old, received by Meyer during 1953, say: "
                        Evansville
                     can well boast… the first junior high school in
                    Indiana—America—and the world…. Of course it was only the
                    beginning, and since then the movement has spread over the land and has taken on maturity of form as
                    it should." (p. 53)
            Central has had and still has many great teachers, whose names and work Meyer records, too many to
                    list here. Myself a member of the Class of 1901, I recall after more than half a century mathematics
                    learned from Miss Sarah Vickery (Miss Sadie to us) and Mrs. Adelia Hornbrook; Latin from Mrs.
                    Augusta B. Corsett; English literature from Miss Daisy Flower (Mrs. Henry B. Veatch, Sr.) and Miss
                    Edith Reilly, who lent us classics to read during summer vacations; and 
                        German
                     literature from Karl Knortz, though it was not until  many years later in my own Indiana University teaching days that I knew Herr Knortz, as we always
                    called him, was then a recognized authority in both America and 
                        Germany
                     for his translating and editing of the works of Walt Whitman, which introduced the
                    great poet to European readers.
            Henry A. Meyer is particularly qualified to serve as the author of the history of Central High
                    School. He is a lifelong resident of 
                        Evansville
                    , having received his grade and high school training there, as did his mother and father
                    before him. He graduated from Central in 1912, and has taught in 
                        Evansville
                     from 1913, since 1926 at Central, where he now teaches mathematics and 
                        German
                    . He attended Indiana University, the National 
                        German
                    -American Teachers Seminary in 
                        Milwaukee
                    , and 
                        Evansville
                     College, where he received an A.B. degree and also did graduate work. For years he has
                    collected material on the history of 
                        Evansville
                     and southwestern Indiana. He is an expert in pictorial and technical photography, and
                    an authority on philately. He has done much research on the postal history of southwestern Indiana,
                    especially on mail carried by 
                        Ohio
                     River steamboats. He is the author of numerous articles for philatelic magazines and
                        The Waterways Journal, and of a series of articles in The S. P.
                        A. Journal on postmarks of letters carried on old-time steamboats. He is co-author and
                    group leader of the authors who prepared The 
                            Brazil
                         Centenary (1943), a history of the stamps and postal records of 
                        Brazil
                    , and is co-author and group leader of the authors of 
                  
                            Hawaii
                        —Its Stamps and Postal History (1948). He serves as consultant for
                    various authors working on philatelic research. He now has in process a history of mail carrying on
                    old-time river steamboats.
            Meyer gives generous credit in his book to many persons and organizations assisting him in research
                    and in supplying material, but he is the one who organized and directed all the research and did all
                    the writing, except for three chapters on vocal and instrumental music and drama, which were written
                    under his direction by three Central students of the Class of 1955. Much of his material was used
                    when 
                        Evansville
                     celebrated in 1947 its centennial as a chartered city. During the next half dozen years
                    he concentrated on collecting material on Central High School. The volume here reviewed is evidence
                    of his effective work.

               The Indiana Gazetteer or Topographical Dictionary. By John Scott. Reprinted from

                        Indianapolis
                    : Indiana Historical Society, 1954, pp. 129. $1.00.)
            In publishing this reprint of Indiana's first gazetteer, one of the earliest books produced
                    in the state, the Indiana Historical Society has made a significant contribution to the observance
                    of the 150th anniversary of the free press in the Hoosier state. It was in 1804 that Elihu Stout
                    brought the first printing press into Indiana Territory.
            The reprint contains an excellent introduction of twenty-three pages by Gayle Thornbrough, editor of
                    Indiana Historical Society publications. Not only does Miss Thornbrough give a detailed description
                    of the work of John Scott from the time he emigrated to 
                        Brookville
                    , Indiana, in 1816 to his death at 
                        Logansport
                     in 1838, but she also includes a critical analysis of the Gazetteer
                    itself. A reviewer could hardly improve on the evaluations given in this introduction.
            John Scott was one of Indiana's foremost printers, at least in the pioneer period. He grew
                    with the state which entered the Union in the same year that he arrived within its borders. He and
                    other early printers were largely responsible for raising the cultural level in the raw West,
                    although it is not known how many copies of the Gazetteer were sold for
                    twenty-five cents each or two dollars for a dozen.
            The original work has been reproduced as nearly as possible. Apparently the volume which was used in
                    this project is in good condition. Only in one or two instances did the editor encounter any
                    difficulty due to illegible print or worn paper where the type was lost or obscured. The reviewer
                    feels, however, that the original pagination should have been followed in the reprint. It would have
                    made easier reading, and the general appearance of the pages would have been improved. However, the
                    editor may have had some practical reason for this decision. Three photostats from the original
                    indicate the type and page form.
            The original Gazetteer contains a title page, a copyright page, and three pages of
                    preface by Scott. A general description of the geological, political, religious, cultural and
                    economic conditions of the state is given in the next twenty-one pages. The following 107 pages
                    contain descriptions of all the  towns, counties, lakes, rivers,
                    streams, etc., listed alphabetically from Abington to 
                        Winchester
                    . Two pages of Appendix give a list of several of the principal roads
                    and distances in Indiana. There are four pages of Addenda, "consisting of
                    several items of information received too late for a place under their proper heads." The
                    book concludes with nearly two pages of "Recommendations" from Governor James 
                        Brown
                     Ray and other state political leaders.
            As a companion piece the Indiana Historical Society has published a reprint of Scott's 1826
                    map of Indiana. This is a fascinating map, partly because of its inaccuracies, but it also has value
                    in showing the political subdivisions as they existed at the end of Indiana's first decade
                    of statehood. The Indiana Historical Society has rendered a real public service in publishing the
                    reprint and the accompanying map.

            In the last few years there have appeared several volumes of edited documents concerning the
                    pre-American period in the 
                        Ohio
                     Valley. Generally they are of such significance to the history of the area that new and
                    revised chapters will have to be written from them. Of such is the stuff contained in the George Mercer Papers.
            
            The story of the 
                        Ohio
                     Company of 
                        Virginia
                     is familiar to American historians. But many of the details of the story as here
                    presented have not been known, and some of the ideas and theories already in common currency will
                    now have to be changed.
            In the proceedings of the 
                        Ohio
                     Company, for example, there is a resolution of 1753 which contains enlightening detail
                    concerning "a [projected] Town to be called Saltsburg" (pp. 147-148). It was to be
                    the first English town on the 
                        Ohio
                     River, but it was never built. Lois Mulkearn's careful editing also serves
                    notice that Croghan chronology will now have to be revised (note 78, pp. 478-479). These are
                    illustrative  samples of the sort of information to be found in
                    the George Mercer Papers.
            
            George Mercer and his father, John, were intimately connected with the 
                        Ohio
                     Company as stockholders and officers. Father was its secretary for several years and
                    the son its 
                        London
                     representative, 1763-1770. It was the latter who, in 1771, merged the interests of the
                    company with those of the ill-starred Grand 
                        Ohio
                     (Walpole) Company, and personally became the largest stockholder in the merger. He
                    lobbied unsuccessfully in 
                        England
                     to get clear titles for the lands the company was originally granted in 1749. Original
                    documents, official copies of others, official correspondence to Mercer, and the records of his
                    dealings with the Walpole Company make up the corpus of the manuscripts printed in this volume.
                    There is also a facsimile reproduction of a unique George Mercer pamphlet concerning the 
                        Ohio
                     Company.
            The nature of the documents printed in the volume is such that they contain considerable information
                    on the economic and social history of the eighteenth century especially in 
                        Virginia
                    . This material, although of considerable value, has not been subjected to editorial
                    scrutiny in the notes because, Lois Mulkearn explains, it is not relevant to the story of the 
                        Ohio
                     Company.
            Despite the significance of this volume and the reception which its contents warrant, there are
                    certain characteristics of its editing and general make-up which are both awkward and confusing. The
                    order in which the contents of the volume are presented, for example, is rather unfortunate. Of its
                    four parts, the first and second are the documents and the third and fourth are notes and comments;
                    but part three is related to the second and part four to the first.
            Within the first section itself, the documents are not printed in the usual chronological order. This
                    situation occurs because a number of documents, in turn not in chronological order, are printed as
                    enclosures of letters. The section is prefaced by a "Chronology of
                    Communications," in reality an analytical chronology of the documents themselves. The
                    arrangement of the documents lessens the value of the analytical preface, whose value in turn is
                    lessened by errors it contains.
            The location of the notes apart from the points in the documents which they concern lends to further
                    confusion. This is too bad because they are meaty and obviously the work  of painstaking and prodigious scholarship. The notes are numbered but
                    the page to which each refers is not indicated. Further, one note often refers to more than one
                    place in the documents. This leads to a curious situation. For example, one is confused to find on
                    page 234 in the documents superior figures for notes 687, 7, 688, 9, and 11, in that order. Further
                    confusion is afforded in the index where it is usually necessary to give dual page references, one
                    to the document section and the other to the note section.
            Another aspect makes for awkwardness. The second part of the book is a facsimile reproduction. The
                    pages of the facsimile, of course, carry the numbers of the original document. Then there is a
                    multi-page appendix to the facsimile whose pagination is yet a separate one. The absence of
                    additional continuing pagination of the text, which is only assumed in this case, is resumed (with
                    an error) after the facsimile insertion. In the index then, for example, there are many entries of
                    this nature: "Potomac River (Va.): 69, 241, 249, fac. 2, 8, fac. app.
                        25." "Fac" and "fac. app."
                    mean "facsimile" and "facsimile appendix" respectively. If the
                    pagination of the volume were carried through the facsimile the index entry cited above would take a
                    much simpler form: "Potomac River (Va.): 69, 241, 249, 332, 338, 391."
            In the bibliography, there is a section called "Calendar of Communications." This
                    seventeen page calendar lists almost four hundred documents covering the period from 1682 to 1905.
                    Only about one-third of these, however, are labeled as "manuscript material
                    consulted." The remainder are supposedly of some pertinence. Relevance may be stretched to
                    mean "universal" but it is not always relevant to do so.
            From an editorial standpoint a number of ambiguities and practices detract from the utility of the
                    volume. It will suffice to mention some by way of illustration. There is no distinction made between
                    italicized statements which are editorial and those which are not. Also, without explanation, while
                    some passages are italicized others are underlined. Further confusion is produced from the frequent
                    use of brackets, parentheses, and "< >" marks. Again, some seem to
                    be editorial and others do not. Lined out portions from the original documents are reproduced, and
                    some of these contain brackets which are also lined out. Are they, in the ordinary usage of
                    brackets, editorial, or not?
            
            An index entry "Bloody Run (Pa.): junction of Indian paths, 474; see also
                    Everett." leads one to the unrewarding entry "Everett (Pa.). See
                    Bloody Run." Further comments might be made about bibliographical notes, consistency of
                    citations, and other of the mechanical aspects of the volume, but these will suffice to illustrate
                    the unfortunate things which will hinder rather than expedite use of this valuable collection of
                    documents.

               A Merchant Prince of the Nineteenth Century: William E. Dodge. By Richard
                    Lowitt. (

            Phelps Dodge & Co. has meant to the American public a vast western mining empire, but this
                    development did not take place until after the death of William E. Dodge. While he was a partner,
                    the main business of the company was the importation of tin plate, and the allied activities made
                    the organization sound like a country store, with dealings which ranged from other metals to tea and
                    rugs, and from cloth to beeswax. Particularly important was the export of cotton from the South, for
                    cotton provided return cargo for ships which had brought metal from 
                        England
                    . The operations ranged as far afield as 
                        China
                     and the East Indies, while in America selling agents covered the entire nation, and
                    also did business in 
                        Canada
                     and 
                        Mexico
                    .
            The interests of Dodge and of the company moved rapidly into various more or less related fields,
                    with investments in iron and copper mines; in brass, copper, iron, and glass manufacturing; in
                    timber land and other real estate; in railroads, insurance, telegraph, and cable enterprises. Dodge
                    himself seldom did any direct management, but now and then he intervened to be sure that the
                    directors followed his general ideas. Most of Dodge's investments turned out well, but
                    there were the inevitable failures, particularly with the various fluctuations of general
                    prosperity. Dodge's success can be credited mainly to his own efforts, even though he by no
                    means started as a penniless immigrant, and even though he followed an old recipe for success by
                    marrying the boss's  daughter. His estate at the time
                    of his death was estimated at between five and ten million dollars.
            Dodge was an able businessman, direct, orderly, and clear thinking. Apparently he had high integrity,
                    for while he was several times accused of bad practices, there apparently was little justification
                    for the charges. In fact his moral principles sometimes hurt his profits, as when he sold railroad
                    stock because he did not approve of trains running on Sunday; in one such case, however, the moral
                    principles were financially profitable when he sold such stock between $110 and
                    $120, with shortly thereafter the railroad going bankrupt and stock falling to ten cents
                    a share. Basically, he was convinced that there were "other and more important
                    things" (p. 189) in life than the making of money. A profoundly religious man, he not only
                    joined and contributed to various religious and philanthropic enterprises, but also devoted great
                    personal efforts to their promotion. Among his interests were the Sunday School Union, the American
                    Bible Society, the American Tract Society, and the YMCA. For over twenty years he was vice-president
                    of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. He helped several theological
                    seminaries, participating in the founding of Union Theological Seminary, and then sitting on its
                    board of directors. Temperance enlisted his greatest reforming zeal, and temperance was transformed
                    into prohibition by the end of the Civil War. He opposed slavery, but his position was moderate,
                    with at times exasperation for what he felt to be the extremist positions of many abolitionists; for
                    twenty years he was vice-president of the American Colonization Society. Other benefactions covered
                    a wide range, including such varied projects as the American Geographical Society, the 
                        New York
                     Historical Society, the Metropolitan Museum, the Museum of Natural History, and the
                    Mercantile Library. He was always greatly interested in education, and in his many benevolences gave
                    particular attention to Negro education.
            Politically, Dodge remained an inactive Whig until long after that party was practically moribund.
                    His political interests were greatly roused by the difficulties of 1860, and while at first he
                    favored the Union Party as representing a calm middle position, he soon swung to the Republicans,
                    with the presumption that they had promised not to interfere with slavery in the states. When war
                    loomed menacingly, he did  everything possible to encourage a
                    compromise of sectional differences—and certainly he was not uninfluenced by his business
                    interests, of which many were in the South. When war came he supported the Northern point of view,
                    and was particularly active in the Christian Commission, which was a rival of the Sanitary
                    Commission. His support of 
                        Lincoln
                     in 1864 was lukewarm because he wanted greater efforts to end the war.
            Political interests led Dodge in 1864 to become a last-minute candidate for Congress. His Democratic
                    opponent was declared elected, but because of the closeness of the vote and the obvious frauds, the
                    election was appealed to Congress, which finally decided in 1866 that it preferred a Republican to a
                    Democrat. In Congress, Dodge represented the businessman's viewpoint, favoring sound money,
                    aid to the railroads, and a high tariff; this last preference was at least startling, since Dodge
                    was primarily interested in international trade. Concerning Reconstruction he was on the side of
                    moderation, favoring a quick reconciliation between North and South. He refused a second nomination
                    in 1866, but as an indirect result of his short political career, plus his well-known philanthropic
                    impulses, he was appointed by President Grant in 1869 to the Board of Indian Commissioners.
            The present biography of Dodge is based largely on the Dodge papers and other comparable collections
                    of documents. It is meticulously detailed, with often little distinction between the important and
                    the trivial, and the organization is sometimes a trifle confusing. The style is adequate. Seldom
                    does the author make any important effort to sketch the backgrounds and larger implications of the
                    topics about which he talks, and in the places where he makes some such attempts, as with the work
                    of the Board of Indian Commissioners, he frequently leaves much to be desired. Generalizations are
                    few, but they would seem to indicate that while Lowitt is sympathetic to Dodge as an individual, he
                    has an inherent distrust of businessmen—at least of the past century. For example, he
                    makes sweeping criticisms of businessmen in their attitudes toward labor (p. 287) and toward the
                    general public (p. 310), both without supporting evidence. Putting the matter a little more broadly,
                    Lowitt seems to this reviewer not to have a very good grasp of the complexities and contradictions
                    of human nature. All of which should not obscure  the real
                    services of Lowitt. He has worked diligently on important material, and has made available the
                    details of a significant life. This type of information has been appearing with increasing frequency
                    during recent years, to the pleasure of every student interested in economic trends. Before long it
                    should be adequate to give the basis for a much more valid characterization of the nineteenth
                    century American businessman than any which has appeared to date.

                    appendix, bibliography, and index. $6.50.)
            This volume, the most significant publication connected with 
                        Ohio
                    's sesquicentennial celebration, is basically a reprinting of the earlier
                    one-volume history written by the same authors in 1934. The original printing was exhausted some
                    years ago and it is good to know that so valuable a book is once again available. The six volume
                    history of the state, to which these authors contributed, had not appeared when the original work
                    was published and in the past twenty years many important monographs on 
                        Ohio
                     history have been written. The text remains essentially the same, for it was written
                    with care in the first place. Revisions are to be found in the chapter which deals with early 
                        Ohio
                     Indians, significant additions have been made to the chapters on social and cultural
                    history, and a final chapter summarizes the events of the past twenty years. Excellent
                    bibliographical essays are included in an appendix.
            The first sentence of the text reads: "
                        Ohio
                     is a political, not a geographical, unit." Roughly three-fourths of the volume
                    deals with political happenings and these are woven into a clear narrative: a masterpiece of
                    condensation. With the year 1850 this narrative is interrupted by a two-chapter description of
                    social and cultural life and a similar survey entitled "Cultural Progress since
                    1850," is placed towards the end of the book. Chapter XIV deals with "Economic
                    Progress, 1850-1880" and the final chapter contains a survey of the economic woes of the
                    1930's. It is this final chapter  which caused a mild
                    critical reaction at the time the book appeared, yet the facts presented could be easily
                    substantiated, in the opinion of this writer, and there are remarkably few indications of bias on
                    the part of the authors other than a sympathy for the victims of the Great Depression.
            It is clear, even to the cursory reader, that the authors succeeded admirably in doing what they set
                    out to do. And each reader will think of phases of 
                        Ohio
                    's history that have been omitted. The reviewer, because of his own interests,
                    wishes that space might have been found for a chapter on economic problems of the early decades
                    comparable to that for the period 1850-1880. It seems regrettable that no description of the trade
                    with 
                        New Orleans
                     is to be found. One may be certain that the authors felt these omissions even more
                    keenly than does the reader.
            It is a pleasure to praise the format of this book in highest terms. James H. Rodabaugh of the 
                        Ohio
                     State Museum served as editor and had supervision of the choice of illustrative
                    materials. The meticulous care given to proofreading and to press work are abundantly evident. The
                    text, as it appeared in 1934, was small octavo and had no illustrations other than maps. The present
                    volume is in the popular quarto size with heavy coated paper admirably suited for the reproduction
                    of half-tones, of which there are approximately three hundred.
            The illustrations are a supplement to the text and little effort is made to tie the two together
                    otherwise than by chronology. For this reason it is to be regretted that a few lines of comment or
                    description were not placed below each cut. To one who is familiar with books about 
                        Ohio
                     it is refreshing to see pictures which have not before appeared in print. One is
                    especially impressed with the excellence of the drawings which Thomas K. Wharton made of the 
                        Ohio
                     country in the 1830's. Few readers will find fault with the choice of pictures
                    and no one can criticize their reproduction. This writer can see no merit in the depiction of Simon
                    Girty (p. 38) and wishes that the cheaply humorous portrayal of the burning of Crawford (p. 42) had
                    not been included, especially since there is reason to question the antiquity of the "old
                    print." He questions the date, "about 1840," of the river scene at 
                        Marietta
                     painted by Charles Sullivan (p. 92). Full-rigged sea-going vessels, such as are shown
                    here, were  probably not built at 
                        Marietta
                     after 1820. A short paragraph, based on Hulbert's article in the American Historical Review (XXI, 720), would have been most useful here.
            One might continue this game of minor criticism (why-Governor Ethan Allen 
                        Brown
                     is not pictured and why hex signs on 
                        Pennsylvania
                     barns are), but this writer is in the mood of praising the work of authors, editorial
                    staff, and craftsmen, for producing a thoroughly satisfying book.

            For some time, 
                        Michigan
                     has needed a general history for both student and non-student. There have been
                    available an ably written college text and several elementary chronologies or histories. The
                    testamentary bequest of John M. Munson, who was long active in 
                        Michigan
                     education, provided that a history of the state be published as well as a history of
                    education in 
                        Michigan
                    . This fund was placed under the trusteeship of the 
                        Michigan
                     Historical Commission which selected F. Clever Bald as the author for such a project.
            The writing of a general history is a difficult task. Because of its very nature it tends to satisfy
                    fully very few. The professional historian has his special fields of interest and they are seldom if
                    ever covered to the extent or detail of his desire. Even the general reader has local interests and
                    topical prejudices which he often thinks the author should have expanded more completely. Bearing
                    all of these items in mind, 
                  
                            Michigan
                         in Four Centuries is a very good general history of the state of 
                        Michigan
                    .
            One factor which is designed to intrigue and invite the general reader is the liberal use of
                    illustrative materials. Not only are there a substantial number of photographs, but there are also
                    interspersed among the pages a very interesting group of pen drawings by William Thomas Woodward on
                    subjects for which there are no photographs available. Thus is filled a gap, often found in many
                    general histories, which is usually very annoying to the non-professional reader.
            
            The photographs themselves are largely a new selection and must not have been used previously in
                    publications. This gives the book a fresh appeal; it is evident that the selection was based on the
                    text of the book, rather than determined by pictorial material readily available.
            There are ten maps included, all of which were executed for this book and, therefore, are integrated
                    with its text rather than being photostats or modifications of existing maps produced for another
                    purpose. This, again, gives clarity to the text and provides a basis of understanding for the
                    reader.
            Bald is to be commended for the intellectual and moral courage needed to write on the more recent
                    past, where the opinions of many readers are rather pronounced and prejudices tend to run strong.
                    Nearly one half of the book deals with the period from the Civil War's beginning to
                    contemporary times. The most common fault of many general histories is that the early period is
                    treated extensively while the area of controversy of more recent years is carefully avoided. Bald
                    has dealt extensively with the more recent past, both with facts and with judgment in selecting
                    fields to be covered. The greatest growth of 
                        Michigan
                     has taken place during this past century, both in population, material and economic
                    development, and institutional and cultural flowering. It is encouraging to read a book for the
                    general reader that is balanced in time and balanced in perspective of the relative importance of
                    the subjects covered. The first chapter, with the intriguing title, "When Elephants Walked
                    in 
                        Michigan
                    ," gives an introduction to the geology and physical history of the state. The
                    twenty-nine additional chapters range from Indians to "Armorer to the United
                    Nations." The economic and social history are given significant emphasis, and in an
                    interesting rather than a dutiful manner. Politics and politicians are not eliminated by any means,
                    and their struggles, achievements, and failures are continued up to the very last chapter.
            The including of the chronology is a very real benefit to either the student or the casual reader.
                    Yet, of course, it is a pitfall for the author. Almost every reader will know of things from his
                    experience, his locality, or his travels that he feels should not have been omitted. For instance,
                    the "Griffin," the upper Lakes' first sailing ship, and its voyage of
                    1679 is of  significance to many. Similarly, the coming of the
                    telegraph to the state, the events of the Civil War, and the coming of the first railroad car ferry
                    in 1869, are matters of interest and curiosity, I am sure, to certain readers. Yet, the chronology
                    is good and is probably already longer than the author would wish.
            The bibliography is entitled, "A Selected List of Books on 
                        Michigan
                     History." It makes no attempt to be an exhaustive bibliography, or to describe
                    the character and scope of the several titles. It is a reading list of general interest on the
                    subject, of titles which might be expected to be found in many local libraries. It is, therefore,
                    tailored for its anticipated reader—to be an asset rather than a source of frustration.
                    The index of fourteen pages should prove very adequate for the students and general public for whom
                    the book was intended.
            I feel that this book will fulfill the hopes of Munson, who made it possible, and the expectations of
                    the Historical Commission of 
                        Michigan

                         to 1948. By Philip D. Jordan. (

            Through the interest and generosity of the Mayo Association, Philip D. Jordan was provided with the
                    opportunity to write The People's Health, a history of 
                        Minnesota
                    's public health program. The writer, an established author and historian,
                    expresses his own basic ideas on the subject by quoting from a recent national report which
                    declares: "Health is not the mere absence of disease but a positive state of body and mind,
                    conducive to full and productive life"; and from Henry I. Bowditch who said that public
                    health is "the most important matter with which any community could concern
                    itself."
            
               The People's Health tells about the, unfolding of a great public
                    enterprise in 
                        Minnesota
                    . It gives an account of the continuous expansion of the effectiveness and range of
                    sanitary science and preventive medicine. The reader is 
                    encouraged and inspired by this public health narrative which once more tells how sanitarians have
                    accomplished so much with so little. Though a wide gulf separates the people's
                    understanding from that of their better informed public health leaders, the public plods along,
                    always increasing its pace to provide public health with more active cooperation and better
                    financial support.
            The first two chapters, on the salubrity of the 
                        Minnesota
                     climate and the Civil War career of 
                        Minnesota
                    's first secretary of the State Health Board, provide a slow start for the
                    monograph. Quickly recovering from these asides, the author writes an unusually fine history. His
                    plan is topical, but he writes at length about the public health activities of three secretaries to
                    the State Health Board: Charles N. Hewitt (1872-1897), Henry M. Bracken (1897-1919), and Albert J.
                    Chesley (1921-). Each of these able men has provided leadership on the national level as well as on
                    the state.
            Although the author immediately calls attention to the omission of a full discussion of finances,
                    organization, and administration, a chapter on each would greatly help the reader and strengthen the
                    book. Judging from material given, the 
                        Minnesota
                     public health system, administratively, is a state-level organization with little in
                    the way of a local base. Public health officials throughout the state are usually state appointees,
                    and the influence of two large cities has kept the program primarily urban rather than rural. When
                    the legislature rejected the State Board of Health's proposal to establish the county
                    health unit, a plan of eight districts was tried. As is the case in several other states, the
                    district did not prove to be local enough and failed to meet high expectations. Internally, a
                    standard public health organization evolved and, after several reorganizations, on January 1, 1947,
                    there were five sections, as follows: (1) Departmental Administration; (2) Medical Laboratories; (3)
                    Environmental Sanitation; (4) Preventable Diseases; (5) Special Services.
            Quite accurately, the rise and growth of public health nursing are appraised as the foremost of all
                    hopeful developments in public health. 
                        Minnesota
                    's great public health leaders and their achievements are warmly commended, but
                    the writer finds more to condemn than to condone in some phases of his state's public
                    health record. He finds fault with his fellow citizens for tolerating polluted water supplies and
                         impure food products and for defeats that public health
                    programs have met in the state legislature.
            In The People's Health the reader is given a uniquely comprehensive view
                    of what is taking place in the field of public health generally and what is on the threshold. People
                    are becoming aroused, and part of their concern, identified as a facet of their search for security,
                    is a fear of private medical practice on the one hand or a fear of government intervention on the
                    other. Between these polar positions, according to a statement quoted from a recent federal study on
                    health, "group hospital programs offer the only satisfactory solution." The author
                    sees the federal government as one of the main opportunities to increase the number of physicians,
                    dentists, nurses, health institutions, and hospital beds; and to make these health essentials
                    available to all who need them. Certainly the rapid appearance of hundreds of hospitals and
                    thousands of hospital beds in the last few years seems to justify his viewpoint. The writer takes
                    special note of a recent report made by eight hundred distinguished national leaders which stated
                    "that only a combination of the efforts of local, state, and federal units could possibly
                    result in a major improvement in public health."
            The monograph is a desirable departure from the technical pattern of public health history which
                    prevailed until the First World War. The People's Health is wide in scope
                    and high in reader interest. Its influence will doubtless be very significant as it is a much-needed
                    instrument in behalf of a valuable social program which is dependent upon public appreciation.

            Historians have made a practice to don the hairshirt periodically to force themselves to re-examine
                    the nature of their craft, or is it their art? In 1946, under the auspices of  the Social Science Research Council, Bulletin 54 appeared: Theory and Practice in Historical Study. It stimulated much discussion and spurred further
                    self-examination. The present cooperative project has for its purpose the "exploration of
                    how historians and other social scientists can better attain profitable intellectual cooperation
                    through more effective knowledge and use of ideas and methods dominant in the various social
                    sciences." From such exploration the authors of the bulletin are hopeful that the
                    boundaries of historical thought will be extended, its purposes clarified, its perspectives
                    sharpened.
            Historians are urged to make more use of the concepts of other social sciences to reorient their own
                    interests and to re-examine their procedures. "Training in thought about history,"
                    say the authors, is "as important as training in any particular type of analysis."
                    But the historian is enjoined to make himself more proficient by levying upon specialized studies of
                    economists, sociologists, statisticians, psychologists, anthropologists, etc. The more the historian
                    concerns himself with interpretation the more needful will be his understanding of the social
                    sciences. Here this bulletin is reaffirming an injunction made familiar to historians these many
                    years through well justified repetition.
            The Bulletin reminds historians that "the central problem of history is the analysis of
                    change," its rate, volume, and direction. And it is their writings which "furnish
                    the materials to guide or at least to justify policies, opinions, and predictions."
                    Historians perform this latter function because they are committed to the belief that
                    "history is not exclusively chaos or chance: a degree of observable order and pattern, of
                    partially predictable regularity, exists in human behavior."
            There will probably be substantial agreement with most of what is presented in this provocative
                    volume. There may be bewilderment, as the authors themselves concede, over the meaning of many of
                    the terms and concepts they have referred to, but the historian is comforted by the observation that
                    in this respect "he is in no worse situation than other social scientists." It
                    seems to this reviewer that insufficient consideration has been given to this problem: how is a
                    historian to gain enough mastery of other fields to be able to distinguish between the sound and the
                    unsound? A little  knowledge is a dangerous thing, for
                    historians as for others.
            There is an inclination (at least on the part of one contributor) to be too cavalier in dismissing
                    "mere narrative history." He granted its value as
                    "entertainment" but doubted its contribution "toward building a body of
                    scientific knowledge about human behavior." Though Parkman and Henry Adams (to take two of
                    the best of the "narrative" historians) were without benefit of advantages enjoyed
                    by later social scientists, can we truly say our volumes display greater knowledge about human
                    behavior than theirs? Desirable as it is to increase our scientific knowledge about human behavior
                    let us not depreciate the artist to whose vision is often revealed human secrets locked against the
                    tools of the social scientist.
            Many years ago Carl Becker, himself a strong supporter of "the new history,"
                    suggested to a colleague in a tone of mild irritation it was time to produce some of it instead of
                    proposing to one another how it should be written. Possibly the same thought occurred to
                    participants in this enterprise. Indeed some of them have attempted to practice what is preached.
                    Bulletins such as this will surely prompt historians to study their respective fields with greater
                    penetration. More and more the tendency will be to study problems rather than periods. But
                    eventually the effort must be made to synthesize separate studies into a comprehensive narrative.
                    When that work is produced, will our familiar landmarks—the American Revolution, the
                    French Revolution, etc. etc.—look very different than they do now? It will be worth
                    waiting for.

            Largely uninscribed in history books is the variety of beliefs and experiences which make up the
                    lives of ordinary people. Out of the innumerable lives and events of this unrecounted history, a
                    single life or a particular event may be illuminated, partially and arbitrarily, by the inscription
                    on a grave.
            
            In this collection of epitaphs Charles Wallis has brought together with a pleasant and informative
                    commentary some 750 inscriptions from American cemeteries. Although epitaphs in general employ
                    traditional forms and sentiments, they are more often than not altered to personal circumstance:
                    Individual attainments, weaknesses, desires and attachments, as well as the whole range of emotional
                    reaction enter into their idiom. Often the comments are blunt and free of the conventions of tact
                    and etiquette within which daily life is hemmed; they express, without restraint, personal hatreds,
                    accusations of crime, extreme egoism, cynicism and even indifference. At the same time, love, faith,
                    grief and individual heroism are amply recorded; the style may be pompous or it may have the awkward
                    simplicity that is so effective and moving in much folk art.
            Religious sentiments range from bright cynicisms such as "Haine Haint" to quiet
                    assurance such as that expressed on a grave in a Friends' cemetery: "I See
                    Daybreak." In between is the whimsical questioner: "Went Away/Mar.22,1921/I
                    Wonder/Where He/Went." Aside from religious sentiment, good deeds or qualities of character
                    may be chosen to record. Sometimes all the memorable aspects of an individual may be listed
                    indiscriminately: "A truthful child, mild tempered, quiet disposition, nearsighted, strong
                    mind." Crimes may also be selected; the dead do not forgive the ill deeds of the living,
                    nor the living the ill deeds of the dead. A 
                        New Hampshire
                     grave recalls: "Henry N…. Murderer of/Sevilla Jones,"
                    while the grave of Warren Gibbs in 
                        Massachusetts
                     accuses his wife of poisoning the oysters. Those who died unnatural deaths are usually
                    immortalized by them. One cannot fail to be impressed by the marvelous death of one lady of the
                    "Old West": "Margarita/Stabbed by a Gold Dollar." But the
                    ridiculous and the recriminitive are matched by epitaphs of simple pathos and dignity, as these
                    lines on the grave of a young mother: "You must talk to the children/as I should have done
                    had I/lived."
            As in much folksong, there is no avoidance of the morbid. Indeed, the treatment of morbidity may be
                    extremely effective. An epitaph on a child's grave in 
                        Massachusetts
                     expresses almost a despairing compulsion to view the horror of death: "Oh
                    would that I could lift the lid and peer/within the grave and watch the greedy worms/that eat away
                         the dead." Rime may give an unintentional
                    "Charles Addams" kind of humor to a horrible death: "How shocking to the
                    human mind/The log did him to powder grind." Characteristic of these epitaphs is the
                    faculty evident in folk art generally, which combines almost in the same breath and without comment,
                    the sublime with the ridiculous, the individual with the ‘made to order,’ the
                    fantastic with the ordinary.
            The author's commentary which threads these inscriptions together, although at times
                    stilted, adequately fills in the factual background. The book is organized rather loosely by subject
                    matter and the type of sentiment involved; a geographical index at the end of the book is convenient
                    for locating all epitaphs cited from one area. The work makes no pretenses of being other than a
                    pleasant afternoon of reading; it is not directed towards the professional folklorist, although it
                    may well be suggestive to him.

            As a means of making the government records in its care more easily accessible to libraries, research
                    centers, and scholars the National Archives in 1940 instituted a program of microfilming selected
                    groups of its holdings. By June 30, 1953, 4666 rolls of master negative microfilm containing
                    reproductions of more than 3,000,000 pages of records had been completed. These master negatives are
                    kept in the National Archives, but positive prints from them, known as microfilm publications, may
                    be purchased at moderate cost. Whole series of basic documents in American, European, Far Eastern,
                    and Latin American history can thus be obtained at relatively small expense for use outside of 
                        Washington
                    . To provide a guide to the records available in this form a List of
                        National Archives Microfilm Publications was issued in 1953.
            
            As a part of its program of analyzing and describing the permanently valuable records in its care the
                    National Archives continues to issue Preliminary Inventories and Special Lists. The more recent
                    numbers of these series are listed above. The Preliminary Inventories are of a provisional nature
                    and are issued as soon as possible after the records are received before screening out of disposable
                    material has been finished or the arrangement of the records has been completed. They are primarily
                    for the use of the National Archives Staff in servicing and controlling its materials, but each will
                    be valuable to the scholar interested in the particular records which it covers. The Special Lists
                    are more detailed than the Preliminary Inventories and furnish fuller descriptions of the important
                    record groups included in the series.

            This book is a compilation of brief definitions of terms pertaining to tobacco. According to its
                    introduction, it "seeks to bring to the smoker the interesting, curious and necessary facts

            Indiana's contributions to 
                        Iowa
                     have been numerous and frequently of high quality. Professor William 0. Lynch many
                    years ago wrote of "The Flow of Colonists to and from Indiana before the Civil
                        War."1 He found that the census of 1850, taken just four years
                    after 
                        Iowa
                    's admission into the Union, gave 19,925 as the number of Hoosier colonists who
                    had settled there; the census of 1860 gave for the same category 57,555, an astounding increase of
                    some 37,000. Only the state of 
                        Illinois
                     had drawn more Hoosiers than 
                        Iowa
                     and only the state of 
                        Ohio
                     exceeded Indiana as the contributor to the growth of 
                        Iowa
                     in this decade.2
            
            If this mass of 37,000 could be redeemed from anonymity there would be found in it the sternly
                    positive personality of a certain Coker Fifield Clarkson, late of 
                  Brookville, Franklin
                County,
                    Indiana. Beside him would be found Elizabeth Colescott Clarkson, his second wife and devoted mother
                    to his children by his first wife, Elizabeth Goudie Clarkson, namely: Pamela, Frances, Richard
                    Perkinhon, and James Sullivan. All but the last-named came to Melrose Township, Grundy County, 
                        Iowa
                    , in 1855; he, the youngest, for some reason remained a time in Indiana and then made
                    the trip alone in February, 1856, to join his family. The father had made some name for himself in
                    Indiana as an editor and Whig leader; he and his sons were to become notable figures in 
                        Iowa
                     history as journalists, Republicans, and leaders in the economic, cultural, and moral
                    life of the state. James Sullivan Clarkson graduated into the ranks of national leaders of his party
                    and ultimately became an elder statesman and an adviser of presidents. This article is chiefly
                    concerned with these three men.

            Coker Fifield Clarkson3 (1811-1890), the Hoosier who became a Hawkeye as if to
                    the prairie born, had a career of several phases which contributes much to the theory that in the
                    development of American culture "the wind blew from the East." He was born a
                    down-easter in the Penobscot country4 and might well have grown up to be a
                    seafaring man from 
                        Maine
                     or a journalist devoted to the promotion of the political fortunes of James G. Blaine,
                    who actually in later days was one of the household gods in the Clarkson family and who corresponded
                    with and visited in the home of his son James. On the testimony of this son James we have it that
                    Coker F. Clarkson "loved his birthplace and kept on his tongue always the brogue of the
                    broad a's, o's and r's of the Yankee, and every day of his long life in
                    heart and prayer were loving thoughts of 
                        Maine
                    ."5
            
            The first phase of his career is that set of forces which we delight to call Heredity and in this
                    case might well be conjured up as The Best of English Middle Class History. Son James was so
                    impressed with this hereditary factor that in 1891 he made a trip to

                    rolls, cemeteries, and all other possible sources. If we cannot accept unreservedly the ecstatic
                    conclusions reached by this ancestor-worshipper who traced the family not only back to the 
                        Norman
                     Conquest but to an even earlier day, we may allow as justifiable his finding that
                    "the one notable thing in the whole career of the name has been a love of writing and
                    letters. Its very name originated itself or was evolved out of

                            about his birthplace may well be understood in view of the fact that his parents distributed
                            the birth of seven children among six different places in New 
                                England

                     Saxon terms…. In the early day a secretary or clerk
                    was called a dark, and a clark's son easily became Clarkson, which is
                    undoubtedly the origin of the name."6
            
            James S. Clarkson, the genealogist of his family, was always eager to claim the name of the famous
                    British abolitionist, Thomas Clarkson (1760-1840), as a forebear, and to rhapsodize over Playford
                    Hall, Thomas' home, as if it were an ancestral seat of the family. This is claiming too
                    much. We may admit him as a collateral member of the line but no more. Thomas Clarkson was the son
                    of a Reverend John Clarkson who kept a free grammar school at Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, 
                        England
                    .7 According to the tradition handed down to Coker Fifield and from
                    him to others, the American branch of the family traces back to a seventeenth century Clarkson who
                    left Wisbech for 
                        Cornwall
                    ; two generations later a son, Richard, came to America as a volunteer member of the
                    forces of Sir Henry 
                        Clinton
                    . He was wounded in the third and victorious charge made against our men at Bunker Hill;
                    after a period of invalidism he was returned to Britain where shortly he fell in love with a Miss
                    Olivia Perkinhon. Now a bit of old-fashioned romance enters into the story. Olivia was the daughter
                    of a family of some wealth and station who disapproved of her match with the patriotic but probably
                    impecunious soldier. The couple lived up to all the reader's expectations: they eloped and
                    married and came to America. Their first permanent home was in 
                        New Hampshire
                     and here their first child was born, a son named Richard Perkinhon in spite of the
                    refusal of the Perkinhons to forgive their headstrong daughter. Four daughters were also born to
                    this union but they do not enter into this story.
            There were other Clarksons who came to America but this Richard Perkinhon, born October 2, 1782, at
                    Stratham near Exeter, 
                        New Hampshire
                    , was the first of this particular line of American-born Clarksons. He grew up as a farm
                    worker and a tailor. It could not be said of him that he did not try to find a place for himself in
                    the New 
                        England
                     environment.

                            Clarkson is accepted as a native of this town and that a statue and appropriate plaque mark
                            his birthplace. N. C. Dewick to author, November 25, 1952. Playford Hall is near Ipswich, in
                            Suffolk.
               
                     He worked for some time as a laborer in his home county and
                    then pursued his tailor's trade at 
                        Portsmouth
                    , at Brentwood, and at 
                        Haverhill
                    , all in 
                        New Hampshire
                    ; then he tried out 
                        Frankfort
                    , and next, Dixmont, 
                        Maine
                    . In 1803 he married Mary Simpson of Brentwood, the daughter of William and Mary
                    Defenthon Simpson, both of Irish stock and of the finest character, according to the memory of Coker
                    F. Clark-son, who knew them during his boyhood. To this union there were born seven children,
                    including Coker in 1811, before the parents decided to seek another and more hospitable climate. The
                    unrelenting 
                        Maine
                     winter, which lasted for twenty-four consecutive months in 1817 and 1818, forced the
                    decision. In 1819, the father came West alone and for reasons not known to us, settled upon 
                        Franklin
                     County, Indiana, as his future home. He put in a crop in 1820 and then sent for his
                    family. The brave mother and her brood of seven came as far as 
                  Wheeling, Virginia
               , with
                    the nine-year-old Coker driving the team every mile of the way. At 
                        Wheeling
                    , they were met by the father; the entire trip from 
                        Maine
                     to Indiana consumed sixty-six days.8
            
            Now begins another phase of Richard P. Clarkson's career: life on the Indiana frontier. His
                    family seems to have had a normal existence. For some years he rented land, first one place and then
                    another, until 1828 when he bought a farm near 
                        Mt. Carmel
                    . He was a tremendous man—he weighed 220 pounds— and was known far
                    and wide for his feats of weight-lifting. He was said to have been able to lift a weight of 1400
                    pounds without the aid of straps or any other artificial devices. His eldest daughter, Pamela,
                    married a prosperous young farmer, Joseph Goudie,9 a son of James Goudie, a
                    prominent politician who was for several terms speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives.
            As for young Coker, he seemed to have inherited some of his father's strength as well as an
                    interest in letters and politics. In addition to the usual farm work at home and for the neighbors
                    he worked in the slack seasons as a laborer on the Miami Canal and whatever he could save went into
                    the family treasury for the purpose of buying a farm, which was

                     done in 1828. But farming' was not enough in this
                    young man's life; the Clarkson urge to write could not be resisted. In 1838 he asked for
                    his freedom and was given it; soon he was apprenticed to a printer-publisher named 
                        Milton
                     Gregg, in 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    , Indiana. All he had of material goods was fifty cents in cash and a suit of blue
                    jeans. In two years he was the editor and in three, the sole owner of the 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    
                    Western Statesman. In one more year he had won the hand of Elizabeth Goudie, the
                    sister of his brother-in-law, Joseph Goudie, and yet one more year and he had purchased the paper in
                    his home town of 
                        Brookville
                     and converted it into The Indiana American, probably the most
                    gratifying accomplishment of his entire career.10
            
            An enduring success rewarded his efforts. Financially he prospered from the earnings of his press and
                    paper and from a farm which he operated on the side. 
                        Brookville
                     too had prospered in spite of the vicissitudes of the Whitewater Canal days. It was
                    just three years after Coker F. Clarkson returned to 
                        Brookville
                     that the building of the canal was begun; in three years more the link with 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     had been made. But the difficulties were far greater than the moments of success and by
                    1852 the canal's promoters gave up the struggle against nature and the railroad."
                    These years, 1836 to 1852, are the very period when Clarkson was most active as an editor and as a
                    political power who wanted nothing for himself but a great deal for his fellow-citizens. 
                        Brookville
                     was a "second capital" of the state and he could not have been much
                    better placed for political journalism. As an active and zealous Whig he voted for Henry Clay in
                    1832 and spent much time as his regional campaign manager and tour conductor. He reluctantly
                    switched from Clay to General William Henry Harrison in 1836, feeling that Clay could never bring
                    success to the party. He helped to nominate Harrison again for the 1840 campaign that proved to be
                    so memorable. He entertained General Harrison in his home and helped to direct the canvass in the
                    Western states and might later have claimed a reward had he been interested in that angle of
                        politics.12

            Coker F. Clarkson we would call a self-taught and a self-made man. In his 
                        Brookville
                     days he knew more or less well all the great Whig leaders of the 1830's and
                    1840's; as an editor and an active correspondent seeking out the talent of the times he had
                    contacts with many of the literary lights of the country. He not only survived these tests but came
                    through with honors. We can only marvel at his wide knowledge and his powers of succinct expression.
                    He himself attributed much of his education to his work as a printer at the case and he saw to it
                    that both his sons were well-grounded in the printer's trade.
            Meanwhile, home and church life had not been neglected. Four children were born to him and Elizabeth
                    Goudie: Pamela, Frances, Richard Perkinhon (1840), and James Sullivan (1842). The town and
                    countryside were full of the children's relatives. Their father's older sister,
                    Pamela, wife of Goudie, had children who would be "double cousins" to them.
                    Undoubtedly they were brought up in a strict regime. Their father had joined the Methodist Church in
                    1830 at the age of nineteen and remained a loyal member, almost a zealot, until his death in 1890.
                    But we cannot imagine him as one of the "shouting Methodists" so vividly described
                    by R. Carlyle Buley13 and certainly not among those despised by the Quakers, as
                    related by Bernhard Knollenberg.14 Of all the "causes" of the
                    times, temperance (later prohibition) was Coker F. Clarkson's greatest love. He helped
                    organize temperance societies all over Indiana, 
                        Ohio
                    , and 
                        Illinois
                     and eventually became Grand Worthy Chief Patriarch of the Sons of Temperance of the 
                        United States
                    . Schuyler Colfax of 
                        South Bend
                    , Neal Dow, and Edward C. Delevan, indeed, all the state and national leaders, were his
                    intimate friends and associates in this work.15
            
            For reasons that were only vaguely intimated, Coker Clarkson sold his paper in 1853 to the Rev.
                    Thomas A. Goodwin. In his valedictory editorial he asserted that he had

                     put out his weekly paper without a single break for twenty-two
                    years and now he was glad to turn it over to someone else; there were many people who owed him money
                    and he fervently hoped that they would come in and pay up because he was badly in need of the
                        money.16
            
            For a time he enjoyed his newly-found freedom. Notices from him or about him frequently appeared in
                    the paper. He was an experimentalist in his farming and delighted in sharing his discoveries with
                    others. A new type of honeycomb was a source of great joy; a highly productive apple tree was the
                    occasion for a public notice inviting his friends and all others except commercial nursery men to
                    come and get shoots from it for grafting. In 1854 he took part in a mass meeting called after the
                    passage of the 
                        Kansas
                    -
                        Nebraska
                     Act, the kind of meeting that led to the formation of the Republican party.
            In 1855 he exchanged this pleasant phase of his life for a renewal of pioneering.17 From a beautiful and comfortable brick home, no doubt with all "modern
                    conveniences," he took himself and his family to a tent home that was then the only
                    habitation in the western part of Grundy County, 
                        Iowa
                    ; from the scenic beauties and varied landscapes of 
                        Franklin
                     County, Indiana, they went to a prairie farm of unbroken vistas where the sun would
                    beat down unrelentingly all summer and the winds would blow unceasingly all winter, and blizzards
                    and prairie fires would be the deadliest enemies. Why would a man of forty-four give up such proved
                    success for such risks? How could a man do it? Stranger still, how could his wife and children do
                    it? One turns to the novels of Herbert Quick for at least a partial answer. In Vandemark's Folly and The Hawkeye18
                he
                    deals with this theme and to some extent recaptures the mood of these pioneers. The Clarksons appear
                    as actual historical figures in The Hawkeye; certainly acceptance of the
                    authenticity of the characters of the book is made easier by familiarity with the saga of this
                    family.

                            Indianapolis
                        , 1922) and The Hawkeye (
                            Indianapolis

            Economically the family prospered. The renunciation of the public life and the return to farming
                    seemed to be a definite and irrevocable decision. Melrose Farm soon became a landmark. Six hundred
                    and sixty-four acres were entered; eventually a thousand acres of the best land in 
                        Iowa
                     were theirs. As stated above, James stayed behind the others about a year and made the
                    long trip from 
                        Brookville
                     to Grundy County alone as a boy of fourteen, the last hundred-odd miles from 
                        Dubuque
                     overland by whatever conveyance he could chance upon, this in February, usually the
                    bitterest month in the 
                        Iowa
                     winter. James joined his father not only in the usual farm work but in the operation of
                    a section of the Underground Railroad, a fact about which he boasted the remainder of his life and
                    which he recorded in Who's Who in America. The father was urged to accept
                    election in 1856 to the 
                        Iowa
                     State Constitutional Convention but refused because of his short length of residence in
                    his newly adopted home. In 1860 he was elected to the Republican National Convention where he first
                    supported John McLean of 
                        Ohio
                     but switched to 
                        Lincoln
                     on the third ballot and marched with the rail-splitters in triumphant
                    procession." This was the second president he helped to nominate. In October, 1861, his
                    elder son Richard backed up the family's politics by going off to the wars, a member of
                    Company A, 12th 
                        Iowa
                     Infantry. Coker again yielded to the call for service and accepted election in 1863 to
                    the state senate, a place which he held for one term of four years.
            Some excerpts from one of his letters and one from James convey vividly the interests and outlook of
                    the family:

                                     farms will more than make the difference. For
                                    instance last year I had rented out considerable of my farm, and my 1/3 of the wheat
                                    amounted to 7 bushels per acre. This at $1.00 per bushel, which is the
                                    price here, is $7 per acre, while the land on which it is raised is not
                                    worth more than $5 per acre. The same with corn. For my 7/3 of corn I
                                    received 25 bushels per acre. This at 35 cents per bushel is over $8 per
                                    acre. I do not know how farming can be made to pay as well in Indiana or 
                                        Ohio
                                    .
                        "But I am not anxious about making much. I am so situated now that I am not
                                    fearful of poverty in the decrepitude of old age, which has sometimes been a horror
                                    to me. My farm will always yield me a comfortable living. More than this would add
                                    to me trouble and anxiety. Were it not for the terrible war raging in our country I
                                    should consider myself comfortably situated.

            Coker F. Clarkson's love for the farm was not transmitted to his sons nor was it sufficient
                    to contain all of his own boundless energy. Shortly after Richard had come home from the Civil War,
                    both boys went packing off to Des Moines to work as journeymen printers for F. M. Mills and Company,
                    publishers of the

                    of young James soon asserted itself and he was able to go into reporting and editorial work and
                    serve as string correspondent for the 
                        Chicago
                    
                    Tribune and other papers. The father and two sons bought out the Register in 1870, thus beginning the final phase of Coker's life. He retained his
                    farm and added, the editorial supervision of the paper to his work.
            Soon there developed what could have been a family tragedy, a split over politics. 
                        Iowa
                     Republicans were badly divided by factionalism after the war. The father was devoted to
                    the political interests of Senator James Harlan, formerly of 
                        Rockville
                    , Indiana, a member of the class of 1848 at Indiana Asbury College, a strong Methodist
                    lay leader, and an educator as well as politician. The sons took up with the newer faction led by
                    General Grenville M. Dodge, Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad and now successfully 
                  
                     20 Coker F. Clarkson to Mrs. Joseph Goudie, February 9, 1863; James S.
                            Clarkson to Mrs. Joseph Goudie, February 22, 1863. Both letters are now in the possession of
                            John P. Goodwin, 
                                Brookville
                            , Indiana.
               
                     backing the senatorial ambitions of ex-congressman William Boyd
                    Allison of 
                        Dubuque
                    . Fortunately for family harmony, the father sold out his interests to his sons21 and James now became the real power in the Register and a
                    kingpin in 
                        Iowa
                     politics. Richard seemed quite content to manage the business side of the firm; the
                    father relegated himself to the back page with a column on farming and soon became famous as
                    "Father Clarkson," known throughout the state for his excellent advice on farming
                    practices and the art of living as well. He also acted as a professional organizer for the Grange.
                    He represents a little-known side of that movement, that of the successful and prosperous farmer and
                    businessman who helped to organize the lodges as social and mildly political organizations which had
                    little to do with the ultraradical anti-monopoly wing that has given us the traditional view of
                    "agrarian radicalism."22 In 1878 he sold his beloved Melrose
                    Farm and moved to Des Moines where he continued his column down to his death in 1890.
            After 1871 the spotlight shifts to James, soon familiarly known far and wide by his pen name of
                    "Ret," acquired by his habit of marking all his wretchedly handwritten copy with
                    this abbreviation for "Return" of all copy to him for personal proofreading.
                    Typesetters had to be paid bonus rates to get them to undertake the translation of his scrawl to
                    cold type. Equally remarkable and far more important than his handwriting was the development of the
                    range of his knowledge and the power of his personality. He was an omnivorous reader and he long
                    retained his facts and illustrative material and drew easily and readily on the reserves of
                    information which he stored up. He became a practical man of affairs as well and acted both as
                    promoter and organizer of the companies that brought the C. B. & Q., the Northwestern, and
                    the Wabash railways into Des Moines.23

                            Papers, Des Moines. Clarkson was very proud of this contribution to the growth of Des Moines
                            and rebuked Andrews severely for having attributed too much credit to other Des Moines men
                            for these additions to the city's welfare.
               
                     He was a great force in the fight for statewide prohibition and
                    helped to get two such acts through the legislature only to see the state supreme court nullify each
                    one on technicalities.24 He devoted himself to the improvement of the
                    state's educational facilities and served on the board of the 
                        Iowa
                     State College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts.
            But politics was James Clarkson's first love and the field of his greatest activity. Like
                    his father before him, he wanted nothing for himself (at this stage) but had very firm notions of
                    what was good for the people. He believed in the divine mission of the Republican Party and in
                    Protection as its gospel. James G. Blaine was his idol and no revelations of irregular sales of
                    railroad bonds ever swerved him from devotion to the man from 
                        Maine
                    . Blaine visited him in his home in Des Moines and fully acknowledged his debt to him as
                    his foremost Western spokesman and manager.25
            
            In 1888 the exigencies of local politics plus the unavailability of Blaine made James Clarkson the
                    manager of Senator William B. Allison's effort to secure the Republican nomination for
                    president. He conducted a strenuous pre-convention campaign for Allison against such figures as John
                    Sherman, Walter Q. Gresham, and Benjamin Harrison with Blaine's shadow always hovering over
                    the field. When the convention met in one of the most open contests in Republican history it seemed
                    that any one of the above named plus several lesser lights had a fighting chance to come off with
                    the prize. The final result owed much to Ret Clarkson's surrender to pure
                    sentiment—some would say maudlin sentimentalism. After seven futile ballots spread over
                    several hectic days, he gave the word that shifted 
                        Iowa
                    's votes from Allison to Harrison and started the Harrison bandwagon on the
                    road to victory.
            In later years he attributed his action to his love for old Hoosier friends, Louis T. Michener and
                    William W. Dudley, Harrison's managers, and to his desire to fulfill his father's
                    pledge of devotion to the Harrison family. Just as his father had helped to nominate William Henry
                    Harrison in 1839, so

                        "You will never know how much good you did me in your good letters of April
                                    26. They made me feel almost as if I had had a visit with you.
                        "Yes, I remember the conference you and I had in 
                                        New York
                                     in 1888 a few weeks before the Repn Natl Convention of that year, and
                                    when we practically reached an understanding that my second choice would be Harrison
                                    and that your second choice would be Allison, although we made no positive
                                    agreement; but I always felt after that that if we could not nominate Allison I
                                    would be with you for Harrison. In a way our little visit then saved the final day
                                    for Harrison. For, with my liking for you and other Hoosiers, and my
                                    father's desire to have me support Harrison, I always felt throughout the
                                    long contest at 
                                        Chicago
                                    , when there was so much pressure on me to favor
                                    Sherman—(particularly from his two brothers then living in Des Moines)
                                    and so kept the way open for that. After the last rally on Saturday, after we had
                                    balloted all week, and had failed to form a union on Allison,—which union
                                    came within a breath of accomplishment, and was defeated only by Chauncey Depew
                                    refusing to join the three others of the Big Four of the N.Y.
                                    delegation—and the Convention had met on Monday, Senator Hoar, of 
                                        Massachusetts
                                    , came to me and said ‘I think it is time some one gave way
                                    for the party.’ I said I thought so too, and that I had a letter in my
                                    pocket from Allison authorizing me to withdraw his name whenever I thought it should
                                    be done, but that I would not do that unless we could get a majority of delegates
                                    pledged to some one before we made the new move. He asked me who I thought was the
                                    best man to unite upon, and I told him Harrison, and went on to tell why I thought
                                    so, and told him how much I believed you and Dudley and other Hoosiers had told me
                                    of Harrison that I believed, and then referred to my father's friendship
                                    for the Harrisons and spoke of how my father had gone on  horseback from 
                                        Brookville
                                     over the Alleghenies to Harris-burg, Pa. in 1839 to help nominate the
                                    elder Harrison for 1840, and he exclaimed ‘Why my father was a member of
                                    that Convention too, and if the Harrisons were good enough for the elder Clarksons
                                    and Hoars they were certainly good enough for the later ones.’ So we
                                    finally agreed—although the Senator at first was pretty strongly inclined
                                    to Sherman, as they were kinsmen in some degree, and Sherman was very strong in New 
                                        England
                                    , but we finally agreed we would go together. Then I said ‘if
                                    you will canvass the Eastern delegations I will canvass the Western ones and if we
                                    get a majority of votes pledged I will withdraw Allison's name at the close
                                    of the next ballot, and announce that 
                                        Iowa
                                     was going to support Harrison.’
                        "We made the canvass and after that and after consulting you and Dudley and
                                    finding how many votes you had pledged, found we had a majority for Harrison, and
                                    then proceeded to carry out our programme. My effective plea with the other
                                    delegates was that if we could get a majority of the delegates to go with us, 
                                        Iowa
                                     would withdraw Allison and cast its vote for Harrison. As I was going
                                    back to my seat with the 
                                        Iowa
                                     delegation, Senator Quay, who had seen us at work among the delegations
                                    over-took me and asked ‘What are you and old man Hoar up to?’
                                    I told him, and he said it was impossible, and that we hadn't had time to
                                    get such an agreement with so many men. I told him that we had, and added,
                                    ‘We have 18 votes pledged from your own State, headed by Oliver, and you
                                    had better get on the wagon.’ But he wouldn't and stuck by
                                    Sherman. Senator Hoar, in his Autobiography, tells of how nearly we came to
                                    nominating Allison, but I do not remember if he tells our final work together for
                                    Harrison.
                        "This is my recollection of it. At Des Moines that night when the news of
                                    Harrison's nomination came a big crowd of enthusiastic
                                    Allison men were in front of the Register office and they
                                    were surprised and of course disappointed over Allison's defeat, and failed
                                    to cheer. My father was in the Register office, and seeing this,
                                    went out on the walk, and hired an express wagon, got into it, and had the driver
                                    drive him into the center of the crowd, and said: ‘Gentlemen, I want to
                                    tell you that no mistake has been made in getting a good candidate for President. I
                                    have known the Harrisons  for over 50 years and
                                    I want to tell you the kind of men the Harrisons are,’ and then he told
                                    them of his horseback ride to 
                                        Harrisburg
                                    , and how he helped to nominate Harrison then, and of the part he and
                                    his paper, the Indiana American, took in the great campaign of
                                    1840—and soon had the crowd cheering.
                        "My father in fact helped greatly in nominating three candidates for
                                    President. First Wm Henry Harrison, as I have stated; second, Abraham 
                                        Lincoln
                                     for he was one of the

                        The remainder of the story is anticlimax and in many ways a study in frustration.
                                    Half a loaf is poor compensation when one feels entitled to a whole loaf and that
                                    well buttered and sweetened. Ret's old habit of self-denial was no longer
                                    his mood. He wanted and expected a cabinet place as a reward for his key votes in
                                    the convention and for his valiant work as virtual campaign manager carried out in
                                    great difficulty due to a siege of sickness. After many conferences and a strained
                                    relation with Senator Allison, who was playing a very cagey game for himself,
                                    Clarkson ended up with a place as First Assistant Postmaster General in charge of
                                    patronage, with John Wanamaker as the Postmaster General. Clarkson soon acquired an
                                    unsavory reputation for his extreme spoilsmanship, although it must be asserted that
                                    he played the game just like his predecessors and successors, Republicans and
                                    Democrats alike.27
                        
                     
                  
               
                
            Now he decided to give up the editor's chair at the Register and make his
                    home in the East. This was a momentous decision and was protested by many of his friends. A long
                    study of his papers and some insight into his character leaves this writer with the conviction that
                    Clarkson thought he had outgrown Des Moines and 
                        Iowa
                     and was ready to conquer new worlds. Unfortunately this did not prove to be the case.
                    He served two years as chairman of the National

                     Committee, 1890-1892, but this was routine work. He opened the
                    Tenth Republican National Convention in 1892.28 He was president of the National
                    Republican League, at best an empty honor. In 1892 he suffered a severe attack of rheumatism and
                    while recuperating at 
                  Asheville, North Carolina
               , was the butt of a strange and
                    unexpected denunciation by Senator Allison, creating a breach which was never fully healed. He
                    accepted Allison's apologies and acted as his manager in the campaign for the nomination in
                    1896 but rather half-heartedly. Perhaps he sensed the futility of it in view of Mark
                    Hanna's masterly campaign for William McKinley.
            In the meanwhile he had to take up other work. He became the president of a bridge construction
                    company which had a contract for a bridge across the Hudson River. He divided his time between 
                        Philadelphia
                     and 
                        New York
                    . In 1899 he was reduced to the point of being a candidate for a job as sergeant-at-arms
                    in the 
                        United States
                     Senate and failed to get even this small plum. In 1900 some of his old friends made an
                    effort to get for him the post of Secretary of the Senate and again failed. This failure he felt
                    quite sure was due to the apathy of Senator Allison who denied the charge. In 1902 his friends tried
                    one more possibility and finally succeeded: President Theodore Roosevelt appointed him to the post
                    of Surveyor of Customs for the Port of 
                        New York
                    .29
            
            From this vantage point he again became a man of some power and of considerable influence in the
                    councils of the party. He seems to have been a personal favorite with President Roosevelt and was a
                    frequent guest at the White House. Among other accomplishments was his introduction and sponsoring
                    of an interesting Hoosier-Hawkeye, Leigh Smith James Hunt, who had made a fortune in Korean
                    gold-mining and Sudanese cotton plantations. Hunt was probably one of those who planted the notion
                    of an African big game hunt in Roosevelt's head and certainly was one who gave expert
                    information to the planners of the trip. A fortunate investment by Clarkson in Hunt's

                     provided a large portion of his income during these and later
                        years.80
            
            In the meanwhile Richard Perkinhon Clarkson had taken over the editorship as well as the
                    publisher's office in the Register. The paper had built up so much
                    momentum under Ret that it could carry on for years as the leading paper of the state. R. P.
                    Clarkson, as he was known, was a man of the finest character and highest ideals and firmest will
                    imagineable but he lacked the sparkle of Ret's literary style and he suffered from an air
                    of reserve brought on by deafness. After running the paper since 1888 he finally brought himself to
                    part with it in 1902 by selling to a syndicate headed by George E. Roberts of Fort Dodge, Director
                    of the 
                        United States
                     Mint. For a short while he held a sinecure as Pension Agent for 
                        Iowa
                     and 
                        Nebraska
                     until his death in 1905.31
            
            Ret held on as Surveyor until 1908 and then retired to a small farm near Tarrytown, 
                        New York
                    . Here he and his wife, Anna Howell Clarkson, lived with their son, Coker Fifield
                    Clarkson and his wife, Lucy Miller Corkhill Clarkson, granddaughter of Justice Samuel Freeman
                    Miller, and their daughter, Olivia, on whom he doted in the best grandfatherly fashion.
            In these years he had little to do except take pride in the success of his three sons and to while
                    away the time in letter-writing and occasional flings at feature stories for the Register. He seemed content to live on in the lives of his children. All had been educated
                    in the best Eastern schools and had made good in the world of business and government service.
                    Occasionally he toyed with the idea of taking on a newspaper but he and his son, Grosvenor, his
                    prospective associate, never received just the right offer.32 In 1917 he 
                  
                     30 There are dozens of letters between Clarkson and Hunt in the two
                            collections of Clarkson papers. In one letter, August 29, 1892, Hunt tells Clarkson that his
                            holdings in the Hunt mining1 companies total $392,000.
