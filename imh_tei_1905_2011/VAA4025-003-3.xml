                <p>THE Wabash and Erie Canal, while identified with the State's internal improvement scheme of 1836, has a history
                    that stands apart from that of the system. The actual beginning of this great waterway antedated the internal
                    improvement law by four years, and it had its origin in Federal aid. The first conception of such a work dates
                    so far back that it is a matter of speculation, for the benefits to be obtained were so obvious that, as one
                    writer says, they must have been suggested to every traveler over the pass between the <geogName
                        key="tgn_2746502" reg="Wabash River">Wabash</geogName> and <geogName key="tgn_2497018" reg="Maumee River"
                        >Maumee</geogName> rivers. The same natural advantages that brought the old French fur trade over this
                    route pointed to the possibility of here connecting the waters of the lakes and the <geogName
                        key="tgn_7022231" reg="Mississippi River">Mississippi</geogName>. The Ordinance of 1787, Wayne's Indian
                    treaty of 1795, and President Washington recognized the military and commercial value of the portage where <placeName>

                    </placeName> afterward grew up. A little later others began to entertain ideas of a canal there, and in 1818
                    Captain James Riley,<hi rend="sup">*</hi> a government surveyor, who had been sent to make preliminary surveys
                    of the region, developed and pushed this idea. A canal not exceeding six miles in length, over the old portage
                    between the <geogName key="tgn_1129389" reg="Saint Marys River">St. Mary's</geogName> and <geogName
                        key="tgn_1126151" reg="Little">Little</geogName> rivers would, he thought, be an important step toward an
                    uninterrupted navigation between the two water systems. His opinion as that of a practical engineer was of
                    sufficient weight to command the attention of Congress, which went so far as to establish the feasibility of
                    such a work by preliminary surveys. As the country was thrown open and the population began to crowd into the
                    rich valley of the upper <geogName key="tgn_2746502" reg="Wabash River">Wabash</geogName>, the commercial
                    demands for an outlet to the east became more imperative and there were repeated and growing demands for
                    improvement <list type="footnotes">

                    and its connection with the <geogName key="tgn_2497018" reg="Maumee River">Maumee</geogName>. Indiana itself
                    was too poor to attempt such undertaking, and Congress was besieged with memorials and bills for grants of
                    greater or less magnitude. The fight for such grants was continuous and increased in the scope of its demands.
                    In 1823 Jonathan Jennings reported a bill "to authorize the State of Indiana to open a canal through the
                    public lands for the purpose of connecting the <geogName key="tgn_2746502" reg="Wabash River"
                        >Wabash</geogName> and the <geogName key="tgn_2497018" reg="Maumee River">Miami</geogName> of <geogName
                        key="tgn_7026039" reg="Erie, Lake">Lake Erie</geogName>." All this called for was a right of way for the
                    canal, but it was generally regarded by the representatives from Indiana as the entering wedge finally to
                    secure a land grant from Congress. Before final action on this bill, attempts were made to enlarge its scope,
                    but it was finally passed in almost its original form. This left on the State the burden of constructing the
                    canal, but, with no fund for the purpose other than a wholly inadequate one derived from what was known as the
                    three per cent. fund,* it was not much nearer to the accomplishment.</p>
                <p>The concession gained simply lay fallow for two years while the general idea of Federal aid of internal
                    improvements was making its way; then another bill was introduced asking for a land grant to aid the proposed
                    canal in Indiana. Meanwhile the idea of the magnitude of the work had grown. In the debates upon the subject
                    there seems to have been no fixed opinion as to the length the canal was to be. One had it the original
                    portage connection of six or seven miles, another extended the canal to the <geogName key="tgn_1126151"
                        reg="Little">Little Wabash</geogName>, twenty-five miles below; others to the mouth of the <geogName

                        key="tgn_2746502" reg="Wabash River">Wabash</geogName>. Mr. Hendricks, the leading supporter of the bill,
                    and Senator from Indiana, probably expressing the sentiment, of the canal's friends, was of the opinion that
                    the canal should extend fifty miles, to the mouth of the <geogName key="tgn_7021004" reg="Mississinewa River"
                        >Mississinaway river</geogName>.† In support of the bill the commercial benefits to the western country

                    alternate section of land, equal to five miles in width for six miles on both sides of the proposed line and
                    throughout its whole length, for the purpose of constructing a canal from the head of the navigation on the

                    one of the 213 miles of the proposed work. Indiana, accepting the conditions of the grant, took steps toward
                    the work, but considerable time was spent in discussing the thing to be done (some, even at this time, leaning
                    to the idea of a railroad), and in organizing; and not until February 22, 1832, was the first ground broken.

                            of the work and the advantages which would be realized, concluded by saying: 'I am now about to
                            commence the Wabash and Erie canal, in the name and by the authority of the State of Indiana.' He then
                            struck a spade into the ground and the assembled gentlemen cheered. Judge Hanna and Captain Murray,
                            two of the able advocates of the canal, next approached and commenced an indiscriminate digging, and

                    of which it was the main artery, and after the abandonment of the other works it was still retained by the
                    State, it then being a source of revenue and having the land grants behind it, though still an unprofitable
                    holding. In 1846, at the instance of the State's creditors, through Charles Butler, their attorney, it, with
                    its tolls and unsold lands, was transferred to them in part payment of the internal improvement debt. A part
                    of the stipulation was that out of the sales of these lands the new holders should complete the canal to the

                    final closing up of its affairs in 1876 of itself makes a long and complicated story. The creditors fulfilled
                    their part of the contract to extend the canal, reaching <placeName>

                    canal" as the period from 1847 to 1856, yet the high tide of tolls and rents ($193,400.18) was in 1852, and
                    "from that time the income steadily decreased." Traffic was deflected to the newer, swifter and more reliable
                    method of transportation, confidence in the future of the canal waned, money ceased to be invested in
                    boat-building and investments in canal-property were withdrawn. By 1854 "bulky goods, like corn, iron and
                    lumber-–articles which paid light tolls-–constituted its main traffic,"† while the better-paying exports all
                    went to the railroads; and to add to this curtailment, the imports caught by the canal dwindled away almost
                    wholly; boats that carried the bulky products eastward were forced to return empty, and the passenger carriage

                    of tolls for the encouragement of shippers, the tonnage steadily declined till the competition with the
                    railroads became hopeless. By various makeshifts, that had in them the flavor of desperation, traffic on the
                    ditch continued to exist after a fashion, until in the seventies it was wholly abandoned, the court ordered
                    the sale of the canal, the right of way and lands went to speculaters and the old waterway, famous in our
                    history, fell into ruin. To-day, over part of the old route, lie side by side the river, the dry and
                    half-obliterated canal bed, a railroad and an electric line, representatives of four distinct epochs in

                    formerly production was limited to supplying home consumption, it now began to send its products to eastern

                    oil-mills and one iron establishment, as being furnished water-power from the canal, and in addition to these
                    were many other mills, elevators, foundries and warehouses scattered all along the route not using canal water
                    for power, but there, nevertheless, because of the canal. Industries dealing with raw material were also
                    developed. The canal ran through a heavily forested tract and at once became the highway for handling
                    firewood. Similarly the manufacture and shipping of lumber was begun and maintained for a long time on an
                    enormous scale, while the quarrying of stone and the manufacture of lime became prominent sources of wealth.
                    In conclusion, it was estimated by Chief Engineer Jesse L. Williams that thirty-eight counties in Indiana and

                    received for their wheat one dollar per bushel and got salt for less than four dollars a barrel.

                <p>Strange as it may seem, this great and badly needed improvement was bitterly opposed by some and every
                    obstruction thrown in the way of the enterprise that could be, the opposition being led by Charles Hutchens, a

                    </placeName> at 2 o'clock p. m., December 25, 1834, to consider the propriety of constructing a canal from the
                    forks of <geogName key="tgn_2181290" reg="Blue Creek">Blue creek</geogName> to its mouth. It was proposed to
                    connect with the Whitewater canal near the mouth of the creek, and it was thought that Congress would donate
                    the contiguous land. The call closes with the following postscript: "While we are borrowing money to build the
                    Whitewater canal, let's borrow a little more to build the <geogName key="tgn_2181290" reg="Blue Creek">Blue
                        Creek</geogName> ." This was done by the opponents of the Whitewater, as the proposed canal would only
                    have been four miles in length. January 5, 1835, the engineer reported the survey completed. The length of the
                    canal was seventy-six miles, with a fall of 491 feet from its head at <geogName key="tgn_2538628"

                    The estimated cost per mile was $14,908, or $1,142,126 for the entire canal. In June of that year General

                    canal was sold in 1842 to Henry S. Vallette, a wealthy Cincinnatian, who proceeded to complete it. In November

                    The following November there was another flood that destroyed all that had been done and $80,000 more was
                    expended, leaving $30,000 of repairs undone, and the canal was not ready for use until September of 1848.
                    Disaster followed disaster, the cost of maintaining it exceeding the revenue until the summer of 1862, when it
                    was sold at the court-house door in <placeName>

                    that portion of the canal and used it as I have stated, but on December 5, 1865, C. C. Binckley (now Judge

                <head>THE INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM OF INDIANA.</head>
                <p>INDIANA'S great scheme for internal improvement which went into active operation with the famous internal
                    improvement law of 1836, has, so far as our published histories show, never received more than superficial
                    consideration. A thorough study of it, of the spirit that begot it and the lessons taught by its economic
                    fallacies would, indeed, make a chapter of some magnitude, and an inviting field still remains open for some
                    ambitious scholar to gather the substance and meaning of it into an elaborate thesis. Thus far, Elbert Jay
                    Benton, in his "<geogName key="tgn_2746502" reg="Wabash River">Wabash</geogName> Trade Route," which has been
                    cited in our previous article, has, perhaps, got the most out of it. This brief study claims to be little more
                    than an outline, which may be of interest in connection with other articles of our series.</p>
                <p>The internal improvement movement, as taken up by the State, can be better understood when we remember that it
                    was but part of a more general one that swept over the country, and which had been gathering force for years.
                    The situation in the <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was, perhaps, analagous to none other in the world at that day—a vast interior, still new and in
                    the rough, predestined by climate, soil and natural resources to high development, and occupied by a race of
                    boundless energy thoroughly bent upon progress. Almost with the founding of the nation the needs of
                    transportation and the desirableness of facilitating it by government aid was agitated; and as population
                    spread, forming sections, the needs became more imperative, both commercially and politically. There was a
                    strong advocacy of federal aid. In 1806 the Cumberland or <geogName key="tgn_6004131" reg="National Road"
                        >National road</geogName>, to penetrate the West, was projected, and a year or two later Albert Gallatin,
                    as Secretary of the Treasury, laid before Congress an elaborate scheme for federal works, consisting of roads,
                    canals and river improvements. His suggestions were not carried out, but the fact that he had been instructed
                    to prepare a report on the subject was significant.</p>
                <p>But such aid as the general government rendered was insignificant <pb n="118" id="VAA4025-003-3-018"/> compared
                    with the growing needs of the country; private enterprise likewise failed to keep pace with those needs, and
                    the idea of State paternalism naturally grew up as the most promising means to the desired end.</p>
                <p>As early as 1812 the legislature of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007568" reg="New York">New York</region>

                    aid, and these were but the earlier steps in a movement which took possession of the country at large.
                    Turnpikes, canals, navigable rivers, and a little later, railroads were things that people must have, and
                    whatever promised to bring them made a strong bid for popular favor.</p>
                <p>In the light of this prevailing and growing idea, then, it is not suprising that the citizens of Indiana,
                    concerned to desperation by the difficulties of their situation, should have fallen in with the notion, and,
                    beguiled by specious arguments, launched into a rash undertaking that afterward threatened to be the State's
                    undoing. The sentiment within the State that culminated in the Act of 1836, with its reckless appropriation,
                    was a growth. "For a period of more than ten years the expediency of providing by law for the commencement of
                    a State system of public works had been discussed before the people of the State by governors, legislators and
                    distinguished private citizens."<hi rend="sup">*</hi> In his message of December 8, 1835, Governor Noble said:
                    "The first steps in most of the important works undertaken have met with opposition from those who entertain
                    fears of taxation, bankruptcy and ruin, but of all the public works in other States there are none that have
                    been abandoned, or that have proved burdensome or unpopular with the people, even under the highest rate of
                    taxation: on the contrary they have uniformly become <list type="footnotes">

                    and objects of just pride and exaltation with the people. These triumphant successes have settled the question
                    as to the practicability and utility of public works, and, encouraged by these examples, our citizens have
                    manifested their willingness to enter with spirit upon a system that will contribute not less to their own
                    prosperity than to the credit of the State."</p>
                <p>The messages and addresses of Governors Hendricks, Ray and Noble (1822 to 1834) urged public works—the
                    improvement of rivers and the construction of roads and canals. The financial success of such works in other
                    States, particularly the Erie canal, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007568" reg="New York">New York</region>
                    </placeName>—where, according to the statement of Governor Marcy, of said State, the revenue from the canal
                    would, within three years, more than pay off its cost—was often quoted. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s canal system, also, had paid well, and facts and figures to prove the safeness of such
                    investment were abundant. In a word, what the people needed the people would use when provided with it, and
                    the returns from the tolls would take care of the necessary debt.</p>
                <p>With the agitation public sentiment became educated to the idea, as is evidenced by the part the question came
                    to play in politics. It became an issue in support of which politicians arrayed themselves, and not a few,
                    among them James B. Ray, Governor from 1825 to 1831, may be said to have ridden into power on this wave.</p>
                <p>In view of all the circumstances, the State, though it did the unwise thing, as the sequence proved, yet acted
                    slowly, and not without prudence. The bill committing the State to the public works did not make its way
                    through the legislature until preliminary surveys had been made, information made public and the will of the
                    people determined by the ballot. "In 1836 the financial affairs of the country seemed to be in sound
                    condition, and the minds of the people of Indiana were fully prepared to regard with favor the commencement of
                    an extensive system of State internal improvements."<hi rend="sup">*</hi> It was only a question of time till
                    this tide must have its way and it issued eventually in an elaborate law of forty-four sections, providing for

                    its way into circulation; prosperity instead of hard times "stared people in the face" and most of the people
                    were more than satisfied. It was believed that the revenues from the public works would fill the State
                    treasury and simply do away with taxation, and the dream of opulent times snuffed out the enforced prudence of
                    the normal business world and begot a burning fever for more gain. "A period of wild speculation ensued. Those

                    legislation, essential to the prosperity of our people, and highly creditable to the character of Indiana,"<hi
                        rend="sup">†</hi> there was a minority who saw breakers ahead, and even among its ardent supporters there
                    was not lacking those whose foresight and sagacity begot premonitions, as is shown by this excerpt from
                    Governor Noble's message of December 5, 1836 (House Journal, 1836, p. 19): "There must," he says, "be
                    foresight and stability in our legislation so as to continue and increase the confidence of the people at
                    home, and maintain the just credit of the State abroad. Until our success is complete our duties will not
                    terminate, and whilst indulging our fancies with the prospect of a bright future, it should not be forgotten
                    that during the progress of every public work like ours there has been a financial pressure from which we can
                    claim no exemption. An overflowing prosperity will follow profuse disbursements of the public funds. With its
                    current we will all be swept along, and, seduced by the times, we will live high, purchase freely, contract
                    debts and plunge into other extravagances at which our present notions of economy would revolt. And when these
                    disbursements are reduced, when the heaviest demands are made upon us for the support of the Treasury, we
                    shall have parted with the means placed in our hands. Such a state of things will hardly fail to bring upon us
                    a pressure, and when the dark period arrives, there may be some so forgetful of its past benefits as to
                    complain of the system."</p>

                <p>Despite these foreboding's, however, the framer of the Message permitted himself to see only a bright and
                    hopeful outcome, and he proceeded to point out the policy whereby there would be thrown into the Treasury each
                    year, not only a sufficient supply for the demands upon it, but a continuous handsome balance that would

                    accruing interest, which was honorably discharged only after years of financiering, and which all but resulted
                    in the disgrace of repudiation.</p>
                <p>The causes of this disastrous outcome were various. In part it is attributed to the financial distress that
                    swept over the country in 1837. Another factor was unwise management. Instead of proceeding judiciously and
                    slowly in the floating of bonds, and completing one work at a time, thus securing speedy returns from tolls,
                    there was a politic attempt to satisfy the clamorous demands of the sections to be benefited and to supply
                    them all at once with their canals, roads and railroads. Thus, to balance the vast expenditures there was no
                    income, save a slight one from the Wabash Canal, which had previously reached a stage of service. "To add to
                    the State's embarrassment, the price of labor, provisions and material increased the cost of the various works
                    far above the original estimates," and yet again, bonds had been sold on credit, and, owing to the subsequent
                    panic in the business world, sums amounting to more than three million dollars were a total loss. These and
                    other causes that would seem to be inseparable from government paternalism<hi rend="sup">*</hi> operated
                    fatally. Some of the works, such as the Whitewater canal, the Madison railroad and some minor features of this
                    system, were transferred to private companies that extended and operated them. The Wabash canal was for the
                    time retained by the State. The utter loss of the work on the unopened canals may fairly be considered as due
                    to the succeeding era of railroads which speedily made canal construction practically obsolete.</p>
                <p>For the better part of a decade legislation in Indiana was fronted by the State's huge and steadily accruing
                    debt, and the seeming impossibility of lifting the burden. The solution was made possible, eventually, by the
                    creditors themselves. In 1845-'46 the population of the State was estimated at 800,000, the taxable property
                    at $118,500,000, the voters' poll-tax at $124,000. The total debt per capita was a little over $20, and the
                    wealth per capita about $140. For five years Indiana's bondholders had received no interest on their
                    investments, the ultimate recovery <list type="footnotes">

                    were being: quoted at 40 cents on the dollar. Among the bondholders were not only large capitalists, but many
                    persons of limited means that depended on their investments and were actual sufferers by the non-payment of
                    their interest. Their straits demanded some remedy, if remedy were possible.</p>

                    as the "Butler Bill" (General Laws, 1846) and is to the effect that the bondholders should receive as part

                <p>THE first settlers of <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002468" reg="Henry">Henry county</region>
                    </placeName> were, as a rule, poor people. After the young pioneer had paid for his half-quarter or quarter
                    section of land at the government price of $1.25 per acre, he seldom had any money left with which to improve
                    it or for the support of his family, and credit was a necessity. Thus the county was literally cleared up and
                    improved on credit. The conditions of the times begot this custom, and the merchants and other business men,
                    perforce, gave credit freely, and these in return received from the great eastern houses long credit, their
                    accounts sometimes being carried year after year. Notwithstanding delays in payment, however, little money was
                    lost, for honesty of purpose was the rule then, and the pioneers paid their debts as faithfully and promptly
                    as their accumulations would permit.</p>
                <p>Under these circumstances it is obvious that the settler could enjoy few luxuries. Life was a struggle to
                    discharge the obligations hanging over him and for the bare necessities. He and his family had in large
                    measure to be self-supporting, in the matter of clothes as well as food, and all are familiar with the story
                    of the spinning-wheel and the loom, and the home-made fabrics, as well as the table supplies wrung from the
                    forest and the clearing.</p>
                <p>The backwoods cabin was, perhaps, as primitive a structure as was ever adopted by a civilized people. John
                    Finley, in his famous "Hoosier's Nest," describes it as <pb n="126" id="VAA4025-003-3-026"/>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>"A buckeye cabin, Just big enough to hold Queen Mab in."</p>
                    </quote> Finley's picture of this domicile, both inside and out, is true to life, but it must be said that the
                    "buckeye" cabin was hardly the typical one, as other logs, such as sugar-tree, beech, ash and poplar, being
                    more durable, were generally used. Buckeye, however, being easily worked, sometimes served, and it is said
                    that these, sending out sprouts during the first summer, would cover the walls with greenery, partially
                    concealing the house amid the foliage of the woods. For these cabins, when of the most primitive form, the
                    surrounding forest furnished practically everything. Logs of a uniform size, notched and saddled at the ends,
                    formed the walls, the openings being sawed out; long poles laid across from gable to gable served the purpose
                    of both rafters and sheeting, and the clapboards, weighted down with other poles, made the sheltering roof.
                    Logs hewed to an even surface formed the puncheon floor. The rude door, with its wooden latch, was hung on
                    wooden hinges, and even the fireplace, a cavernous recess of smaller logs and rived slabs, lined "from the red
                    clay on the hill," was fashioned from the material at hand.</p>
                <p>A more specific description of some of these features of construction may be permissible. The opening for the
                    fireplace, from five to ten feet wide, was sawed out of the wall, as were the windows and doors. From this
                    opening outward was built an enclosure like a pen, of small, split logs, the outer ends notched and saddled,
                    as were the corners of the cabin, and the inner ends secured to the ends of the house logs by pins driven in.
                    Inside of this three-walled enclosure a similar temporary one was built with a space of twelve or fifteen
                    inches between the two sets of walls, and into this space moist clay was firmly pounded and left to dry. When
                    the false wall was removed or burned away this clay formed a protecting back and jambs for the fireplace,
                    extending four or five feet up, and above this was constructed the chimney of rived sticks built up in a
                    diminishing square and heavily plastered with clay. The hearth and bottom of the fireplace were made by
                    filling in with clay to the level of the cabin floor and this was pounded with a maul until rendered hard and
                    firm, then well wet with water and scraped to a smooth surface with a wooden scraper.</p>
                <pb n="127" id="VAA4025-003-3-027"/>
                <p>The chinks or spaces between the logs that formed the walls of the house were filled in with short sticks split
                    to fit into the crevices as snugly as possible, and these were plastered over with tough clay or mortar, which
                    shut out the weather very effectually. After the cabin was erected spaces were sawed out for doors and
                    windows, and slabs secured to the ends of these sawed logs by wooden pins served at once to hold them in place
                    and to make frames to the openings. To exclude the weather and admit light, the windows, before the
                    introduction of glass, were covered by a sheet of paper stretched across and pasted to the frame and rendered
                    semi-transparent by greasing. The doors were made of broad slabs fastened to cross battens by means of wooden
                    pins. These battens were longer than the width of the door, the projecting ends being furnished with holes
                    into which pins would set, and these pins were in other slabs or "heads" that were attached to the logs at the
                    jamb of the door. The wooden latch was raised from the outside by a "latch-string" that passed through a small
                    auger-hole and hung out. When this was drawn in the door was securely fastened.</p>
                <p>These cabins, built entirely without the use of nails or any scrap of iron, were the most primitive of our
                    backwoods domiciles. After the first years glass and other imported material became more or less common, and
                    with the establishment of sawmills sawed boards took the place of hewed slabs. The next improvement in
                    construction was the house of hewed logs. These, by comparison, presented quite a neat appearance, with their
                    smooth walls and mortar daubing and with floors, frames and finishing of yellow poplar, and when of two or
                    more rooms were considered particularly fine. They were sometimes of two stories, and the earlier taverns and
                    business houses in the villages or on the principal highways were usually of this kind.</p>
                <p>Some of these houses, while they would be considered small now, were regarded as spacious then, and indeed,
                    their capacity for accommodation was something to be wondered at. The rearing in them of large families was
                    the rule rather than the exception, and there was always room for friends and kinfolks. The taverns, by
                    utilizing auxiliary space, were like the proverbial stage-coach, in which there is always room for one more.

                <p>The simple log-cabin home is an integral part of the earlier history of Indiana. To the rising generation it is
                    almost unknown, except by hearsay, and yet in these humble abodes, which may be called veritable gifts of the
                    forest, were nurtured a majority of the men who laid the foundations of the State and many of whom have
                    reflected luster upon the name of Hoosier–-true fledglings of the "Hoosier Nest."</p>
                <p>The household equipment of the pioneers was primitive and rude. The late Dr. D. H. Stafford, who came to <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002468" reg="Henry">Henry county</region>
                    </placeName> in 1823, gave the following as one of several plans for the construction of the beds: Holes were
                    bored in a log of the wall at the proper height from the floor, and into these sticks were driven
                    horizontally, the other ends being supported by upright stakes or posts. Upon the framework thus provided was
                    woven a bottom of withes or bark or deer-skin thongs, which formed a support for the bedding. Privacy was
                    sometimes secured by making the outer supporting posts high enough to be furnished with a concealing
                    curtain.</p>
                <p>Hooks on which to hang clothes or other articles were fashioned from the forked or crooked branches of trees,
                    and forked sticks with the addition of pins inserted in the longer arm made pot-hooks which were caught over a
                    pole or "cross-tree" that was fixed in the fireplace a safe distance above the fire, the pots being hung on
                    the pins. An improvement on these was the "trammel-hook," formed of a fiat bar of iron hooked at one end,
                    while at the other an adjustable hook could be raised or lowered as desired and secured by means of an iron
                    pin inserted in holes that were drilled along the bar. With the advent of brick chimneys came swinging cranes
                    of iron. These, set in iron eyes embedded in the masonry, could be turned freely, the long arm carrying the
                    pots out over the hearth when desired.</p>
                <p>The common culinary utensils were, first of all, the rotund, bulbous-looking pot, constricted at the top with a
                    flare above so <pb n="129" id="VAA4025-003-3-029"/> the lids would sit in safely; the long-handled frying-pan,
                    and the iron oven for baking pone. This latter was a vessel perhaps three or four inches deep, set on legs and
                    provided with an iron lid turned up around the edge. In it the thick loaf of corn bread was baked by setting
                    it on a bed of coals with more coals piled upon the lid. A thin, smooth board or broad wooden paddle for the
                    hoecakes was also an essential, and sometimes long-handled waffle irons were part of the outfit. At a later
                    date and with growing prosperity other cooking devices came into use. The "reflector" oven was considered a
                    great invention. This utensil consisted of a light iron frame two to three feet in length, mounted upon short
                    legs, to hold the baking and roasting pans. To the back part of this frame a flaring top was attached by
                    hinges, so that it might be turned back when the cooking needed attention. The sides were also enclosed. This
                    flaring top and sides, made of bright tin, presented a large opening toward the open fire which was
                    supplemented by a bed of live coals drawn out upon the hearth, and from the hood, sides and back of tin the
                    heat was reflected down upon the cooking. It served its purpose well, and surely no better bread, cakes or
                    pies have ever been eaten anywhere than those our mothers used to bake in the old "reflectors" upon the
                    hearth.</p>
                <p>When the cook stove made its way into the early homes of the country it was hailed with delight by the majority
                    of the pioneer women because it afforded such great relief to their faces, hands and arms that had been so
                    continually blistered by the great open fires, but some adhered to the fireplace, the old utensils and the old
                    culinary methods as long as they lived. A good many of the more prosperous families used the "Dutch ovens."
                    These were made of small boulders or bricks and mortar, or else of tough clay, wrought and beaten into shape,
                    and burned by slow fires built within. They were usually set upon wooden platforms aloof from the house, by
                    reason of danger from fire, and were protected by a shed. They were principally used in the summer time. In
                    appearance they were rounded domes, not unlike the old-fashioned beehive. The fire was built in them and then
                    raked out and the baking set upon the floor, the body of the oven retaining enough heat to do the cooking.</p>
                <p>The woodenware of the household was often made by the <pb n="130" id="VAA4025-003-3-030"/> pioneer himself.
                    Trays, large and small, were made from the soft poplar, buckeye and basswood, and these took the place of most
                    of the present-day tin- and crockery-ware. The churn was sometimes a mere trough and paddle. The hominy pestle
                    was a solid beech or maple stump with a bowl-shaped cavity burned in the top to hold the grain while being
                    pounded, and a similar stump cut as smooth as possible made the chopping-block for meat. The rude trough
                    hollowed out from a short log split in half that was used to catch sap from the sugar trees is still a
                    familiar relic from the olden time.</p>
                <p>For drinking and dipping vessels the common article was the gourd–-one of the most adaptable and convenient
                    gifts of nature to man. In an age when manufactured conveniences were hard to get the gourd was a boon, and in
                    every cabin home it played a conspicuous part. Of many sizes and shapes, it served, when properly scraped out
                    and cleansed, a variety of purposes. It hung as a dipper beside the spring or the well with its long sweep,
                    and in the same capacity it was a companion to the cider barrel and the whisky jug; it was used at the table,
                    at the lye kettle or at the sugar camp for soup, soap or sap; a large one properly halved made a wash-pan or a
                    milk-pan, or, cut with an opening, it became a receptacle for the storing of divers things; a small one was
                    used by the grandmother to darn the family socks over; the boy used one to carry his bait in when he went
                    fishing and the baby used another for a rattle. A veritable treasure was the gourd, and it should be
                    celebrated in song.</p>
                <p>There were various curious articles used in the pioneer homes that are now quite obsolete. One of these was the
                    dough-break-–a clumsy-looking wooden machine for kneading batches of dough. Another was a yoke that fitted
                    across the shoulders with a thong hanging from either end whereby two buckets of water could be carried,
                    leaving the hands free to carry two more if desired. Among the more well-to-do families, and at a later date,
                    perhaps, we find metal warming-pans which, filled with live embers, were used to iron the sheets of a cold
                    night; lanterns of perforated tin; big dog-irons presenting fantastical fronts of brass; tinder-boxes with
                    their contents of flint, steel, little powder-horns and "punk" from rotten logs, used to start the fires;
                    turning-spits for the meat roasts; candle-molds with <pb n="131" id="VAA4025-003-3-031"/> balls of cotton
                    wicking; long tin horns and conch shells to call the men to dinner, and many other conveniences now considered
                    quaint and sought for relics.</p>
                <p>As the country grew, many of the home-made articles were supplanted by the products of local artificers. The
                    neighborhood potter supplied rude queensware, such as milk-pans, crocks, jars, jugs, pitchers, and even
                    teapots. This ware was generally used in <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002468" reg="Henry">Henry county</region>
                    </placeName> fifty or sixty years ago. The village cabinet-maker was an expert, as handsome specimens of his
                    handicraft still to be found will testify. His chairs, cupboards, bureaus and sideboards were made to last as
                    well as to sell, and the furniture put up by such artists in wood as John or Miles Heacock or Jacob Brenneman
                    was good for generations. The writer knows of rockers in this county that have been in use for seventy-five
                    years or more, and the old splint-bottomed chairs with woven seats of thin hickory strips are still to be
                    found in country homes. Twisted corn-husks were also often woven into chair bottoms. Wild cherry, which was
                    common, was a favorite wood for furniture, and those old cherry specimens of the local cabinet-makers'

                <p>One important piece of pioneer furniture, if so it might be called, unknown to the modern household, was the
                    loom, which in the days of home-made fabrics was almost indispensable. The space this ponderous machine
                    occupied in a small cabin made it a serious incumbrance, and hence a period would be devoted to the family
                    weaving, after which the loom could be taken apart and stowed away, unless, as sometimes happened, one had a
                    separate loom-room. The excellence of the work done upon these rude, home-made implements is a matter for
                    wonder now, as one examines preserved specimens. Not only have those blankets, jeans and various cloths a
                    surpassing durability, but some fabrics, such as coverlets and curtains, exhibit a remarkable artistic taste
                    and skill, both in the dyeing of the yarns and the weaving of complicated figures.</p>
                <p>Complementary to the loom were the spinning-wheels–-a big one for the wool and the familiar little one for the
                    flax. The skilful use of these was a part of the education of every girl, and in the ears of many an old man
                    and woman the resonant hum of it still lingers as the sweet music of a day that is past.</p>

                <p>A NUMBER of weeks ago I listened to a beautiful sermon delivered in this church, the minister using as a basis
                    for her discourse the two words "and others."</p>
                <p>The Apostle Paul in writing to the Hebrews enumerates the many great deeds of faith of the patriarchs and
                    prophets, and then exclaims, "And what shall I more say, for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of
                    Barak and of Samson and of Jephtha, of David also, and of Samuel and the prophets," who through faith did
                    great and mighty things. "And others had trials of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover, of bonds and
                    imprisonments."</p>

                    </placeName>, everything centers around Levi Coffin, and other names are rarely mentioned. Newspaper
                    correspondents come long distances to see the house in which he lived, and to get photographs of the same and
                    write long articles of the brave and courageous things he did for the poor slaves seeking freedom. I would not
                    for one moment lessen in the slightest degree the grand and noble work of Levi Coffin, but I would at least
                    say, "and others," who for the sake of humanity "suffered cruel mockings, yea, moreover, bonds and
                    imprisonments," and persecutions and religious octracism. The work of helping fugitive slaves began very early
                    in the history of the old town, but was not thoroughly organized until Levi Coffin took his position at the
                    helm, and by his very prudence and boldness, gave confidence to all those disposed to engage in the dangerous
                    work.</p>
                <p>In the year of 1840 Arnold Buffum visited <placeName>

                    </placeName>–-a man of great power and fine presence-–and by his eloquent and persuasive speech did an immense
                    service to the cause of abolitionism. Soon after this there began the organization <pb n="134"
                        id="VAA4025-003-3-034"/> of anti-slavery societies. The first State society was held at <placeName>

                <p>The interest grew in intensity. The advocates of emancipation of slaves became very bold in all they said and
                    did, and the opponents to the so-called abolitionists and their methods equally bold and unyielding. The
                    church itself was shaken to its very foundation, and the climax finally came in the Yearly Meeting of 1842,
                    when the meeting for sufferings reported eight of their number as disqualified to fill the stations they
                    occupied in that body.</p>
                <p>"Immediately after the last session of the yearly meeting a large number of anti-slavery Friends convened in
                    the meetinghouse to confer upon the situation. Before they had opportunity to discuss the condition of
                    affairs, John Maxwell walked into the ministers' gallery and in the name of the trustees demanded of those
                    present that they immediately leave the house. He first called them Friends, then as if correcting himself, he
                    said he did not know whether they were Friends or not; he would call them people. Another Friend then proposed
                    that as they were so arbitrarily denied the use of the house for the purpose which brought them together, that
                    they meet at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031870" reg="Fountain City">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, nine miles north, the next morning at 9 o'clock. It was united with and the people retired. Next
                    morning at 9 o'clock there was a large assembly gathered at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031870" reg="Fountain City">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> and continued in conference till 11 o'clock, when it adjourned till 2 o'clock to give place to
                    the regular week-day meeting. From 2 o'clock this conference continued until near sunset.</p>
                <p>"Entire harmony prevailed; the spirit of love and prayer overshadowed the meeting, under the influence of which
                    devout supplication went up to the throne of mercy and grace for Divine counsel and aid in this hour of sore
                    conflict."</p>
                <p>From that hour on the public attention was called to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031870" reg="Fountain City">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> more than ever before as the center of the anti-slavery movement in this section of the country.
                    Most of the citizens of the town of whatever denomination were in sympathy with the work, and under the
                    perfected organization everything moved <pb n="135" id="VAA4025-003-3-035"/> along in excellent harmony for
                    the care of the fugitive slaves. Levi Coffin could not have accomplished so much if there had not been so many
                    faithful helpers. There were times when it was wiser and safer to divide the number of slaves until they could
                    safely travel to the next station. It was often necessary to raise money for them, for there were unavoidable
                    expenses. Oftentimes they were almost naked and shoeless, so that clothing and shoes had to be supplied. There
                    was a sewing society organized where the good women met to prepare clothing for the fleeing fugitives. The
                    trains bearing these fugitives nearly always traveled in the night, so wagons and horses had to be supplied,
                    and reliable conductors who would safely pilot them to the next station. All these things could not be done by
                    one man, and Levi Coffin was never hindered in his work by lack of efficient helpers. He aided many scores of
                    slaves on to freedom, an average of about one hundred each year while he lived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031870" reg="Fountain City">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and he left the place and the work with great reluctance, but was finally persuaded to go to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1847 to take charge of the wholesale store in that city, which kept only goods produced by
                    free labor.</p>
                <p>This was fifteen years before the emancipation proclamation, yet the work went right on at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031870" reg="Fountain City">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> during all those years, and no slave was ever turned away. "I was an hungered and ye fed me,
                    naked and ye clothed me, homeless and ye took me in."</p>
                <p>A number of free colored people of Old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031870" reg="Fountain City">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> were quite active and reliable in caring for the fugitives and for any service in their power to
                    give. Chief among them were William Bush, William Davidson, Douglas White and James Benson, but a number of
                    others were equally ready to lend a helping hand. I have been told William Bush was the chosen captain of the
                    forces organized to meet the famous Kentuckians who threatened to burn the town and other dreadful things.
                    While these Kentuckians were in the center of town and trying to gather some clew to their missing slaves,
                    they offended a colored man by the name of Cal Thomas who had a gun on his shoulder, and he declared he would
                    shoot and shoot to kill, but he was quieted and led away.</p>
                <p>Eli Osborn, a friend who was always active in the anti-slavery <pb n="136" id="VAA4025-003-3-036"/> cause, was
                    standing by and he told the Southerners that he did not believe in fighting, but if they would get down off
                    their horses he would be glad to play a game of marbles with them. Eli Osborn a number of times harbored
                    slaves in his home, and in his work of hauling between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement>

                    </placeName>, had opportunities of carrying the escaping fugitives in his wagon. Linden Osborn, his son, who
                    is still a living citizen of <placeName>

                    </placeName> the famous slave, John White, of whom Levi Coffin writes in his book. And this was not all that
                    Linden Osborn did.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the man who next to Levi Coffin did the most in directly aiding fugitive slaves previous to and after
                    1847 was William Hough, who lived just across the creek where Elwood Boren now resides. Time and again did he
                    care for fleeing slaves and contribute liberally of his money in aid of the work. His daughter, Mary H.
                    Goddard, writes me that she well remembers one morning when her two older sisters prepared breakfast for
                    seventeen runaway slaves. Levi Coffin speaks in his book of William Hough's house as a "noted stopping place
                    on the underground railroad." His daughter speaks of the time when a number of Kentuckians came with a search
                    warrant to search her father's house. "It was a bright moonlight night," she says, "and they could be seen
                    very plainly. The man with the search warrant read it aloud. We listened and heard father say: 'Now, I can
                    tell thee, thee will not find thy darkey, for he is not here in my house, but thee may look all thee wants
                    to.' So then, brother Daniel went with the old gentleman all over the house, carrying the light. When they
                    came to the attic over the old kitchen my brother opened the little attic door and said: 'Here is where we
                    keep our runaway darkies, but there are none in there tonight,' when the old gentleman put in his head,
                    looking all around. Then, when they came to our bedroom door he was going to come in, but brother Daniel said:
                    'This is my mother's bedroom. You can't go in there.' And the old man replied: 'Maybe he is under the bed.'
                    This was the last of the search warrant, and father again said to him: 'Didn't I tell thee he was not
                    here?"'</p>
                <p>Mrs. Goddard says they were in search at this time for the famous Louis Talbert, the slave who escaped from the
                    South <pb n="137" id="VAA4025-003-3-037"/> and afterward made a number of trips back to the South and piloted
                    many away from the land of bondage to freedom. He was finally captured at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then on his way South to make another effort to lead others from slavery to a free country. His
                    old master was glad to capture him, and declared he would make an example of him, for he said "Talbert had led
                    away $37,000 worth of slave property." His mistress plead so earnestly for him that he was only punished by
                    being sold into slavery farther south, where it would be much more difficult to escape. On the way down the
                        <geogName key="tgn_7022231" reg="Mississippi River">Mississippi river</geogName> he leaped from the boat
                    and made his escape in the darkness, and after many trials and hardships he again came in the night to William
                    Hough's house. His daughter says: "I remember so well one night we heard some one hallooing at the north side
                    of the house, and my father said: 'Who is there?' And he answered: 'Louis Talbert.' He then told us how his
                    mistress begged for his life and of the final decision that he must be sold into the market farther south. I
                    saw him once after I went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> to teach," she continues. "He came to the Franklin-street school to see my brother. After this we
                    never heard of him again, supposing they had caught and killed or sold him."</p>
                <p>At one time or other Louis Talbert attended school at the Union Literary Seminary, which was taught for many
                    years by Ebeneezer Tucker, a prominent educator and anti-slavery man. In his history of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Louis had been there but had left. They found no fugitives. Three men started at midnight on
                    foot to come to the institute to tell Louis to get out of the way. They came just at daylight and asked: 'Is
                    Louis Talbert here?' 'No, why?' 'If he is, he must make himself scarce; they are after him; sixteen men came
                    into <placeName>

                    or find him anywhere else." Tucker further says that after Talbert was captured at <placeName>

                    afterward came to my father's house. I remember Picayune and the meeting of Henry and his family. Henry was a
                    slave and he stayed at my father's house until his family, who were free, came on. They met upstairs in our
                    house. My mother was upstairs when they met. I remember we wanted to know if she saw them. She said: 'No, I
                    looked the other way.' "</p>
                <p>William Hough's father, Jonathan Hough, and brothers, Hiram, Levi and Moses, were all active in the
                    anti-slavery cause. Jonathan lived with the youngest son, Moses Hough, and family, and fugitives were
                    repeatedly cared for in their house. Jonathan Hough was one of the early pioneers in the settlement of New
                    Garden township, and entered the land comprising the farms where William E. Elliott and Elwood Boren now live.
                    Israel Hough lived just north of William Hough, and his house was searched also by the noted Keutuckians.</p>
                <p>Benjamin Thomas was a true and tried hero in the interest of the colored race. His home was always welcome to
                    the escaping-black man and many were made to feel that "a friend in need was a friend indeed." It was Benjamin
                    Thomas who gave 120 acres of land northeast of <placeName>

                    establishment of a school for the education of the colored people. This was the Union Literary Seminary
                    referred to in this paper. Besides the free colored pupils, Mr. Tucker says as many as ten fugitive slaves
                    attended the school at one time. William F. Davis, now living in <placeName>

                <p>Daniel Puckett, Dr. Henry H. Way and Benjamin Stanton were three very prominent characters in those stirring
                    times in Old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031870" reg="Fountain City">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They were three of the eight who were disqualified <pb n="139" id="VAA4025-003-3-039"/> by the
                    meeting for sufferings in Indiana Yearly Meeting of 1842 for the active part they took in the abolishment of
                    human slavery. They were each always ready with voice or pen or personal deeds to do whatever lay in their
                    power to promote the interests of the fleeing fugitives or in arousing a public sentiment against the curse of
                    human bondage. Daniel Puckett was a minister in the Society of Friends. Dr. Way was a practicing physician and
                    was many times called upon for professional services to those seeking freedom who by great exposure and
                    fatigue became ill or disabled in any way. He was a brave and true man, a fine debater and true counselor.
                    Benjamin Stanton was editor of <hi rend="i">The Free Labor Advocate,</hi> whose pen was ever ready in favor of
                    justice and human rights. They were all prominent in the separation which took place in the Society of Friends
                    because of slavery, and Benjamin Stanton was clerk of the first yearly meeting held by anti-slavery Friends.
                    Daniel Puckett accompanied Arnold Buffum to some of the neighboring meetings when he was speaking for the
                    formation of anti-slavery societies, and Jonathan Hough went with him to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2034164" reg="Winchester">Winchester</settlement></placeName> and other

                <p>Dr. Hiram Bennett was a man of fine ability, who gave up his profession to accept the position of lecturer for
                    the first anti-slavery society formed in the State, at a salary of $500 a year. He was an excellent speaker
                    and traveled over a large territory, and, like all speakers against slavery, suffered much persecution and
                    opposition.</p>
                <p>When Levi Coffin was summoned before the grand jury at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031339" reg="Centerville">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he gave answers which are so often quoted, he was accompanied by Dr. Henry Way, Samuel
                    Nixon and Robert Green, who had been called for the same purpose, namely, to convict them, if possible, of
                    aiding escaping slaves. Samuel Nixon kept a public house a number of years and often had as guests the men who
                    were in search of runaway slaves, yet he did much in the cause of freedom and against slavery. Like many other
                    members of the Society of Friends who left the South to escape the influences of slavery, he left the State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007919" reg="Virginia">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> in 1827 or 1828 and settled in New Garden township, and a little later in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031870" reg="Fountain City">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Robert Green was a good man who was always ready for any service in his power to give. Samuel
                    Charles <pb n="140" id="VAA4025-003-3-040"/> was another prominent Friend who was proscribed by the body
                    so-called, but he always remained true to his convictions in the interests of human freedom. Harvey Davis,
                    Harmon Clark, William R. Williams and Jonathan Unthank were among the number who were relied upon for help for
                    these destitute people; to receive them into their homes, or with horses and wagons and conductors, pilot them
                    to a nearer station to the land of freedom, and each no doubt could have told thrilling incidents that were a
                    part of their own experiences.</p>
                <p>And what shall we say of all the good women who were ready to get up at any time of night to receive these
                    unfortunate people into their homes; oftentimes destitute of sufficient clothing, possibly wet and covered
                    with mud, hungry, and occasionally sick or injured. Think you it did not require a deep conviction of duty and
                    a heroic courage to meet such additional labors to their already full household cares? Nothing less than love
                    of justice and pity and sympathy for the oppressed (the mother heart often appealed to) could win such
                    sacrificing labor under such adverse circumstances. Their names should be placed on the honored rolls of those
                    who stood true in the cause of human liberty.</p>
                <p>There was an organization of young men who obligated themselves for certain duties in aid of the colored
                    people. They sometimes would hire speakers. Another duty which must have required much fortitude was to take
                    regular turns and ride to the "settlement" beyond <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2093247"
                            reg="Spartansburg">Spartansburg</settlement></placeName> to teach in the Sabbath school. Among their
                    number were Zeri and Moses Hough, Daniel and Jesse Hill, Thomas and Isaac Woodard, Ira Marine, Calvin Thomas,
                    Daniel Thomas and others.</p>
                <p>John Lacey was another reliable worker, and his son, William Lacey, did more than any one was ever able to find
                    out. He belonged to a sort of secret service who patroled the banks of the <geogName key="tgn_7014265"
                        reg="Ohio River">Ohio river</geogName> watching for escaping slaves and directing them to places of
                    safety. He was the man who assisted Eliza Harris, of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," up the bank of the river near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2081620" reg="Ripley">Ripley</settlement></placeName>, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, after crossing it in midwinter with her child, on the floating cakes of ice. He confided to a
                    very few how he watched with thrilling interest her dash for liberty on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> side with her pursuers in hot chase after her. When she reached the <pb n="141"
                        id="VAA4025-003-3-041"/> river she hesitated, for it seemed hopeless, but when she realized that she was
                    certain to be captured and separated from her child she clasped her boy more closely and leaped upon a cake of
                    floating ice, and from that on to another, and another, and another. At times she seemed to be sinking and
                    appeared as though she must be lost, but she would place her boy on the nearest floating ice and drag herself
                    onto the same, and with renewed courage continued her daring escape, while Lacey on one side and her would-be
                    captors on the other side watched her with dazed interest and consternation. Finally, with both her and her
                    child nearly frozen, their clothing wet to the skin with the ice-cold water, and almost exhausted, she reached
                    the <placeName>

                    </placeName> side and was assisted up the bank by William Lacey and directed to a place of safety and
                    protection. In her farther flight to <placeName>

                    </placeName> she was shifted from the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and she was at the home of Levi Coffin a number of days. Her name will live for centuries in the
                    story of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," and the man who assisted her up the river bank at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2081620" reg="Ripley">Ripley</settlement>
                    </placeName> was at one time a resident of Old <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
                <p>To still further bear testimony against the traffic in human slavery, many of these good people decided that
                    they could not use the products of slave labor and maintain consciences void of offense, so there were
                    established "free-labor stores" or depots where such goods could be obtained. This was the cause of Levi
                    Coffin going to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1847. He was chosen to manage the wholesale or distributing store for free-labor merchandise.
                    The store at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031870" reg="Fountain City">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> was kept by Joel Parker, an active anti-slavery man. These goods were necessarily more expensive
                    and oftentimes not so attractive, but that did not prevent these heroes of human liberty from bearing
                    testimony against the degrading influence of slavery.</p>
                <p>Nathan Thomas, son of Benjamin Thomas, made several trips to the South in search of cotton, sugar and other
                    products that were not produced by slave labor. He was a prudent but valiant worker in the anti-slavery
                    organization. His wife was the widow of Zeno Reynolds. Her name before marriage was Williams, and she was one
                    of the first teachers in the school established for colored people by the gift of Benjamin Thomas.</p>
                <p>After Levi Coffin removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> he frequently sent <pb n="142" id="VAA4025-003-3-042"/> "runaways" by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031870" reg="Fountain City">Newport</settlement>

                    </placeName>. At one time he brought in his own carriage two valuable slaves, John and Mary. At Daniel

                    </placeName>, he overtook four other slaves whom he started from <placeName>

                    </placeName> two nights before, but they had not traveled so rapidly, moving along at night. From Daniel
                    Clark's they came on to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031870" reg="Fountain City">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> in broad daylight, much to the fear of James Haworth, for Coffin had urged Haworth to get his
                    carriage ready and drive with him to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031870" reg="Fountain City">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for they must hasten on because such valuable property would soon be vigorously sought for. When
                    they drew near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014336" reg="Richmond">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Haworth suggested that they pass around the city, because then, as now, it was not fully alive
                    to public duty, and could hardly be trusted. As they came near to Moffitt's mill on the east fork of <geogName
                        key="tgn_7021535" reg="Whitewater River">Whitewater</geogName>, which was run at that time by Benjamin
                    Fulghum and William Kenworthy, they saw these two men with others at work near the mill. When they got
                    opposite, Coffin sang out at the top of his voice the words of an old anti-slavery song: <quote

                <p>There is still one other prominent worker that I must mention. Pusey Graves was a very brilliant and earnest
                    man who began in early life to make speeches against slavery and gave lectures in the cause, and at the time
                    James G. Birney was a candidate for President, Pusey Graves was a candidate for Congress on the same ticket. I
                    can not do better than to quote a letter received two days ago from his son, Charles B. Graves, who is now one
                    of the judges on the Supreme bench in the State of <placeName>

                                <p>"My father, Pusey Graves, was a very enthusiastic and active anti-slavery man. In his young
                                    days he attracted some attention <pb n="143" id="VAA4025-003-3-043"/> by making anti-slavery

                                    </placeName> was then a part, on the ticket with James G. Birney for President, he made a very
                                    active campaign and was greeted with stale eggs several times. I have heard my mother tell of
                                    the condition of his clothes when he came home. He also traveled over the southern part of
                                    Indiana with a colored man named Lester, an ex-slave, whom father taught to read. This colored
                                    man was a great natural orator and made impressive and eloquent addresses.</p>
                                <p>"My father's home was a well-known stopping-place on the underground railroad. Fugitives often
                                    stopped there while we lived in <placeName>

                                    was being taught to read whenever opportunity offered. When the notorious slave-hunting posse
                                    came to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031870" reg="Fountain City">Newport</settlement>
                                    </placeName> four of the fugitives slept in my father's house, and afterward were employed by
                                    him to cut and rive "cooper stuff" out in the woods about three miles northeast of town, where
                                    they camped until the excitement died out. Pusey Graves and Dr. Stanton, I think, and perhaps
                                    others, bought a printing press, wrote articles and set type at night and printed an
                                    anti-slavery paper for some time, but of course they could not keep it up. We kept a copy of
                                    the paper until he returned from <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, and I think he sent it to the Indiana State Historical Society. These are only a
                                    few of the events which I remember and have received as a part of the history of the family.
                                    My mother's father, John Mitchell, was on the road often with his team carrying fugitives
                                    north. Levi Coffin was a leader among the abolitionists, and they relied upon him for advice
                                    and cooperation, and like all leaders he was accredited with not only his own acts, but with
                                    much that justly belonged to others. While he was a great power and deserves much credit,
                                    still there are others, who, in a more humble way, did actual personal service and gave relief
                                    to fugitives that would, if known, compare favorably with the work of this great leader."</p>

                <head>FIRST STATE FAIR IN INDIANA.</head>
                <p>INDIANA'S first fair was held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, October 19-23, 1852, on the old military reservation, west of West street, now known as Military
                    Park. It was largely through the efforts and influence of Joseph A. Wright, then governor of the State, that
                    the institution was brought into being, and the hearty response when the movement was once under way showed
                    that the time was right for the focussing of the State's industries.</p>
                <p>The newspapers, which at that day reviewed local affairs but sparingly, devoted an unusual amount of space to
                    advertising the fair both before and during its progress, and the following extract from an editorial shows
                    the hopeful enthusiasm that greeted the occasion:</p>
                <p>"A just pride in the utility and greatness of their pursuits will be generally infused among our farmers,
                    mechanics and manufacturers. Standards of excellence in stock, of utility in machines, and of true taste in
                    the elegant articles of comfort and luxury will be fixed in the minds of all. Progress in their respective
                    pursuits will take the place of indifference in their minds. A laudable ambition to have the mantel decorated
                    with a silver cup will actuate all, and thus feeling and acting, who can calculate the ultimate result?"</p>
                <p>The people responded no less enthusiastically. By that time railroad communication was established to <placeName>

                    >Peru</settlement></placeName>, and with the eastern counties by the Bellefontaine and Indiana Central
                    (Panhandle) roads. These admitted of easy access to the capital from the various sections of the State. Half
                    rates were given; the plank roads let animals pass free of toll, and the exhibits and the crowds came.</p>
                <p>There were 1365 entries, with quite a showing of improved agricultural machinery. Among the greatest
                    curiosities of the time were three sewing-machines (the Home, Wilson, and Singer). There was much live stock
                    exhibited, especially hogs, sheep and cattle, and of the latter the Durham were by all odds the most in
                    evidence. By reason of this feature the attendance was augmented by many stockmen from <placeName>

                    </placeName>. According <pb n="145" id="VAA4025-003-3-045"/> to the report of one paper, there were about
                    15,000 visitors the first day; on the second 25,000, and on Thursday, the third day, there were more people in
                    town than the grounds could hold, and the other shows outside caught the overflow.</p>
                <p>Among other features there was an address on Thursday delivered by John B. Dillon, the historian; and Friday
                    and Saturday plowing matches were held out on Calvin Fletcher's farm. The gate receipts at twenty cents a
                    head, for the five days of the fair amounted to something over $4,600, which, according to the local papers,
                    not only defrayed expenses but allowed the return of $2,000 that had been borrowed of the State.</p>
                <p>Altogether it was undoubtedly the liveliest week <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> had ever known. In anticipation of the unusual crowds, side shows, great and small, flocked
                    hither, all eager to catch the surplus Hoosier small change. The "Yankee" Robinson's "Athenaeum," otherwise
                    vaudeville troupe, gave three performances daily in a tent near the fair grounds, and Wells' Minstrels lured
                    the crowds with time-honored jokes and burnt cork. A man named Diehl put up what he advertised as an "enormous
                    pavilion" near the State House, where he let off fireworks a la Pain of modern pyrotechnic fame.</p>
                <p>Toward the last came P. T. Barnum's Museum and Menagerie. Then there was a "grand exhibition of the World's
                    Fair"-–a reproduction by illuminated views of the famous Crystal Palace exposition; "Beard's Hoosier Panorama
                    of 'Paradise Lost'," at one of the churches, and divers other catch-pennies.</p>
                <p>Added to all this the Democrats had a big torch-light procession which was to close with speaking at the Wright
                    House where the New York store now stands. The Whigs, however, objecting to the Democratic program, gathered
                    in numbers to howl down the speakers, and pandemonium resulted. Out of this affair a difficulty sprang up
                    between George G. Dunn and W. A. Gorman which all but resulted in a duel.</p>
                <p>The original intention, out of deference to the other leading-towns of the State, was to shift the fair from
                    place to place, giving <placeName>

                <p>A Department of Archives in connection with the State Library, for which a limited appropriation was made some
                    time ago, has at length become a reality, though its permanency, we believe, has not yet been established.
                    Prof. Harlow Lindley, of Earlham College, in whose hands the work has been put, has spent the summer
                    collecting and organizing material. Two features of Professor Lindley's plan that call for especial mention
                    are (1) the discovery and purchase, for the State Library, of historical material; and, (2) the locating of
                    material over the State that can not be purchased, and at least preparing an intelligent bibliography of the
                    same, so that a student working through the library as a bureau of information can get on the track of as wide
                    a range as possible of documents relating to his subject. The need of something of this kind is obvious to all
                    who have attempted to write in Indiana history and aimed to do it with any thoroughness. Only such know the
                    fragmentary and chaotic character of much of the material relating to important phases of our history, and
                    will hail any effective attempt to add to that material. We await with interest the accomplishment of the
                    archives department.</p>
                <p rend="center">STATE HOUSE DOCUMENTS.</p>
                <p>For many years there has been stored in the basement of the State House a great mass of books and papers
                    relating to the business of the auditor's office from the beginning. These have recently been overhauled,
                    sorted and put in orderly arrangement, with the result that many documents of decided value have been
                    unearthed. Prominent among these are the original books of various land offices of the State, the records of
