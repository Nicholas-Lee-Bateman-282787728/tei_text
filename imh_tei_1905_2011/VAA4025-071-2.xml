                            <p>There is a family joke about the tendency of some of the Cassman men to imbibe: they were
                                descended from an Indian woman named "Thirsty" and had been so ever
                                since. Though amusing, this is quite inaccurate. The woman's name was Thirza,
                                not "Thirsty" (though nineteenth century pronunciation may have been
                                closer to "Thirzie"). She probably was not an Indian but a white woman
                                (see note above). Moreover, the son from whom the jokesters were descended was born in
                                1815, prior to the death of Cassman's first wife. They more likely derived
                                their drinking prowess from Cassman than from his wife.</p>

                    patent dated September 10, 1823, granted to Samuel Cassman the north half of section twenty-two, in
                    township twenty, of range nine, in the land district of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It differed from the usual patent by stating that in accordance with the provisions of
                    the Treaty of St. Mary's he had "located" the land, and by repeating the
                    treaty prohibition against transfer of the property without approval of the president.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Patents regularly stated that evidence of payment for the land had been presented.
                    Although Cassman's tract has been called the "first purchase" in Mount
                    Pleasant Township,<hi rend="sup">13</hi> no mention of payment appears in his patent.</p>
            <p>If Cassman selected this particular half section himself, he showed considerable perspicacity. This
                    was rich and desirable land. It is described as having the "White river crossing the
                    northwest part and Buck creek the center, in a northwesterly course, furnishing excellent water
                    power for mill sites, which were in later years utilized."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Originally
                    a heavy growth of timber covered Mount Pleasant Township creating a rich woodland of oak, walnut,
                    poplar, ash, hickory, maple, beech, and sycamore.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> It would seem that Cassman
                    had reason to expect the possession of such land to bring him respect, comfort, and security; but it
                    soon became a source of anguish to him, partly through his own fault, but largely because of the
                    insatiable hunger of pioneer entrepreneurs to acquire and develop the wilderness lands.</p>
            <p>It seems that Cassman moved onto his property in 1824 or 1825, cleared land, built, and began
                        farming.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> In 1832 <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>, possibly because Cassman's land was still classified as a reservation
                    (Reserve No. A 33) at that time and, being considered Indian, the family was not enrolled among

            <p>Cassman's ambition and industry apparently did not impress some of the white settlers. An
                    assessment of Samuel Cassman, though published much later, is sweepingly denunciatory:
                    "Such facts as are known of him do not honor him in his distinction as the first recorded
                    land owner in this county. He had the Indian thirst for whisky, and had neither the thrift nor
                    industry to develop his land and become a factor of civilization."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
                    Examination of documents, however, seems to reveal the more complex picture of a bewildered Indian
                    trying to cope with official red tape, unresponsive agents, and Jacksonian policies in handling
                    Indian affairs. Cassman was hampered by his poverty, lack of education and business acumen; by the
                    white man's prejudice, greed, and impatience to possess the land; and especially by his own
                    frequent intemperance. Cassman obtained whiskey at stores kept by white men who then hypocritically
                    condemned his use of it.</p>

                    Burt's letter justified his acknowledgment of the deed as deputy recorder in the absence of
                    the recorder as provided by law. The need to expound this small point of Indiana law to Senator

            <p>Nearly eleven months passed before further action toward finalizing the transfer was recorded. Then
                    Elijah Hayward addressed President Jackson a letter which briefly reviewed the facts of the treaty
                    reservation and the sale of Cassman's land for five hundred dollars acknowledged in the
                    proper form. Since Tipton had certified the fairness of the price and Cassman's competency,

                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName>'s statement that he was personally acquainted with Cassman. It seems unlikely
                    that Cassman would have been unaware of having known and been known by the Indian agent. Personal
                    acquaintance is a two way street. Cassman, in his naïveté, seems not to have
                    realized that President Jackson, for whom he begged God's help to consider the plight of
                    the poor, was politically committed to effecting the removal of Indians from the lands east of the <placeName>

            <p>Possibly, Cassman's letter in his own behalf helped to slow down the legal processes, since

                            ("god help the presedent") suggest that Cassman had some acquaintance with
                            Christian teaching. His expressions occasionally take on a psalmodic quality.</item>

                    <pb n="117" id="VAA4025-071-2-019"/> by a young lawyer, Andrew Kennedy, concerning the contest for
                    Cassman's land. He stated that the heirs were six in number, three of age and three minors.
                    "Those kind of contests," he said, "are attended with much trouble, and
                    offten I fear, with much injustice to the heirs of those men to who the aborigenese of our country
                    have saw fit to make donations." He told Cass that he was omitting the terms of the treaty
                    since the secretary was perfectly acquainted with the matter. Cassman, he said, took possession of
                    his land in 1824 or 1825 and remained in quiet possession of it until 1829 when one Samuel McClure,
                    having some claim against Cassman agreed to settle it in consideration of an eighty acre lot of
                    Cassman's land. Though no deed to McClure has been discovered, Kennedy stated that a deed
                    was executed and that McClure tried to obtain a patent for the land, but failed. McClure then
                    relinquished the land and took Cassman's note for the amount owed, with Goldsmith C.
                    Gilbert offering security.</p>
            <p>Kennedy thought that Gilbert bought the remaining two hundred forty acres of Cassman's land
                    in the meantime, though no evidence of such a transaction has been found. He also stated that
                    Gilbert agreed to pay Cassman six hundred dollars for the property, half the amount in chattels,
                    namely: three yoke of oxen, three log chains, and a wagon; and the remainder in the form of a
                    promissory note.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> He continued with an accusation suggesting doubledealing on
                    the part of Gilbert when Cassman offered for sale the oxen, chains, and wagon which had been
                    delivered to him and executed as his property. Before the day of the sale, Kennedy said, Gilbert,
                    fearing he would not get a patent for the land, disavowed the contract and reclaimed the farm
                    equipment which he eventually used to pay his own debts. Besides that, Gilbert also advertised and
                    forewarned the public that he would not pay the amount of his note to Cassman. That note, Kennedy
                    said, <quote rend="blockquote">

                    believe they had been wronged by the representations of General John Tipton, but that the government

            <p>Noteworthy is Gilbert's confidence that he could prove, against Cassman's denials
                    and with the mortgage by now long overdue, that he had paid enough for the land. Since, according to
                    Andrew Kennedy, Gilbert had charged Cassman a specious per diem "rental" for the
                    oxen which he later reclaimed, he may now have calculated, given the lapse of time, that the family
                    actually owed him "rent" for the land on which they were still living. Though
                    Gilbert's letter was answered on July 3, as noted on its reverse, the case was not yet
                    settled. <placeName>

                    originally agreed upon as part of the settlement, most of which, Kennedy said, Gilbert had
                    subsequently reclaimed. In his final statement Pepper declared that "the enclosed
                    compromise having taken place between Goldsmith C. Gilbert and Samuel Cassman it is presumed that
                    there will be no more required by the department. Mr Gilbert will therefore await the receipt of the

            <p>One might be inclined to marvel here at the nobility of the officials who saw to it that the poor
                    Indian received his due, but had Cassman not been so persistent he would have lost all to the white
                    man's ambition. In writing to Cass, Cassman showed some familiarity with the parable of the
                    rich man "faring sumptuously." Perhaps he had also heard the one about the
                    impoverished widow who kept pleading with the judge until he did her justice, not because he was a
                    godly man, but because of her importunity.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>

            <p>When Congress convened in regular session in December, Hendricks quickly went to work on behalf of
                    his constituents. At his suggestion the Senate created a Select Committee on Roads and Canals. The
                    next day he was made chairman of the committee, and ten days later he moved that the committee be
                    instructed to study federal aid to Indiana to build a canal connecting the <placeName>

                    each time, the committee was created and he was made its chairman. Then in January, 1830, Roads and
                    Canals was made a standing committee, and the next winter Hendricks was again its chairman.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> During this initial senatorial term he also served four sessions on the

            <p>Few problems of national importance are resolved quickly, and the political circulars that Senator
                    Hendricks wrote during his first term show the persistence of many questions that he had treated
                    while in the House of Representatives. Proposed changes in public land policy and the proper
                    relation to Latin American republics continued to receive detailed coverage; internal improvements
                    and Indian affairs became major issues and were reported in depth; and the controversial tariff
                    question was occasionally reviewed.</p>
            <p>Congress had ended credit sales of public lands in 1820 and the next year had passed a comprehensive
                    relief law to lighten the burden of purchasers already in arrears and to hasten liquidation of the
                    accumulated indebtedness. At that time Hendricks believed this law to be broad enough to satisfy

                    congressmen from the thirteen original states were opposed to graduating the price of public lands,

            </p>
            <p>During the 1827 debate on graduation, Hendricks labeled the current public land policy unjust and
                    offered an amendment that would have limited graduation to lands in the territories and ceded all
                    other public lands to the states in which they were located. Though he had earlier supported the

                    a state by retaining title to public lands located therein. He took his stand on the Ordinance of
                    1787, which provided for the admission of new states "on an equal footing with the original
                    States in all respects whatever," and on the Constitution, into which he read the same

            <p>The most controversial and time consuming diplomatic question that came before the Senate between

                    majority of the senators favored this mission, antiadministration forces in the Senate delayed
                    confirmation of the proposed delegates, and the congress adjourned before they arrived.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> On every roll call during the controversy, Hendricks took the stand he felt
                    would expedite the mission, because he believed in the wisdom of a friendly policy toward neighbors
                    and saw prospects of a growing commerce with them.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>As Americans settled the interior, they found natural waterways to be a valuable but inadequate means
                    of moving people and goods. Streams were seldom close enough, and rapids and other obstructions
                    often hindered navigation. Improvement of transportation was possible through clearing rivers,
                    building roads, and digging canals, but western states, deprived of public lands and the privilege
                    of taxing public and newly sold lands, lacked the resources to do the job. As chairman of the Senate
                    Committee on Roads and Canals, Hendricks welcomed responsibility for screening proposals for federal
                    aid and recommending appropriations.</p>

                    and he contended that if Congress had not the constitutional authority to appropriate funds for
                    Cumberland Road construction, neither had it the constitutional authority to bargain for tax
                    exemption for public and recently sold lands in the new states with the promise of using two percent

                    laid before the Senate a bill that would have given Indiana a strip of land three miles wide on each

            <p>Friction between white men moving westward and Indians whom they encountered was not a new problem,
                    but it was becoming an acute one in the South. The westward migration of cotton planters was
                    creating irresistible pressure for more land, and fearing "degradation and
                    extermination" of the Indians, President James Monroe in 1825 suggested removal as a way to
                    "not only shield them from impending ruin, but promote their welfare and
                    happiness." He intended to compensate them generously for their property; grant them
                    adequate lands beyond the reach of encroaching white men; and establish for them a suitable system
                    of government. In 1828 President John Quincy Adams also recommended Indian removal, which he
                    believed would "do justice to those unfortunate children of nature" and
                    "secure to the members of our confederation their rights of sovereignty and of
                        soil."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> The Indian Removal Act of 1830, which was passed early in
                    Andrew Jackson's administration, authorized the president to grant western lands to the

                    struggle was not over, however, because some southern tribes were still proud enough and strong

            <p>Imports duties were a primary source of federal revenue, and the nation's tariff policy

                    raising rates to protect domestic manufacturing from foreign competition. Most southerners, however,
                    being exporters of raw materials, favored tariff reduction. The tariff question got caught up in the
                    political controversy between Jacksonians and Adams-<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> men, and the Tariff of 1828, called by some the "tariff of
                    abominations," satisfied no one. A moderate protectionist, Hendricks played no prominent
                    role in this legislation. He believed, however, that after the national debt had been paid custom
                    duties just high enough to cover current expenses, including internal improvements, would provide
                    adequate protection for domestic manufacturing.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hendricks was a diligent senator who gave careful attention to the requests of his constituents and
                    defended the interests of the state of Indiana as he understood them. New states had no heritage of
                    sovereign status and were indebted to Congress for their existence. Under the terms of their
                    admission they were dependent on that body for Indian removal, the availability of land for
                    settlement, and money for the construction of internal improvements. Like many a westerner,
                    therefore, Hendricks looked more often to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> than to his state capital for power and resources, and in that sense he was a
                    nationalist. In such matters as prohibition of slavery in territories and new states, construction
                    and maintenance of internal improvements at federal expense, and <list type="footnotes">

                    power over state power. And he often urged the exercise of that superior power to promote the
                    development of the West.</p>
            <p>In another sense Hendricks may be described as a states rights advocate. Concerned about
                    Congress' retention of public lands in the West in general and Indiana in particular, he
                    read those portions of the Ordinance of 1787 and the Constitution, which deal with the admission of
                    new states, like a strict constructionist. He concluded that the admission compacts were
                    unconstitutional because Indiana and other new states had not been granted sovereignty over all land
                    within their borders; and he launched a campaign to obtain the cession of all public lands to the
                    states in which they were located.</p>
            <p>Hendricks' apparent ambivalence on the matter of nationalism vs. states rights is, however,
                    probably an illusion. Doubtless he favored Indiana, the West, and the nation in that order and
                    supported the exercise of power at whatever level appeared most advantageous to Indiana and the
                    West.</p>

            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>It has been my practice ever since I have been honored with a seat in Congress, at the close of every
                    session, by a short letter, to distribute among the people, such information as I was enabled in
                    that way to communicate, and which would, in my opinion, be useful or satisfactory to them. This
                    practice originated in the opinion, that as the people are <list type="footnotes">

                            to ascertain whether or not commas or periods are used, and in these cases the editor has
                            made what seems to be the correct punctuation. Letters and words have been put in brackets

                    informed concerning them, and, that it is the duty of the representative to give such information,
                    as often as it may be convenient for him so to do. In this view of the subject, I have thrown
                    together on the pages of a common sheet, some of the outlines of business which has occupied the
                    present session, and will endeavour to give them as general circulation as possible.</p>
            <p>The session has been one of much length, of considerable warmth, of discussions of many important
                    subjects, some of which are specially interesting to the Western country. Among these may be classed
                    the question of internal improvements, which has excited, and must continue to excite, much interest
                    in Congress. The new states are not the owners of the soil within their geographical boundaries.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> They are deprived of this great source of revenue, which in several of the old
                    states, has, in peace and in war, sustained their treasuries, and enabled them to engage in works of
                    this character. They are of necessity driven to Congress instead of their own Legislatures, for a
                    participation in the proceeds of the Public Lands, and they must ever continue, while in this state
                    of dependence, to urge this subject upon the attention of the General Government. The present
                    Administration has taken a stand more favourable to the new states, in relation to the power of
                    Congress <list type="footnotes">

                            confusion might result over whether the mistakes were editorial, authorial, or
                            typographical. Otherwise incorrect and phonetic spellings have been retained as found.
                            Obvious repetition of the same word in the text has been deleted. The spelling of Indian
                            names has followed that in the original text. When names first appear in the text,
                            identification of persons or places has been made in either brackets or footnotes. In cases
                            where geographic locations, acts of Congress, or other types of potentially unclear
                            references are made, bracketed information has been added to clarify the text. These
                            circulars are printed in full, except for deletions made for land bills which Hendricks
                            included in the circulars. For these a summary and citation for each bill have been
                            provided. These circulars are taken from photocopies of the originals.</item>

                    given much effect to their opinions, even to the placing of their veto on bills.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> This question has still to struggle in every movement, against the settled opposition of the
                    great mass of the southern states, and those from the north, who believe that Congress has no
                    constitutional power over the subject.</p>
            <p>The southern states generally deny the power of the General Government to construct roads and canals.
                    They deny all power which is not so plainly laid down in the constitution, as to put at defiance,
                    contradiction, and doubt. Their policy is to make the General Government weak, and the state
                    Governments strong; and this policy seems to be based on the great question of slavery, on which the
                    states are unfortunately separated, by opinions and interests, strong and inflexible. The southern
                    states seem to fear, that if power is admitted to exist in the Government of the Union, that the
                    power of Legislation on the subject of their slaves, will finally be assumed, and that, in this way,
                    the wealth and political condition of the slave-holding states may be totally changed. Their fears
                    are certainly groundless, but they nevertheless exist.</p>
            <p>As much however, if not more, has been done in favor of this great interest of the country, during
                    the present session, as at any previous one. The construction of the Cumberland road between <placeName>

                    Indiana a quantity of land equal to three sections on each side of the Canal, along its whole line,
                    from one end thereof to the other, for the purpose of aiding the state in constructing the Canal.
                    This bill, owing to the pending mass of business, the magnitude of the appropriation which it
                    proposes, and the constitutional question of the power of Congress over the subject of internal
                    improvement, will not become a law during the present session. The partial discussions however,
                    which have taken place in the Senate on the merits of this bill, are by no means discouraging. The
                    objection too, which is based on the want of a survey of the route, will probably be removed before

            <p>The finances of every nation, in every age of the world, have always been, and must ever continue to
                    be, a most important interest. On this depends their prosperity in peace, and their energy in war. A
                    nation great in resources, and having those resources under their own control, are capable of
                    sustaining great emergencies, and of pressing forward in rapid strides of improvement to wealth,
                    intelligence and respectability. The revenues of a nation should be unembarrassed with debt, and
                    equitable in their assessments upon the people. They should be expended with economy, and industry
                    should not be burthened with dispensable contributions upon the people.</p>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    of the public lands. It has always been embarrassed, and the general burdens increased by a national
                    debt. This debt had its origin in the Revolutionary war, a war into which the colonies were plunged
                    without any preparation, and which the condition of the country was unable to furnish the means of
                    carrying on during its progress. A necessity existed to substitute credit for capital, and a
                    national debt was the consequence. The payment of this debt was very properly assumed by the
                    Government after the peace, and it would have tarnished our national character, if so important a

                    reduced to about $43,000,000. The last war added to that sum upwards of
                    $100,000,000, but by every fiscal exertion, based on an unparallelled revenue from the
                    customs, for several years, immediately succeeding the war, it was in October last reduced to about
                    $80,000,000. The revenue is at present in a prosperous condition, and perhaps no other
                    interest is so well calculated to show the vast resources of the country; for it is estimated that
                    this 80,000,000, will be paid in less than ten years, by the ordinary application of the means now
                    in existence, and of the system now in successful operation.</p>
            <p>The current expenditures of the government for the year 1826, including the army, navy, pensions and

                    the principal and interest of the public debt, and the revenue to be received is estimated at
                    twenty-five and a half millions. The tariff which was adopted two years ago, a measure having for
                    its object the protection of our manufactures, and from which so much evil was predicted, has had a
                    beneficial effect. On some articles on which the duties were raised, there has been an increase of
                    importations; and the increase of our exports, is not only evidence of our national prosperity, but
                    is flattering to our national pride. The gross amount of Custom House duties during the last fiscal
                    year, is stated at six millions greater than in any year since the excessive importations of
                    1815-'16.</p>

                    ingredient in the Indian character, still existed against him. He had not been forgiven by the
                    nation, for the part he had taken in their recent wars, however great his apparent influence among
                    them. A large majority of the nation disagreed to the treaty, and shortly after its signature, put
                    him to death. It was impossible that the treaty of the Indian Springs could ever be carried into
                    execution. This was foreseen early last summer, and large deputations of both parties were by the

                            $1.25 per acre by applying the payments previously made. The 1826 statute
                            extended this privilege to 1827; it authorized for one year the redemption of lands subject
                            to foreclosure and already forfeited lands at $1.25 per acre; and it extended a

                    it was presented to the Senate, viewing as I still do, this proposition, to be nothing more than a

                    originated in the House of Representatives about seven years ago, and which finally triumphed by an

                    declared, that they would "regard at any epoch, as a violation of treaties, the

                    be worth more to us than that of all the world besides. Nor can we look with indifference on their
                    political condition. We cannot it is true make common cause with them against <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>. This is not our policy. But there is such a thing as social and fraternal feeling
                    among nations, as well as individuals. It is easier and more agreeable for nations governed by the
                    same description of laws, and the same forms of Government, to keep up friendly and commercial
                    relations, than for nations differing in these respects; and especially as in the present case,
                    where they have passed through the same struggles and conflicts for their liberties. And if there be
                    any political society for us, it must be with the Republics of the south. The Republics of ancient
                    times have long since passed away; they have been overthrown by their own dissentions, or deluged by
                    the wars which have so often agitated Europe. There is now no Grecian republic, no Roman
                    commonwealth, no republican States General of Holland, no national assembly of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. We can associate with republics in no other quarter of the Globe. The present however
                    is an important era in the political history of the World. A greater number of nations are now
                    governed by the elective and representative principles than at any former period of which history
                    gives us any information.</p>
            <p>These friendly feelings however towards the patriots of the south ought not to induce us to change
                    our national policy. This policy is peace, commerce and friendship with all nations, entangling
                    alliances with none. There are many causes of war, which might exist between them and other nations
                    with which I would not interfere.</p>
            <p>I would not go to war in the belligerent struggles between <placeName>

                    Europe against the Republics of the South, unless that combination assumed the attitude of a war
                    against Republican principles. But in that event I would join the coalition of the South American
                    States, I would assume the attitude of a belligerent in the great cause of republics. The civil as
                    well as the military Departments of the Government should be summoned to the occasion. I would put

                    would be worthy of a great effort. It would demand that effort though it should be the last. It
                    would be our own cause as well as that of South America; for a coalition of emperors and kings

            <p>The present session of Congress has so far progressed, and is likely to terminate, without having
                    been employed on many subjects of great importance to the nation at large. More tranquility has
                    existed, and a greater degree of harmony and good feeling has prevailed, than at the last session.
                    It has not, however, been without a sufficient degree of excitement to produce variety and novelty,
                    and to keep all the materials of the political system in healthful activity. The foreign relations
                    of the country have made a less considerable figure, than at the last session. We have, however,

            <p>A Bill has passed the Senate, repealing in part the duty on Salt. It proposes to diminish the duty
                    one-half the present year, and altogether the next. This duty produces a revenue, amounting to near
                    $700,000 per annum; a sum almost as large as that derived to the Government from all the
                    public lands. It is chiefly paid near the seaboard, for nature seems to have furnished the great
                    interior of the country with the means of manufacturing this article. The people on the seaboard
                    procure that article now as cheaply as it can be manufactured in the interior, and the repeal of
                    this duty would materially depress the manufacturers, as well as injure the Treasury.</p>
            <p>The Session, although productive of few measures of national character, has been one of great
                    importance to our State. The treaties concluded on the <placeName>

                    They had extinguished the Indian title to a district of country of great value, in extent about
                    3,000,000 of acres, including the whole valley of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. But these treaties looked in some degree to the Internal Improvement of the State. In
                    the one, provision had been made for a road from <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>, by <placeName>

                    and more than one third of the Senate are opposed to the constitutional power of Congress to
                    construct roads and canals. These treaties were pending in the secret sessions of the Senate till
                    the 23d of January. They are, however, ratified as they were signed, with the exception of one

                    agency of the State in the execution of the grant was taken away. A bill was accordingly reported,
                    authorizing the State to do precisely what the treaty intended it should do. This bill has already

                    January, immediately after the advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of the treaties
                    had been obtained. It proposed to give the State, for canal purposes, six sections in width, along
                    the line of the canal, but was amended before its passage, and grants, by alternate sections, the
                    one half of five sections on each side of the canal; being the one half of ten miles wide, instead
                    of the whole of six miles wide. The grant is liberal, and will, no doubt, if judiciously managed,
                    make the canal. A similar bill was reported to the Senate at the last session; but, at that time,
                    there had been no extinguishment of Indian title—no surveys of the route. The bill,

                    in Indiana. In this request, the <placeName>

                    </placeName> canal, the White Water canal, and an union by canals of the waters of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> with <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>, were named. An Engineer was accordingly
                    detailed; but owing to the sickness of the hands, and the death of the Engineer, the work was
                    retarded early in the season, and is not yet completed. The Secretary of War will again be requested
                    to direct the continuation and completion of these surveys the ensuing season. Such progress,
                    however, had been made in the survey of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> canal, as to determine its practicability. It is ascertained that the summit level

                    </placeName>'s will supply this summit with a sufficiency of water. The ascertainment of
                    these facts have been of great utility in the passage of the canal bill through the Senate, and will
                    forever put to rest all doubts about the practicality of the work.</p>

            <p>A bill has been reported to the House of Representatives, but at too late a period to become a law,

            <p>The bill to graduate the price of public lands is yet among the orders of the day, and has not been
                    finally acted on by either House. Nor is there any probability that it will become a law in any
                    shape, during the present session. It proposes a great change in the land system of our country, and
                    presents a fit occasion for an attempt, at least, to make that change valuable to the new States. It
                    has long been my opinion, that the public lands, of right, belong to the States in which they lie;
                    that the new States are unjustly deprived of their public domain, by the compacts with the Federal
                        Government,<hi rend="sup">26</hi> which ought never to have been entered into; and that this,
                    being an unnatural state of things, cannot last.</p>
            <p>Impressed with this belief, and unwilling that the occasion should be lost, when this bill received
                    the partial consideration of the Senate early in January, I proposed, in the form of an amendment,
                        <hi rend="i">that the public and unappropriated lands, within the limits of the new States,

                            the Union the state agreed to a compact providing that public land located in the state
                            remained the property of Congress and would be exempt from state taxation while public and
                            for five years after passing into private hands. In return Indiana received some salt
                            springs; land grants for education and for the seat of government; and five percent of the
                            net proceeds from the sale of public lands in Indiana after December 1, 1816, for building
                            roads and canals. Three fifths of this money was to be spent by the legislature to improve
                            transportation within the state; two fifths was to be spent by Congress to build roads to
                            the state. See <hi rend="i">Annals of Congress</hi>, 14 Cong., 1 Sess., Appendix

                    arrived when it should be made. Whatever the fate of this proposition may be, there can be little
                    doubt of its justice and expediency, both in reference to the new States, and to the Union. Of its
                    success in any short period of time, no one ought to be sanguine. The new states have as yet no
                    controlling influence or numbers in the councils of the nation. In submitting this proposition I
                    have discharged in part, a duty to the State; a duty which will demand my un-remitted exertions,
                    while any reasonable prospect of its success shall remain. The new states were guarantied admission
                    into the Union, "on an equal footing with the original states, in all respects
                    whatever;" &amp; it is in vain to pretend that this <hi rend="i">equality</hi> exists,
                    while they are deprived of their public lands; while in seventeen States, the waste and
                    unappropriated lands belong to the States, and in seven States these lands belong to the Federal
                    Government. It is mockery to tell the new States that they are equal in sovereignty to the old
                    States, while they are deprived of the first object of sovereignty: their public domain. The day

            <p>Of the Congress of Panama, which excited so much attention during the last session, and to which it
                    was determined to send ministers, but little as yet is known. Its organization did not take place
                    till the 15th of June last, and the time and place were alike unpropitious for the meeting. One of

                    was the season, before Congress had determined on the mission, and passed the necessary

            <p>Another speck of War has recently appeared in Europe. The Emperor of the Brazils, who had fallen heir

                    that kingdom, in favor of the present Queen; and, as a last testimonial of his affection for the
                    Portuguese nation, had given them a Constitution similar to that which had recently existed in <placeName>

            <p>S<hi rend="sc">IR</hi>:</p>
            <p>The present session, greatly protracted as it has been, and largely participating in the political
                    struggle of the time, is about coming to a close. Though much of its time has been spent in useless
                    debate, it has been engaged in, perhaps as many subjects of national importance, as any other since
                    the close of the late war.</p>
            <p>The tariff, a subject of deep interest to the different sections of the country, has occupied its
                    time, and distracted its counsels, more than any other. This subject, which had attracted much
                    public attention for the last year, was early presented to both Houses by petitions, memorials and
                    resolutions, from almost every city and village from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>. Those of the northern, middle and western states, were almost unanimously in favour of
                    increased duties on importations of foreign goods, whilst those of the Southern states, were perhaps
                    more nearly unanimous in opposition to this policy. It has been the complaint of the friends of
                    domestic manufactures, that this interest has, during the present session, been partially at least,
                    in the hands of its enemies, and deeply affected by the political question, which unfortunately
                    divides and distracts the body politic.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> It was said, that a majority of the
                    committee on manufactures, if not altogether opposed to a tariff, were at least lukewarm towards the
                    measure. Whatever the fact may have been, the offspring of their deliberations, after unusual delay
                    in the collection of testimony under authority of the House, was a bill, which seemed to please no
                    one, and which, if not framed for that purpose, was calculated to produce its own destruction, by
                    being offensive to all. This bill however, after passing the House of Representatives, was much
                    amended in the Senate, and has at length become a law.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

            <p>A country extensive and populous as ours is, and so abundant in resourses [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>],
                    covering almost every degree of latitude in the temperate zone, is well prepared to put its domestic
                    commerce in place of foreign traffic, and to put the balance of foreign trade largely in our favour,
                    instead of being as at present, greatly against us. That is a bad policy which operates as a
                    perpetual drain of the circulating medium from any country.—Wherever this state of things
                    exists, the policy of the country must be radically wrong, and must, if persevered in, ultimate in
                    destruction.</p>
            <p>Another law for the relief of purchasers of the public lands, has passed during the present session.
                    It is no doubt intended to close the old credit system, and to terminate the relief measures, and it
                    is greatly to be desired, that all interested should avail themselves of its advantages. It may be
                    very difficult, if not impracticable, to procure the passage of any subsequent law on this subject.
                    A copy of the act will no doubt be acceptable. It is as follows:<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A bill has again passed the Senate, giving under certain restrictions, preemption rights to those who
                    have relinquished lands under the provisions of the several acts for the relief of purchasers of
                    public lands, and authorizing such persons to purchase the same at private sale at a fixed price.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A law has passed authorizing the re-payment of forfeited monies to purchasers of the public lands, as
                    well in case where the one twentieth part of the purchase money was deposited in advance, as in
                    cases of entire instalments. For this purpose certificates are to be issued by the Registers of the
                    Land Offices where the payments were made, in favour of those entitled to receive, and these
                    certificates are receivable as cash in all land payments.</p>
            <p>The future disposition of the public lands in the new states, is a subject of much embarrassment.
                    This question has in various forms occupied the time of the present session, without producing any
                    practical result whatever. The bill to graduate their price, and to cede the refuse to the several
                    states in which they lie, was finally negatived in the Senate, and the question is at rest for the
                    present session. The recent discussions however, of the various land propositions, will in all
                    probability put the whole subject fully before the <list type="footnotes">

                    will not permit it to sleep, but which will promise at a future day, some change beneficial to the
                    new states.</p>
            <p>The course I have taken on this subject, is probably known to all. It has long been my opinion, that
                    the public lands of right belong to the several states in which they lie, and that but for the
                    compacts entered into with the federal government, previous to their admission into the Union, they
                    might constitutionally have taken possession of them, in virtue of state sovereignty, and their
                    equality with the original states. In accordance with this opinion, I did at the present session, as
                    I had done at the last, propose a direct cession of these lands to the states in which they lie;
                    giving to the new states, <hi rend="i">unconditionally</hi>, all the public lands to which the
                    Indian title is extinguished, and that subject to the Indian title, on condition of extinguishing
                    that title at their own expense; an expense averaging heretofore from two to five cents per acre.
                    This proposition was on the table of the Senate the greater part of the last session, but no
                    opportunity was afforded for its discussion until the present session; and the bill to graduate the
                    price of the public lands to which it was offered as an amendment, although reported for five
                    successive years, never met the final consideration of the Senate, until a few weeks ago.</p>
            <p>The public lands, especially of every new state, are the primary interest of that state, and reason
                    as well as justice would surely say, that based as our institutions are, on the public will, that
                    public will should control that interest. The Legislatures of the new states are, in my opinion,
                    much better qualified to make proper disposition of the public lands, than is the Congress of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. They are better acquainted with the condition of the people, their wants and their
                    wishes. The states would better know how to graduate, and when to give pre-emption rights and
                    donations to actual settlers. Under the auspices of the State Legislatures the lands of inferior
                    quality, would be given to actual settlers who might be unable to purchase, and prosperous and
                    compact settlements would be formed, in districts of country, which under the present system are
                    almost wholly neglected.</p>
            <p>The bill to graduate which had been long before the Senate, and had from various circumstances
                    excited a considerable interest in its favour, was all that had prospects of success at the present
                    session, and of course the proposition <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-071-2-057"/> above referred to, was
                    not pressed to a final decision; no vote was taken on it. The bill to graduate proposed to cede to
                    the states such lands as could neither be sold in a given time for twenty five cents per acre, nor
                    given away to [a]ctual settlers; but this section was stricken out, and the bill as amended and
                    finally voted upon, proposed a graduation of prices down to twenty five cents per acre, falling
                    every two years twenty-five cents; &amp; selling at prices somewhat reduced, to actual settlers
                    one quarter section each. I voted for the bill and was anxious that it should pass, as the best that
                    could at the present be done, and as a step towards my own proposition, to which I have little doubt
                    the matter must ultimately come. The graduation bill was rejected by a vote of 21 to 25 in the
                    Senate. Two Senators were absent who would in all probability have increased the majority against
                    it.</p>
            <p>The condition of the public lands in the new states, is one which cannot last. Equality with the
                    original states, was guarantied to them on their admission into the Union, and their inequality is
                    too grossly manifest, to be unobserved by an intelligent people. It is not satisfactory to be told,
                    that many of the old states had no public lands at their disposal, those lands having passed from
                    the British crown to individuals before the revolution; for such states, though they may not have
                    had the primary disposal of the soil have always had the power over it in the form of taxation. The
                    sovereignty and Independence of a state, is indeed better consulted, by the soil being in the hands
                    of patriotic industrious citizens, than in the hands of its own Government; but the people are mere
                    tenants, whose soil is neither in their own hands, nor that of their Legislature; and the Government
                    is any thing else than independent, whose soil is owned by, subject to the jurisdiction and at the
                    disposal of any other Legislature than its own. A respectful and persevering assertion of our right
                    to the public soil, as incident to the sovereignty and equality of the states, is in my opinion, the
                    attitude the new states should assume on this subject. While divided among themselves they cannot
                    expect success. Any thing short of this attitude, acknowledges inferiority and independence
                    [dependence]. So doubtful at least is the argument of constitutional power in the federal
                    Government, to hold the lands within the limits of the states, that the compacts with the new
                    states, not to interfere with the primary disposal of the soil, and not <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-071-2-058"/> to tax the public lands, seem to be chiefly relied on; as if power
                    could be acquired by compact, which was not given by the constitution, and as if compacts made by
                    60,000 people before they were admitted into the Union, could equitably be binding in all future
                    time upon millions.</p>
            <p>The present condition of the public lands must forever keep the new states, not only dependent on the
                    federal Government; but absolutely poor. By the operation of the land offices, the country is
                    drained almost of its last dollar, and this must continue as long as the public lands belong to the
                    Union. It is a singular fact, that on the seaboard, in the commercial cities there has been for
                    years past, a redundancy of capital. It has been seeking investment, at four and a half and five per
                    cent, while in the North Western states there is scarcely any circulating medium at all.</p>

                    that in actual service, would, in the opinion of many military men, be insufficient for the
                    necessary purposes of the Government even in time of peace. I voted however for the reduction of the
                    army in 1821, to its present establishment, and was then, as I still am of opinion, that it might
                    have been further reduced.</p>
            <p>The whole Naval force of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> authorized by law previous to the 3d of March, 1827, consisted of 12 ships of the line,
                    exclusive of 2 on <geogName>Lake Ontario</geogName>, 1 frigates of the first class, 3 of the second
                    class, 16 Sloops of War, 4 Schooners and three other vessels. Some of these are yet on the stocks,
                    but this whole force is in condition, to be put into active service in a short period of time,
                    should [t]he exigencies of the country so require. By act of the 3d of March, 1827, a further
                    appropriation of $500,000 per annum for six years for the gradual increase of the Navy
                    was made, and under this act, timber has been procured, for the construction of 5 ships of the line
                    five frigates and five Sloops of war.</p>
            <p>Of the vessels of the Navy there are now in commission, one ship of the line, 3 frigates of the first
                    class, 2 of the second class, 10 sloops of war and 4 schooners. These are stationed in squadrons in
                    the Mediterranean, the Brasils, the West Indies and the Pacific, for the protection of our commerce,
                    which the enterprize of our citizens has carried into every ocean and every sea.</p>
            <p>The war between Buenos Ayres and the Brasils, and the protracted contest between the Republics of the
                    South and Old <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>, have been fruitful sources of piracies, and have largely contributed to the necessity
                    of our armaments on the coasts of South America and the West Indies, and the lawless and sanguinary
                    struggle between the Greeks and the Turks, has produced the like necessity, for an imposing squadron
                    in the Mediterranean, for the supression of piracy and the protection of our commerce there.</p>
            <p>The foreign relations of our country are as tranquil as at any period since the late war. Questions
                    how ever of some embarrassment exist, in relation to boundary, between the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and Great Britain, on our North Eastern and <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-071-2-060"/> North
                    Western coasts. To attempt a history of these disputed points, would be too long for this letter.
                    Suffice it to say, that difficulties heretofore insurmountable have prevented the designation of our
                    North Eastern boundary between the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the British provinces, and the progress of settlements on both sides, have led to
                    collisions of an unpleasant character[.] The State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> has been considerably agitated, on account of the violation of her Territory and the
                    mal-treatment o[f] her citizens by British Subjects. The same difficulty of boundary ex[i]s[ts]
                    Westward of the <geogName>Rocky Mountains</geogName>[.] On this subject a temporary compromise was
                    effected by convention of 1818. Which expires by its own limitation in ten years from its date. By
                    this convention it was agreed that no exclusive jurisdiction should be exercised by either party;
                    but that the citiz[ens] of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and the subjec[ts] of Great Britain, should have equal rights on the disputed
                    Territory. The convention has been renewed for an indefinite period of time, which how ever may be
                    terminated, by either giving twelve months previous notice to the other party. This question of
                    boundary heretofore has been, as at present it is, the basis of unyielding objections on the part of
                    many members, to the proposed occupation of the mouth of the <geogName>Columbia river</geogName>, a
                    measure not likely to be adopted, until all questions of boundary in that quarter be settled. The
                    session will terminate on the 26th of the present month.</p>

            <p>The financial affairs of the nation, are at this time, as they have been for years past, in a most
                    prosperous condition. During the last four years, there has beon [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] paid on
                    account of the national debt, $45,303,642 26, and should the same fiscal prosperity be
                    continued to us which has existed the last year, the debt will in effect, be entirely extinguished
                    in little more than four years. The whole remaining debt, exclusive of the Bank stock item of
                    $7,000,000, was, on the first of January last, $51,362,135 78, and of this the
                    13,000, 000 dollars of the old Revolutionary three per cents, will probably be redeemed much below
                    par; so that the actual debt now existing, is little more than the amount paid in the last four
                    years; and the best wish, the warmest friend of President Jackson can feel or utter, is, that his
                    administration may extinguish the debt, during the presidential term for which he is elected. This
                    would be a civic wreath, no less durable, than the laurels that already encircle his brow. Then will
                    the public lands in the new states be released from the heavy weight of the national debt, and their
                    pledge to that object, which has heretofore set like an incubus on the new states, will cease to
                    exist. Then it will be in the power of the General Government to diminish the public revenue from

                    current expenditures including internal improvements, and this amount can be so imposed, as
                    sufficiently to protect the primary manufactures of the country. The high duties at present imposed
                    on articles not manufactured at home, may then be totally abolished. The burdens on the shipping and
                    the commerce of the northern states, and on the agriculture of the south, may then be lessened, if
                    not entirely removed; and then, nothing deserving the name of excuse, will remain, to justify
                    Congress, in refusing to acknowledge the sovereignty of the new states, in and over their
                    unappropriated lands.</p>
            <p>The subject of public lands is one of much embarrassment even at the present day: nor is that
                    embarrassment likely to be diminished; while the title and disposition of them, remains in the hands
                    of the Federal Government. A large portion of the time of Congress is already employed, in
                    legislating on this subject for the new states under the present system, and for many years past,
                    have the tables of both Houses, been burdened with propositions looking to a change of system. Among
                    these propositions, that of graduating the price according to the quality, has been presented to the
                    Senate for the last six years. The graduation bill has been frequently discussed in the Senate, and
                    was, at the previous session pressed to a decision of that body. The result was unfavorable. The
                    members from the new states seem less inclined than heretofore to press this bill, and more
                    inclined, to assert <hi rend="sc">THE</hi>

            <p>Resolutions asserting in the strongest terms, the rights of the new states to the unappropriated
                    lands within their limits, have, during the present session, been received from the legislatures of

            <p>By a recent treaty with the Potawatamie Indians, held at the big St. Joiephs, in September last,
                    their title to a tract of country, of considerable extent in Indiana, was extinguished. It includes
                    the country watered by the Elk Heart and other tributaries of the St. Josephs, and is supposed to be
                    in extent about one million of acres. This treaty has been ratified. An appropriation for its survey
                    is made, and some of these lands will no doubt be brought into market the ensuing year. It is said
                    to be a delightful region of country and that the tide of emigration to it has already set in.</p>
            <p>A bill authorising the occupancy of the mouth of the <geogName>Oregon</geogName> or
                        <geogName>Columbia river</geogName>, gave rise to considerable debate in the House of
                    Representatives. It was supported as a measure necessary for the protection of the fur trade, for
                    the prevention of British encroachments south of the line, and as a measure necessary to ensure us a
                    fair participation in the commerce of the South Sea. It was resisted as a measure likely to produce
                    collisions with the British and Indians in that quarter; on account of the worthlessness of the
                    country, compared with the expenditure necessary for keeping up an establishment there, and on
                    account of the bad policy of settling a colony, or establishing a territory, requiring protection at
                    so great a distance; but above all, on account of the delicate nature of the unsettled question of
                    boundary westward of the <geogName>Rocky mountains</geogName>. It was negatived in the House of
                    Representatives where it originated. A bill for the establishment of a Territorial government west

                    a strong squadron in the Mediterranean, for the protection of our commerce, and the suppression of
                    piracy there; but this, [i]ndependent of the wars of the Grand Seignor, would in all probability
                    have been necessary, to protect our commerce against the pirates which continually infest those
                    seas.</p>
            <p>The war between the Turks and the Greeks, probably owing more to the destruction of the Turkish fleet

               <hi rend="i">Dear Sir</hi>: Heretofore, it has been my practice, at the close of every session, to
                    address, a letter to the people of the State. This has been done, as on the present occasion, with
                    the view of communicating a short history of the most important business of the session. It is my
                    purpose to give this letter a general circulation, and I hope to succeed in sending it into every
                    settlement and neighborhood of the State, that every citizen who may think worth while, to hear or
                    examine its contents, may have an opportunity of so doing.</p>
            <p>It is often pleasant to take a retrospect of by-gone days, and in political affairs, as well as every
                    thing else, prosperity is well calculated to please. In no portion of our political history since
                    the close of the revolution, is this retrospect more agreeable, than in that which has transpired
                    since the close of the late war. During the whole period of that war; a war of brilliant
                    achievements on the land, the ocean and the lakes, Indiana, though not a borderer of the principal
                    enemy, was a frontier State, and suffered much from the hordes of savages on her northern frontier.
                    In many places the settlements had extended but a short distance from the <geogName>Ohio
                    river</geogName>; and pickets, block-houses, and forts, were to be seen, as the nucleus of every

                    forest; yet panic and consternation prevaded [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] the settlements. Many
                    settlements were entirely broken up, and the Territory, no doubt for some time after, diminished in
                    population. This state of things however, was not of long duration, for in 1815, a census was taken
                    with a view to a state government, and the population was found to be upwards of 60,900. In 1820, it
                    was upwards of 147,000, and in 1830, there is good reason to expect, it will approach 400,000.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

            <p>In June, 1816, the convention met, and the Constitution was formed, and in the December following,
                    Indiana was admitted into the Union. Since that period, the Indian title has been extinguished to 7
                    millions of acres, much of which has been brought into market, and such has been our natural
                    advantages, the salubrity of our climate, the fertility of our soil, and the great value of our
                    navigable rivers, that a tide of emigration has rolled in upon us, probably unknown to any other
                    portion of the Union.</p>
            <p>Since that period too, some of the primary interests of the country have experienced much change. The
                    price of the public lands has been reduced, and a system of internal improvements created, of
                    incalculable advantage to the Union, and especially to the Western States. In 1820, the price was
                    reduced from two dollars per acre to one dollar and twenty five cents, and the credit
                    repealed.—Th[us the] relation of debtor and creditor bet [ween the] government and the
                    citizens, was prospectively done away[.] The debt had already swollen to more than
                    $22,000,000. It had become alarming; and in 1821, the relief system was adopted[.] Time
                    was given from two to eight years, according to the various classes, for the payment of this debt. A
                    deduction of 37$ per cent was allowed on cash payments, and a relinquishment of lands at
                    their original prices was also authorized. Various amendatory laws have since been enacted in
                    pursuance of this system, until the debt is chiefly extinguished. For the cases which yet remain,
                    another law has been enacted during the present <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>A bill has passed the Senate reducing the price of lands which have been in market since the 30th day
                    of June, 1827, to one dollar per acre; and in favor of actual settlers, on one quarter of section
                    each, to seventy-five cents per acre. This, should it become a law, will give accellerated motion to
                    the settlement of the new States; will give great advantages, beyond what has ever been given before
                    to actual settlers, and will put the public lands more than heretofore, within the means and power
                    of the poor. Bills to vest in the State of Indiana certain lands whithin [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] the

            </p>
            <p>A bill has passed the Senate granting townships of land, in aid of seminaries of learning, for
                    education of the deaf and dumb, to such States as have not heretofore received them.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Those granted to the old States are to be selected in the territories: those to the new
                    States, within the new States. If, fortunately for our State, no such seminary shall be found
                    necessary, the assent of Congress will be readily obtained, for its application to other objects of
                    education[.] The township [f]or Indiana, and none other, will be selected in our state.</p>
            <p>On the subject of the public lands generally, my opinion is well known, and remains unchanged. I
                    believe that they constitutionally, and of right, belong to the several states in which they lie,
                    and that this disposition of them, is not only reasonable and just towards the new states, but
                    essentially necessary to the Union. They are a bone of contention in the councils of the nation. The
                    old states cling to them in the spirit of colonial monopoly a[n]d power, and the new states are
                    contending for them as a necessary appendage of their <list type="footnotes">

                            Hendricks but is here omitted. The first section of this statute offered three alternatives
                            to purchasers who had accepted extended credit under earlier relief laws but whose lands had
                            later reverted to the government for nonpayment. Prior to January 1, 1831, they could draw
                            scrip, receivable for the purchase of certain other lands, in the amount actually paid for
                            the relinquished land. Until July 4, 1831, they could either retain the land under the right
                            of preemption by paying the current minimum price of $1.25 per acre or make the
                            remaining payments at the same rate.</item>

                    require that they should not be held by the Federal Government; for in the hands of the Union, they
                    are the apple of discord among the states. The resolution of Mr. Foot, of which the public lands
                    happened to be the subject, and which has been the basis of a protracted discussion, is not to be
                        regretted.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> It has shewn, and will shew to the American people, more
                    clearly than any thing which has gone before it, the inexpediency af [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] the
                    present coudition [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] of the public lands. It shews how little the
                    representatives of the old states know about the new states, and how incompetent they are to manage
                    the public lands. That resolution indirectly assumes the ground, that the public surveys ought not
                    to be extended, till all the surveyed lands shall be sold. It will not be adopted. The discussion
                    which it has elicited, is fortunate for the new states. It will spread the question more broadly
                    before the people, and shew to Congress more and more the difficulty and impropriety of conti[n]uing
                    to legislate on the subject. Such too will be the fate in the House of Representatives, of the wild
                    scheme, of distributing their proceeds among the several states, according to the present
                    representation. This is very much like the proposition, strenuously advocated in Congress, some 8 or
                    10 years ago, of giving to the old states school lands, equivalent to that given to the new states.</p>

                    Department, developing the natural advantages of the country, and designating national works of
                    internal improvement. Under these appropriations, the route of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> canal has already been designated, and other surveys made; one to test the

                    those of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, and a survey is contemplated, the present year, to test the practicability, of uniting

                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> with the western branch of <geogName>White river</geogName>.</p>
            <p>The value of internal improvements, to a country like ours, so large in geographical extent, cannot
                    at once be calculated or seen. Good roads and canals, uniting by cheap and speedy communications,
                    distant points of the union, are more valuable to its permanency, than all the fortifications which
                    can be placed on the seaboard or inland frontier. Such too, is the position of Indiana in the Union,
                    that she must necessarily be as much advantaged by works of this description, as any other State. We
                    have the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> forming the southern boundary [o]f the State, the
                    navigation of which, has of late, been greatly improved. The Cumberland road is already located
                    through the centre of the State. A road from the Atlantic seaboard to the upper Mississ[i]ppi, which
                    will at no distant day be one of great importance must necessarily pass through the northern portion
                    of our Stateline of water communication, the two greatest cities of the union, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and two of the largest rivers on the contiment [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>], and of the
                    world, the Mississ[i]ppi and the St. Lawrence. This is a work pre-eminently national in its
                    character, and one which the Federal Government ought to accomplish itself. This however can better
                    be done by the States, through the aid of the General Government, and that aid has already been
                    liberally given to the State of Indiana, in the grant of lands for that purpose, authorised by the
                    act of March, 1827. This grant judiciously managed, will no doubt go far towards completing the
                    work; but if it should fail to a greater extent than the State of Indiand [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]
                    shall be able to sup[p]ly, it cannot be, that the government of the Union will hesitate in making
                    further appropriations for the completion of this great national work. To this the Federal
                    Government may be considered as pledged, as early as the year 1787, by the "articles of
                    compact, between the <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-071-2-071"/> original States, and the people and

            <p>A bill has been reported, but will not probably become a law during the present session, giving to

                    mind. Not so with the Indian question in the south. On this subject, much of the benevolence of the
                    country is excited, in a misapprehension of the policy of the Government towards the Indians. But
                    nothing coercive on the subject of their removal, has, on the part of the Government, ever been
                    proposed; and the proposition now before Congress, is an exchange of the country where they now

                    to them protection in their new residence against the hostilities of other tribes.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> All this is submitted to their free acc[e]ptance or refusal. It is believed that they

                    bloodshed have taken place between them and the whites. They cannot for many generations to come, be
                    amalgamated with the whites. They have not adopted, to any considerable degree, the employments of
                    agriculture; their game is destroyed, and they cannot live by the chase. Humanity requires that
                    their condition should be changed, and it is believed that this is the opinion of many of
                    themselves. Already have a large number of the Cherokees removed to the west of the <placeName>

                    been undeviatingly followed ever since. It is the policy of settling them west of the organized
                    States and Territories; assigning to each tribe a separate district of country, giving them a
                    permanent title to it, and protecting them against wars among themselves, as well as encroachments

                    attract public attention to it throughout the union. Other considerations too, came in aid of its
                    own importance, to give it, magnitude before the American People.</p>
            <p>The feelings of some portions of the south in reference to the judicial power of [t]he <placeName>

                    this subject an air of importance, both here and els[e] where, which in other times would not have
                    been seen or felt. This impeachment, terminated, as is generally known, in the acquittal of the
                    Judge, and the proposition to repeal was promptly met in the house of representatives, and the bill
                    rejected on the second reading by a vote of nearly three to one.</p>
            <p>The financial affairs of the federal government are, as they have been for many years past, in a
                    flourishing condition. The whole public debt of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, amounted, on the first of January last, to $39,123,191 68, and the
                    operation of the sinking fund is rapidly diminishing it. Payments amounting from ten to twelve
                    millions are annually made on the principal and interest of the debt, and it requires no financier
                    to determine that in a very few years, the revenue remaining as it is, it must totally disappear.
                    But the anti-tariff spirit which is always in motion, would constantly be employed in modifying, if
                    it would not entirely destroy this ample source of revenue. To show every one its importance, it
                    will be sufficient to state, that the receipts from all sources into the treasury during the year
                    1829 amounted to $24,827,627 38, and of this sum, the customs, or in other words, the
                    Tariff upon imported goods, produced $22,681,965 81; the sales of the public lands, in
                    all the new states and territories, about a million and a half; the State of Indiana paying nearly
                    one third of that amount.</p>
            <p>From this view of the case it is obvious, that when the debt shall be paid, we shall have a large

                    Improvement, for a distribution of these surplus revenues among the states. This plan, viewed at a
                    distance, is quite plausible. Its inducements may be many, but its difficulties will be great, and
                    it will at all events be better to adhere to the old system, from which much good has been realized
                    till we get another ready for adoption. The new system has been broached in the hope, that it will
                    do away much of the constitutional objection to roads and canals, against which the present mode of
                    appropriation has been struggling for years. But if the distribution scheme be liable to the same
                    objection and will require an amendment to the constitution before it can be adopted, we may bid
                    farewell to all hopes resting on that basis. That it will require such amendment of the
                    constitution, is the opinion very generally of those who oppose the present mode on constitutional
                    grounds. A small sum, compared with the ample means of the Union, would lay the foundation of a
                    system which would keep itself in activity, and progress with works of incalculable benefit to the
                    country. Let, for instance, $10,000,000 be embarked, and judiciously expended, in aid of
                    companies formed in the states, in works of primary importance; works which will, with all
                    reasonable certainty, in a short time after their completion, place their stock at and above its par
                    value; and when this shall take place, sell out the government shares, or make new investments in
                    other similar works. This is the view of the subject which I have had for years past. The U. States
                    have stock in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> and Chesepeak canal; this canal has already realized beyond the most sanguine
                    expectations of its friends, large dividends to the stockholders; its stock is now but little below
                    par, and is fast on the rise. When it shall get to par, sell it and make another judicious
                    investment of the capital. So with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> stock, in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> &amp; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                    </placeName> canal; when it rises to par sell it and invest it elsewher[e], so in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> canal. It is easy to see that the still and silent operation of a capital which might
                    gradually be invested, withot[sic] being felt by the Treasury, would have a magic power in the

            <p>An objection to the distribution scheme is that on the basis of representation the new States which
                    will need most will get least. But the greatest danger of all is, that the revenues of the country
                    will be so modified that there will be nothing to distribute. <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-071-2-078"/>

            <p>The great Indian question of the South may be considered at rest. The ratification of the Choctaw
                    treaty leaves little with which to keep up public excitement. The tribes of the South, strange as
                    the statement may appear, have for years been transferring themselves of their own accord, West of
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, and the tribe just named, has since the formation of the treaty last summer been
                    removing in great numbers. It is believed that of the Choctaws, say 17,000 about 5,000 have already
                    gone, and a large portion of the residue have since been making preparations to go. The treaty with
                    them is very liberal, and in other times would no doubt have been objected to, on account of its
                    weight upon the treasury. Individual reservations are guarantied to those who choose to stay, and
                    ample provision is made for those who wish to go. A treaty with the Chickasaws has also been entered
                    into, but has not yet been submitted to the senate. It is based on the condition, that exploring
                    parties of that tribe delegated to examine the country proposed to be given in exchange, shall
                    favorably report[.] These two tribes will soon settle themselves west of the <placeName>

                    years back, and the Cherokees, the only remaining tribe in the southern states, have also been going
                    westwardly for some time past.</p>

                    in all the necessaries of life, and near the fare-famed salt region of the west. The Cherokees are
                    supposed to be in number about 15,000 [15,600?], and the general condition of those west, is said to

            <p>The law of last session for the removal of the Indians, when they should be willing to go, has been
                    liberally censured, as well as those who sustained it. And altho' it only appropriated half
                    a million, it has been so often associated with wild calculations, that thousands have no doubt
                    received the impression, that it contained the appalling sum of more than twenty millions. Our own
                    legislature had frequently approved the policy of the government, in the Indian removal question,
                    but this was either denied, or admitted to refer to their removal, on principles totally different
                    from those of the act spoken of.</p>
            <p>In the memorial of the [Indiana] general assembly of February, 1830, just one year ago, there is the
                    following language.</p>
            <p>"To endeavor to avert from the Potawatomies and Miamies, the fate which has attended many of
                    their kindred tribes, is a duty sanctioned by a regard for the national reputation, and by every
                    humane and philynthropic consideration.</p>
            <p>"As the best means of accomplishing so desirable a result and securing the happiness of the
                    aboriginal race, your memorialists respectfully and earnestly urge the adoption of measures to
                    induce the Indians within this state to abandon from choice those narrow forests where they now
                    acquire but a precarious and scanty subsistance, and to emigrate to the country West of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, which is much better adapted to their wants and to their habits.</p>
            <p>"The benevolent and patriotic views and recommendations of the President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> on this subject, of which they tender their cordial approbation, render it unnecessary
                    for your memorialists to offer arguments in detail."</p>
            <p>It has been a fit subject for political excitement in which politicians led the van, while an array
                    of the best men and the best feeling followed in the rear. That excitement is indeed dying away, but
                    so great is it still, that our tables have <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-071-2-080"/> been loaded with
                    petitions and remonstrances, protesting against the law, and requesting its repeal, denouncing the
                    treaty and petitioning the senate that it might not be ratified; when if this law had been repealed
                    and the treaty rejected, starvation inevitably awaited the Indians. So general has been the wish,
                    and so loudly expressed on the part of this tribe, that the treaty should be ratified, that party
                    feeling in a great measure gave away, and the journals of the senate, shew but twelve votes in the
                    negative. Humanity demanded the ratification and will rejoice at the result, if the laws of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> and some of the other states are cruel towards the Indians, then surely any legislative
                    provision which enables them to get away from those laws, and which make their condition better than
                    ever it was before, must meet the approbation of all.</p>
            <p>The law of last Session has been censured, as having for its object a total change of our policy
                    towards the Indians; as authorizing individual contracts with them instead of treaties, through
                    their authorized chiefs; contracts which were not to be submitted to the senate for ratification,
                    and to any amount, however enormous, beyond the appropriation. Those who voted for the law have been
                    arrainged [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] before the American people for these unheard of exertions of
                    legislative power, and of cruelties towards the Indians. They could only say that nothing of the
                    kind was intended or authorized, and that nothing of the kind would be done. The occasion has passed
                    by. The Cherokees have refused to treat and the law is to them a dead letter. The Choctaws have
                    treated and the treaty has been submitted to the senate, for the sanction of that body. Instead of
                    an expenditure of 24,000,000, the appropriation of half a million is only in part expended.</p>
            <p>These things being so, the conclusion is not to be resisted, that false alarms have been sounded, and
                    that the people have been directed. I have charged [changed] no opinion for the last ten years on
                    the Indiana [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] question [.] I voted for the law of last session, and every
                    subsequent reflection justifies the deed. I do not approve of the legislation of the southern states
                    on this subject; but a difficulty now exists, and it seems better to settle the difficulty, by the
                    removal of the Indians, with their consent, than by arraying the power of the federal government
                    against that of the states.—It is said that the president has power to protect the <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-071-2-081"/> Indians in the rights secured to them by treaties. Grant this:
                    but whenever the laws of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> have to be enforced, at the same time, in several of the states by the military arm of
                    the government, then farewell to the Union. This is a crisis which has never arisen in the
                    government. When it shall come, it may emphatically be said that the days of the republic are
                    numbered.</p>
            <p>On land subjects, very little will have been done the present session. The bill to reduce the price

                    not yet been finally acted on by the house and again is before the senate. Another relief law has

                        improper.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Of course nothing of favor, or the want of it, towards the bank,

                            who had bought land on credit for less than fourteen dollars per acre, had received extended
                            credit under earlier relief laws, and yet had lost that land qualified for a clear title if
                            the previous payments amounted to $1.25 per acre; if the payments did not amount
                            to $1.25 per acre, purchasers had the right of preemption until July 4, 1831, by
                            paying the difference. Occupants of relinquished land as described above were given until
                            July 4, 1831, the right of preemption for up to two quarter sections in contiguous tracts.
                            This statute also permitted the original buyer of town property to complete his purchase by

                    memories extended far back into the period covered. This material first appeared in the <hi rend="i">English Department News Letter</hi> at the time William Riley Parker was chairman. Parker
                    revealed both a streak of sentimentality, and an even stronger sense of the importance of a history
                    as a practical departmental tool. He felt that these essays would also fulfill the Department of
                    English's obligations to Indiana University in celebrating its sesquicentennial. Arranged
                    principally in chronological order, the chapters, though prepared by different individuals, give a
                    rather good continuity to the story. In case of the briefer essays there is a chronological
                    overlapping.</p>
            <p>The much beloved and highly respected teacher Frank Davidson wrote of those somewhat vague years when
                    English and literature were pulling away from the historic "stump" of rhetoric and
                    the classics at Indiana, and when the university was taking a highly formative step. As in all
                    American universities, 1868–1900, this separation was not without its traumatic moments
                    or bleeding wounds. Under the stirring <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> regime with its broadening of the university curriculum, introduction of electives, and
                    a higher degree of departmentilization, Indiana University developed an unusually good Department of
                    English. Orrin Benner Clark, George W. Saunderson, Charles H. Gilbert, George Washington Hoss, and
                    others were worthy pioneers. They were able to add many cubits to the teaching of the English
                    language and the literature it had produced. Beyond this some of these men played active roles in
                    liberalizing the entire university curriculum.</p>
            <p>In his essay covering the decades 1893–1920 Professor Donald J. Gray deals with a
                    strategic era of expansion in both the Department of English and the university. In these years both
                    struggled to reform themselves into much more significant institutions. Between the departure of
                    David Starr Jordan and the emergence of William Lowe Bryan as a dominant force in the university,
                    the departments undertook <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-071-2-084"/> to establish themselves as forces in
                    the general educational process. To this end Martin Wright Sampson, as department head, was able to
                    collect around him a promising young staff. The list of faculty members for these three decades
                    contains the names of many men of bright quality. Among them, Will David Howe, chairman,
                    1906–1919, Frank Aydelotte, Lewis Nathaniel Chase, Ralph Leslie Rusk, Henry Thew
                    Stephenson, and Frank Davidson, were indeed intellectual adornments.</p>
            <p>In a second essay Gray traces the history of the English Department down to 1945 and that great
                    dividing line in American academic history, the end of World War II. Henry Holland Carter was
                    chairman, 1923–1941, and Russell Noyes, 1941–1951. Like their distinguished
                    predecessor, Will D. Howe, both men had an important personal impact on the teaching of English and
                    literature. These were the years when Stith Thompson, Samuel Yellen, Donald Smalley, Chauncey
                    Sanders, Ralph Collins, Will T. Hale, Arthur Lieble, Mary Elizabeth Campbell, Lee Norvelle, and
                    Josephine Piercy joined the staff. These were productive scholars who glorified the name of the
                    university. An important development of these years was the presentation of a sparkling list of
                    literary lecturers to both general and departmental audiences. These also were years of genuine
                    realization of high departmental purposes.</p>
            <p>A series of five brief essays by Stith Thompson, John Robert Moore, Laurens J. Mills, Josephine
                    Piercy, Mary Elizabeth Campbell, and Samuel Yellen give intimate personal accounts of service in the
                    department and its efforts to realize scholarly objectives. Professor Yellen's essay is
                    especially revealing in its discussion of the ups and downs of a departmental professor in an era of
                    national depression. The same is true of Professor Russell Noyes' essay on the years
                    1928–1968. One more essay, Philip B. Daghlian's appraisal of the chairmanship of
                    James A. Work is a genuine contribution in its assessment of how far the field of English in the
                    university had advanced in a century of growth.</p>
            <p>This history is rich in names, and the departmental annals compiled by William Riley Parker is the
                    sort of readily available record which every university department should have at hand. This history
                    covers in detail an aspect of Indiana University which the historian of the university <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-071-2-085"/> could not possibly deal with in limited space. This well executed
                    history should challenge every other department to follow suit, and first in line should be the
                    Department of History.</p>

            <p>There really is very little point to this review other than as an object lesson in the perils of the
                    Bicentennial. It is not simply that the book under consideration lacks the distinguishing qualities
                    of a scholarly work, but that it is inadequate even as a specimen of popular history. It serves to
                    illustrate nothing more than the grubby opportunism of the marketplace.</p>
            <p>Stringing together a series of eyewitness accounts of military actions hardly constitutes a history
                    of the American Revolution, but taken even as a military history it is deficient. The author
                    provides little in the way of a narrative framework. The eyewitness reports are left to stand
                    without critical comment. The War for Independence might just as well be taking place on the moon
                    for all meaning the author imparts to the battles that are described. A lay reader would indeed be
                    hard put to make consecutive sense of the events that constitute the War for Independence.</p>
            <p>The claim to pictorial history is equally farfetched. There are all sorts of visual materials
                    scattered through the text, but little rhyme or reason for their presence. Lacking attribution for
                    the most part, it is difficult to say whether the illustrations are in fact of contemporary origin.
                    The impressionistic water colors provided by Smith are pretty but wholly inappropriate to the
                    subject, or to the claim that the work is documentary in character.</p>
            <p>In summary, what we have here is a glossy piece of merchandise passing as a history of the American
                    Revolution, <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-071-2-086"/> with little in redeeming value for a general public
                    that certainly needs to know more about its revolutionary heritage.</p>

            <p>The American frontier produced many men of extraordinary vision and ambition capable of seizing upon
                    the boundless opportunities of a developing wilderness. Typical of this breed was James Patton whose
                    personal saga was played out on the western frontier of mideighteenth century <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. A <geogName>Northern Irish sea</geogName> captain, Patton made his first contact with
                    America in the 1730s when he delivered cargoes of indentured servants to the labor hungry planters
                    of the Old Dominion. By 1737 Patton had abandoned the sea and had become involved with the
                    influential William Beverley in land speculations along the <geogName>Rappahannock River</geogName>.
                    Within a remarkably few years Patton emerged as one of the most powerful figures along the entire <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> frontier. Settling in the sparsely populated <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Augusta County</region>
                    </placeName>, Patton became the local militia commander, coroner, president of the county court, tax
                    collector, sheriff, and head of the local Presbyterian church board of commissioners. As the author
                    notes, Patton ran <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Augusta County</region>
                    </placeName> as a personal fiefdom with little consideration for the democratic principles that
                    supposedly flourished on the frontier.</p>
            <p>First and foremost Patton was a land speculator, and much of this biography is devoted to his
                    unceasing efforts to acquire more land patents. Although the author does not choose to comment on
                    the subject, Patton's experience is an excellent example of the role played by land
                    speculators in the settlement of America. Patton was a greedy man driven by an insatiable hunger for
                    wealth and power. One result of his pursuit of riches is that he explored and surveyed a vast region
                    of the frontier, publicized the availability of choice lands, and thus hastened the populating of
                    those areas. Another result was that he necessarily had to involve himself in Indian relations in
                    order to improve the security of his holdings <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-071-2-087"/> and thus make
                    them more attractive to potential settlers. In this latter endeavor Patton was neither skilled nor
                    lucky. As an agent of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> his efforts to deal with the Iroquois were inept. Worse, he happened to be one of the
                    few military leaders on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> frontier following the disastrous ending of General Braddock's campaign. He
                    died at the hands of the Indians in 1755 while leading a pitifully small band of militia.</p>
            <p>Although based on patient research, this volume does not qualify as great history. The author fails
                    to place Patton in the larger historical context of the great events shaping America at midcentury.
                    Patton was very much part of the story of two great empires struggling for dominance over North
                    America. He was also a relevant figure in explaining American expansionism and in evaluating
                    American interaction with the Indians. His career throws light on the old question raised by
                    Frederick Jackson Turner regarding the influence of the frontier on developing American democracy.
                    But if the book is short on analysis, the author has performed a real service in bringing to our
                    attention the fascinating life of this early frontiersman.</p>

            <p>This volume offers a potpourri of constitutional history, local history, editorial comment, and
                    source bibliographies of great interest to any serious student of the United State territorial
                    system or of western Americana in general. Editor Bloom has skillfully selected his contributors to
                    achieve a coverage of the history of the territorial system that is both broad and penetrating. Most
                    of them have added something worthwhile to the study of the most singularly unimperialistic empire
                    in the history of mankind.</p>
            <p>Space precludes detailed comment on each of the eighteen articles and commentaries making up this
                    volume. A few of them however, deserve to be singled out for their particular merits. Leonard
                    Rapport, Charles E. South, Marion M. <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-071-2-088"/> Johnson, and John P. Heard
                    supply bibliographical commentary which should not be missed by students in the field. Jo Tice Bloom
                    offers some real revelations as to the substantial influence often wielded by the territorial
                    delegates in Congress. Robert W. Johannsen challenges the traditional view of Stephen A. Douglas as
                    a slick power broker in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>

                    </placeName> crisis and argues convincingly that Douglas was genuinely concerned for the rights and
                    welfare of territorial inhabitants. Likewise, Kenneth N. Owens supplies some interesting new ideas
                    concerning politics and the day to day activities of government in the territories. This reviewer,
                    however, does not entirely agree with his conclusion that "territorial government provided
                    the means by which a resident, upper-class leadership could fashion structures of government
                    congruent with those in the older states" (p. 174).</p>
            <p>The only disappointments in the volume are the contributions by Arthur Bestor and Robert F.
                    Berkhofer, Jr. Bestor, in his section entitled "Constitutionalism and the Settlement of the
                    West: The Attainment of Consensus, 1754–1784," overlooks the development of a
                    consensus on western independence from the Atlantic littoral <hi rend="i">before</hi> the American
                    Revolution. Although he does mention Benjamin Franklin's "Plan of Union,"
                    which was presented at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> Conference, Bestor does not appear to notice how, here as elsewhere, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> was expressing the general public sentiment in the American colonies. Further research
                    reveals that the concept of western autonomy was well developed before the Revolution and that it
                    formed the ideological substance of dozens of proposals for extending Anglo-American settlement
                    westward for over twenty years prior to the Revolution. What happened afterward was more the
                    implementation of the consensus than its achievement. Bestor's assertions that the
                    Proclamation of 1763 was of "far greater importance, from almost every point of
                    view" than <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> Plan and that the Proclamation's "underlying principles were the same
                    as those of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> Plan" (p. 15) simply do not stand up in the sources.</p>
            <p>Berkhofer's article, "The Northwest Ordinance and the Principle of Territorial
                    Evolution," is free from such gross errors but falls rather short of success in its effort
                    to relate the "republican ideology" of the Revolution to the principles of
                    territorial government. Berkhofer does skillfully quote <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-071-2-089"/>
                    Benjamin Rush to show that a territory must evolve into "a fertile, well regulated
                    district," inhabited by men "of property and good character" before the
                    status of statehood is deserved (pp. 50–51). In so doing, however, he misses at least two
                    essential points: the synergy of the American Revolution's antiimperialism with the natural
                    determination of revolutionaries to propagate their institutions and their ethics and, above all,
                    the ideological amorphousness, born of a most explicit eschewal of specific ideology, which made the
                    American Revolution so different and which explains why a democratic regime followed. It seems
                    dangerous to generalize for the whole Revolution from Rush or any other single
                    "ideologue"; even if this works for tyrannical revolutions, it cannot work here.
                    Nevertheless, Berkhofer's contribution represents a useful point from which a discussion of
                    these issues may begin.</p>

            <p>Paul W. Gates has long been recognized as a scholar who relies on primary source material for
                    interpretations of settlement and land use on the frontier. In <hi rend="i">Landlords and Tenants on
                        the <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                        </placeName> Frontier</hi> he has collected more than two decades of his own articles on how
                    public lands in the northern prairies came into private hands prior to the Homestead Act of 1862.
                    Some changes in content and annotated bibliographic comments leading the reader to more recent works
                    bring the book up to date. The excellent introduction contains a summary of his ideas on the subject
                    of land policy, including his own speculation on the effects of federal policy and the problems of
                    placing a specific monetary value on frontier land.</p>
            <p>The unifying thesis of this book is Gates' conviction that laws governing the occupation and
                    sale of land have had a strong and lasting effect, on the economic, social, and political
                    development of prairie lands. Chapters about the prairies of Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> indicate that large landholding by speculators and the consequent tenant and labor
                    systems retarded the development of public services such as roads, <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-071-2-090"/> schools, and churches. This made the land a questionable bargain for
                    the settler and his family. Gates argues strongly that in the last analysis the delayed development
                    is traceable to federal land law, which through its pricing and sale system, made it easy for the
                    speculator to acquire almost unlimited tracts but very difficult for the common man to start a
                    family farm. His conclusion is paradoxical—on the one hand land speculators and money
                    lenders hampered the democratic development of the areas controlled; on the other hand, they may
                    have been the only possible vehicle for settlement of any kind.</p>
            <p>Broader than the title indicates, the book touches on many other subjects, including southern
                    investment in northern land, farming techniques, and systems of tenancy. It cites the effect of
                    confusion over land titles on settlement in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to illustrate the importance of land law and follows the development of some major land
                    holdings well into the twentieth century. Gates believes that systems developed before the Civil War
                    on the prairies of Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> set the patterns for bonanza farms and cattle ranches in the West.</p>
            <p>As with any collection of material not written as a unit there are repetitions of fact and
                    interpretation, but these are overshadowed by the depth of research and strength of analysis.
                    Detailed descriptions of many situations make this book useful to local historians as well as those
                    interested in the broader aspects of American land policy. Simply as a collection of reprints, <hi rend="i">Landlords and Tenants on the <placeName>

                    selected twenty-five officials for scholarly scrutiny. These officials include obvious choices:
                    Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, James K. Polk, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Roosevelt, and Harry Truman. Other essays consider a succession of leading diplomats
                    from Benjamin Franklin and John Quincy Adams to Dean Acheson, John Foster Dulles, and Henry
                    Kissinger. There are also portraits of naval officers Charles Wilkes and Alfred Thayer Mahan, Far
                    East experts Willard Straight and Stanley Hornbeck, Soviet specialist George Kennan, and Senator
                    John W. Fulbright among other influential second echelon figures.</p>
            <p>In selecting contributors the editors also achieved considerable geographical, ideological, and
                    generational balance. There are New Left revisionists as well as more orthodox realist and
                    nationalist interpreters. Writers include prize winning young historians like John Gaddis and Ross
                    Gregory and established senior scholars such as Robert Divine, Robert Ferrell, Norman Graebner,
                    Lawrence S. Kaplan, and David M. Fletcher. Since both editors completed graduate work at Indiana
                    University, it is not surprising that nine history graduates and faculty members from this school
                    contributed essays, and all these selections conform to the same high professional standard.</p>
            <p>Despite a diversity of subjects and divergent perspectives, Merli and Wilson successfully imposed a
                    consistent pattern on the biographical sketches. Each is about twenty-five pages long and contains
                    brief bibliographical notes but not full scholarly citations. In addition, illustrative cartoons and
                    biographical sketches of the contributors add to the volume's usefulness as a teaching
                    tool.</p>
            <p>Naturally in an enterprise of this magnitude there are many controversial interpretations. Some
                    readers, for example, will dispute Cecil Currey's conclusion that Benjamin Franklin was a
                    self seeking corruptionist who gained coincidental benefits for America while pursuing his own ends.
                    The volume as a whole also has certain understandable limitations—including an aura of
                    academic exclusiveness. It should surprise no one that the policymakers whom professors opt <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-071-2-092"/> to write about are successful cerebrals—<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Adams, Kennan, and Kissinger—not diplomatic dunderheads. A well rounded
                    picture of American diplomacy might also include a few sketches of fumbling professors, bumbling
                    political hacks, and hard nosed businessmen assigned to distant legations.</p>
            <p>There are other shortcomings. About twenty-five per cent of the selections deal with the
                    1940s—a fact reflecting both the quantity of scholarly activity and the preoccupation of
                    academics with Roosevelt-Truman policies. Finally, except for Michael Roskin, a former foreign
                    service officer writing on Kissinger, the list of contributors apparently does not include writers
                    with diplomatic or political experience.</p>
            <p>In balance, this is an important volume—one certain to stimulate student interest in
                    diplomatic history.</p>

            <p>This collection of essays was designed first to give students a convenient introduction to the latest
                    scholarship on the progressive period and second to give younger scholars an opportunity to present
                    original interpretations. It succeeds admirably in the first goal; but, like any collection, several
                    of the essays are not particularly pathbreaking. The common strand that unites them, as Professor
                    Gould observes, is a more positive attitude toward the period's achievements than would
                    have been likely in such a collection a few years ago.</p>
            <p>Stanley P. Caine finds the origins of progressivism in the social traumas and new corporate and tax
                    dodging abuses that accompanied the depression of 1893–1897. R. Laurence Moore argues
                    that progressive intellectuals were naive and confused because they tried to merge conflicting goals
                    such as science and morality, democracy and efficiency, environmentalism and free will, liberation
                    and organization. Lewis L. Gould describes how conflicts between Republican leaders—and
                    he particularly blames Theodore Roosevelt—destroyed <pb n="191" id="VAA4025-071-2-093"/>
                    the unified coalition which William McKinley had put together, leaving the GOP with weak leaders and
                    a conservative direction by 1912. John J. Broesamle shows how Woodrow Wilson managed, by committing
                    the Democratic party to support for weak interest groups, to build a remarkable—and
                    fragile—coalition that surmounted the clashing constituents and negativist traditions
                    which had made the party the minority one during most of this period.</p>
            <p>James Penick, Jr., describes familiar attitudes toward exploitation of the environment and concludes
                    that the largest weakness of progressive conservationists, whatever approach they favored, was their
                    elitism. Melvin G. Holli contrasts democratic "social reform" mayors like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Hazen Pingree with the mainstream of municipal reform. His penetrating
                    analysis demonstrates how the nineteenth century mugwumpish and elitist approach to city problems
                    paved the way for the professional city managers who wanted to redistribute power from the lower
                    classes to business and professional groups. Holli concludes that the costs, and not the forms, of
                    city government triggered agitations. Wilton B. Fowler argues that defensive and strategic concerns
                    primarily shaped the period's diplomacy. Thomas K. McCraw suggests that the era's
                    mixed legacy resulted from unresolved conflicts among cardinal progressive tenets: democracy,
                    pietism, trust in professionalization and efficiency, faith in political solutions, tendency to see
                    problems as abstractions, and fear of radical alternatives.</p>
            <p>Scholars will quibble with the more suggestive essays. Did voters influence the course of the debates
                    among reform spokesmen that Holli analyzes? Gould assumes that a political party should try, above
                    all, to keep broad coalitions together, as McKinley did; and he obviously regrets the ideological
                    quarrels that split the GOP. But is party harmony more satisfying to voters than a real debate and a
                    choice, say between Nelson W. Aldrich and Robert M. La Follette, within a party? Did voters play any
                    role in the developing internal problems among the progressives? Should popular conflicts be
                    compromised or ignored? Instead of lamenting these conflicts, McCraw seems to assume that such
                    struggles did not exist, that one huge progressive consensus lay behind the institutional legacies
                    of the period. He quotes Ralph Nader's indictment of regulatory agencies as though large
                        <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-071-2-094"/> numbers of consumer conscious progressives had not made
                    precisely the same indictment at the time. Can one safely assume that only one group of actors
                    created the legacy of an entire period in which debates were often fierce?</p>

            <p>During the last decade there has been a revival of interest in the history of American socialism.
                    Motivated in part by their own involvement in the social conflict of recent years, younger
                    historians have questioned the basic assumptions of earlier interpretations. In 1952 Daniel Bell
                    found in socialism a chiliastic movement ill suited for the politics of a modern industrial society,
                    while in 1967 James Weinstein discovered a Marxian political party viable within the American
                    tradition. <hi rend="i">Failure of a Dream?</hi> reproduces some of the major writings of this
                    debate and furthers discussion with the inclusion of new material. Each major essay in the
                    collection is accompanied by a critical comment by another scholar, which in turn is followed by a
                    reply from the first author. Thus the book has a verve and vitality unusual in collected essays, as
                    intellectual opponents such as John Laslett and Phillip Foner, Steven Thernstrom and Seymour Martin
                    Lipset confront each other directly.</p>
            <p>The essays are grouped around two major themes, which are initially explored in an introductory
                    exchange between the editors. The first account points to various internal weaknesses in the
                    movement itself—in ideology, leadership, and tactics—and examines how in the
                    specific historical context of pre-World War I America these factors contributed to
                    socialism's failure. The second approach explores the idea that the American movement would
                    have remained weak regardless of the strategy of the party, for American culture itself usurped the
                    millennial promise of socialism.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Failure of a Dream</hi>? is a valuable collection for both the general reader and the
                    serious student and is especially useful <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-071-2-095"/> for the classroom. Its
                    discussion of American culture and values and its more specific examination of the questions of
                    social mobility, trade unionism, and agrarianism contribute to a better understanding of socialism
                    and American social history in general.</p>
            <p>In viewing the collection as a whole, however, one is startled by the omission of any discussion of
                    religion beyond Marc Karson's sterile treatment of Catholic antisocialism or
                    Bell's dismissal of the movement as too religious. Since little is available in published
                    form, this is not simply an oversight of the editors; yet, American culture has been deeply
                    influenced by religious thinking, and the period of socialism's promise and greatest
                    strength coincided almost exactly with a major religious revival. The spiritual crisis that
                    accompanied industrialization evoked, as Timothy L. Smith has suggested, a public commitment to
                    Christian values greater than at any time between the Civil War and World War II. These feelings
                    influenced the socialist movement and were one important source of its opposition to emerging
                    corporate society. That Eugene Debs had a portrait of Christ, and not Marx, in his prison cell at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName> was not simply a personal pecularity but was representative of many in the party.
                    Further study of the relationship between a self defined Marxist movement and religious thought is
                    needed and would perhaps provide additional clarity for many of the debates in this collection.</p>

            <p>Iowans have been less successful in developing a comprehensive historical literature dealing with
                    their state than have some of their midwestern neighbors. Opinions differ as to whether this is
                    attributable to the division of resources between two official historical agencies, the natural
                    perversity of the Hawkeye, so lovingly delineated by Meredith Wilson, or still other reasons. But it
                    is a fact that eras in which outstanding progress has been made in collecting manuscripts,
                    developing library resources, and encouraging the <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-071-2-096"/> writing of
                    articles and books of quality about <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> have been all too rare in the state's history. Although dedicated amateurs,
                    capable professionals, and well intentioned politicians have enlisted in the cause, perverse
                    troglodytes have also helped in shaping <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>'s state history programs, and the alternatives posed have sometimes been
                    tragi-comic. Should there be more manuscript collecting and fewer steamboat excursions? Why preserve
                    Bob Feller's uniform lovingly, having thrown out the state records dealing with an
                    important state business, the insurance industry, in order to make room for a new lavatory?
                    Frustrations about such matters have sometimes reached high levels indeed, and recent dueling
                    challenges bandied within the Board of Curators of the Historical Society were more than mere
                    horseplay.</p>
            <p>For some forty years Leland L. Sage moved unperturbed through this unpredictable environment,
                    unfailingly courteous and usually with a knowing twinkle in his eyes. Arriving at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> State Teachers College with a Ph.D. in European history, he discovered that the local
                    library holdings and his own personal resources would not support the continuing research that he
                    believed every historian should pursue. He turned, therefore, to midwestern history, devoting many
                    years to the preparation of a meticulous and comprehensive biography of one of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>'s most powerful politicians, Senator William Boyd Allison.</p>
            <p>In the volume reviewed here, Professor Sage has tried to fill the long felt need for a scholarly one
                    volume history of the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>. He does not regard his work as definitive and indeed is hopeful that it will be tested
                    by others engaging in similar ventures. The books of such writers plus additional research projects
                    will pave the way, he suggests, for a scholarly multivolume history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>. But here, in a text of 335 pages plus notes, Sage has provided a succinct, readable
                    volume which in general incorporates the findings of recent relevant research. Sage has maintained a
                    high level of objectivity throughout the narrative and has laid a number of old myths to rest in the
                    process. True, he is a bit too concerned with "firsts" and somewhat given to
                    moralizing, but he carries neither to excess.</p>
            <p>Sage's keen interest in the political history of the nineteenth and early twentieth
                    centuries is evident in the chronological emphasis of this book, and some will conclude that he <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-071-2-097"/> has paid less attention to economic, social, and cultural
                    history than is appropriate. This reviewer falls in the latter group, but he also realizes that
                    Sage's emphasis to a considerable extent follows the emphasis of the historical literature
                    that was available to him. On balance Sage has rendered a great service to lowans and to the members
                    of the scholarly community. It is hoped that publication of this book along with recent changes in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>'s historical programs presage a new productive era in the support and writing

                    </placeName>, 1974. Pp. xiv, 808. Illustrations, notes, index. $20.00.)</head>
            <p>Griffin's book tells of the evolution of a university from its chartering in 1863 to the
                    present time. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> legislature separated the need for a university from that for an agricultural college
                    and established separate institutions. The Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862, however, was the spur to
                    the establishment of any kind of university. The University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, without the land grant, struggled into existence amid public disinterest, lack of
                    students, and the absence of legislative support. The citizenry was confused about the nature of a
                    university, and that confusion was translated into opposition or indifference.</p>
            <p>Although Griffin's book, like most institutional histories, moves slowly through endless
                    facts of encyclopedic proportions, the work has several redeeming features. The author is obviously
                    at his best as he traces the role of the faculty in shaping curriculum and institutional programs.
                    How a faculty matured is well described here, better perhaps than in most volumes of this kind. The
                    growth of professionalization and departmentalization weaves its way through the story with periodic
                    encounters with efforts to refocus administrative control. Griffin also advances and defends the
                    thesis that the changes in student social life and activities were as much influenced by
                    specialization and professionalization as by the rise of student hedonism. Another assessment that
                    raises this volume above some others is the analysis <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-071-2-098"/> of the
                    relationship of populism and progressivism to the rise of the university. How that relationship
                    differed from the one in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and other states is interesting but not sufficiently developed.</p>
            <p>A major criticism of the book is that in cataloging facts, the author obscures many strong passages.
                    The very human story of Professor James H. Canfield as he comes and goes through the narrative is
                    obscured by hundreds of faceless characters, without any human dimension, who occupy roles as
                    faculty, regents, students, and legislators. The story has an impersonal, monolithic feeling about
                    it, as though the institution in the end triumphed over the individuals, and perhaps it did. Another
                    major criticism is that the story of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> is not related to the broader history of higher education. Griffin does better than
                    most, but he ignores efforts over the past decade toward more comparative institutional histories.
                    One regrets the absence of a bibliography in this handsome volume. The general tendency of faculty
                    not to put their papers in archives is shown once again by the paucity of references to such
                    records.</p>
            <p>On balance, Griffin has written a very fine book, meticulous in its attention to fact, perhaps a good
                    compromise for those who pay for institutional histories and those who try to make use of them.</p>

            <p>In the preface and first chapter the author tells the intent of his book: "to describe what
                    went on in field, barn, house and rural neighborhood" during the years his father called
                    his "golden years," about 1900 to 1915; also to be "a sort of
                    biography" of the author's father, L. D. McMillen.</p>

                        </placeName> Farm</hi> is museum like in its faithful portrayal of method, machinery, and life
                    pattern of those farm years. The author, later editor of <hi rend="i">Farm Journal</hi>, sometimes
                    sets new ways beside ways of "the golden years," but without lamentation or
                    glorification. He simply shows them, and answers the <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-071-2-099"/> questions
                    his book raises. Among modern advantages the author notes: "With postwar development of
                    poisons a farm can be easily kept free of rats" (p. 46). But as one of the disadvantages,
                    he observes that "people able today to buy seasonal foods the year around cannot imagine
                    the delight these things, such as strawberries, rhubarb, mushrooms … gave a family that
                    had them only in brief season" (p. 46).</p>
            <p>Delightful are descriptions of churning as "cream being jostled into butter"; of
                    hunting arrowheads and mushrooms; his father banking the house with strawy manure for winter warmth;
                    his mother making maple syrup of corncobs and pies of ground cherries; the affectionate account of
                    old Doc, the family driving horse, and the hired men who lived with the family; of building the
                    house and barn; of Grange meetings and fishing vacations.</p>
            <p>L. D. McMillen's efficiency and good management are attested by his ability to buy a 125
                    acre farm at $35 an acre, and from its income to pay for it and make a good living; build
                    a new house and barn; hire and house a fulltime assistant; take vacations; and help his son buy a
                    newspaper—all, moreover, during an era to which history accords three periods of economic
                    stagnation.</p>
            <p>Each farm crop activity is minutely described, separately. A reader unacquainted with farming might
                    get the impression that farming goes on an orderly schedule, no activity encroaching on another.
                    Actually on most farms they collide, as the hay getting ready before the corn is laid by, to the
                    distress of farmers. But whether acquainted or unacquainted with farming, a reader will feel he has
                    lived and worked a full year on the McMillen farm, known its wearinesses and its family, and shared
                    its richness which the author suggests is perhaps greater in retrospect than it seemed at the time.</p>
            <p>The reader admires L. D. McMillen for many qualities: thrift; honesty; neighborliness; appreciation
                    of leisure, land, and education. And yet the reader steadily feels something missing in the
                    portrait. Is the father unimaginative? The picture lacks warmth. Perhaps the author's
                    conscientious effort to keep himself in the background is part of the reason. It creates a slight
                    stiffness, an impression of self consciousness. But in the last paragraphs, with the
                    author's words, reprinted from <hi rend="i">Farm and Fireside</hi>, the missing piece of
                    portrait is fitted into place. All the warmth and love flow <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-071-2-100"/> in,
                    adding a vital last touch to a fine, honest book that succeeds in doing what the author set out to
                    do. <hi rend="i">

            <p>This reprint of Dreiser's 1916 book is an expensive but appropriate way to revive a
                    surprisingly vital minor work, retaining <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Booth's shadowy, expressive sketches, without editorial apparatus. <hi rend="i">A Hoosier Holiday</hi> was conceived by Booth and Dreiser as a joint pot boiler, and
                    the book has suffered from this image as well as from the fact that it came in the backwash from
                    Dreiser's first burst of creative effort—four large novels between 1911 and
                    1915. Booth shared the meager profits and his sketches have a genuine life of their own. The text is
                    vintage Dreiser, full of his brooding over the tragedy and transcience of life, full of his constant
                    shuttling between bitterness and tenderness, vulgarity and delicacy, determinism and sentimental
                    love of life sharp insight and bland commonplace. <hi rend="i">Holiday</hi> is thus mostly irony.

                    </placeName>, planned as a "working holiday," was painful in all the predictable
                    ways. A genial, popular account of travel and reminiscence was for Dreiser impossible. Nevertheless,
                    as cranky and sometimes clumsy as Dreiser was, all the documents in his dogged search for the truth
                    about himself and his world are still impressive. We are embarrassed for him when he seems to be as
                    shaken by mooning over unrequited puppy love as by confronting social injustice or human
                    delinquency, but part of the embarrassment is for ourselves. The principal change in the atmosphere
                    of the book from 1916 to the present is that Dreiser's iconoclasm, pessimism, and outrage
                    are no longer shocking, although the fact that they were shocking in 1916 and for a long time after
                    is enlightening in itself.</p>
            <p>Sixty years have added interesting dimensions to <hi rend="i">A Hoosier Holiday</hi> as a historical
                    document. The first half of <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-071-2-101"/> the book takes us, in
                    Booth's new touring car, through <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Dreiser revelled in the adventurousness of automobile travel with top speeds of
                    forty-five miles an hour, many blowouts, and treacherous, unimproved roads. There are brilliant
                    vignettes of people and places, often interrupted, of course, by Dreiserian digressions. The Hoosier
                    half of the book is darker and more personal, but no Indiana historian can ignore it.</p>
            <p>By far the most appreciative and profound review of <hi rend="i">A Hoosier Holiday</hi> was by
                    Dreiser's great champion, H. L. Mencken, who, as advisor and editor, may also have had a
                    lot to do with the final text. Mencken was sure that here, "for the first time,"
                    was "a clear understanding of the fundamental faiths and ideas, and of the intellectual and
                    spiritual background no less, of a man with whom the future historian of American literature will
                    have to deal at no little length." In 1916, this was an opinion of a minute minority. It is
                    clearly vindicated today, even though <hi rend="i">A Hoosier Holiday</hi> does not challenge
                    Dreiser's best novels for literary status, and as autobiographical material was superseded
                    by <hi rend="i">A Book About Myself</hi> (1922) and <hi rend="i">Dawn</hi> (1931).
                    Mencken's review, along with a generous selection of other notices, is reprinted in Jack

                    historical endeavors were not restricted to Indiana or even the Middle West. Unfortunately <hi rend="i">Massacres of the Mountains</hi> did not come to the editor's attention when
                    republished in 1969, hence this belated notice of it. Published almost ninety years ago, this volume

                    whites and Indians merits study. Though like most people of his time Dunn anticipated the ultimate,
                    perhaps early, absorption of the Indian into "American" civilization, his comments
                    reflect an understanding of the various abuses, dilemmas, currents, and problems which had long

                    credits the War Department with doing a commendable job in a reasonably expeditious manner under
                    considerable duress of circumstances. The author presents significant evidence in support of this

                    arming the Union forces. He also points out that the fighting during the Civil War was much less a

                    discusses these two lines in the context of transportation development generally.</p>
