                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All
                    split lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for
                    the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as
                    &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                            <l>And folk in black who whispered pityingly,</l>

                            <l>Of sodden grief the slow drops still ooze out,</l>
                            <l>And, falling on all fair things, they wither these.</l>
                            <l>Tears came with timeâbut not with time went by.</l>

                            <l>Warm kitchen, sunny parlour, with the soft</l>
                            <l>Intolerable pervading memories</l>
                            <l>Of her whose face and voice made melodies,</l>

                            <l>Because she gathered in her dying hands</l>
                            <l>And carried with her to the fair far lands</l>
                            <l>The flower of all our joy, because she went</l>
                            <l>Out of the garden where her days were spent,</l>
                            <l>And took the very sun away with her.</l>

                            <l>It seems a place for rest,</l>

                            <l>Not there, not there, our hardest tears are shed,</l>
                            <l>But in the house made empty for her sake.</l>

                            <l>Is paid, slow drop by drop, till the new day</l>
                            <l>With thin cold fingers pushes back nightâs wings,</l>
                            <l>And drags us out to common cruel things</l>
                            <l>That sting, and barb their stings with memory.</l>
                            <l>O Loveâand is the price too hard to give?</l>
                            <l>Thine is the splendour of all things that live,</l>
                            <l>And this thy pain the price of life to theeâ</l>
                            <l>The sacrament that binds to the beloved,</l>
                            <l>The chain that holds though mountains be removed,</l>
                            <l>The portent of thine immortality.</l>
