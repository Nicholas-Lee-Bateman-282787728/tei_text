				<head rend="center">PREFACE <lb/>
					<hi rend="sc">TO THE BOYS AND GIRLS</hi></head>
				<p/>

				<p> A<hi rend="sc">GES</hi> and ages ago, so far back that the world has almost forgotten
					about it, the Celtic people had a great empire spreading over a large part of Europe.
					Then, after a long while, something happened to break up this empire; nobody knows exactly
					what, but most probably they fought among themselves or with other people, or both, or
					perhaps some stronger race swept into their country and thrust them out. At any rate, by
					and by it came about that all that was left of the empire of the Celts was that part of it
					which we now call France and the British Isles; they called them Gaul and Britain and
					Ireland.</p>
				<p> Meantime the great city of Rome had been growing more and more powerful and sending her
					conquering armies everywhere till at last <pb id="VAB1843-010" n="viii"/> she brought most
					of Europe under her sway. And the Celtic people, whose proudest boast had been that once
					upon a time they had captured the great city, now found themselves under her dominion and
					soon beginning to have Roman ideas about things. For no nation could be ruled by Rome and
					be just the same as before. There was one part of the Celtic lands, however, that did not
					change, and this was Ireland. Far off to the west, for some reason she was never visited
					by the Roman soldiers and so managed to keep her affairs all to herself.</p>
				<p>Thus several centuries passed; and then, as you perhaps know from your histories, Rome
					herself, with all her pride and splendor, was conquered and overwhelmed by the wild tribes
					to the north of her, and Europe, which had been growing more and more civilized, sank back
					into ignorance and barbarism which it took hundreds of years to shake off.</p>


				<pb id="VAB1843-011" n="ix"/>




				<p> But all the while Ireland, off there in the western ocean, kept to herself. Just as she
					was not conquered by Rome, neither was she overwhelmed by the barbarians when Rome fell,
					but kept right on living her Celtic life and doing things in her own Celtic way clear down
					to the time when the rest of Europe began to rouse up and learn things again. Indeed, the
					Celtic people did much to help wake up Europe; for though they had not been conquered by
					the Romans, nevertheless the Celtic scholars had been wise enough to study the best books
					written by them and by the Greeks, and these, together with much other knowledge which
					they gained for themselves, they kept from being forgotten by the world.</p>
				<p>Though it is true that a hundred years after the time of our story the Norman race
					invaded Ireland and in the centuries that followed her people have gradually changed in
					many ways from the Celts of long ago, yet still the Celtic <pb id="VAB1843-012" n="x"/>
					blood and the Celtic spirit so lives in Ireland that when to-day we speak of the Celts we
					most often mean the Irish rather than those other descendants of the old race who still
					are scattered through many parts of Europe and even Asia.</p>
				<p> Now the Celts have always been an interesting people, and those of long ago left many
					things for us to admire and treasure. Though they did not build great and beautiful
					temples and palaces whose ruins still speak of past glory, as did other races of the old
					world, yet in the more delicate handicrafts no one ever did finer work, as is proved by
					the innumerable beautiful objects of gold and silver and enamel still to be seen in Irish
					museums. The lovely chalice of Ardagh, the Tara brooch, the cross of Cong and the
					bell-shrine of St. Patrick, these are famous beyond Ireland; while as for the painted
					books made by the old-time Celtic artists, of the many of surpassing beauty one <pb
						id="VAB1843-013" n="xi"/> was so marvelous-- but, no, I must not tell you about it now,
					for it is part of our story!</p>
				<p> But besides these things which we of to-day can see and touch, the Celts of long ago
					left a great deal more. They left to the world an inheritance of beautiful myths and
					romantic stories and poems and fairy tales, some of which you have perhaps already read as
					you surely will read more of them by and by. These belong to every one; but to their own
					children and ever-so-great-great grandchildren, down through the centuries, the Celts of
					long ago left an inheritance of delight in beauty, of joy in the loveliness of the lovely
					world about us, in the blue sky and the green earth, joy in bright and beautiful colors, a
					love of poetry and fairy stories, and, best of all, a way of losing themselves in
					wonderful dreams, dreams sometimes tinged with a wistful sadness, perhaps, yet always
					beautiful. It is this inheritance that so marks the Celtic people to-day, wherever they
						<pb id="VAB1843-014" n="xii"/> may chance to live, that when we know some one who
					specially loves all these things, we say he must have in his veins a strain of Celtic
					blood; and very likely he has.</p>
				<p> But it is high time to get to our story, which has been waiting all this while. Our
					little Celtic cousin, Ferdiad, is ready to meet you in the first chapter and take you back
					to the long ago, and I hope you and he may become very good friends.</p>

						<hi rend="sc">THE TAILLTENN FAIR</hi></head>

					<p> T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> August sun was shining brightly over the Irish meadows skirting
						a narrow river that glittered with such a silvery light you would never have thought its
						name was the Blackwater. Neither would you have supposed the place on its bank in front
						of which were moored scores of oddly built boats was really the very tiny old village of
						Tailltenn. No, you would have declared that it was a gay though rather queer looking
						city, and could scarcely have believed that in a week's time all its noise and <pb
							id="VAB1843-020" n="2"/> bustle would vanish and only the few wattled houses of the
						little village be left.</p>
					<p> For Tailltenn in August, when its great fair was held, and Tailltenn the rest of the
						year were two very different places.</p>
					<p> But never mind about Tailltenn the rest of the year, for our story begins right in the
						middle of the fair, which was surprisingly like our fairs of to-day. And this seems
						strange, considering that it was almost exactly nine hundred years ago; that is to say,
						it was August of the year 1013.</p>
					<p> But people nine hundred years ago liked to show and buy things and enjoyed racing and
						games and entertainment of all kinds just as well as we do, and any one who could, amuse
						was sure to have plenty of folks looking on. So it was that the Celtic boy, Ferdiad, who
						had stopped to watch a specially skilful juggler, soon found himself squeezed into a
						crowded circle of people and presently a red-headed lad <pb id="VAB1843-021" n="3"/> of
						about his own age was pushed close beside him.</p>
					<p> Both smiled good-naturedly, and, "Look!" cried Ferdiad, bending his eyes on the
						juggler, "I have counted, and he has nine swords and nine little silver shields and nine
						balls, and he keeps them all up in the air at once and hasn't let one fall!"</p>
					<p>"He's the best I ever saw!" said the other boy gazing admiringly at the man, who was
						dressed in a loose tunic of saffron-colored linen with a wide girdle of scarlet. On his
						legs were long tight-fitting trousers of the same material and his shoes were of thick
						leather without heels and laced with red cords. A short scarlet cape with a pointed hood
						lay on the ground where he had thrown it when he began his performance.</p>
					<p> Suddenly, with a few dextrous movements, he caught one by one the balls and swords and
						shields he had been tossing about, and snatching <pb id="VAB1843-022" n="4"/> up one of
						the latter began passing it among the crowd.</p>
					<p> A few small silver coins were dropped into it and two or three little silver rings
						which often passed instead of coins. People used but little regular money and generally
						paid for things by exchanging something else for them, as perhaps a measure of wheat or
						honey, which every one liked; or, if the thing bought was valuable, often a cow or two
						did for money.</p>
					<p> As now the juggler was coming their way with his shield, the two boys strolled off
						together; for though each had a few silver rings tucked into his girdle for spending
						money, they had other plans for disposing of these.</p>
					<p> When they had gone a short distance they stopped and looked each other over. Both were
						tall and straight and well grown for their age, which was about twelve years; and their
						bare heads shone in the sunlight, Ferdiad's as yellow as the other boy's was red.
						Ferdiad <pb id="VAB1843-023" n="5"/> wore a tight scarlet jacket with sleeves striped
						with green and a kilted skirt reaching just above his bare knees; below them were
						leggins of soft leather laced with cords tipped with silver as were also his
						moccasin-like shoes. He had a short cape made of strips of brown and green cloth sewn
						together, but as the day was warm this hung over one shoulder and was only loosely
						fastened by a silver brooch. The other boy, who had come from a little different part of
						the country, was dressed in the fashion of his own home. His jacket was much like
						Ferdiad's except that it was yellow, and instead of kilts he wore long tight-fitting
						trousers of gray; his cape also was gray figured with black.</p>
					<p> Presently he said to Ferdiad, with a frank smile, "My name is Conn and my home is in
						the kingdom of Munster where my father is a bo-aire. I guess yours must be a flaith from
						the colors of your clothes. My foster-father <pb id="VAB1843-024" n="6"/> is a bo-aire,
						too, and we came to the fair this morning in our chariot and I drove all the way from
						near Kinkora where we live. What is your name?"</p>
					<p> "Ferdiad O'Neill," answered Ferdiad; but seeing Conn look bewildered, "O'Neill," he
						explained, "means my father's name is Neill; you know 'O' stands for son of."</p>
					<p> "Yes," said Conn in surprise, "but why do you have <hi rend="i">two </hi>names?"</p>
					<p> "Well," replied Ferdiad, "my father says that the high king, Brian Boru, wants people
						to start having two names instead of just one. You see, if each family settles on a
						second name that they can add to their first, then you can tell better who folks are and
						who are their kin. My father, who is a flaith as you guessed, don't want to put anything
						after his own name for every one in the kingdom of Meath, where my home is, knows him as
						Neill. But he says I may as well begin with the two names. I <pb id="VAB1843-025" n="7"
						/> suppose everybody will have family names afterwhile."</p>
					<p>"I suppose so," said Conn, who had been listening with interest." I hadn't heard about
						it before, but if you can start a family name by adding 'O' to your father's, then I
						would be Conn O'Keefe!" and he laughed at the odd new fashion. "But," he went on, "who
						is your foster-father?"</p>
					<p> "He is Angus the poet," answered Ferdiad With a touch of pride. "We live beyond Kells
						on the Blackwater, and we all came to the fair yesterday. We rowed down the river in our
						curragh."</p>
					<p> Now do not suppose that these two boys were orphans because they talked about their
						foster-fathers. Far from it! In fact, most Celtic boys, and many girls too, were extra
						well supplied with parents; for they usually had not only their own real fathers and
						mothers but also the foster-fathers and mothers with <pb id="VAB1843-026" n="8"/> whom
						they lived from the time they were seven, or even younger, until they were seventeen.
						This custom of putting children to be trained in the home of some one else seems strange
						to us, but the Celtic people of those days thought it the best way to bring them up.
						Sometimes their foster-parents were close friends of their own fathers and mothers and
						took the children for the sake of the affection they felt for one another; and sometimes
						people placed their children with some one they thought specially fitted to train them,
						and then they paid a certain sum of money for it, or, more likely, a number of cows.</p>
					<p> For the Celtic people then had no large cities and few towns even, but lived mostly in
						the country and the more cows they had the better off they considered themselves. They
						were divided into tribes or clans with chiefs of different degrees of rank. A bo-aire,
						as was Conn's father, 'though a respectable chief, <pb id="VAB1843-027" n="9"/> owned no
						land but was obliged to rent it of some higher chief, or flaith, such as Ferdiad's
						father; but a bo-aire always had plenty of cattle of his own. So probably Conn's
						foster-father received enough fat cows to pay for the support of the boy.</p>
					<p> Indeed, the Celtic laws decided just what must be paid for feeding and clothing foster
						children, and decided also, according to their rank, what they should eat and wear; and
						every one paid a great deal of attention to the laws. It was because of these that Conn
						had barley porridge with a lump of salty butter on it for breakfast while Ferdiad ate
						oatmeal with saltless butter which was considered finer; if either had been a king's son
						he would have had honey on his porridge. And because of these same laws Conn and Ferdiad
						at once knew each other's rank; for sons of flaiths might wear red, green and brown
						clothes, while the colors for boys of bo-aires were yellow, black and gray. </p>

					<pb id="VAB1843-028" n="10"/>



					<p> But while we have been talking about them, the boys have not been standing still. They
						had decided at once to be friends, and "My foster-father said I was to go around and
						find what I wanted to look at," said Conn, "but I think it would be more fun seeing the
						fair together."</p>
					<p> "So do I" answered Ferdiad. "Let's look around and see what's going on."</p>

					<head rend="center"> CHAPTER II <lb/>
						<hi rend="sc"> FERDIAD AND CONN SEE THE SIGHTS</hi></head>

					<p> T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> boys were just starting off together when a sudden shouting
						arose.</p>
					<p> "O, look over there!" cried Ferdiad, "I believe they are beginning to course the
						hounds!"</p>
					<p> Both lads ran across a space of green grass to where a low wattled fence enclosed a
						large oval race-course. People were gathered about it talking excitedly as they watched
						the lively capers of a dozen or more large wolf hounds that several men held in leash by
						long leather thongs. The dogs were straining impatiently at their collars, and the
						moment the signal was given and they were unleashed, <hi rend="i">"Br-rh-rh-rh-
							rh-rh!!"</hi> off they darted, their noses pointing <pb id="VAB1843-030" n="12"/>
						straight ahead and their long legs and powerful bodies bounding past so swiftly that
						neither Ferdiad nor Conn could make out one from another.</p>
					<p> But in a few moments the fastest began to sweep ahead, and Conn cried out excitedly,
						"Look! Look! That big light brown one I picked out is leading!"</p>
					<p> "Not now!" called back Ferdiad, as they hurried along the fence following the racing
						dogs with their eyes. "No! now it's the one with the white tip to his tall!"</p>
					<p> "Whew!" shouted Conn, as <hi rend="i">"Br-rh-rh-rh- rh-rh!"</hi> with a deep roar the
						baying pack swept past again, "If there isn't that bright blue one that was 'way behind
						leading them all now!"</p>
					<p>And, sure enough, when the panting hounds came around the last quarter of the track it
						was the bright blue that leaped first across the streak of white lime that marked the
						goal. There was a great shouting and clapping of hands by <pb id="VAB1843-031" n="13"/>
						the bystanders as the tired dogs were led off.</p>
					<p> "Whose hound was it that won? Do you know?" asked Conn of Ferdiad.</p>
					<p> "I heard a man say he belonged to Prince Cormac of Cromarty," answered Ferdiad. "They
						say the prize is an enameled dog-collar and a leather leash trimmed with silver. I
						wonder when the high king will give it to him?"</p>
					<p> "Not till the end of the fair, boy," said a tall man standing near. "The high king
						isn't here yet but is coming to-morrow, and there will be games and chariot races yet,
						and, last of all, the poets' and story-tellers' contest."</p>
					<p> "Well," said Conn as the boys turned away, "that hound race was good,-- but I never
						thought the blue one would win! He was such a handsome color I suppose Prince Cormac
						must have had him specially dyed for the fair."</p>
					<p> "I dare say," said Ferdiad, "but I have a green hound at home that is just as
						handsome, and my foster-mother says when she colors the <pb id="VAB1843-032" n="14"/>
						next wool she spins maybe she will have enough red left to dye another one."</p>
					<p> For the Celts thought oddly colored animals very pretty, and women when they dyed the
						yarn which they all spun for themselves often emptied what was left in their dye-pots
						over the family pets. So a purple cat or blue or red dog was no uncommon sight.</p>
					<p>But the boys had wandered off from the race track and had come to an open space where
						were a number of booths covered with green boughs. Here merchants were selling all sorts
						of things; there were bows and arrows, swords, shields and spears, bronze horns and
						trumpets and harps, homespun woolen and linen cloth, and fine silks from beyond the sea,
						and there were wonderful bracelets and necklaces and torques, a kind of twisted collar,
						and brooches, all of finely wrought gold and silver; for the Celts, both men and women,
						loved to wear quantities of golden ornaments and nowhere in <pb id="VAB1843-033" n="15"
						/> all the world were more skilful goldsmiths than theirs.</p>
					<p> In one of the better built booths covered with a thatched roof several scribes were
						busy. Each held in his lap a thin board with a sheet of vellum on which he wrote,
						dipping his swan-feather pen into ink held in the tip of a cow's horn fastened to the
						arm of his chair. Some were writing letters for people who had no ink or vellum of their
						own or perhaps could not write themselves; while others were copying from books beside
						them, all of which were for sale. No one had dreamed yet of printing books on presses,
						so copying them by hand was the only way to make them. Some of the books had initial
						letters painted in gold and colors, and as the boys passed they looked critically at
						these.</p>
					<p> "They are not so well done as some at the Kinkora monastery where I go to school,"
						said "Conn. For the most beautiful books were <pb id="VAB1843-034" n="16"/> made by the
						patient hands of the Celtic monks.</p>
					<p> "No," said Ferdiad, "I dare say not. And they can't compare with the books at the
						monastery of Kells near where we live.</p>
					<p> "Oh," he went on eagerly, "you just ought to see the Great Gospel of Saint Columkille
						that is kept at Kells! The monks there say there's nothing like it in the whole
						world!"</p>
					<p> "I've heard something of that book," said Conn, "but I don't know much about it. What
						is it?"</p>
					<p> "Well," answered Ferdiad, "it's hundreds of years old and painted with the most
						wonderful borders and initials and pictures that anybody ever made! The patterns are so
						fine and the lines lace in and out so perfectly that they say if your eyes are sharp
						enough you can count hundreds of loops and ornaments on a spot no wider than your
						finger!"</p>
					<p>"I don't see how anybody ever painted patterns <pb id="VAB1843-035" n="17"/> like
						that!" said Conn. "Who made it? "</p>
					<p> "Nobody knows for sure," answered Ferdiad. "Some say Saint Columkille had it made and
						some say he did it himself. But everybody declares that whoever painted it, an angel
						must have guided his hand, for nobody could have done it without help from Heaven. And
						then the book has the most wonderful gold case you ever saw!" For most handsome books
						then each had its own box-like case of gold or silver ior carved wood or ivory.</p>
					<p> Just then a horse's whinney caught the boys' attention and they went over to the pens
						where horses and sheep and cows were for sale, and enormous wolf-hounds some of them as
						large as calves. Around these hounds especially was always a crowd of interested buyers,
						for the Celts delighted in racing them; also these powerful dogs were useful in
						protecting their homes tt night and in chasing off the packs of wolves <pb
							id="VAB1843-036" n="18"/> that roamed through the great wild forests that covered so
						much of the land. Presently both boys began to sniff hungrily as they came to that part
						of the fair where food was being sold.</p>
					<p> "Let's get something to eatk!" said Conn, "Aren't you hungry?"</p>
					<p> "Yes," said Ferdiad, looking up at the sun, "it's past midday!" And they made their
						way toward the nearest booth. Beside it was an open fire and over this hung a great
						bronze kettle in which pieces of meat were boiling. A man in cook's cap and apron stood
						by with a long hook of bronze.</p>
					<p> "We would like some of your meat, sir," said Ferdiad, and at once the man hooked out
						some pieces which he placed on an earthen platter; this he set on a low wooden table on
						the grass beside him, and the boys sitting down on the ground began eating with their
						fingers as people did then. They finished with some milk served in cups hollowed out of
						yew wood and <pb id="VAB1843-037" n="19"/> some wheaten cakes which the cook's wife had
						kneaded up with honey and baked on a flat hot stone in front of the fire.</p>
					<p> When the boys had eaten, "You be my guest, Conn," said Ferdiad as he paid the man with
						one of the small silver rings he took from his girdle.</p>
					<p> By this time the crowd seemed to be moving toward the grassy space within the race
						track, so of course Ferdiad and Conn went along. When they reached the place a wrestling
						match had already begun and after that was running and jumping and quoit throwing and
						fencing contests, and all the while there was a blaring of trumpets and blowing of great
						horns or else somebody was twanging on a harp or shaking castanets of bone, keeping up a
						noise and excitement for all the world like fairs of to-day.</p>
					<p> When the sports were over the afternoon was almost spent and Ferdiad and Conn fairly
						tired <pb id="VAB1843-038" n="20"/> of sight seeing. "Come on," said Ferdiad, "let's go
						find our curragh and take a row on the river before you go back to your
						foster-father."</p>
					<p> "All right!" said Conn, and off they went toward the river. Near its bank was another
						grassy space and scattered through it a number of houses, all of them round; for that
						was the shape most Celtic people preferred. Each was built of poles placed upright in
						the ground forming a circle; long rods of hazel from which the bark had been peeled were
						woven between the poles, making a wattled wall, and the cone-shaped roof was thatched
						with rushes. These houses, which belonged to the fair and had been built long before for
						the use of the high-born people attending it, had been freshened up with coats of lime,
						some glistening, dazzling white in the sunlight, and others decorated with bright
						stripes in different colors.</p>
					<p> Several gayly dressed ladies were walking <pb id="VAB1843-039" n="21"/> about and
						there was a sound of harpstrings in the air. "Are those queens?" asked Conn of Ferdiad,
						for it was his first visit to the fair and he had found Ferdiad had been there
						before.</p>
					<p> "Yes," said Ferdiad, "and my foster-mother is one of the ladies attending the Queen of
						Meath, so she and my foster-sister, Eileen, stay in that striped house under the big
						quicken tree. These houses are for the queens and their ladies and those yonder are for
						the kings."</p>
					<p> For you must know that Ireland was a land not only of many kinds of parents but also
						of quantities of kings and queens. The country was divided into ever so many little
						kingdoms belonging to different tribes or clans, and, as I have told you, in these
						tribes were many chiefs or flaiths of different degrees of rank, but over them all in
						each kingdom was the king. Some of the kingdoms were larger and stronger <pb
							id="VAB1843-040" n="22"/> than others, so the kings varied in power; but none of them
						was so important as the high king who ruled them all just as each of them ruled the
						chiefs under him. But though the high king was called the King of Ireland, the smaller
						kings fought and quarreled so much among themselves, and so many bold chiefs from
						countries near by were always trying to gain a foothold in Ireland that the high king
						seldom really governed the whole land. However, the one who came nearest to doing it was
						the great Brian Boru, who hadn't come to the fair yet but was expected the next day.
						Ferdiad pointed out to Conn a long wooden house built on top of a grassy mound in the
						middle of the fair where the high king would stay, and close beside it another large
						building where he would give a great feast in the evening.</p>
					<p> Meantime all the other fifteen or twenty kings with their queens and followers were
						having <pb id="VAB1843-041" n="23"/> the best kind of a time and behaving in the
						politest way to each other; for no matter how much they fought at other times, no one
						dared to start a quarrel at any of the great Celtic fairs, for everybody knew perfectly
						well that the punishment was death.</p>
					<p> But Ferdiad and Conn had come to the water's edge and were just looking for the right
						boat when a little girl with flying yellow curls came racing toward them, her blue
						mantle fluttering and her little sandaled feet twinkling as she ran. "O, Ferdiad," she
						called out, "I was just wishing you would come! Mother says I may go for a little ride
						on the river if you will take me!"</p>
					<p> Then seeing Conn, whom she had not noticed in her eagerness, she drew back with a
						touch of bashfulness.</p>
					<p> "This is my new friend Conn, from Munster," explained Ferdiad, "and he is going with
						us. Conn," he added turning to the boy who <pb id="VAB1843-042" n="24"/> was staring
						shyly at the little girl, "this is my foster-sister, Eileen."</p>
					<p> At this Eileen, with a friendly smile for the new friend, took Ferdiad's hand as he
						helped her clamber down the bank and they picked out the boat in which they had come to
						the fair. It was the kind the Celts called a "curragh" and was made of wickerwork
						covered with tanned cow-hides which had been stained a dark red. When Eileen had stepped
						daintily in and seated herself and the boys followed, "Let's go across the river and see
						how the fair looks from the other side," she said, "and then let's go around the bend
						and back!"</p>
					<p> And Ferdiad and Conn taking up the long oars of hickory did exactly as Eileen
						commanded.</p>

						<hi rend="sc"> THE HIGH KING COMES TO THE FAIR</hi></head>

					<p> "F<hi rend="sc">ATHER</hi>, father!" called Eileen the morning after the boat ride, as
						she ran out of the round wattled house where she and her mother had slept.</p>
					<p> She had caught sight of a tall man coming swiftly toward her, and in a moment he
						stooped and kissing her rosy cheek three times lifted her in his arms so she could
						nestle her golden head on his bosom in the pretty Celtic fashion of greeting those one
						loved.</p>
					<p> "O, father," she said, as hand in hand they went to meet her mother, Fianna, who had
						just stepped out into the sunshine, "isn't this the day you sing your song before the
						high king?"</p>
					<p> "Yes, child," answered her father smiling, <pb id="VAB1843-046" n="26"/> "but do not
						be too sure I shall win the prize. There are many fine poets here and everybody thinks
						the prize will not be the jeweled ring only, but that Brian Boru will choose the winner
						for his chief poet in place of Niall who is dead. You know I told you Niall was a great
						master of his art, so the high king will not be easy to please."</p>
					<p> Eileen laughed confidently, "So are you a master!" she declared. Then, "Where is
						Ferdiad?" she asked.</p>
					<p> "He will be along in a minute," answered her father; "the poets' house was so crowded
						last night he went off and slept in the tent with his friend Conn and his
						foster-father."</p>
					<p> As the three stood waiting for Ferdiad, you would have thought them a handsome family.
						Eileen's yellow curls, white skin and oval face were like her mother's, and she was
						dressed in much the same fashion only that her close-fitting <pb id="VAB1843-047" n="27"
						/> tunic and narrow clinging skirt of figured green and white linen were not so long as
						her mother's yellow and white ones, and her bratt (which was the Celtic name for the
						loose mantle almost every one wore), was blue instead of green striped. Her head was
						bare while her mother's was partly covered with folds of fine filmy linen; but both had
						the same kind of sandals on their feet.</p>
					<p> Angus, Eileen's father, was tall and straight; his long light hair was parted and hung
						over his shoulders in carefully twisted strands while his beard also was parted and
						curled in fork-shape, a very fashionable way. He wore a crimson jacket, olive green
						trousers, and shoes of brown leather embroidered in gold; round his jacket was a
						saffron-colored girdle, his cape was of checkered turquoise blue and black, fastened
						with a large silver brooch, and on his head was a saffron yellow pointed cap with a very
						narrow brim. Now if you have counted <pb id="VAB1843-048" n="28"/> the colors in his
						clothes you will know there were six; and any Celt could have told you that meant that
						poets were thought so much of that they ranked next to kings; for no one else was
						allowed to wear six colors at once. To do so was considered a great honor, for everybody
						delighted in the brightest colors; but people who were neither kings nor poets had to be
						satisfied with five or less, according to their rank, down to the poor slaves who could
						wear only a single coarse garment of gray.</p>
					<p> Eileen's father carried in his hand a small quaintly shaped harp with strings of
						bronze; though he was not playing on it, yet as he walked along there was always a sweet
						tinkling sound. That was because fastened to his pointed cap was a musical branch such
						as all Celtic poets wore. It was curving like a little bough from a tree, only it was
						made of silver and in place of leaves was hung with tiny silver bells. This meant that
						Angus ranked as an <pb id="VAB1843-049" n="29"/> ollave, or master poet, and had studied
						his art for seven years. If he had been a poet less skillful his musical branch would
						have been bronze, while, on the other hand, the chief poet of the high king wore one of
						pure gold.</p>
					<p> But Ferdiad had already come up and been kissed three times by Angus and Fianna, and
						then they began planning the day, for next morning they were to return home.</p>
					<p> "Eileen," said her mother, "you and I will go to the merchants' booths. I want to buy
						some things before we go home, and perhaps I will get a new necklace and bracelets for
						you; then we must see the embroidering women, for the queen's ladies say they make
						beautiful things."</p>
					<p> Eileen had half wanted to go along with Ferdiad and Conn, but her eyes sparkled at the
						prospect of buying some new finery, so she was quite satisfied with her mother's
						plan.</p>
					<p> "Then you boys can put in the morning together," <pb id="VAB1843-050" n="30"/> said
						Angus, "and I will be free to practice my new song for the contest."</p>
					<p> "O, father," cried Eileen, "<hi rend="i">can't</hi> we hear it?"</p>
					<p> "No," answered Angus, "that is to be in the Hall of Feasting this evening, and only
						the chief grown folks will be there. But then," he added, seeing the disappointment in
						her face, "there are to be story-tellers on the fair green this afternoon, and you
						children can go there."</p>
					<p> So presently off they scattered, Angus strolling down to a quiet place on the river
						bank, Eileen tripping along beside her mother, while Ferdiad hurried over to the race
						course where he was to meet Conn.</p>
					<p> "Well," said the latter, who was eagerly watching for him, "you are just in time for
						the morning races. They are to be with horses and chariots to-day instead of
						hounds."</p>
					<p> Sure enough, there was a tremendous squeaking of axles as a number of two-wheeled
						chariots <pb id="VAB1843-051" n="31"/> were being driven toward the track. All were made
						of wicker strengthened by a framework of wood, and their seven-spoked wheels were rimmed
						with bronze. Some were quite open and others gayly canopied, and each held two persons;
						one who merely rode, and the charioteer who sat nearest the front and drove the
						horses.</p>
					<p> As chariot after chariot came along, the boys looked at them with interest. "Just see
						that one!" Ferdiad said, "how fine the wickerwork is and what handsome bridle reins all
						covered with red enamel!"</p>
					<p> "Yes," said Conn, "and there comes another just as fine with a blue canopy and silver
						trimmed reins."</p>
					<p> All the while the crowd was becoming larger and larger and presently an extra loud
						squeaking arose.</p>
					<p> "My!" exclaimed Ferdiad, "that must be somebody important coming! Do hear what a <pb
							id="VAB1843-052" n="32"/> noise his chariot makes!" For Celtic people thought it very
						fine to attract attention as they drove along and the more noise their wheels made the
						better they liked it.</p>
					<p> By this time everybody was looking in the same direction and as the chariot came
						nearer, "I should think it is somebody important!" said Conn. "Why, that is the high
						king! I've often seen him at Kinkora; you know his palace is there."</p>
					<p> It was Brian Boru, who had just come to the fair. In front of him walked four stalwart
						soldiers each carrying a battle ax. His chariot was of the finest wicker with a purple
						canopy embroidered in gold, and the two horses drawing it were snow-white with ears dyed
						scarlet while their long manes and tails were royal purple and their harness was richly
						decorated with gold.</p>
					<p>The chariot stopped at a wooden pavilion overlooking the race course, and the high king
							<pb id="VAB1843-053" n="33"/> alighted and took his place on a seat piled with
						deerskin cushions.</p>
					<p> The boys had been staring hard at everything. "I didn't remember Brian Boru was so
						old!" whispered Ferdiad, who had only glimpsed the high king at the fair the year
						before. "But he's handsome yet!"</p>
					<p> "Yes," said Conn, "he's far past eighty but he's mighty good-looking." Indeed, most
						Celtic kings were; for the simple reason that they were not allowed to reign if they
						bore the slightest blemish on face or body.</p>
					<p> The high king was of course dressed in six colors and his mantle of purple silk
						fringed with gold was fastened with a wonderful brooch so large that it reached from
						shoulder to shoulder. His long beard was parted fork-shape and from beneath his crown,
						which covered his head like a golden hat, his hair fell in twisted strands ornamented
						with hollow golden balls, which were thought very stylish. Around <pb id="VAB1843-054"
							n="34"/> his neck was a handsome golden torque and many rich bracelets covered his
						arms.</p>
					<p> When the high king had seated himself a group of men who had followed his chariot
						ranged themselves behind him, while the soldiers stood at each side as guard.</p>
					<p> "Who do you suppose all those people are around the high king?" said Conn. "There are
						ten, not counting the soldiers."</p>
					<p> "Well," said Ferdiad, "my foster-father told me that at important places like this at
						least ten people always go around with the high king. Let me see,-- one must be a
						bishop,--"</p>
					<p> "Yes," interrupted Conn, "he must be the one with the top of his head shaved and the
						little gold box hanging to his necklace. You know bishops carry bits of parchment with
						verses from the Bible written on them in those boxes."</p>
					<p> "Then," went on Ferdiad, "one must be a <pb id="VAB1843-055" n="35"/> chief,-- maybe
						it's that one with the red and green spotted bratt and the fine torque. And there's
						always a poet, but, of course, since Niall's dead and the high king hasn't chosen a new
						one yet, I guess that must be another chief standing where the poet belongs."</p>
					<p> "And that one with the harp and trumpets anybody knows is a musician," put in Conn,
						"and it's easy enough, too, to tell that the tall man with the leather herb bag at his
						girdle is a doctor, but who are those two standing beside him?"</p>
					<p> "I don't know which is which," said Ferdiad looking perplexed, "but they must be the
						historian and lawyer, for you can see from their looks and the colors of their clothes
						that those other three are servants."</p>
					<p> By this time a number of other kings and their followers had seated themselves in the
						pavilion, while in another one near by were various queens and their ladies all in the
						brighest <pb id="VAB1843-056" n="36"/> colors and with many flashing ornaments of
						gold.</p>
					<p> Presently the high king's musician began blowing one of his great trumpets and the
						races began. There was a sudden thud of bronze-shod hoofs swiftly printing the ground, a
						glimpse of flying manes and tails, of panting nostrils and taut glittering reins, of
						rushing chariots and charioteers straining forward with long whips in their hands, and,
						above all, the excited shouting of the crowd; all of which proves, as I have told you,
						that the Celtic people of long ago liked racing and managed it at their fairs
						surprisingly the same as we do.</p>
					<p> Of course Ferdiad and Conn stayed till the last race; then they got something to eat
						and went over to the fair green where they were to meet Eileen and hear the story
						teller. On their way they saw the high king's chariot going toward the mound where stood
						the great Hall of Feasting.</p>


					<pb id="VAB1843-057" n="37"/>



					<p> "Why," said Conn, "I thought the feast wasn't to be till this evening?"</p>
					<p> "It isn't, boy," said a man wearing a soldier's helmet and tunic with a short sword
						stuck into his girdle; one arm was thrust through the leather holder of a small round
						shield, though he carried these things only because it was the custom of soldiers, not
						that he expected to fight at the fair, for that, you know, was forbidden. "The high king
						is going to the meeting of all the kings and chiefs which they have every year in the
						Hall over there. They hold the meeting to talk over the affairs of Ireland,-- and
						there's enough to talk about now, youngsters!" went on the soldier. "The way those
						pirate Danes are coming over here in their long ships and fighting and robbing and
						burning folks' houses has got to be stopped <hi rend="i">some </hi>way," and the
						soldier's eyes flashed as he fiercely shook his round shield.</p>
					<p> "That's what my foster-father thinks!" <pb id="VAB1843-058" n="38"/> cried Ferdiad.
						"He says they have been growing bolder and bolder ever since they captured the fort at
						the Ford of the Hurdles." (This fort was on the river Liffey where the city of Dublin
						now stands.) "He says, too, he wouldn't be surprised any day to see them come up the
						Blackwater in their long boats and raid <hi rend="i"> us!"</hi></p>
					<p> "Why don't your king drive them off?" asked Co</p>
					<p> "Well," said Ferdiad, "I guess our king of Meath is as brave as anybody. But my
						foster-father says it will take more than one king's army to drive off those Danes!"</p>
					<p> "That's a true word, son!" said the soldier. "It's work for our best Celtic fighters,
						and I guess that is what the high king will tell them. And I hope the battle will soon
						be on!" And the soldier strode off looking very fierce and warlike.</p>

						<hi rend="sc"> THE STORY OF THE DEDANAANS</hi></head>

					<p> W<hi rend="sc">HEN</hi> the boys came to the fair green a large circle of people had
						already gathered to listen to the story tellers, for they liked these almost better than
						the racing. Several men in gay mantles stood in the midst of the circle tuning the small
						harps they carried; for usually parts of the stories were in poetry and this they always
						chanted to the music of their harps. Ferdiad and Conn, however, did not stop here but
						passed beyond where was a smaller group made up of the boys and girls who had come to
						the fair and who had a story teller especially for them. All were seated on the grass
						and the two lads soon found a place by Eileen who was watching for them.</p>


					<pb id="VAB1843-060" n="40"/>


					<p> "Did you have a good time this morning?" asked Ferdiad.</p>
					<p> "Yes," declared Eileen, beaming; "see this lovely torque mother bought me, and she got
						some wonderful silk of the merchants from Gaul,"-- here she paused,-- "Hush!" she
						whispered. "See! they are going to shake the chain of silence!"</p>
					<p> A tall man had arisen shaking in his hand a short chain of bronze hung with silver
						bells, and at this signal every one stopped talking, and Fergus, the story teller, stood
						up ready to begin. Those for the grown folks circle were already asking their hearers if
						they would rather listen to stories of battles, of cattle raids, courtships, fairies, or
						histories of Ireland; for to be a story teller in those days was no simple matter; one
						must study for years and was expected to have hundreds of different stories in his mind
						ready to tell at a moment's notice. It was by listening to these that the great mass <pb
							id="VAB1843-061" n="41"/> of people got not only entertainment but education.</p>
					<p> But while the grown folks were choosing, the children's story teller had decided to
						tell something of the people who had lived in Ireland before the coming of the
						Celts.</p>
					<p> "Long, long ago," he began, "our beautiful land was the home of many different people.
						One after another they came, the newcomers fighting and driving out the others, till at
						last a race called the Firbolgs held sway. After they had been here for some time, one
						day away up somewhere to the north of us a strange rose-colored cloud floated over the
						seashore, and when it melted away the Firbolgs found that a great number of strangers
						had landed from boats which they themselves at once burned, showing that they meant to
						stay."</p>
					<p> "They were the DeDanaans!" cried some of the children, "and they live now in the fairy
						mounds!" for every one had heard of these <pb id="VAB1843-062" n="42"/> marvelous
						strangers the memory of whom is still cherished in Ireland.</p>
					<p> "Yes," went on Fergus, "they were the DeDanaans; but though wise in all magic arts,
						they lived above ground and had not yet become fairies. They were a beautiful god-like
						people with fair skins and blue eyes and hair as yellow as cowslips."</p>
					<p> "Where did they come from, sir?" asked Conn, who had been listening attentively.</p>
					<p> "From the 'Land of the Ever Young,'" answered Fergus.</p>
					<p> "And where is that, sir?" ventured Conn once more.</p>
					<p> "Well, boy," said Fergus, a bit severely, "it is called also the 'Land of the Ever
						Living,' which is the same as the 'Land of the Dead,'" and Conn said no more.</p>
					<p> "The Firbolgs," continued Fergus, "talked to the DeDanaans and at first thought they
						would not fight them. Then they began saying <pb id="VAB1843-063" n="43"/> among
						themselves how slim and light were the spears of the strangers, who were a slender
						people, while their own were big and heavy like they were. So deciding they were much
						stronger and better armed, they went back and attacked the DeDanaans. But they were
						terribly fooled in the strangers, who threw their light sharp spears much faster and
						farther than the clumsy ones of the Firbolgs. So the golden-haired DeDanaans won the
						battle, though they did not drive the Firbolgs from Ireland but let them still keep a
						certain part for theirs.</p>
					<p> Now the DeDanaans were a wonderful people, full of wisdom and skilled in the arts of
						magic and in the making of beautiful things. They had come from four of the chief fairy
						cities in the Land of the Ever Young, and from each they brought a precious gift; there
						was an invincible sword, a magic spear, an enchanted cauldron from which hosts of men
						might be <pb id="VAB1843-064" n="44"/> fed and it would never be empty, but most
						wonderful of all was the Stone of Destiny, and on this all the high kings of Ireland,
						for hundreds of years, stood when they were crowned." </p>
					<p>"My foster-father said it always roared when the crown was set on the king's head!"
						broke in Ferdiad.</p>
					<p>"Yes, indeed, boy," said Fergus, "it roared like a lion; but only if the king was
						lawful. If he had no right to the crown then the stone was silent, and you may be sure
						there was trouble ahead for the false king."</p>
					<p>"Where is the stone now?" asked another boy.</p>
					<p>"Well," said Fergus, "for a long time it was kept at Tara, the ancient Celtic
						capital,"-- Here another boy broke in, "When we came to the fair, about ten miles from
						here we passed a great big mound with an earth rampart around it and old looking ruins
						that my father said was Tara. What happened to it? "</p>


					<pb id="VAB1843-065" n="45"/>
					<p> Fergus took all these interruptions in good part, for the boys' and girls' story
						teller always expected them to ask many questions.</p>
					<p> "Tara," he said, "was for ages the famous capital of all Ireland and the high king had
						his palace, built of smooth boards carved and painted, on top of the mound you saw
						protected by the rampart of earth. It was all very splendid, but long, long ago, one day
						Saint Ruadan became angry at the high king and laid a curse on Tara, and since then no
						one has dared to live there. But you know I was talking about the Stone of Destiny that
						the DeDanaans brought and which was first kept at Tara. Now about the time the curse was
						laid on the place the king of Scotland sent and begged his brother, who was high king of
						Ireland, for the loan of the stone for a year. The Scottish king wanted to stand on it
						when he was crowned. The stone was loaned to him but never again has Ireland got it
						back!"</p>


					<pb id="VAB1843-066" n="46"/>
					<p> Nor has it come back to Ireland to this day; for more than two hundred years after our
						story, the English king, Edward I, took this magic stone from Scotland to London. It is
						now the famous Coronation Stone which is part of the throne on which the English kings
						sit when they have been crowned in Westminster Abbey; and perhaps some day you may see
						it there.</p>
					<p> Meantime Fergus went on with the story of the DeDanaans. "After they had ruled in
						Ireland for a long while," he said, "another people, this time our own Celtic race, led
						by their king Miled, sailed to Ireland from somewhere away off to the east. When the
						DeDanaans saw them coming, by their magic arts they raised a terrible storm hoping in
						this way to keep the boats from landing. But though many of the boats were destroyed,
						there were such hosts of Celts that they managed in spite of the storm to land enough
						men to attack the <pb id="VAB1843-067" n="47"/>DeDanaans, who were obliged to retreat
						before them till they came right here to the Blackwater where Tailltenn is now. Here
						they made a stand and a great battle was fought, and the Celts won. But the DeDanaans
						were not driven out of Ireland, you know."</p>
					<p> "Yes," said some of the children eagerly, "we know. They are fairies now!"</p>
					<p> "That is right," said Fergus; "the DeDanaans cast a spell over themselves making them
						invisible; and this spell they can put on or off as they please, and even now they rule
						unseen over part of Ireland. Where we can see only green mounds and ruined walls, as at
						Tara, and under all the pleasant hills, there rise their fairy palaces where they live
						in continual sunshine and feast on magic meat and ale that keeps them everlastingly
						young and beautiful."</p>
					<p> "I saw a DeDanaan fairy once!" spoke up one little boy.</p>
					<p> "So did I!" declared another, and then the <pb id="VAB1843-068" n="48"/>children all
						fell to discussing and disputing about how many they had seen till Fergus had to stop
						them by telling them to scamper off for he was through for the afternoon.</p>
					<p> But the boys and girls were quite sure of what they said, and, no doubt, they were
						right, for everybody knows that to this day there are said to be more fairies in Ireland
						than in almost any other land.</p>

						<hi rend="sc"> THE HALL OF FEASTING</hi></head>

					<p> W<hi rend="sc">HEN</hi> the story telling was over and Eileen had gone back to her
						mother, Ferdiad and Conn hurried up the mound where stood the Hall of Feasting. The high
						king was to give a dinner there later on and the boys wanted to see what they could.</p>
					<p> At big open fires near the Hall cooks were busy turning spits, made of peeled hazel
						rods, on which venison and hares and wild birds were roasting. Others were tending huge
						cauldrons filled with boiling beef and sheep and little pigs. Potatoes, which we now
						call Irish but which are really American born, had not yet come to Ireland, because of
						course you know Columbus did not find America till more than four hundred years after
						our story; but there were <pb id="VAB1843-070" n="50"/>cabbages and onions and beans,
						and there were puddings and red apples and hazel nuts for dessert.</p>
					<p> "See, Conn," said Ferdiad, "the door of the Hall is open; let's go in and look
						around."</p>
					<p> "All right!" said Conn, so they went in and watched as servants spread linen cloths on
						a number of tables standing close to the walls of the long room. There were seats for
						these only on the side next the wall; for nobody was expected to have his back to the
						center of the room where the poets always sang their pieces after dinner.</p>
					<p> "These must be the tables for the kings and flaiths," said Ferdiad as they strolled
						along the room, "for see, there are the hooks in the wall for their shields."</p>
					<p> "Yes," said Conn, "and look up a little higher and you can tell exactly each king's
						place, for there are the king's-candles all ready to light," and he pointed to a number
						of bronze <pb id="VAB1843-071" n="51"/>brackets holding very large candles of beeswax
						with great bushy wicks. "And that enormous one, bigger around than I am, is where the
						high king will sit. It's just like the one that burns at the door of his palace at
						Kinkora when Brian Boru is there, and my foster-father says that when he goes to war a
						big candle like that always burns at the door of his tent at night."</p>
					<p> "I suppose where those other handsome cloths are is where the queens and their ladies
						will sit," said Ferdiad, "and down at the end of the Hall where they are spreading the
						tables with deerskin must be for the servants."</p>
					<p> At every place was laid a napkin, a platter, a cup for mead and a knife for cutting up
						the food, all of which was eaten with the fingers. In front of each was also a small
						dish of honey, of which every one was immensely fond and in which they liked to dip
						almost everything, even meat and fish.</p>


					<pb id="VAB1843-072" n="52"/>
					<p> Soon the dinner was ready and servants began bringing in great dishes of meat which
						later would be carefully carved and distributed according to the rank of the guests.
						Thus, a certain part of the roast ox was always given to kings and poets, another
						special part to queens, another to flaiths, and so on till all were served. There was
						one other part, however, that was always the choicest of all; and of this Conn whispered
						to Ferdiad, "Who do you suppose will get the hero's morsel?" For this tidbit was the
						portion of the man who was thought by everybody to have performed the bravest or most
						heroic exploit.</p>
					<p> "I don't know," answered Ferdiad, "of course there are lots of kings and chiefs here
						at the fair, but I don't know who has done the bravest thing. I dare say it will be the
						one who has fought and beaten the most Danes."</p>
					<p> Just then "Clear out now, youngsters!" said <pb id="VAB1843-073" n="53"/>an
						official-looking man, who with two others had come into the Hall and taken their places
						close by the open door.</p>
					<p> As the boys slipped out, "I guess it's time for the feast," whispered Ferdiad, "but
						let's wait outside and see the folks come."</p>
					<p> Here one of the men at the door, lifting a large trumpet he carried, blew a loud blast
						and immediately a number of squires, who had been waiting near by holding the shields of
						their masters, marched up and handed them to the second of the three men who knew every
						shield and the rank of its owner. At a second blast from the trumpet the shields were
						taken into the Hall and hung on the hooks Ferdiad had noticed in the wall over the
						tables. It was a gay sight when all were placed; most of them were small and round, some
						made of wicker covered with leather and coated with lime which shone dazzling white,
						others painted in different colors, while many were ornamented <pb id="VAB1843-074"
							n="54"/>with beautiful bands and bosses of gold and silver. When all were arranged the
						trumpeter blew a third blast, and at this the feasters began to arrive.</p>
					<p> "There comes the high king!" said Ferdiad, as the aged monarch, wrapped in a rich
						purple mantle and attended by his followers, reached the door of the Hall. As he was
						giving the feast, he stood near the entrance and greeted each guest before turning them
						over to the third of the three men at the door whose business it was to seat each man
						under his own shield and to lead the ladies to the tables spread for them.</p>
					<p> "Don't they look fine!" said Conn, as he gazed at the gayly dressed throng coming up
						the mound.</p>
					<p> "Yes, indeed!" echoed Ferdiad, "and oh, there's my foster-father!"</p>
					<p> Angus was with a group of kings and poets who came directly after the high king, and
							<pb id="VAB1843-075" n="55"/>there was a sweet tinkling of musical branches as they
						passed.</p>
					<p> "I wish my foster-father could go to the feast, too" said Conn. wistfully, flushing
						slightly at the thought that he was not of high enough rank to be one of the guests.</p>
					<p> "Never mind," said Ferdiad quickly, "I'm sure he is a brave man from what you have
						told me about him, and I don't wonder you think so much of him. I think he was mighty
						good to take me into your tent to sleep, and I know my foster-father would like to meet
						him."</p>
					<p> Conn looked pleased, and as he was not of an envious disposition, he said he hoped
						Angus would get the prize and that the high king would choose him for chief poet. "And
						oh," went on the boy, "if he does you will all come to live at Kinkora where Brian
						Boru's palace is and you know our home is near there and most likely you will go to the
						same monastery school where I go!"</p>
					<pb id="VAB1843-076" n="56"/>
					<p> "That would be fine!" exclaimed Ferdiad, "and do tell me more about Kinkora." And
						talking of this the two boys wandered off together through the long twilight.</p>
					<p> Meantime within the Hall the feasting went merrily on; by and by the dark fell and all
						the kings'-candles were lighted, and then, when the feast was over, the chain of silence
						was shaken and the poets one by one stood out and sang their songs. But we have not time
						in this story to tell of what they sang nor of how beautifully they played on their
						harps, for they were very skillful musicians as well as makers of songs. Many fine poems
						were thus given, but, of course, Angus won the prize of the jeweled ring and was chosen
						by the high king to be his chief poet, while over his shoulders was hung the wonderful
						mantle of feathers, which was worn only by chief poets, and his silver musical branch
						was replaced by one of pure gold.</p>
					<p> I say of course this happened to Angus, because <pb id="VAB1843-077" n="57"/>Eileen
						was quite sure it would, and so was Ferdiad, and so was I when he came into this story
						which must move now for awhile to Kinkora; for Angus and his family would be expected to
						live in the poet's house by the palace of Brian Boru.</p>
					<p> But before we go to Kinkora I must tell you how Ferdiad went with his foster-parents
						and Eileen back to their home near Kells where Angus wished to arrange his affairs
						before quitting it for the court of the high king.</p>

					<head rend="center">CHAPTER VI <lb/>
						<hi rend="sc"> KELLS IS RAIDED </hi></head>
					<p> T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> curragh in which they had come to the fair was pointed up the
						Blackwater which it parted in long ripples of silver as Ferdiad and Angus pulled at the
						oars. They were all very proud and happy over the honor Angus had won the night before,
						and Eileen had hugged and kissed him and begged to hear all about it.</p>
					<p> But "There, child," said her father, "I will tell you by and by. We must hurry now to
						reach Kells, for you know we want to stop there to see the new high-cross they have been
						putting up, and we must be home by dark, for we cannot sleep in the curragh neither can
						we camp in the forests; there are too many bears!"</p>
					<p> Indeed, for much of their way after leaving <pb id="VAB1843-079" n="59"/>Tailltenn the
						great trees came close to the water's edge and in their deep shadows prowled many
						dangerous beasts; for a large part of Ireland was still wild and unsettled. Now and then
						they passed open bog lands with perhaps a glimpse of blue mountain tops in the distance;
						and sometimes the river led through meadows where cows and sheep were grazing near the
						homes of their owners. As I have told you, most of the Celtic people lived in the
						country and their homes, which they called "raths" were much alike. There was always a
						round or oblong house in the middle of a piece of ground enclosed by a circular wall of
						earth often planted on top with a prickly hedge to better protect the place from the
						attack of enemies or wild beasts.</p>
					<p> Even the palaces of the kings were built much the same, only larger and finer, and
						they were called "duns" instead of raths.</p>
					<p> But the curragh on the Blackwater had been <pb id="VAB1843-080" n="60"/>making good
						progress and before long they could glimpse through the trees the stone walls of Kells,
						while clustering about rose the thatched roofs of the round wattled huts where lived the
						young students.</p>
					<p>For Kells was not a town but a monastery where a number of monks lived and studied and
						taught, and in their spare time made beautiful painted books. There were many such
						places in Ireland and the Celtic monks had become so famous for their learning that
						people not only from their own country but even from Britain and Gaul (which we now call
						England and France), sent their sons to be educated by them. Much of Europe was then
						very heathenish and ignorant, and had it not been for those Celtic monks, many of whom
						went as missionaries and started schools in other countries, the world would not be
						nearly so wise as it is to-day.</p>
					<p> As they now drew near Kells, "Shall we go to the monastery landing?" asked
						Ferdiad.</p>
					<pb id="VAB1843-081" n="61"/>
					<p> "No," said Angus, "I see the monks working at the new high-cross on the hill yonder.
						We will land there and go up and look at it."</p>
					<p> In a few minutes they had all climbed to the hill top where the new stone cross had
						just been put in place. It was very large, more than twice as high as a tall man, and
						wonderfully carved with scenes from the Bible as it was meant to tell its story to
						people who had no books of their own. There are to-day more than fifty of these great
						Celtic crosses standing on the hills of Ireland and artists from many countries copy
						them because of their beauty.</p>
					<p> "Oh, father, isn't it fine!" cried Eileen.</p>
					<p> "Yes, indeed!" said Angus; "it is one of the finest I have seen. Who of you made it?"
						he asked, turning to the monks who were standing by.</p>
					<p> One of them was about to answer him when <pb id="VAB1843-082" n="62"/>suddenly there
						came a sharp jangle of bells from a tall round tower of stone near the monastery.</p>
					<p> "Hark" cried the monk, and as they all paused a moment, there came another wild peal
						of the bells, and crashing through the woods beyond Kells they could see a score or more
						people from the country round about running frantically for the tower. Some were
						carrying children in their arms and others driving before them a few cows or sheep,
						while from the door of the monastery the brown-robed monks were already pouring out,
						their arms filled with precious books and such sacred things of gold and silver as they
						had been able to snatch from the altar of the monastery church. For everywhere the young
						students were running about shouting <hi rend="i">"The Danes! The Danes!" </hi>and
						everybody knew that those fierce pirate raiders from across the northern sea were
						heathens who thought no more of stripping a Christian <pb id="VAB1843-083" n="63"/>altar
						than of driving off a herd of cattle and killing their helpless owner.</p>
					<p> "Can you see them coming yet?" asked Angus anxiously of the monks.</p>
					<p> "No," they said, "they are probably burning the raths they have raided, but they will
						be here quickly! We must hurry to reach the tower!" For the monks were no fighters, and,
						moreover, they all knew they would be far outnumbered by the raiders.</p>
					<p> Angus at once snatched up Eileen, who was screaming from fright, and bidding Fianna
						and Ferdiad to follow, they all ran like deer down the hill.</p>
					<p> By this time the country folk had given up hope of saving their cattle and sheep and
						were trying only to save themselves as both they and the monks and their pupils crowded
						to the foot of the tower and scrambled as fast as they could up a wooden ladder which
						led to a door high above the ground. For the tower was <pb id="VAB1843-084" n="64"/>not
						only a belfry for the monastery church but also a place of refuge from just such sudden
						attacks as the Danes were now making. And how often these places of refuge were needed
						in those wild warring times is proven by the many ancient towers, solitary and deserted,
						which still rise from innumerable Irish hills and valleys. And very good strongholds
						they were when every one was inside, the ladder drawn up and the great door barred. If
						the raiders tried to come too close they were apt to get their heads cracked by a few of
						the big stones of which there was always a good supply to be dropped from the high
						windows.</p>
					<p> As Angus and the rest now joined the others at the foot of the ladder, Angus saw that
						Fianna and Eileen got safely in and then telling Ferdiad to climb up too, turned to see
						if he could help the others. But Ferdiad waited to pick up a child that was lost from
						its parents and runing about crying helplessly. He handed it up <pb id="VAB1843-085"
							n="65"/>to safety, and just then a group of belated country people came screaming that
						the Danes were at their heels!</p>
					<p> At this there was a wild rush for the ladder by those who were still outside. Angus,
						who supposed Ferdiad had gone in long before, climbed in with the last of the monks he
						had been helping, and in the struggle to gain the door no one noticed that Ferdiad was
						pushed off the ladder by a burly countryman wild with terror, and that the lad fell,
						some distance to the ground.</p>
					<p> For a few moments he lay stunned, and when he came to himself the ladder was drawn up
						as out of the forest came rushing a troop of wild Danes. Some wore chain armor and
						helmets with cows' horns fastened in front making them look like demons, while others
						were clad in tunics made from the shaggy skins of beasts; but all carried shields and
						spears and short swords and were shouting in loud fierce voices.</p>


					<pb id="VAB1843-086" n="66"/>

					<p>Ferdiad's heart quaked and he crouched back at the foot of the tower where he had
						fallen and where, luckily, some bushes made a fairly good screen.</p>
					<p>When the raiders came nearer and found there was nobody to fight, part of them began
						swarming into the monastery and church and huts of the pupils looking for anything on
						which they might lay hands, while others started driving off the flocks of the country
						folks, and still others quarreled among themselves over the booty they had brought from
						the raths they had afterward destroyed.</p>
					<p>Ferdiad, who had all the while been looking sharply about, all at once fairly held his
						breath as his gaze fell on a sheltered nook in the monastery wall. The Danes being for
						the time busy elsewhere none of them saw as did Ferdiad that a monk, clutching his robe
						as if trying to hide something beneath it, had seemingly crawled out of the wall and was
						creeping <pb id="VAB1843-087" n="67"/> through the bushes in the direction of the tower.
						Ferdiad guessed at once that he had come out of the underground chambers; and sure
						enough, the tangle of bushes hid a hole in the wall just big enough for a man's body.
						This hole was the opening of a secret passage leading from the bee-hive shaped stone
						chambers such as were built under most monasteries and important houses as a place to
						hide valuables or the people themselves if attacked too suddenly for them to reach the
						nearest round tower.</p>
					<p>Now this monk of Kells, Brother Giles, had been with the last of those fleeing from the
						monastery when all at once he had remembered the most precious thing in all Kells and
						which no one else had thought to try to save. This was the marvelous angel book of Saint
						Columkille of which Ferdiad had told Conn the monks said there was no other like it in
						all the world! That it could for a moment have been forgotten would seem unbelievable
						were it not that <pb id="VAB1843-088" n="68"/> every one knows that when people are
						frightened and must pick out what they most care for, as at a fire, they often bring
						away very silly things and leave the best of all behind.</p>
					<p> At any rate, the moment the monk thought of the book he rushed back and snatched it
						from the drawer where it was kept, then, finding the Danes were already coming toward
						the door of the monastery, he hurried down the winding stair to the underground
						chambers, hoping to hide there. But in a few moments the Danes discovered the stair and
						he could hear them groping their way down, for it was very dark there. At this he began
						stealthily to feel his way to the secret passage, and because of the darkness he managed
						to escape from the raiders who were poking in corners for what plunder they could find.
						The monk, hiding the precious book in its golden case, had just come out of the passage
						when Ferdiad saw him.</p>
					<p>As the boy looked, suddenly Brother Giles <pb id="VAB1843-089" n="[]"/>
						<pb id="VAB1843-090" n="[]"/>
						<figure>
							<p> "<hi rend="sc">FERDIAD'S EYES GREW WIDE WITH HORROR</hi>" </p>
						</figure>
						<pb id="VAB1843-091" n="69"/>straightened up and made a dash for the tower hoping to
						reach it before the Danes saw him.</p>
					<p> Forgetting his own danger, Ferdiad tried to call to him that the ladder was up, but
						could not make him hear. But the poor monk had scarcely run half way till with a fierce
						shout one of the raiders started in pursuit. Ferdiad's eyes grew wide with horror as the
						monk sprang forward desperately only to sink lifeless on the ground beneath the sharp
						thrust of a Danish sword. As the man paused a moment Ferdiad could see his wild cruel
						face and red-scarred forehead, then suddenly as the dead monk's robe fell apart the Dane
						caught the gleam of the golden case which held the painted book, and snatching it up
						greedily ran off with it before Ferdiad's strained gaze could make out just what the
						object was.</p>
					<p> In a little while the other raiders came out of the monastery, having stripped it of
						every bit of gold and silver they could find, and as they <pb id="VAB1843-092" n="70"
						/>could not set fire to the stone buildings they had to content themselves with burning
						the thatched huts of the students. While these were still smoldering they took
						themselves off toward the seacoast, driving before them the sheep and cows they had
						stolen from the country folk.</p>
					<p> As soon as they were sure it was all over, the people one by one crept down from the
						tower, the country folk going sadly back to try patiently to rebuild their desolate
						homes while the monks began to set things in order about Kells.</p>
					<p> Everybody was amazed and delighted to find Ferdiad had escaped with his life, though
						of course no one had known he was not safe in the tower. The body of Brother Giles was
						borne sorrowfully into the monastery; and then, when they began to bring back the gold
						and silver things they had saved and to take stock of what the Danes had stolen, first
						of all the Abbot discovered that Saint Columkille's book was gone. He was filled with
						dismay and remorse <pb id="VAB1843-093" n="71"/>that he had forgotten it, and kept
						muttering despairingly "The angel book of the blessed Saint Columkille! May all the
						saints forgive me!"</p>
					<p> The monks, too, looked at each other white and terrified, fearing a curse upon Kells
						because of their unbelievable carelessness. For none of them knew that Brother Giles had
						given his life in the vain effort to save the beautiful book, and they felt sure that
						the Celtic people would blame them when it was known the precious volume was lost, for
						it was even then famous in Ireland.</p>
					<p> As Ferdiad heard them lamenting, presently an idea occurred to him. "Reverend Father,"
						he said to the Abbot, "perhaps it was Saint Columkille's book that Brother Giles was
						carrying when the Dane struck him. I saw the man take something from his robe as he lay
						on the ground, but could only get a flash of gold. I couldn't see just what it was, as
						the Dane turned <pb id="VAB1843-094" n="72"/>from me when he picked it up and he ran off
						right away."</p>
					<p> The Abbot listened gravely, but only said, "Perhaps, boy. But it might have been a
						golden candlestick you saw; we had many such. And even if it was the book, the Dane will
						care for nothing but the gold of its case and will surely destroy it when he rejoins his
						people and looks at it; they have burned countless precious volumes before this!" and
						the Abbot sighed bitterly.</p>
					<p> But, somehow, Ferdiad got it into his head that the book the angels had made would not
						be destroyed, and he wished more than anything else that some day he might find it.</p>
					<p> Meantime, Angus, seeing there was really nothing he could do to help restore order at
						the monastery, had brought down the curragh and he and Ferdiad had moored it at their
						landing. Fortunately their rath, being on the other side of the river from Kells, had
						escaped harm.</p>

					<head rend="center">CHAPTER VII <hi rend="sc"> THE NEW HOME AT KINKORA</hi></head>

					<p> A<hi rend="sc">NGUS</hi> had disposed of his home rath to a bo-aire who had given in
						exchange many bags of wheat and silver rings and gold torques and necklaces. Then,
						loading in an ox-cart such things as they wished to take with them to Kinkora, they had
						set out for the river Shannon; for as Brian Boru's palace was on the bank of that river
						it was easier to make the main journey by boat.</p>
					<p> Eileen and her mother and Ferdiad rode in the cart with the driver, but Angus came
						beside them on a horse, which was considered the only proper way for a poet to ride; his
						horse had a single bridle and he guided and urged it on, not by a whip, but a small rod
						of carved yew wood having a curved end with a goad.</p>
					<pb id="VAB1843-096" n="74"/>
					<p> They all greatly enjoyed the journey both by land and water, and slept soundly every
						night at some comfortable brewy, which was the Celtic name for an inn; though, unlike
						our inns, they were places of free entertainment. Indeed, there were no other kind among
						the Celts, who thought so highly of hospitality that at every place where four important
						roads met they built a brewy. It was thought a great honor to be a brewy master and it
						was usually given to a man who had served his country well. He was given also a large
						piece of public farm land and many sheep and cows and was expected always to have food
						and beds ready for travelers. And lest any one should miss his way, a servant stood
						always at the cross roads to point out the brewy.</p>
					<p> In this way they made the journey to Kinkora and were soon settled in their new
						home.</p>
					<p> The second morning after their arrival, Ferdiad was in a meadow near by knocking <pb
							id="VAB1843-097" n="75"/>about a leather ball with a bronze tipped stick when suddenly
						he threw it down, crying delightedly, "Well, Conn! We have been here two days and I
						wondered why you didn't come!" and he ran to meet his friend whose red head had just
						flamed in sight.</p>
					<p> Conn laughed with pleasure. "I came the first chance I had," he panted, "and I ran the
						last half mile. My foster-father has been sick and I had to tend the cows and sheep so I
						couldn't get away before. How do you like it here?" he added, looking eagerly around.
						Then, seeing the ball and stick, "Oh," he cried, "why didn't I bring my stick and we
						could have had a game of hurley!"</p>
					<p> "Never mind," said Ferdiad, "come and see where we live now."</p>
					<p> "It's inside the high king's dun, isn't it?" asked Conn, looking toward the great
						earthen wall faced with stone and cement that rose near by enclosing the palace of Brian
						Boru.</p>
					<pb id="VAB1843-098" n="76"/>

					<p> "Yes," answered Ferdiad, "you know the king's poet and doctor and lawyer and the rest
						of the folks that always attend him have houses inside the dun."</p>
					<p> "I know," said Conn, "and these scattered around through the fields are for the
						millers and farmers and cloth-makers and everybody who does things for the palace
						folks."</p>
					<p> By this time the boys had come opposite the doorway in the great circular wall and had
						begun to weave their way among a number of tall upright stones, each as large as a man
						and placed as irregularly as if a lot of people running toward the dun had suddenly been
						petrified. It was like playing hide and seek for the boys to try to keep together.</p>
					<p>"Well," said Ferdiad, as at last they stood before the open door of heavy oaken beams,
						"the king of Meath has stones before the wall of his dun, only not half so many as
						these!"</p>
					<p> "They're a wonderful protection," said <pb id="VAB1843-099" n="77"/>Conn, "and if any
						army tried to attack Brian Boru's palace they would have a mighty hard time getting
						inside the dun, for, of course, they would have to make their way between the stones a
						few at a time, just like we did."</p>
					<p> Here the boys stepped inside the enclosure. They did not need to use the small log
						knocker which lay in a niche in a stone pillar beside the door, as the latter stood open
						with the keeper blinking in the sun. They crossed a wooden bridge over a moat and this
						brought them to the door of a second wall of earth thickly planted on top with hazel
						bushes. Passing through this they came to the very large green space in the center of
						which was a low mound where stood the wooden palace of Brian Boru. Dotted around near
						the earthen rampart were a number of round wattled houses where, as Ferdiad had said,
						the chief attendants of the high king lived.</p>
					<p> "I've been here before," said Conn, who had <pb id="VAB1843-100" n="78"/>often brought
						things from the farm of his foster-father, "and I've peeped inside the palace once or
						twice when the high king was away, but I haven't been in any of the chiefs' houses.
						Which is yours?" --"Oh, I see!" he added, laughing, as Eileen, catching sight of him,
						came running from an open doorway.</p>
					<p> "Come in, Conn" she cried, seizing both his hands. "Isn't our house pretty? It has
						stripes just like the queen's house at the fair!" and she pointed to the red and blue
						and green bands painted on the plaster that overlaid the wattled walls. "And see how
						nice it is inside!" she went on, leading Conn within.</p>
					<p> "Yes," said Conn, "it is very pretty," and he gazed admiringly around. In the center
						of the house was a carved pole supporting the thatched roof, in which was a hole to let
						out the smoke when it was cold enough to build a fire on the earthen floor now strewn
						with rushes. There were several low tables and <pb id="VAB1843-101" n="79"/>seats
						cushioned with white fleeces, and around the wall behind partitions of wickerwork stood
						the beds with posts fixed in the ground.</p>
					<p> "I helped weave the coverlids!" said Eileen with pride as they peeped into these tiny
						bedrooms, "My loom is in our greenan," and she led the way to a separate little house
						shining white in the sun and covered with vines. For no Celtic home was considered
						complete without such a little bower, or greenan as they called it, for the mistress and
						her friends, and it was always placed in the pleasantest and sunniest spot.</p>
					<p> Here Ferdiad called "Come on, Conn, let's go and take a look in the palace and around
						the dun. The high king and most of the flaiths have gone deer hunting and father Angus
						is practicing a new poem, so we'll poke around awhile and then after dinner maybe we can
						find somebody to tell us a story."</p>
					<p> As the boys ran off together, "Be sure and <pb id="VAB1843-102" n="80"/>show Conn the
						queen's greenan all thatched with bird wings!" called Eileen, and Conn smiled, for he
						had often seen the greenan with its wonderful roof of feathers which were arranged in
						glistening stripes of white and many colors. So, too, he had seen the great banquet hall
						of Brian Boru, though he looked in again to please Ferdiad. It was built much in the
						style of the Hall of Feasting at the Tailltenn fair, only handsomer and more gayly
						painted, and the heavy door of carved yew wood and the posts on either side were
						elaborately ornamented with gold and silver and bronze. As they looked inside, "There is
						where father Angus sits when there is a feast," said Ferdiad, pointing to a seat at one
						of the long tables next to the high king's throne-like chair.</p>
					<p> Back of the banquet hall was a kitchen with open fires and spits for roasting and
						cauldrons for boiling. There was also on the mound another large wooden house with
						living rooms <pb id="VAB1843-103" n="81"/>and curtained beds, although all the more
						important folks had each a little round sleeping house all to himself.</p>
					<p> Outside the main dun were several smaller circular enclosures protected by ramparts,
						and in these were stables for the horses and chariots, sheds for cows and sheep and
						pigs, granaries for wheat and barley, and kennels for the great fierce wolf-hounds that
						were loosed every night to guard the dun from unwelcome visitors.</p>
					<p> By the time the boys had seen everything dinner was ready and afterward Ferdiad begged
						Angus to tell them a story. "It needn't be a long one," he said, "but Conn and I have
						been looking at the big wolf-hounds of the high king and we wish you would tell us about
						how Cuculain got his name."</p>
					<p> Angus smiled, for he knew the boys had heard many times of the exploits of Cuculain
						(whose name means "the Hound of Culain"), the most famous of all the Celtic heroes, but
						he <pb id="VAB1843-104" n="82"/>knew also that made no matter for the boys loved to hear
						the same stories over and over. So they went out under a quicken tree near the house
						where Angus sat on a bench while Ferdiad and Conn stretched out on the grass at his
						feet.</p>

					<head rend="center"> CHAPTER VIII <lb/>
						<hi rend="sc">HOW CUCULAIN GOT HIS NAME</hi></head>

					<p> "Y<hi rend="sc">ou</hi> know," began Angus, "it was in the brave days of the Red
						Branch Knights, hundreds and hundreds of years ago. Every summer these famous warriors
						used to go to the dun of Concobar Mac Nessa, king of Ulster, which is in the northern
						part of Ireland, and while there they would practice drills and hold contests of
						strength and go through all sorts of feats of arms.</p>
					<p> "One summer when they were thus visiting King Concobar, on a certain day a great flock
						of birds alighted on the wheat fields and began to eat the ripe grain. The king and a
						party of his knights went out with slings and stones to drive them off. But the birds
						kept flying farther <pb id="VAB1843-106" n="84"/>and farther away till at last when it
						grew dark they had lured King Concobar and the rest to where a fairy mound rose from the
						banks of the river Boyne.</p>
					<p> "When they looked about for somewhere to sleep, they could find only a tumble-down
						hut, and with this they had to content themselves; that is, all but one of the knights
						who went exploring further till he saw an opening in the fairy mound and entering it he
						came to a beautiful house and was met at the door by a handsome young man who told him
						his name was Lugh of the Strong Arm. In a little while the young man's wife came in and
						the knight stared with surprise for he recognized her as Dectera, a lovely girl who with
						fifty of her maidens had disappeared from the court of King Concobar a whole year
						before.</p>
					<p> "When the knight went back to the hut where the others were and told what he had seen,
						King Concobar at once sent for Dectera <pb id="VAB1843-107" n="85"/>to return to the
						court with him. She refused, but next morning they found in the hut her beautiful baby
						boy whom she had sent as a gift to the people of Ulster, for the Druids had made
						wonderful prophecies about what a great hero he should be."</p>
					<p> "Who were the Druids?" asked Conn.</p>
					<p> "Why," said Angus, "they were the priests of long ago, before the blessed Saint
						Patrick came and taught our Celtic people about Christ and started the Christian
						religion in Ireland.</p>
					<p> "But everybody in King Concobar's time believed what the Druids said," went on Angus,
						"so the Red Branch Knights took the baby back with them and found a nurse for him, and
						the king gave him a large piece of land and a rath for his inheritance and he was named
						Setanta. By and by, when he was seven years old, he was sent to be brought up in the
						court and be a foster-son of King Concobar. He was a fine strong boy and soon excelled
						all the other boys <pb id="VAB1843-108" n="86"/>at court in running and leaping and
						riding horseback and shooting with bow and arrow and in hurling the spear, and all the
						things you boys now are being taught.</p>
					<p> "Now one summer, when Setanta was about ten, King Concobar and some of the knights who
						had come again for the yearly practice in arms, decided to pay a two days' visit to
						their friend a flaith named Culain who lived a number of miles from the king's palace.
						When they were ready to start they asked Setanta to go with them, but he was busy
						playing a game of hurley and wanted to finish it; so he said he would come later in the
						afternoon.</p>
					<p> "The king's party went on, and Culain welcomed them and spread a great feast and by
						the time they had finished it was quite late in the evening, and they had forgotten all
						about Setanta. Then all at once they heard a most ferocious baying outside."</p>
					<p> "Yes," cried Ferdiad, for the boys were <pb id="VAB1843-109" n="87"/>very fond of this
						story, "it was the hound of Culain that had been let loose to guard the rath for the
						night, and it was as big and fierce as that lion beast that lives across the sea
						somewhere and everybody is so afraid of! One of the merchants from the south of Gaul
						told us about it at the fair."</p>
					<p> "I have heard of the lion," said Angus, "and they say it is very terrible, but I
						believe I would as soon meet it as one of our Celtic wolf-hounds on guard. As the folks
						in Culain's rath listened the noise grew louder as if the hound was fighting fiercely.
						At this they rushed out--"</p>
					<p> "And there stood Setanta with his foot on the dead hound!" broke in Conn
						excitedly.</p>
					<p>"Yes," said Angus, "when it sprang on him he had seized it by the throat and killed it
						all by himself. The king and knights were amazed and they carried Setanta into the house
						and declared he would be a great hero. But while they were all exclaiming about
						Setanta's <pb id="VAB1843-110" n="88"/>feat, Culain stood apart, sad and silent; for he
						thought a great deal of his hound that had guarded his rath faithfully for years.</p>
					<p> "As soon as Setanta noticed this, he said courteously to Culain that he was sorry he
						had been obliged to kill his hound, but that if he would give him a young dog he would
						train it so well that in a few years it would be as brave and faithful as the hound he
						had lost. And he said that meantime, if Culain would give him a spear and shield, he
						himself would stay and guard the rath from all harm."</p>
					<p> "Wasn't that splendid of Setanta!" exclaimed Ferdiad.</p>
					<p> "Yes, indeed!" answered Angus, "and from that time on he was called 'Cuculain,' and
						every one who knows the stories of our Celtic heroes knows that his is the most famous
						name of all. But that will do for to-day," and Angus rose to go into the house.</p>
					<p> "I must go, too," said Conn, and as the boys <pb id="VAB1843-111" n="89"/>strolled
						together to the door of the dun, he added, "Next week school begins in the monastery
						over on the hill. I'll see you there, won't I?"</p>
					<p> "Yes," said Ferdiad, "father Angus says that is where I am to go, so good-by till
						then."</p>

					<head rend="center"> CHAPTER IX <lb/>
						<hi rend="sc"> ON THE MARCH</hi>
					</head>
					<p> F<hi rend="sc">ERDIAD</hi> found the Kinkora school very interesting. Every day when
						the weather was pleasant the boys gathered in the cloister courtyard where the monks
						taught them out of doors. If it was cold or rainy they went inside to a schoolroom where
						the vellum books were kept in leather satchels hanging from wooden pegs ranged round the
						walls. The boys all had long narrow tablets of wood coated with wax, and with a slender
						rod of metal they wrote on these the things they must specially remember. They learned
						grammar, a little geography in rime, some Latin and various bits of wisdom called
						"oghams," and every school year they must memorize at least ten new poems and stories;
						for these were thought a very important part <pb id="VAB1843-113" n="91"/>of school
						work. Ferdiad and Conn sat side by side and told the stories over and over to each
						other, and were always delighted to get a new one.</p>
					<p> Meantime, Eileen was taught at home, where besides her lessons she learned to spin and
						weave and sew and embroider. There were several other girls and boys whose
						foster-parents were among the attendants of the high king and queen, and with these they
						had many merry times. Conn came often to see them, and as the autumn wore away the boys
						went nutting and hunting and fishing together.</p>
					<p> When winter came it was not very cold, but fires were lighted and in the evenings they
						played chess and checkers and listened to stories and poems and music; for Brain Boru
						loved such things and always did his best to encourage scholars and poets and
						artists.</p>
					<p> But though life passed happily enough for the boys and girls, the faces of the older
						people <pb id="VAB1843-114" n="92"/>began to grow more and more anxious as the weeks
						went on. Now and again Ferdiad and Eileen would hear talk of some fresh raid by the
						Danes, who were all the while growing bolder and bolder.</p>
					<p> Sometimes Conn came with tales he had heard, and one day he said to Ferdiad: "My
						foster-father says there's bound to be a fight before long, or those Danes will just
						settle themselves here in Ireland and we never can drive them out!"</p>
					<p> "That's what father Angus thinks, too," said Ferdiad. "He says as soon as spring comes
						Brian Boru will get all the Celtic kings together and start out after the Danes and
						there will be a big battle somewhere."</p>
					<p> And sure enough, as the winter passed, more and more messengers came and went from
						Kinkora as the high King completed his plans; and every one around the palace talked of
						the Danes and how they must be conquered.</p>
					<pb id="VAB1843-115" n="93"/>
					<p> "Do you know, Ferdiad," said Conn excitedly one day, "folks say the banshee Aibell has
						been seen by the O'Brien of Killaloe, and she has given him a magic cloak that will make
						him invisible as he fights in the battle?"</p>
					<p> "Who is Aibell?" asked Ferdiad.</p>
					<p> "Oh, I forgot," said Conn, "you haven't lived here long enough to know. She is the
						fairy queen who specially guards the flaith O'Brien. He's a great champion and lives at
						Killaloe, not far from here. Aibell is famous around here and her palace is under the
						rock of Craglea in a glen near the O'Brien's home."</p>
					<p> "Well," said Ferdiad, "I hadn't heard about Aibell, but I did hear that a flock of
						roysten crows flew eastward last night, and some say the battle witches often take the
						shape of crows and fly ahead when war is coming."</p>
					<p> The next day the two boys had still more exciting things to talk about. "Oh, Conn!"
							<pb id="VAB1843-116" n="94"/>cried Ferdiad, "what do you think? <hi rend="i">We
						</hi>are going, tool The high King will take along quite a number of the boys from here
						to run errands, and father Angus says that you can go with the group from the palace
						because you and I are such friends!"</p>
					<p> "Oh, good!" cried Conn, his eyes dancing.</p>
					<p>"My foster-father and my own father both are going with the soldiers and I suppose
						quite an army will start from here."</p>
					<p> "Yes," said Ferdiad, "some of the Celtic kings and their soldiers will come here to
						start with Brian Boru and the rest will meet him in the kingdom of Meath, near where the
						river Liffey empties into the sea, and I am sure my own father, too, will be with the
						Meath army. They say a lot of the Danes have been camping all winter at the Ford of the
						Hurdles, and the high King means to attack them somewhere near there."</p>
					<p> So the preparations went on; and by and by, <pb id="VAB1843-117" n="95"/>when April
						came and the hawthorn trees began to bloom and the fields were full of buttercups, the
						Celtic kings with their poets and attendants began to arrive in chariots, while their
						soldiers followed on foot. The more important folks were entertained inside the dun, and
						the common soldiers pitched their tents in the fields without.</p>
					<p> In a few days more Eileen and her mother waved a tearful good-by to Angus and Ferdiad
						and Conn as they took their places in the great host that wound out of the dun and
						across the fields to the east. At the head went Brian Boru and after him the kings and
						flaiths riding in chariots, while the poets cantered along on horseback, their musical
						branches tinkling and their heads full of the battle songs they would chant when the
						time came. There were also musicians and story tellers and jugglers to provide
						entertainment when they camped at night, and doctors and priests to attend those who <pb
							id="VAB1843-118" n="96"/>would be wounded and dying in the fight. The soldiers trudged
						along on foot and the baggage followed in ox-carts. Ferdiad and Conn and the other boys
						marched along with the rest and whenever they were wanted to carry message or do any
						service the buglers called them, and when they got tired marching they could climb in
						the ox-carts and ride for a while.</p>
					<p> "How long will it take us to get to the seacoast? Do you know?" asked Conn of
						Ferdiad.</p>
					<p> "Father Angus said it would be over a week," said Ferdiad, "but I don't care how long
						it takes. I think it will be lots of fun, especially when we camp at night!"</p>
					<p> And Ferdiad was right. The boys greatly enjoyed the march, and, best of all, the
						evenings when the tents were pitched, the protecting wall of earth thrown up around the
						camp, the fires made and supper being cooked. Later on, when the great king's-candle was
						lighted <pb id="VAB1843-119" n="97"/>at the door of Brian Boru's tent, story telling and
						singing and all sorts of fun went on.</p>
					<p> At last they drew near the mouth of the river Liffey and began to smell the salt air
						of the sea; and on a plain near its shore they made their camp. Close behind rose the
						Hill of Howth, and not far off the sea glittered and gleamed as the ebbing waves laid
						bare a wide strand of bowlders covered with long green water weeds. By and by, when the
						tide would come sweeping in, the great foaming breakers would roar and rumble over the
						stones like a herd of angry, bellowing bulls, and for this reason the Celtic people
						called the seashore there "Clontarf," which means in their language the "Lawn of the
						Bulls," a name which it bears to this day.</p>
					<p> Ferdiad and Conn, who had not before seen the ocean, delighted in watching the curling
						green breakers and wading out as far as they dared. But they did not have much time to
							<pb id="VAB1843-120" n="98"/>play, as the next day, which was Palm Sunday, they had
						many errands to do.</p>
					<p> On that morning all the other Celtic kings joined Brian Boru's army, bringing with
						them their hosts of fighting men dressed, as were all the rest of the Celtic soldiers,
						in tunics of yellow linen; they had no armor because they thought it cowardly to wear it
						and protected only their heads with leather helmets and the front of their legs from the
						knee down with pieces of brown leather. The kings and flaiths did not wear even these,
						but were arrayed in silk and gay linen bratts and tunics and gold chains and bracelets
						quite as if they were going to a feast instead of a fight.</p>
					<p> Ferdiad and Conn were very busy for the next three or four days, and finally, Thursday
						evening, Ferdiad said, "I believe they will fight soon now. I wouldn't wonder if it
						would be to-morrow!"</p>
					<p> "Why," said Conn, "that's Good Friday! <pb id="VAB1843-121" n="99"/>I shouldn't think
						Brian Boru would pick such a holy day to fight. You know he is so religious."</p>
					<p> "He is," said Ferdiad, "but I heard the soldiers talking about a prophecy of a Dane
						soothsayer. I don't know how they found out about it, but the prophecy says if the
						battle is on Good Friday our Celts will win, though the high king will be killed. Of
						course nobody wants Brian Boru killed, but the soldiers say they want to fight to-morrow
						on account of the first part of the prophecy and that they can ward off the last part
						easy enough as they are sure the high king won't be in the fight because of the day and
						they will keep an extra strong guard around him besides."</p>
					<p> "What does Brian Boru say?" asked Conn. "Did you hear?"</p>
					<p> "They say he has the battle all planned and is willing for it to be to-morrow, though,
						as the soldiers thought, he himself won't touch weapons on Good Friday because it's
						against <pb id="VAB1843-122" n="100"/>his religion. It seems to me he is too old to
						fight anyway!"</p>
					<p> "Don't you think it" said Conn. "He is mighty brave and a good fighter yet, if he <hi
							rend="i">is</hi> 'way past eighty!"</p>
					<p> That night there were no poets' songs nor story telling nor jugglers' tricks, for
						everybody was on the alert for the coming battle. The two boys curled up side by side in
						one of the ox-carts and, like all the rest of the Celtic host on this night, they did
						not take off their clothes. Far off in the distance they could see the watchfires of the
						Danes at the Ford of the Hurdles, and they went to sleep talking excitedly of the
						morrow.</p>

					<head rend="center"> CHAPTER X <lb/>
						<hi rend="sc">THE BATTLE OF CLONTARF</hi></head>
					<p> S <hi rend="sc">URE </hi> enough, at daybreak the next morning there rose the sound of
						wild war cries as the Celts rushed out from their camp toward the Ford of the Hurdles.
						The full tide was roaring and bellowing across the Lawn of the Bulls, but its noise was
						quite drowned as with fierce cries of their own the Danes sprang to meet them.</p>
					<p>"Hark! Hark!" exclaimed Ferdiad as he and Conn jumped from the ox-cart where they had
						slept, "the fight has begun!" As none of the boys were allowed in the way of the battle
						but had been ordered to stay behind the lines, "Let's run up the side of the Hill of
						Howth," he said, "we can at least see it from <pb id="VAB1843-124" n="102"/> there. My,
						how I wish we could be in it!"</p>
					<p>"Don't you though!" cried Conn longingly as they scrambled up the steep grassy slopes.
						There were others also watching from the Hill; the doctors who must be ready to help the
						wounded, the priests to comfort the dying, and the historians to write down just what
						went on. For the Celts liked to keep an account of all their doings.</p>
					<p>The boys stood near these, and as the fight became fiercer and fiercer of course they
						grew more and more excited.</p>
					<p>"I wonder where the high king is?" said Conn.</p>
					<p>"I don't know," answered Ferdiad,-- then, "Look!" he cried, "I believe he is over
						yonder sitting on a rock! Can you see?"</p>
					<p>"Yes," replied Conn, "and there's a ring of men with locked shields standing all around
						him!"</p>
					<p>It was indeed the aged high king. His face <pb id="VAB1843-125" n="103"/> was white and
						set as if carved from marble, yet his piercing eyes were brave and fearless as he sat
						watching the battle which he was certain would in some way bring death to him. For the
						Dane prophecy had sunk deep into his mind, and nothing could shake his belief that it
						would be fulfilled.</p>
					<p>Wilder and wilder grew the struggle. Banners fluttered and fell, and the loud battle
						cries from thousands of throats, the clanking of Danish armor and rattling of spears and
						shields all mingled in one hoarse roar as the chariots of the Celtic kings rushed hither
						and thither and the poets goaded their horses to the front ranks bravely chanting their
						songs and inspiring the courage of the soldiers.</p>
					<p>The sun rose higher and higher and the ebbing tide flowed far out to sea, and still the
						conflict raged and none could foresee who would be the victors. Now one side and now the
						other seemed gaining the advantage. But toward <pb id="VAB1843-126" n="104"/> noon the
						watchers on the Hill began to despair; for they could see the yellow tunics of the
						Celtic soldiers rolling back in a tawny flood as the gleaming mail of the Danes swept
						over them.</p>
					<p>Ferdiad and Conn scarcely spoke as breathlessly they looked, each wondering whether his
						father or foster-father still lived or had gone down before the Danish hosts as had
						already the son and grandson of the high king.</p>
					<p>But Brian Boru was too proud and skillful a warrior to allow his armies to meet defeat
						at the hands of pirates and sea-rovers no matter how many or how powerful. Still
						standing white and motionless, watching the plain through the ring of shields,
						nevertheless he was all the while sending swift messengers back and forth ordering the
						battle, till at length, as the sunset tide again surged in, bellowing, over the
						waterworn bowlders, the tide of war turned also for the Celts. </p>
					<pb id="VAB1843-127" n="105"/>

					<p>Louder and louder rang the songs of the poets, the voice of Angus leading them all, as
						the Celtic kings and captains rallying their soldiers for a last mighty effort, rushed
						resistlessly forward, hurling their spears, thrusting with their swords and dealing
						deadly blows with their battle axes, till suddenly their Danish foes gave way and fled
						wildly before them.</p>
					<p>At this the boys could hold back no longer, but flying down the hillside ran toward the
						seashore where the victorious Celts were pursuing the Danes, who were trying to reach
						the long dragon ships in which they had come to Ireland and which were moored at the
						mouth of the river Liffey. When the tide was low they could easily wade out to these,
						but now plunging into the great green breakers hundreds and hundreds met their death.
						Some tried to reach the bridge over the Liffey which led to their fortress only to find
						escape cut off by the brave Celts who had captured and held it.</p>




					<pb id="VAB1843-128" n="106"/>
					<p>When dusk fell, the great army of the Danes was crushed and defeated. Of those who had
						not fallen in battle or been drowned in the roaring tide a few had managed to escape,
						but most were prisoners in the hands of the Celtic soldiers. The Battle of Clontarf was
						over and the high king, Brian Boru, had forever broken the power of the Danes in
						Ireland.</p>
					<p>But what of the high king himself? Had he escaped the death for which he had waited
						through all the long day? No, he had not escaped. Faithfully from early dawn to sunset
						the shield men had guarded him in unbroken ring, and not till the tide of battle turned
						and the Celts were pursuing the flying Danes did they relax their watch. For how could
						they know that at the very moment their tired arms dropped to their sides a fugitive
						Dane, who had managed to escape the Celtic spears and crept through the forest and
						behind the rocks at the foot of the Hill, would spring <pb id="VAB1843-129" n="[]"/>
						<pb id="VAB1843-130" n="[]"/>

						<pb id="VAB1843-131" n="107"/> upon the aged monarch and deal him death with a single
						thrust of his sword?</p>
					<p>But thus it was the soothsayer's prophecy was fulfilled.</p>

					<pb id="VAB1843-132" n="108"/>
					<head rend="center">CHAPTER XI <lb/>
						<hi rend="sc">FERDIAD AND THE DANE PRISONER </hi></head>
					<p>F<hi rend="sc">ERDIAD</hi> and Conn stood together in a group of soldiers who were
						making campfires for the night, and many were the stories they all had to tell of the
						day. But most of all were they wondering how it was that a single Dane had been able to
						kill the high king in spite of all the shield men.</p>
					<p>"It was that heathen prophecy!" declared one soldier, "and nobody could help it!"</p>
					<p>"They say the Dane who struck him was a great sorcerer and that no sword could bite his
						magic armor," said another. And this explanation seemed to satisfy them best; for they
						did not like to think an ordinary man could have harmed the king they had taken such
						pains to guard.</p>


					<pb id="VAB1843-133" n="109"/>
					<p>"Did you know the flaith O'Brien was killed?" asked another.</p>
					<p>"Yes," spoke up some one else, "his men say that at first he was invisible because of
						the cloak from the banshee of Craglea, but as the battle grew fiercer he scorned not to
						be seen and threw it off. It was then a Dane spear struck him, and they say his shield
						moaned as he fell!"</p>
					<p>"Did you see the war witches dancing on the tips of our Celtic spears?" said another
						voice.</p>
					<p>"To be sure!" came an answering one, "And look! they are flying now over the battle
						field!"</p>
					<p>"Do <hi rend="i">you</hi> see them, Ferdiad?" whispered Conn, in awed tones.</p>
					<p>"It looks like fog coming in from the sea," said Ferdiad, gazing through the gathering
						dusk, "but I suppose the witches are in it."</p>
					<p>Just here some other boys came along on <pb id="VAB1843-134" n="110"/> their way to see
						the prisoners, and Ferdiad and Conn went with them to the rear of the camp where scores
						of sullen-looking Danes were standing under guard waiting their turn to be chained.
						Torches flared here and there, and as their flickering light fell on the faces of the
						prisoners all at once Ferdiad stopped short with a long "Oh!" He was standing in front
						of a tall, cruel-looking man with hands chained behind him and an ugly red scar across
						his forehead.</p>
					<p>After his first gasp of surprise, "Conn," whispered Ferdiad excitedly, "he is the man
						who killed the monk in the raid on Kells! I would know his face in a thousand. And he
						took what the monk had hid in his robe and I have always thought it was the angel book
						of Saint Columkille!" Here Ferdiad caught sight of the wooden shield at the Dane's feet:
						in its center was a pointed boss of iron which was thrust through, and partly held in
						place, <pb id="VAB1843-135" n="[]"/><figure>
							<p>"<hi rend="sc">HE WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF A TALL, CRUEL LOOKING MAN</hi>"</p>
						</figure>
						<pb id="VAB1843-136" n="[]"/>
						<pb id="VAB1843-137" n="111"/> the fragment of a thin sheet of gold. The corners of this
						were fastened to the wood by a few bronze nails, and the gold was beautifully hammered
						in a curious design of interlacing lines and queer animal forms with long tails twisting
						in many intricate spirals.</p>
					<p>"Look!" cried Ferdiad, as he examined this eagerly, "now I <hi rend="i">know </hi>it
						was Saint Columkille's book he got! That gold is part of its case, I've seen it and
						remember the pattern! I suppose he put it on his shield trying to imitate our handsome
						Celtic ones with their gold ornaments."</p>
					<p>Meantime the captive was staring sullenly at Ferdiad, who was saying to Conn, "I wonder
						if he understands Celtic? I wish I could ask him some questions."</p>
					<p>"No, boy," said a soldier standing guard near by, "but if you want to ask him something
						I can help you, for I know his language." </p>

					<pb id="VAB1843-138" n="112"/>
					<p>"Oh," said Ferdiad, "ask him where the <hi rend="i">book </hi>is that was in that case.
						It was the angel book of the blessed Saint Columkille!"</p>
					<p><hi rend="i">"It was?"</hi> exclaimed the soldier in surprise, for almost every Celt
						had heard of that wonderful book. But to the soldier's question the Dane only shrugged
						his shoulders and would say nothing.</p>
					<p>"I was at Kells when the Danes raided it, and I saw him kill the monk who was trying to
						save the book!" went on Ferdiad.</p>
					<p>At this the soldier began fiercely to threaten the man, telling him they would kill
						him. But still the man sullenly refused to speak; for he had been long enough in Ireland
						to know that the Celtic law would not allow prisoners to be killed.</p>
					<p>Then Ferdiad thought of something. "Tell him," he said, "that my foster-father is the
						chief poet of Ireland and I will get him to compose a scornful poem about him!"</p>


					<pb id="VAB1843-139" n="113"/>
					<p>Now do not laugh, for this was no idle threat of Ferdiad's, and when he suggested it
						the soldier said approvingly, "That will settle him!" For a Celt dreaded nothing more
						than for a poet to chant scornful verses about him. They had a peculiar reverence for
						their poets and believed that by their songs they could, if they wished, call down
						terrible misfortunes or even death.</p>
					<p> So the soldier took pains to impress all this on the Dane, who turned pale with fright
						and at last burst out in a torrent of words to which the soldier listened
						attentively.</p>
					<p>"He says," he interpreted, "that that book has been trouble enough to him. When he was
						carrying it off from Kells another Dane attacked him and tried to get it away, and in
						the fight he killed the man but not before he had got a sword thrust that blinded one of
						his eyes,-- which served him right! though the wicked heathen was ugly enough already
						with <pb id="VAB1843-140" n="114"/> that red scarred forehead of his!"-- put in the
						soldier on his own account as he went on, "he says the gold was what he wanted, and
						after his fight with the man he tore the book out of its case and threw it away. And may
						the blessed Saint Columkille send his soul to everlasting torment for it!" added the
						soldier as he piously crossed himself.</p>
					<p>Ferdiad drew a long breath, "Well," he said at last, "at least it wasn't burned!" For
						everybody knew the Danes had made many a bonfire of the precious books and manuscripts
						they had stolen from the Celts. "Perhaps it may be found yet," he said to Conn as they
						walked away together.</p>
					<p>"But it would surely be spoiled if it had been lying on the ground all this while!"
						said Conn.</p>
					<p>And still discussing it they went over to the center of the camp where every one was
						going. For Angus was beginning to chant the mourning <pb id="VAB1843-141" n="115"/> song
						for the high king, who lay within his tent with lighted candles at his head and feet and
						the royal waxen one blazing at the door.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="chapter">
					<pb id="VAB1843-142" n="116"/>
					<head rend="center">CHAPTER XII <lb/>
						<hi rend="sc">THE BOOK OF KELLS </hi>
					</head>
					<p> I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was the day after the battle of Clontarf, and the Celtic camp
						was already broken up and the soldiers scattering back to their homes. The body of the
						dead high king, Brian Boru, was to be borne in a cart drawn by white oxen and covered
						with a purple pall to the church of Armagh, a very sacred place in the kingdom of
						Ulster. There, with solemn ceremonies, the Celtic monarch would be buried, standing with
						his face to the east, wrapped in his royal mantle, his shield and spear beside him.</p>
					<p>Now it happened that Kells was one of the stopping places on the way to Armagh; and
						when Ferdiad heard this, he begged his foster-father <pb id="VAB1843-143" n="117"/> that
						he and Conn might go that far along with the pages who attended the different kings and
						flaiths.</p>
					<p>"We can ride in the cart for the pages, and stay at Kells and you can stop for us when
						you come back from Armagh!" said Ferdiad eagerly. "I want to hunt for Saint Columkille's
						book and Conn will help me." For Ferdiad had told his foster-father about what the Dane
						prisoner had said.</p>
					<p>Angus had no hope that the beautiful book might be found, but Ferdiad begged so hard
						that he agreed and Ferdiad ran off happily to tell Conn.</p>
					<p>So it came about that the two boys went along when the funeral procession set off, the
						white oxen and royal cart leading the way while close behind rode poet Angus chanting
						sorrowful songs in honor of the dead king. After him came as many of the Celtic kings
						and flaiths as could arrange to go to Armagh, and last of all <pb id="VAB1843-144"
							n="118"/> followed the host of attendants for these, the boys among them.</p>
					<p>At Kells the funeral train was received with every honor, and after a brief rest moved
						on to the north; but Ferdiad and Conn stayed behind. The boys were warmly greeted by the
						monks, who knew Ferdiad well and were fond of the lad; and they were especially glad to
						see him as they had not heard from him since the day of the raid.</p>
					<p>He soon told them what he had found out about the beautiful book, and Brother Patrick
						said, "Yes, lad, I remember finding the body of no doubt the very man the Dane prisoner
						told you he had fought with over the gold case, and we gave the wicked heathen Christian
						burial where we found him. If the book was thrown away soon after the fight, it must be
						somewhere not far from that spot."</p>
					<p>"Oh, please show us the place and let's begin looking right away!" cried Ferdiad. <pb
							id="VAB1843-145" n="119"/> "I can show you the Dane's grave," said Brother Patrick
						with a sigh, "but unless the blessed Saint Columkille has worked a miracle, the
						beautiful book is surely ruined by this time!"</p>
					<p>The spot to which he led the way was in a woodland skirting the monastery fields, and
						just beyond was a bog where the monks had once cut the peat they burned in winter,
						though it had now become quite dry. Several of them who had heard Ferdiad's story came
						along, and all began to search. But most of them were no longer young, and it seemed to
						them a hopeless task; though they constantly mourned the loss of the most beautiful book
						in Ireland.</p>
					<p>As the Kells school was over for the summer, there were no young students to help
						search, for they had all gone away for a time; so at last Ferdiad and Conn found
						themselves the ones who must find the book if any one did.</p>


					<pb id="VAB1843-146" n="120"/>
					<p>Up and down through the trees they went, peering and poking under every swirl of fallen
						leaves or dead boughs where they glimpsed anything that looked in the least like the
						brown carved leather that covered the lost book. Ferdiad led the way southeastward from
						where the two Danes had fought, "For," he said, "that is the direction Brother Patrick
						says the raiders went after they left Kells, and even yet you can see the broken
						branches where they drove the cows through the woods on their way toward the sea."</p>
					<p>The boys got down on their hands and knees and looked under every thicket of bushes,
						and Conn even poked under tufts of violets and cowslips.</p>
					<p>"Why, Conn," laughed Ferdiad, "it's too big to hide under those! Saint Columkille's
						book is at least a foot wide and more than that long, and thick through!"</p>
					<p>Indeed, they got as interested as in a game <pb id="VAB1843-147" n="121"/> of hide and
						seek; moreover, the monks offered as prize, if the book was, found, a handsome bow and
						arrows with a quiver of red enameled leather, such as they gave to their best student at
						the end of his year's school work.</p>
					<p>For almost a week the boys searched and searched in vain. At last Ferdiad said,
						"There's a fairy mound somewhere in these woods, I think not far from here. Let's go
						around it three times and say a charm and maybe the fairies will help us!"</p>
					<p>"All right!" agreed Conn, and soon finding the little hill they walked around it
						backward three times, each saying softly under his breath a special charm rime; for many
						such had been handed down among the people from the days of the DeDanaans.</p>
					<p> Now it was an odd thing, but that very morning, while Conn with a stick was poking
						under some hazel bushes, Ferdiad, in looking behind a log at the edge of the woodland,
						happened to <pb id="VAB1843-148" n="122"/> start a young hare. Off scampered the little
						creature out of the woods and over a corner of the peat bog. Suddenly,-- <hi rend="i"
							>plump!</hi> down it tumbled head over heels in a hole where, long before, the
						monastery brothers had been cuting their peat.</p>
					<p>Ferdiad, who was fond of hunting with his red and green hounds, though he had none with
						him, instinctively ran after the hare to see what had become of it. Though the ground
						was spongy lower down, for some distance from the top the bog was dry; and when Ferdiad
						came to the hole, there was the frightened little hare huddled up at the bottom and in
						his scrambles to get out his hind legs were scattering the brown dry leaves that had
						blown over from the forest the autumn before.</p>
					<p>As Ferdiad bent over his eyes began to grow very round as he stared, not at the little
						hare, but at something lying at one side of the ragged hole where the hare had been most
						active in <pb id="VAB1843-149" n="[]"/>
						<pb id="VAB1843-150" n="[]"/>
						<figure>
							<p>" <hi rend="sc">THE DRIFTING LEAVES HAD PROTECTED IT FROM THE WEATHER </hi>"</p>
						</figure>
						<pb id="VAB1843-151" n="123"/> scattering away the leaves. The corner of a brown flat
						object was laid bare, and Ferdiad, springing down hurriedly, cleared away the rest of
						the leaves and drew out-- but, of course, you have guessed what!</p>
					<p>Yes, indeed, it truly was the angel book which by some strange chance had fallen into
						the peat hole when the Dane, hurrying to join the other raiders, had come out of the
						woodland and cutting across a corner of the bog had torn it from the case and flung it
						away. It had dropped under a projecting edge of the peat, and this and the drifting
						leaves had protected it from the weather so that when Ferdiad lifted it out, though its
						thick leather cover was marred and discolored in places, yet when he opened it its
						marvelous painted pages shone out as bright and beautiful and undimmed as when first it
						came from the hand of the unknown artist hundred of years before!</p>
					<p>"<hi rend="i">Conn! Conn!</hi>" shouted Ferdiad, trembling <pb id="VAB1843-152" n="124"
						/> with excitement, "<hi rend="i">Come here! I have found it!</hi>"</p>
					<p>In a moment Conn came running, and when Ferdiad told him how he had discovered it he
						stared in surprise. "Do you suppose it could have been a DeDanaan fairy in the form of a
						hare that helped you find it?" he cried. "I was sure I saw some fairies flitting around
						there in the woods after we came back from the mound."</p>
					<p>"I don't know," said Ferdiad, "it might have been!"</p>
					<p>And perhaps it was; and perhaps, too, as the monks declared when Ferdiad bore back the
						book in triumph to the monastery, the blessed Saint Columkille or the angels who had
						guided the hand of the bygone artist had indeed wrought a miracle and so saved those
						rare painted pages from harm as they lay all the long months hidden in the bog.</p>


					<pb id="VAB1843-153" n="125"/>
					<p>In very truth, the angels must still guard the sacred volume; for all these things I
						have told you happened long and long ago. Long and long ago Ferdiad and Conn and Eileen
						lived out their happy lives and long ago poet Angus sang his last sweet song. The raths
						of the Celtic people of old and the duns of their high kings are now only ruined walls
						watched over by the hidden fairies, and their beloved Ireland has passed through many
						changes and has known much of sorrow. Yet through all the passing centuries the Great
						Gospel of Saint Columkille, or the Book of Kells, as it is more often called to-day,
						still keeps its lovely pages untarnished and unfading. In the city of Dublin, which once
						was but the fortress at the Ford of the Hurdles, still is it jealously cherished, and
						still is it ranked, as in the days of Ferdiad, the most beautiful book in all the world. </p>
