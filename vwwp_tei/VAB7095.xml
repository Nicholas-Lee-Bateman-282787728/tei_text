                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All
                    split lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for
                    the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as
                    &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                    <l>In a rose‐bush a spider’s net spied he,</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>The spider was large and her web was tough;</l>
                    <l>She watched till the bee had struggled enough</l>
                    <l>Before it was worth her while to be rough.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>But a hole in her institution, you see,</l>

                    <l>As spiders will weave whose ancestors throve:</l>
                    <l>And vainly the bee in its agony strove.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>To free you by Force were a serious wrong,</l>
                    <l>For spiders have lived in that way so long</l>
                    <l>They “work” at their nets, so neat, so strong.</l>

                    <l>Besides, Coercion!—so wicked, you see!—</l>
                    <l>To compel that fat spider to set you free</l>
                    <l>Were “in principle” evil, for you and for me.</l>

                    <l>Be sure I am sorry; perhaps some day</l>
                    <l>Spiders will cease to subsist on prey,</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>So the sun went down, and the spider fed</l>
                    <l>On the agonised honey bee not yet dead;</l>
                    <l>And sympathy sighed, and went home to bed.</l>
