                    </placeName>, Indiana, there stands a large tombstone on which is chiseled in phonetic characters a
                    long inscription beginning with the information quoted above in the standard alphabet. It is the
                    final message of William Cole Talcott, a reformer's reformer, who lived during a time
                    frothing with reform. During his long lifetime he espoused a number of the major and minor reforms
                    produced by nineteenth-century America. In religion he swung from a strict Calvinist position to
                    that of Universalism, and from Universalism to a sort of pantheistic humanism; he was a strong
                    advocate of temperance and vegetarianism; in politics he began as a Free-Soil Democrat and ended an
                    ardent Republican; his economic views were strongly socialistic, so much so that he even founded a
                    Fourieristic community. All these reforms, besides many others such as feminism, land reform,
                    judiciary reform, educational reform, and tax reform, he fostered in newspapers which he published
                    over a fifty-year span, at times printing them in his own phonetic characters, for he was a spelling
                    reformer too.</p>

                    people into a socialistic industrial association of the Fourieristic type. The colony was located

                    </placeName> Industrial Association," as the colony was called. Though Talcott was prime
                    mover of the project, he was given the title of secretary. The association was a joint stock
                    corporation to which each member contributed as much money as he had, although those who lacked
                    money were admitted for the labor they would perform.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Although the association
                    started with only fifty persons, there were over a hundred connected with it during its brief

                    largely New Englanders who had migrated first to <placeName>

                    from the members, some was paid on the farm, and the rest was used to build a seventy-five-foot-long
                    common dining hall, a kitchen, a storeroom, and fifteen dwellings, and to buy farming implements and

            <p>In the spring of 1845 ten acres were cleared and seed was sown. From the beginning there apparently
                    were those who did not do their share of work while doing their share of eating. Such shirking, of
                    course, brought complaints from the women who were doing the cooking, and it was not long before
                    people began dropping out. Nevertheless with the approach of winter the membership of the community
                    was increased by an influx of new members. One member, Ephraim O. Trueblood, was quoted as
                    complaining that the work was too hard for his women, that there was too much looseness in the
                    relations of some of the families, and that the community was not a good place to bring up
                    one's family. Therefore, he and his family decided to leave in 1846.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>The Trueblood family's departure was undoubtedly not a unique incident since the whole
                    community seems to have dissolved by late 1846 or early 1847. About 1867 Talcott gave his view of
                    the reasons for the project's collapse: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>"The main cause of … dissolution, I have ever believed, was that Mr.
                            McCartney violated his promise to invest his whole tract of land; and after we were fully
                            organized and on the ground ready to receive the title and use the land, he withheld all of
                            the valuable and available portion, and turned us off with the broken, marshy land, lying
                            between the road and the river, at twenty dollars per acre, the appraised price of the

                        <p>The cause of the failure, "in a nutshell," was probably this: McCartney,

                            association for the purpose of getting his land cleared up and improved for nothing. He

                    April 24, 1847, and by this time the paper had grown to a five-column folio weekly. Although Talcott
                    and Harrison differed on some political and social questions, they got along pleasantly in the
                    beginning, and the paper prospered financially, as its growth in size during 1847 and 1848

            <p>The initial harmony between the owners of the <hi rend="i">Western Ranger</hi> was not to be lasting,
                    however. From the beginning Talcott and Harrison signed their initials to articles they wrote or
                    edited. As time passed, there were even articles by one editor stating that he had nothing to do
                    with an article written by the other editor in the same issue.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The result of
                    this growing difference was that in June, 1849, Talcott bought out his partner and on July 25, 1849,
                    changed the name of the paper to the <hi rend="i">Practical Observer.</hi> His newspaper business
                    flourished so well during the next few years that in January, 1853, Talcott began to issue a
                    triweekly besides the regular weekly. In September of that same year, he started publication of the

                            interesting to note that although Talcott maintained that his phonetic alphabet used only
                            one symbol for each sound, on the title page of his book the title is given as <hi rend="i">Doktrin and Practis,</hi> a spelling in which both a <hi rend="i">k</hi> and a <hi rend="i">c</hi> are used for the same sound. On the cover of the volume and in the

                    Talcott claimed that his paper (possibly he was considering all editions together) was the largest

                    that the semi-weekly was the only such paper published in so small a town, in so sparse a country,
                    and at so low a price. Near the close of 1853 the subscription price was $5 for the daily

                    judge in the fall of 1856, he sold the entire office to Dr. R. A. Cameron in April, 1857. But Judge
                    Talcott was not able to leave the newspaper business so easily. In July, 1858, his son Henry became
                    an associate editor of the paper, which was by then called the <hi rend="i">Republican;</hi> later
                    that year Henry inveigled his father to lend his experience as a veteran newspaperman and become a
                    joint editor and proprietor. This arrangement lasted until the next March when the paper was resold
                    to Dr. Cameron. In 1874 Judge Talcott again bought the paper, which he renamed the <hi rend="i">Vidette.</hi> Except for thirteen months during 1879 and 1880, he continued in partnership with
                    his son Charles, who had secured a half interest in December, 1874,<hi rend="sup">25</hi> until 1888
                    when they sold the paper. Although he was in his seventies, William Talcott was unable to make a

                    arranging roman and italic letters so that there should be one, and only one, letter for each
                    distinct sound in the language. Moreover, he had also given examples of the application of his
                    proposed alphabet in spelling various words. Talcott went on to point out to his readers that in
                    1843 he had also mentioned the invention of a similar system in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. He explained that while the English system advanced a new, simple, and complete
                    alphabet for writing, it appeared the adoption of the system in print had not been thought of.
                    Talcott exulted in informing his readers that the very same system presented in the <hi rend="i">Ranger</hi>

                    phonotypy and that in the future it would contain articles explaining and illustrating the subject.</p>
            <p>In the <hi rend="i">Western Ranger's</hi> issue of June 23, 1847, Judge Talcott also gave
                    his principles of phonotypy—principles of writing and printing reform. First, all words
                    were to be spelled precisely as they were pronounced and pronounced precisely as they were spelled,
                    so that one might know by the pronunciation of a word how to spell it and by the spelling how to
                    pronounce it. Secondly, in order to make phonetic spelling possible, each sound in the language was
                    to be uniformly represented by a distinctive letter, which was never to stand for any other sound.
                    Thirdly, Talcott maintained that since the English alphabet had too few letters and since these
                    letters were irregularly applied, it was inadequate for phonetic purposes and should be transformed
                    into a genuinely phonetic alphabet—which Talcott then proceeded to give. <list type="footnotes">

                    Talcott's several extant alphabets and has forty characters, including all the standard
                    characters of the English alphabet with the exception of <hi rend="i">k, q,</hi> and <hi rend="i">x.</hi> Talcott added characters for eleven additional vowel sounds by using standard vowels with
                    diacritical marks, plus the "oo" sound printed as a double <hi rend="i">u</hi>—really an inverted <hi rend="i">m;</hi> the six additional sounds are represented
                    by roman or italic type and by homemade characters apparently formed by modifying standard type. For
                    example, the voiced "th" sound is represented by a lower case <hi rend="i">d</hi>
                    with the back of its circular part cut away and looks something like an inverted question mark
                    without the dot. A number of these characters are obviously makeshift, and when he presented them
                    Talcott explained that he was expecting newly cut type very soon.</p>
            <p>Although it would require another study to determine whether Talcott's phonotypy was indeed
                    a "first" as he claimed, it is evident that his was one of the early systems. He
                    did much original work and was notable among advocates of phonetic spelling in that he spread
                    principles of phonetic usage so early and so deep in the American frontier.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
                    Talcott utilized every means and opportunity to further this reform, making use of articles he
                    published in 1843 and the <hi rend="i">Spirit of Reform,</hi> the first newspaper he personally
                    published. The <hi rend="i">Spirit of Reform</hi> was published in connection with his <placeName>

                    paper would advocate the plan of industrial association as well as the principles of
                    "phonography, a science which reduces spelling to a simple rule by which a person may
                    become a perfect master of the art in a few hours, and a good reader in a few days." The
                    paper was a monthly which ran only a few issues, however, and no copies seem to be extant. In the

                    </placeName>, Judge Talcott often ran columns of varying lengths in phonetic characters; he printed
                    anecdotes, news items, letters written to him in phonetic script, or editorials. At times he
                    included a key to the phonetic type, but very often not; he would even run poems and full columns on
                    the front page or stray lines stuck in here and there in phonetic type. In the <list type="footnotes">

                    published a daily edition, most of which was printed in this type. At the same time a very large
                    portion of the paper was devoted to arguments on behalf of reforms of every nature. At this time he
                    also published several books on reform in his phonetic type, at least one of which is written in
                    rhyming iambic heptameter. Besides all these publications in phonetic characters—and
                    Talcott experimented much over the years—he printed every piece of news he could find on
                    spelling reform anywhere in the English-speaking world and periodically editorialized on the
                        subject.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Talcott used two main arguments for the employment of a phonetic system. First, he contended that a
                    phonetic alphabet would save every child at least two school years which were ordinarily spent in
                    learning how to spell, and then only poorly. Secondly, Talcott believed the system would save
                    Americans at least $3,000,000 daily since a phonetic alphabet demanded less printed space
                    for a given number of words than did the ordinary longer forms. Therefore, great sums would be saved
                    by reducing the time needed to read material now containing many unnecessary letters—to
                    say nothing of savings in school expenditures by eliminating the two unnecessary years of spelling
                    study. Talcott very neatly summarized these arguments in some phonetic verses, which are here
                    reproduced in regular type.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>The saving is not vain, for two whole years are no small gain, While present teaching tends to

            <p>Although Talcott devoted much effort to publicizing phonetic spelling, perhaps the field in which his
                    newspapers were most effective was that of politics, especially during the 1840's and
                    1850's. It was not until after about 1846 that the members of the Democratic party took a

                    ardent supporter of Free-Soilism. Though he early thought slavery could be contained through the

                    Republican party. He then turned his and his paper's allegiance to the Republican party,
                    and "through the influence brought to bear by the <hi rend="i">Observer</hi> upon the
                    citizens, the new party immediately went to the front, and has since had control of the official

                    remarked: "Owing to the prominent part so bravely borne by Judge Talcott during the

            <p>William C. Talcott had quite a varied career as a jurist—fifteen years
                    altogether—and from this experience he also evolved some definite ideas of reform. In
                    1840 Talcott was elected a justice of the peace; he was appointed probate judge in 1849 and elected
                    to the same office in 1850. He resigned in 1852 to accept the Democratic nomination for assemblyman,
                    but was defeated because of his strong antislavery and temperance position. In 1856 he was elected
                    common pleas judge and was later re-elected to this office for two more terms, twelve years in all.
                    Talcott practiced law for six years after his last term in office.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Judge Talcott would have eliminated a number of legal practices he considered superfluous, such as
                    judicial oaths and grand juries, which he regarded as merely a waste of time and an added expense.
                    He also insisted that a majority decision of a jury should be sufficient to decide a case, for
                    unanimity was, he felt, as unnecessary here as in any other democratic process.</p>

            <p>Besides advocating a number of court reforms, Judge Talcott favored several then radical changes in
                    criminal law. He believed that the list of acts considered crimes should be shortened, excluding all
                    acts not injurious to others. He would have abolished vindictive penalties, making all punishment
                    either reformatory or restraining in purpose. So he wrote in his <hi rend="i">Doktrin and Practis,</hi>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>In the area of civil rights Judge Talcott worked not only for the freedom of Negroes but also very
                    earnestly for women's rights. He thought that divorce was something that should be used
                    when necessary and that no stigma should be attached to it. He himself, however, lived with his
                    first wife over sixty years until her death. His thoughts about the rights of women as human beings
                    and their right to the vote is best summed up in the following stanzas: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mohammedan monocracy, the ancient Jew theocracy, And Mormon aristocracy agree in this idea:

            <p>Judge Talcott also had very definite ideas about education, which he would improve by introducing not
                    only his method of spelling, but also a more utilitarian approach toward learning. His approach
                    would have instituted a work-as-you-learn program and an arrangement similar to the <placeName>

            <p>From early in his career onward, Talcott was a strong defender of the temperance movement, supporting
                    it in his newspapers and other writings. His position, however, was not so rigid as that of some
                    members of the movement. He did not believe the sale of liquor should be completely prohibited but
                    that allowance should be made for its medicinal and sacramental uses. As for punishment for the
                    misuse of alcohol, Talcott believed the courts ought to make a decision giving both buyer and seller
                    their just due.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Abstinence from liquor was not the only aspect of temperance
                    Judge Talcott practiced, for he would eat no meat. For one two-week period he subsisted on nothing
                    but squash grown in his own back yard, insisting he had no desire for anything more.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Apparently his diet did not adversely affect his health, which was excellent until his

                    school, and from serving ten years as a minister to owning and editing several newspapers. Though he
                    was considered eccentric, though part of his energies were fruitlessly expended, Talcott always
                    vigorously tried to apply the yardstick of reason to all his thought and to his efforts toward the
                    realization of his ideas in the society around him. If one word could sum up his character and life,
                    that word would be "reformer," for almost every facet of his life reflects a
                    different reform movement of his time. Apparently of all his activities only surveying, already a
                    mathematical discipline, escaped the rationalist fever of reform. His cooperative community was an
                    experiment in social reform. He wished to revise the legal system and the penal code and to revamp
                    political institutions. He had progressive views on teaching school, and in the matter of religion
                    he himself went through a long series of personal readjustments and reforms. And throughout his life

                        History of the State of Indiana</hi> and carried the names of DeWitt C. Goodrich and Charles R.
                    Tuttle as authors. The volume also indicated that it had been published by Richard S. Peale at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1875. This book was of particular interest because it contained a biographical
                    sketch of John Purdue which related details of his life prior to the time he settled in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1839. Only brief mention was made of his business careers in <placeName>

                    conclude that the information regarding Mr. Purdue's early life had probably been obtained
                    from him, for the writer became convinced that this was the first time such biographical data had
                    appeared in print. The author was, therefore, curious to learn how and by whom this data had been
                    obtained.</p>

                    biographical information about Mr. Purdue. This information has been used, often verbatim and
                    without credit, by later writers. Moreover, it remains the principal source of information about
                    John Purdue's life during the years before he came to Indiana.</p>
            <p>The search for information regarding the writing and publication of <hi rend="i">An Illustrated
                        History of the State of Indiana</hi> soon raised further questions. There was the question of
                    the date of the book's first publication—was it 1874, the date of copyright, or
                    was it 1875, the date indicated in the earliest editions usually found in libraries. This problem
                    could be quickly resolved by writing to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Copyright Office, which was subsequently done. Meanwhile, two copies of the history
                    were located, each having a publication date of 1875 and with identical title pages, but with
                    differences that stamped one as an earlier edition than the other. One copy was found in the Earlham
                    College Library, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and the other in the Morrison-Reeves Library, the public library at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although both had identical title pages, the Earlham copy was considerably thicker
                    than the Morrison-Reeves copy. Closer examination indicated that different paper had been used in
                    the printing of the books, which accounted for the difference in thickness. This discovery did not
                    in itself prove that the two copies belonged to different editions, but further examination of them
                    revealed more significant differences than merely that of the paper on which they had been printed.
                    These differences were: (1) the claim of one of the copies to be the "second
                    edition"; (2) a glaring typographical error in one which did not appear in the other; (3) a
                    difference in the dates given for the publishers' prefaces; and (4) important variations in
                    the texts of the prefaces. Other differences may exist in these two copies; no effort was made,
                    however, to make a collation of their texts.</p>
            <p>A careful examination of the prefaces made it apparent that the Morrison-Reeves copy was earlier than
                    the Earlham <list type="footnotes">

                    in the Morrison-Reeves copy, and May 15, 1875, in that of the Earlham Library. A typographical error
                    ("stel") on page 624 of the Morrison-Reeves copy had been corrected to read
                    "life's" on the same page of the Earlham copy. Only the Earlham copy
                    claimed to be the "second edition." The preface to the Morrison-Reeves volume
                    praised the text to follow; the preface to the Earlham copy contained much less self-praise and was
                    even apologetic in tone, a fact suggesting that perhaps an earlier edition had met unfavorable
                    criticism. From this combination of evidence it seemed reasonable to conclude that there had been
                    two editions—or at least two printings—of <hi rend="i">An Illustrated History
                        of the State of Indiana</hi> in 1875 despite the fact that the title pages of both Earlham and

            <p>Both copies gave 1874 as copyright date. Correspondence subsequently indicated that copies of the

                    doubtless explained by the fact that prior to 1909 it was possible to file a claim for copyright of
                    a book by registering its title as soon as it had been projected, which might be months or even
                    years in advance of its publication.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Two additional editions of <hi rend="i">An Illustrated History of the State of Indiana</hi>
                    subsequently appeared. An edition was published in 1876 which claimed to be the "second
                    edition." This 1876 edition appeared to be identical in content with the previous one, but
                    it had a new publisher, J. W. Lanktree &amp; Company, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Three years later another edition appeared which was called the third edition, though
                    it was properly the fourth and apparently final one. In this 1879 edition the names of Goodrich and
                    Tuttle did not appear on the title page as they had in the three previous ones. Their names were
                    replaced by that of "Hon. W. S. Haymond," who was identified as editor and

                    "down to 1879," whereas the two earliest editions had given 1875 as end date and
                    the 1876 edition had given 1876. The 1879 edition was somewhat longer than the earlier editions.
                    Nevertheless, it gave the same 1874 copyright date as the previous editions. And as in previous
                    editions, it was dedicated to Indiana pioneers; had a ten-page "Introductory,"
                    dated at <placeName>

                    Tuttle did not appear on the title page of the 1879 edition, some libraries, including the Library
                    of Congress, cataloged it as a new work. According to the Preface, this edition included new
                    material on the 1870's, additional sketches of "distinguished public
                    men," and "numerous corrections and alterations" in the text.</p>
            <p>Why did <hi rend="i">An Illustrated History of the State of Indiana</hi> appear when it did, and what
                    were the respective roles played by its original authors and publisher? The basis for its appearance
                    in the 1870's seems readily apparent. That was the Centennial Decade and thus a time of
                    patriotic fervor which expressed itself magnificently in the Exposition of 1876 and in the
                    popularity of state and county histories throughout the country. Unfortunately these histories were
                    generally hastily prepared and usually designed for uncritical readers. In the 1870's
                    Americans were conscious of their historical heritage as they have seldom been, and they welcomed
                    books about pioneer days which emphasized achievements made possible by the hardships and sacrifices
                    of their predecessors, many of whom were their ancestors. Hence in this favorable atmosphere <hi rend="i">An Illustrated History of the State of Indiana</hi> went through four editions in five
                    years even though it appeared during one of the most severe depressions the country has ever
                    experienced.</p>
            <p>Questions about the men originally responsible for this history of Indiana were not easily answered.
                    The usual reference sources yielded nothing of significance, except what might be inferred from
                    entries in the Library of Congress Catalog of Books. Here, information on Goodrich was limited <list type="footnotes">

                    Between 1873 and the end of the centennial year, 1876, Tuttle's name was attached to eight
                    different volumes in addition to the Indiana history, but his writing continued with a two-volume
                    history of <placeName>

            <p>From the information in the Library of Congress Catalog of Books it appeared logical to infer that
                    Goodrich and Peale were not principally writers, but apparently were publishers, promoters, and
                    salesmen of books. Tuttle, however, seems to have been a writer who lived by his pen, though one
                    might easily also think of him as a promoter and salesman in some important respects. Such evidence
                    also strengthened the conclusion that Tuttle, not Goodrich, had been the principal author of their
                    history of Indiana. This conclusion was supported by the fact that only Tuttle's name was
                    attached to the "Introductory" to this work.</p>
            <p>Fortunately the unresolved questions about <hi rend="i">An Illustrated History of the State of
                        Indiana</hi> and about the men who produced it are not entirely a matter of conjecture, while
                    further research verified conclusions already indicated. Inquiries to various libraries in search of
                    information about Goodrich and Tuttle proved fruitless until there came an informative letter from
                    Miss Caroline Dunn, librarian at the William H. Smith Library of the Indiana Historical Society, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Miss Dunn's letter included a number of valuable bits of information, but
                    most important of all was the news that the holdings of the Smith Library included a 363-page
                    autobiographical sketch that DeWitt C. Goodrich had written in 1905. This sketch had been given to
                    the library by a son of Goodrich in 1948,<hi rend="sup">8</hi> and with it was the following

                            character, inclined to be attracted to places at a distance from where he happened to be, to
                            make dubious investments in gold mines, oil wells and inventions, to accept what was written
                            of American leaders as untainted of fantasies or falcifications (especially if they were
                            Republican), and to share with his generation full faith in Progress. He was kindly and
                            self-sacrificing toward his family. A strong sense of justice governed his views, and
                            because of it he was sometimes misled into hasty and mistaken courses. He is buried with
                            father, mother and at least one sister in Mount Hope Cemetery, Peru, Indiana.</p>

            <p>Goodrich's autobiography contains much information about himself, Tuttle, and Peale. It
                    must, however, be noted that Goodrich wrote his autobiography two decades after <hi rend="i">An

                    version of his relations with Tuttle and Peale cannot, at least at this writing, be checked against
                    similar recollections of Tuttle and Peale. Nevertheless, that information which Goodrich offers as
                    fact is generally easily separated from his opinions.</p>
            <p>The initial one hundred pages of Goodrich's autobiography are largely devoted to his life
                    preceding the Civil War. He states that he and a twin brother were born at Peru, Indiana, May 27,
                    1844. His father was a surveyor and engineer who moved the family to <placeName>

            <p>During the year 1865–1866 Goodrich attended the Collegiate Institute, a school maintained
                    by the Methodists, at Battle Ground, Indiana. In 1866 he was elected surveyor of <placeName>

            <p>Goodrich and Peale soon began working together again. Since the time of their initial work together
                    as book salesmen, Peale had married and gone to Jackson, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, where he became a general agent in the book business. Before opening his <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> office, he spent two or three weeks with Goodrich in his general agency at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After a couple of years in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, during which time his wife died, Peale asked Goodrich to join him in publishing a
                    history of Indiana. Presumably Peale had met Tuttle in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>—Tuttle's history of that state appeared in 1873—and had
                    been impressed with him as an author. Goodrich's account of the writing and publication of
                        <hi rend="i">An Illustrated History of the State of Indiana</hi> is interestingly and frankly
                    told: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We engaged a fellow named Tuttle to write up a history of Indiana. Tuttle had written a

                            author. It was decided to use my name, which of course would be a deception. I agreed to the
                            use of my name, but with the understanding I should do some of the work. So I wrote some of
                            the County histories &amp; prepared all the statistical matter which appears in the
                            work.</p>
                    </quote>It was learned that it would not be illegal for Tuttle to do writing on the Indiana history,
                    so his name was put on the title page. Goodrich's Autobiography continues the account about
                    the history of Indiana: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Although Goodrich wrote that "the work went along swimmingly" with the Indiana
                    history, the association of Goodrich, Tuttle, and Peale was of short duration. Goodrich recalled:

                        <p>After our history of Indiana was completed &amp; Tuttle paid for his work, Peale told me

                            "Don't let Tuttle talk you into getting out his <placeName>

            <head>The Americans as Elite: An Essay in the Cultural Approach to History</head>
            <byline>William M. Neil<hi rend="sup">⋆</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>One of the most interesting activities of historians today is concerned with the exploration of as
                    many approaches to the examination of an historical subject as ingenuity permits. What is meant by
                    the term "approach" is fairly obvious. An approach is an avenue, a particular way
                    of coming at something which provides its own unique access. It leads one to a vantage point from
                    which to gain a certain insight that cannot be attained elsewhere. Of course real understanding of
                    anything demands that all approaches be explored and all vantage points eventually be used. But, at
                    the very least as a preliminary to the fullest understanding possible, the single, particular
                    approach is valuable as an analytic device.</p>
            <p>One such approach is suggested by a key concept from the behavioral science of anthropology, an
                    approach emphasizing the culture concept. Man alone among all the creatures of this planet is
                    distinguished by the possession of a culture, a vast agglomeration of ideas and artifacts, beliefs
                    and institutions, knowledge and customs. Viewed at one level, culture is the "composite of
                    the capabilities and habits learned by man as a member of society."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> At
                    this level it is the sum total of the raw material for the study of man: the sum total of his
                    political, social, economic, intellectual, religious, and aesthetic value judgements; the sum total
                    of his concrete ways of behavior; the sum total of his store of material possessions. At a higher
                    level, culture is an inferential construct that enables us to generalize about these human
                    phenomena. It is an abstraction like the concept in physics of a gravitational field, which no one
                    has ever seen but which makes possible an understanding of the phenomena from which it is inferred.

                    or belief in a religion, or systems of etiquette, and so forth—can, through this
                    inferential concept of culture, be seen to be expressions of a deeper, unconscious organization.
                    These unconscious assumptions characteristically made by individuals in a given culture constitute
                    the basic themes of the culture; they can be abstracted from concrete cultural traits and used to
                    identify the force structure underneath that supports and shapes them. Thus we can speak of modern
                    Western culture in terms of such abstractions, cultural common denominators so to speak, as the
                    themes of Individalism, Rationalism, Libertarianism, Nationalism, and so on. Obviously in any large
                    culture area there will be many variations on such basic themes, depending upon at what time and in
                    what place particular examples are examined. But as the basic theme in a set of musical variations
                    governs the limits of the variations, so the basic cultural themes govern the limits of cultural
                    variations for any specific culture.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cultures may be associated spatially with geographic areas and temporally with historical periods.
                    They may be classified into various categories, just as the forms of life are classified, by
                    dividing and subdividing larger groups into smaller ones according to the variations on basic
                    themes. Thus, human culture can be divided into primitive and civilized cultures; civilized cultures
                    into those of Europe, Asia, Africa, etc.; European into Western and Eastern; Western into French,
                    German, Anglo-American, etc.; Anglo-American into English and American; and so on. In short, culture
                    is defined as the sum total of observable traits as well as the abstract inferences devised in order
                    to generalize about the observable traits and their relationships.</p>
            <p>Cultures, as remarked above, are often identified by national labels. In the case of American
                    culture, it can be said that in one sense the term "American" is an objective
                    label used to denote a particular subarea within the larger culture area of Western Europe. Within
                    this subarea the basic abstract themes, or common denominators of Western European culture, are to
                    be found in their American variations. In another and more common sense,
                    "American" stands for a particular national group. Such a group is itself a bundle
                    of <list type="footnotes">

                    significant abstract cultural themes—nationalism—born in the Western European
                    culture area. In this sense the term "American" connotes <hi rend="i">that</hi>
                    people's self-conscious awareness of its own unique identity, with all that this awareness
                    implies in the way of an historical self-image.</p>
            <p>This essay proposes to examine the extent to which the concept of the American as elite has entered
                    American culture and to make this examination from the approach of the American people's
                    self-conscious view of themselves in history.</p>
            <p>History is essentially the study of man's past. A little reflection will soon make it clear
                    that there are really two pasts, an actual past and an historical past. The actual past stands for
                    what actually happened at some precise time and at some precise place. There can be only one actual
                    past, inaccessible and irrevocable. The historical past represents later efforts to reconstruct the
                    actual past and to understand its meaning. The job of reconstructing what actually happened is
                    difficult enough, depending as it does on painstakingly piecing together vestiges of the actual past
                    that have come down to us in the form of historical evidence—evidence that is incomplete
                    and full of distortions like images reflected through a series of imperfect and broken mirrors. It
                    is even more difficult to discover any definitive meaning in the past, for the actual past is
                    enigmatic. To know finally what actually happened, a well-nigh impossible task in itself, is not to
                    know automatically why it happened and what it meant. The construction of an historical past is
                    inseparable from the attempt to interpret the past.</p>
            <p>Before the nineteenth century the interpretation of history revealed in general two fundamental
                    assumptions about the nature of man in history. The Greco-Roman view of historical man was a
                    humanistic one that saw man as <hi rend="i">Man.</hi> It used the universal human endowments as
                    bench marks and with these measured out history and judgments on men and peoples. In
                    contradistinction to the classical view of man in history was the Judaeo-Christian religious view
                    that saw man as spirit and revealed divine intention working upon and through man as the real
                    meaning of history. The Judaeo-Christian view of history supplanted the classical view upon the
                    decline of the Greco-Roman civilization and dominated European thought through the Middle Ages and
                    down to the <pb n="32" id="VAA4025-057-1-036"/> late seventeenth century, when the beginnings of the
                    Enlightenment brought about a revival of classicism.</p>
            <p>Beginning with the period of the French Revolution a new concept of man in history emerged, the
                    nationalistic one. This concept saw history as a force generated by a combination of ethnic and
                    geographical elements into the highest human group, the self-conscious nationality. This new
                    interpretation, however, rested upon an older view of man than either the classical or the
                    Judaeo-Christian. It rested upon what one might call the primitive view of man which saw mankind as
                    kin, epitomizing the mystic consanguinity of special bloodlines. Expressed simply at the primitive
                    level the nationalistic concept refers to the kind of self-centeredness that led the tribe of one
                    mountain valley to call themselves by name with the word that in their language stood for man, and
                    then by implacable illogic to refer to the tribe of the neighboring valley, therefore, as Not-Men,
                    and hence suitable for killing and eating. Expressed complexly at the civilized level this concept
                    means the kind of group glorification that can lead eventually the nationals on one side of a
                    striped barrier-pole to call themselves <hi rend="i">Herrenvolk</hi> and by implacable illogic to
                    regard those beyond as sub-men and suitable for conquest and the gas chamber.</p>
            <p>The kind of nationalism just described is essentially a state of mind. While homogeneity of
                    population and culture and the possession of an exclusive territory are often important in helping
                    shape nationalism, they are not indispensable factors; nor are they as important as the will to be a
                    nation, which often, as in the cases of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="is">Israel</country>
                    </placeName>, triumphs over lack of homogeneity or territorial unity. This nationalistic state of
                    mind represents a deep emotional commitment and depends to a very large degree upon a sense of group
                    solidarity. This solidarity in turn rests upon what we might call the mythos of the group. A crucial
                    part of this group mythos is the belief that all members of the group are entitled to claim as part
                    of their heritage the historical experience of the group. The glorious past belongs to all. This
                    belief is quite important in bridging disparities between the different components within the
                    national group who otherwise would not have much in common or, even, in the case of economic and
                    social classes, be potential rivals. <placeName>

                    heritage create a warm bond of oneness among all members of American society: hence the importance
                    of the group's view of its past to modern nationalism.</p>
            <p>Modern nationalistic history began in the era of the French Revolution and Napoleon and became firmly
                    established in the post-Napoleonic period of Romantic fervor and nationalist struggle. Historians
                    like Treitschke in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, Michelet in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, Palacky in Bohemia, and others elsewhere became immensely popular. The kind of history
                    that they produced captivated the emotions of Europe; they were the searchers of the national past
                    who presented the most irresistible interpretation of the national experience. In their works one
                    can see the coming of age of modern nationalism—the fusing of the political institution
                    of the state with the Romantic mystique of the <hi rend="i">Volksblut.</hi> Thus came about the
                    modern nation-state, the ideal instrument for expressing a national elite's particular
                    genius—a process consisting largely of satisfying the political ambitions of the state
                    then justifying it on the grounds of the superiority of the "blood."</p>
            <p>During this era of emerging nationalism the Anglo-American experience was at one and the same time a
                    part of the European experience and yet apart from it. Both Great Britain and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> could not escape from being affected by the nineteenth-century virus of nationalism;
                    its course of development in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and America, however, was along distinctive lines. It is not within the scope of this
                    paper to consider the story of British nationalism, however interesting that may be; passing to
                    America, it becomes clear that American nationalism represents a distinct and very intriguing
                    variation on the European theme.</p>
            <p>In the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> there occurred no deification of the state and no exaltation of the national authority.
                    Nor was there any significant attraction to the cult of the blood—except for upper
                    classes in the ante bellum South, who became hopelessly intoxicated with the romanticism of Sir
                    Walter Scott, and a few pockets of snobbish Anglo-Saxonism among landed and moneyed would-be
                    aristocrats in the East. To be sure, there would be occasional outbreaks of xenophobia in America in
                    various forms, but even this represented more a kind of provincialism and insularity than the <hi rend="i">Herrenvolk's</hi>
                    <pb n="34" id="VAA4025-057-1-038"/> savage contempt for the lesser breed. Racial and religious
                    bigotry there would be in plenty, lynch mobs and slave quarters—but no pogroms, no
                    ghettos, none of the formal apparatus of the state used so often in Europe to suppress the
                    out-group.</p>
            <p>Cosmopolitanized by unrestricted immigration into a nation of nations, conditioned by their own past
                    into believers in the proposition that all governments are created evil, Americans proved at one and
                    the same time to be receptive to the idea of nationalism but hostile to its European expressions. As
                    substitutes for the ideas of <hi rend="i">Volkstat</hi> and <hi rend="i">Volks-blut,</hi> Americans
                    preferred two others. These were drawn from the brief, yet deeply revered past of the Republic and
                    had absolute hold upon the minds and hearts of the people—the ideas of freedom and
                    enterprise. (One might suspect that the extent to which the average American wholeheartedly
                    subscribes to the slogan "free enterprise" has little to do with his views on
                    economics or business and everything to do with his instinctive reaction to the two
                    "holiest" words in his ideology.) As the American people saw it and would continue
                    to see it, the genius of America, amply demonstrated by history, had brought about the establishment
                    in this land of the most free and enterprising people of all times the creation of an American
                    elite. As one of the most popular of mid-nineteenth-century American history textbooks put it:

                    transcends the actual facts of the Constitution's antidemocratic origins. Likewise, to most
                    Americans the Constitution is the embodiment of union, the sacred manifestation of democratic

                    noble endeavors; the readiness to take risks and try things yet untried, to put energy and

                    name of general improvement. Freedom dedicated to enterprise—here is the American formula
                    for a process of infinite perfectibility.</p>
            <p>To the American people regarding their history, the idea of enterprise has been from the beginning
                    dominated by a sense of Manifest Destiny. Here is a key phrase in the language of the American as
                    elite. It goes straight back to the heritage of Puritanism and its Calvinist convictions of a chosen
                    people. Who could doubt the evidence of his senses that this people, waxing powerful and prosperous
                    in a land fabulously endowed by nature with every conceivable form of wealth, was divinely favored?

                    inspiring than their obvious "rendezvous with destiny."</p>
            <p>But what precisely was the destined Great American Enterprise? Making allowances for the fact that
                    people seldom think consistently and logically when it comes to ideologies, remembering also that at
                    any time in a people's history there will be much intermingling, overlapping, borrowing,
                    exchanging, and confusing of ideological thought within the group, we can state that in general
                    Americans have been influenced by two traditional conceptions of the Great American Enterprise. Of
                    these two ideas about the basis for American greatness, one represents the tradition of agrarian
                    America and the American farmer, the other the tradition of entrepreneurial America and the American
                    businessman.</p>
            <p>The American farmer tradition has been geographically isolationist, politically
                    Jeffersonian-Jacksonian, economically agrarian, socially rural, culturally nativist; the American
                    business tradition has been geographically global, politically Hamiltonian, economically capitalist,
                    socially urban, culturally cosmopolitan. These two traditions represent the main currents of
                    American history. In their interrelations they establish the polarities that create the tensions of
                    American history.</p>
            <p>The tradition which enjoyed the position of dominance in America before the turn of the twentieth
                    century was, of course, that of agrarianism. The Great American Enterprise was the conquest and
                    utilization of the land, the conversion of the wilderness into fruitful farms. The pioneer farmer
                    represented the American folk hero, the older of the two conceptions of the American as elite. On
                    practically every state seal was a depiction in heroic dimensions of the farmer and his
                    tools—plowboys and their ox teams, shocks of wheat, scythes, reapers, and so on. These
                    symbolized America's pride in her yeomen, the salt of the earth. Regarded in the public
                    mind as the most free and enterprising farmer on the globe, the American husbandman was always
                    depicted standing proud and independent upon his land, subject to no other man's bidding, a
                    fitting stalwart to accomplish America's destiny. Land was his great desire, farming his
                    sacred dedication, the political tradition of Andrew Jackson his guarantee of freedom, and an
                    unshakeable conviction in the superiority of the American farmer his credo.</p>
            <pb n="37" id="VAA4025-057-1-041"/>
            <p>From this agrarian tradition came one of the most powerfully influential interpretations of American
                    history that ever captured the minds of the American people—Frederick Jackson
                    Turner's frontier thesis. Turner saw in the American farmer's experience, which
                    was repeated every generation upon a gradually receding frontier of cheap land, a great force which
                    made America unique in character and accomplishments among the nations of the world. Out of the
                    struggle to subdue the wilderness, a struggle of almost three hundred years, developed American
                    democracy, ingenuity, practicality, individualism, optimism—in short, all the attributes
                    of the inimitable American character, fashioned in freedom on an agrarian frontier.</p>
            <p>Ironically, the turn of the century that saw the publication of Turner's interpretation of
                    American history also saw the surrender of the once dominant agrarian tradition to its old rival,
                    the entrepreneurial tradition. This business tradition had always existed side by side with the
                    agrarian tradition, but always as representative of a minority in the nation as a whole. It saw the
                    Great American Enterprise not as the taming of agricultural frontiers—this was only
                    incidental—but as the creation of a new commercial and industrial world power. Its hero
                    was the businessman; capital was his great desire, trade his sacred dedication, the political
                    tradition of Alexander <placeName>

                    </placeName> his guarantee of freedom, and an unshakable conviction in the superiority of American
                    business his comfort.</p>
            <p>The great catastrophe which set American agrarians at each other's throats also destroyed
                    the dominance of their tradition. The American Civil War, which, as Lewis Mumford puts it, drew a
                    white-hot gash across American history, signalized the end of an era. The rise of the New
                    Industrialism in the period of Reconstruction meant the emergence of a new America, the emergence of
                    modern America, as Allan Nevins phrases it. The younger generations flocked to the city, which, in
                    the cases of the great exploding metropolises, became the glamorous new frontiers. The farmer grew
                    less and less important as his numbers in the general population grew proportionally smaller and his
                    relative share in the national wealth rapidly dwindled. The sturdy plowboys still remained on the
                    state seals, their brawny arms filled with the shocks of ripe harvests, but people no <pb n="38" id="VAA4025-057-1-042"/> longer thought of them as symbolic of America's greatness. The
                    captain of industry, surrounded by the newfangled instruments of commercial activity, the telephone,
                    the typewriter, the dictaphone, the stock ticker, captivated the imagination of the American people
                    and convinced them that here was the new American genius. As Sherwood Anderson bitterly commented:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>"In the days before the coming of industry, before the time of the mad awakening,
                            the towns of the Middle West were sleepy places devoted to the practice of the old trades,
                            to agriculture and merchandising. In the morning the men of the towns went forth to work in
                            the fields or to the practice of the trade of carpentry, horse-shoeing, wagon-making,
                            harness repairing, and the making of shoes and clothing. They read books and believed in a
                            God born in the brains of men who came out of a civilization much like their own. On the
                            farms and in the houses in the towns the men and women worked together toward the same ends
                            in life. They lived in small frame houses set on the plains like boxes, but very
                            substantially built…. After one of the poor little houses had been lived in for a
                            long time, after the children had been born and men had died, after men and women had
                            suffered and had moments of joy together in the tiny rooms under the low roofs, a subtle
                            change took place. The houses became almost beautiful in their old humanness. Each of the
                            houses began vaguely to shadow forth the personality of the people who lived within its
                            walls…. A sense of quiet growth awoke in sleeping minds. It was the time for art
                            and beauty to awake in the land.</p>
                        <p>"Instead the giant, Industry, awoke. Boys, who in the schools had read of Lincoln,
                            walking for miles through the forest to borrow his first book … began to read in
                            the newspapers and magazines of men who by developing their faculty for getting and keeping
                            money had become suddenly and overwhelmingly rich. Hired writers called these men great, and
                            there was no maturity of mind in the people with which to combat the force of the statement,
                            often repeated….</p>

                    Hamlin Garland and other writers saw the starkness and desperation of this effort in the Populist
                    Revolt. As William Allen White described it, <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It was a fanaticism like the crusades. Indeed the delusion that was working on the people
                            took the form of religious frenzy. Sacred hymns were torn from their pious tunes to give
                            place to words which deified the cause and made gold—and all its symbols,
                            capital, wealth, plutocracy—diabolical. At night, from 10,000 little white
                            school-house windows, lights twinkled back vain hope to the stars…. They sang
                            their barbaric songs in unrhythmic jargon, with something of the same mad faith that
                            inspired the martyrs going to the stake. Far into the night the voices rose,
                            women's voices, children's voices, the voices of old men, of youths and of
                            maidens rose on the ebbing prairie breezes as the crusaders of the revolution rode home,
                            praising the people's will as though it were God's will and cursing wealth

            <p>By the 1920's the cult of business was firmly entrenched. Americans began to invest the
                    businessman with all the attributes of a new national elite; a few, like Bruce Barton in his
                    best-selling biography of Christ, even tried to recast traditional Christianity in the new mold,
                    calling Jesus the Great Salesman and the Golden Rule the best advertising copy ever written. Most
                    Americans, however, were satisfied simply to see the Rotarian replace the Granger as the American
                    self-image.</p>
            <p>The agrarian tradition of older America did not vanish completely, of course; its attitudes and
                    outlooks still remain important parts of the American scene. The Turner thesis, though criticized
                    vociferously in the last twenty years, remains in its essentials the single most widely accepted
                    interpretation of American history. Isolationism and nativism are still to be encountered in their
                    traditional guises, and the Jeffersonian-Jacksonian political tradition is still the one <list type="footnotes">

                    American regards the successful businessman as the epitome of American national superiority. His
                    ideas, his attitudes and values, his likes and dislikes, his evaluation of himself are well-nigh

                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he attended lectures by the noted Louis Agassiz. About 1859 he received a degree

            <p>Immediately upon the outbreak of the war, Dr. Fletcher enlisted in the Sixth Regiment of Indiana

                    </placeName> on April 25, 1861. As indicated in his journal, Fletcher served twenty days as a
                    hospital surgeon, presumably at Camp Morton, before his regiment left for western <placeName>

            <p>Although Fletcher missed the engagement at Philippi because he was among those who were sent on the
                    foray against St. Marys, he soon had opportunity to exhibit great courage and daring. After helping
                    care for the wounded at Philippi, he became a "scout" or spy. On June 27 he
                    volunteered <list type="footnotes">

                            </placeName>. According to the father's diary, William decided to volunteer as
                            early as April 17, only three days after the fall of Fort Sumter. Apparently, he began
                            service at Camp Morton on April 18, for under date of April 19, the father recorded in his
                            diary that Billy, as he called his son, had enlisted and "campd on the ground last
                            night." On May 12 the father noted that Billy had become an aide to his colonel but
                            that he seemed rather gloomy. Quite likely it was about this time that Dr. Fletcher
                            completed his twenty days of medical service only to learn that the medical appointment
                            which he expected was not forthcoming. Entries in Calvin Fletcher's diary for the
                            period from May, 1861, through February, 1862, indicate that William B. Fletcher was
                            courageous and daring, perhaps to the point of being reckless. On May 26, the father wrote
                            that he had told his son good-by, expressing the hope that he would not be killed. William
                            is reported as having replied that he would turn up again like a bad penny.</item>

                                                copy of the William B. Fletcher Diary, although Fletcher's
                                                handwriting is at times difficult to decipher. Original paragraphing,
                                                spelling, and punctuation have been followed. There are instances in
                                                which it is impossible to determine whether Fletcher intended a given
                                                punctuation mark to be a comma, period, or dash; there are also
                                                instances in which it is not possible to tell whether he intended a
                                                given word to be capitalized. In these doubtful cases, punctuation and
                                                capitalization have been interpreted according to modern usage.</p>
                                            <p>All sketches in Fletcher's diary, except for two small unclear

                                                place they appear in the original as technically feasible. Since
                                                Fletcher fitted his sketches closely into his text, the following

                                            in the Governor's mansion and obtained the place. Disappointed, but
                                            with undampened resolution, he applied to each regiment for admission as
                                            private, without being able to find a single vacancy. At last Colonel
                                            Crittenden kindly discovered that the Sixth was in need of a fife-major,
                                            and, without a very scrutinizing examination, introduced the applicant to
                                            the situation. The talents of the young doctor soon made his services in
                                            other quarters not only acceptable but needful, and he had but one march at
                                            the head of his regiment as fife-major."</item>

            <p>Of the "slightly more than four hundred Parkman letters … printed in this
                    edition" (I, p. lxi) none is extraordinarily moving or revealing. None is of any high
                    literary value. The best writing appears in those not properly part of any correspondence but done
                    as essays intended for formal publication—"Letters to the Editor" and
                    the like. Except in controversy where he was formidable, Parkman was a gentlemanly and friendly
                    letter writer who was bluff, businesslike, and effective rather than lively, moving, or elegant.
                    Even in youth he wrote reticently. The little surviving correspondence from his <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> Trail adventure is disappointing. Neither do the letters in these volumes add much to
                    what Parkman's biographers and the <hi rend="i">Journals</hi> have told us.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless these two well-printed and scrupulously edited volumes were well worth the doing. They
                    fill out the Parkman record definitively. And they tell the story of the man who wrote the great
                    forest histories with matchless directness, authoritativeness, and finality. Rich in detail, with
                    hundreds of more or less recondite facts supplied by Professor Jacobs, Parkman's <hi rend="i">Letters</hi> finally constitute a kind of manual of the historiographical life as a
                    great man lived it. They provide wonderful insights into the world of that cultivated,
                    internationalist, intellectual Proper <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> which so fascinated Howells and James (who both in turn fascinated Parkman when they
                    wrote about his milieu). The letters document perfectly the qualities of Parkman's mind:
                    his zeal, toughness, and stoicism; the clarity, retentiveness, independence, and impressive capacity
                    for objectivity of his intelligence; the intriguing blends of romanticism, aristocracy, and
                    practicality in his outlook.</p>
            <p>Inevitably, the central motif of his letters as of his life is Parkman's fight for health.
                    Near-blindness, migraines, exhaustion, racking tension, insomnia—and then arthritis which
                    forbids the exercise that alleviates other afflictions—cut him down again and again.
                    Emotional losses exacerbate physical difficulties. For months and years he is prostrated. Medical
                    science is helpless, and "cures" as often injure as help him. They always fail.
                    And yet he lives out his three-score years and ten. He produces the long series of beautifully
                    written, solidly and originally researched histories and his novel. He engages significantly in
                    public controversy and even finds time to develop a lily and become briefly a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> professor of horticulture.</p>
            <p>Twenty years younger than Emerson, Parkman showed many of Emerson's
                    "Plotinus-Montaigne" or "wingéd <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>" traits. His original determination to unite personal experience of the
                    wilderness with exact historical documentation smacks of that. "The best characteristic of
                    my books is, I think," he wrote retrospectively, "that their subjects are largely
                    studied from real life. They have involved, however, a prodigious amount of mousing in libraries and
                    archives" (II, <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-057-1-082"/> p. 209). It says a good deal about the
                    man, a pet lover, that any reader of his letters would know that in "mousing" he
                    thought of himself as cat, not mouse.</p>
            <p>In the same way, Parkman sought to hold all of life in balance between the fact and the ideal. The
                    best of authors were Shakespeare and Molièe—but the best to bring a boy up on
                    was Scott: "… an educational force of the first value, in all the qualities of
                    the man and the gentleman; and if, as Mr. Howells tells us, his influence is undemocratic, then so
                    much the worse for democracy" (II, p. 240). Perhaps Parkman did not know how closely his
                    ideal of a republican aristocracy centered on a romantic concept of the gentleman conformed to that
                    of Fenimore Cooper—though "Cooper, Irving, &amp; Bryant" are named
                    the "American writers to whom I owe most" (II, p. 240).</p>
            <p>For all the picture these letters, like most literature on Parkman, give us of the debilitated if
                    heroic, closeted Brahmin, Parkman's ability to conduct his public and particularly his
                    professional life effectively is impressive. He understood the "business of
                    authorship" and managed it far more astutely than Melville or even Henry James (to say
                    nothing of Poe). He worked painstakingly and foresightedly to cooperate with and make friends of
                    American, Canadian, and French historians. He took responsibility for building and advancing the
                    profession—not for self-promotion but for Clio. And yet he profited as a researcher and
                    undoubtedly in the elevation of his reputation by such activities.</p>
            <p>Parkman worked hard for others, but when necessary he hit hard for the credit of his own name and
                    veracity. He loaned expensive documents; he sacrificed as well as enthused to help other
                    men's editions into print. Of course his own work was advantaged, the grist flowed to his
                    mill. But in the long run it was all for the love of history. And his final disinterestedness is
                    perhaps best demonstrated by the generosity of his gifts to libraries, especially those of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Historical Society. One of the largest categories of letters is given to such
                    professional concerns, and it is here that Professor Jacobs' diligence in annotating names,
                    papers, books, old controversies, etc. shines to best advantage. The editor makes whole pages of the
                    history of history come to life in his notes. Altogether, he and his publisher are to be
                    congratulated on these volumes.</p>

            <p>These hefty books—four very substantial volumes in weight as well as
                    content—add an increment of solid worth to the shelf of available surveys of the history
                    of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Considering the number of excellent works of this sort which teachers and general
                    readers may turn to, no one should have any difficulty today in finding a general American history
                    which in size, organization, point of view, and style satisfies his own predilections. In fact, one
                    might almost say that there is an embarrassment of riches in this respect.</p>
            <p>The Kraus and Dulles volumes form the part of the <hi rend="i">University of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                        </placeName> History of the Modern World</hi> dealing with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> of America. The two volumes divide that history at the conventional place, the year
                    1865—an orthodoxy which from today's point of view seems less defensible and
                    desirable than it did a generation ago and which seems to stem more from the traditional semester
                    organization of year-long general courses in American history than anything else. Surely
                    Reconstruction and its aftermath belong primarily to the era of the Civil War. Unfortunately, the
                    economics of scholarly book publishing rule out any innovation which might jeopardize the widespread
                    adoption of the books as textbooks regardless of the merits of the innovation. We will have to be
                    patient with this unfortunate truncation of a unified period, which by implication confuses the
                    location of a major watershed in American history.</p>
            <p>Here is history excellently written—lucid, sprinkled with occasional sprightly wit,
                    eminently readable in every respect—which can be recommended as an admirable guide for
                    the student and layman and as a very useful summary for the professional historian. Here also is
                    history which exhibits on its every page testimony to the high standards of contemporary scholarship
                    in the field. It is authoritative, careful, and crisply up-to-date in fact and interpretation. The
                    authors have given us, despite some minor flaws, a survey which is a model for its kind. One perhaps
                    might have wished for somewhat more interpretation at the expense of a few factual details; perhaps,
                    too, there could have been more stress upon weaving together American affairs and those of the other
                    nations of the world. These are small matters, however, compared with the over-all high quality of
                    the volumes.</p>
            <p>Physically and functionally these volumes, as all of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>'s history series, are a joy to use. Handsomely bound and clearly printed on
                    excellent paper, with good indices and a full and perceptively annotated bibliography, they
                    immediately impress one as fine specimens of the art of bookmaking. The authors, the editors of the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Press are to be heartily congratulated.</p>
            <p>The history of Professors Malone and Rauch, while offered specifically as an undergraduate college
                    textbook, is far more than just a <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-057-1-084"/> student handbook. Like the
                    Kraus-Dulles volumes these are a very good general history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Here, too, the story of American history is divided at the Civil War, with Professor
                    Malone writing the volume dealing with the period before 1865 and Professor Rauch the volume on the
                    period after 1865. In style and scholarship this history is also first-rate. Both the authors have
                    felicitous styles that are equal to all the demands put upon them for imaginatively re-creating such
                    an epic as America's history. Clear but not sparse, vigorous but not unsubtle, colorful but
                    not extravagant—from the first page the writing enables the reader to settle back and
                    allow himself to be carried pleasantly and excitingly into this perennially absorbing story.</p>
            <p>However excellent these authors are from the literary point of view, they are no less impressive in
                    their ability to handle skillfully the techniques and apparatus of the scholarly historian. Clio
                    need fear no shortcomings from her devotees here. This history is careful, sound, and judicious, on
                    the one hand, and liberal, questioning, and imaginative on the other. Both students and laymen could
                    not find a much better introduction to what today's professional historian tries to do with
                    history for the reader who is a nonspecialist.</p>
            <p>It is too bad, however, that such a fine, rich, vigorous story should be entombed in a drab and
                    dreary set of covers. The outward appearance of the books is reminiscent of the most uninspired and
                    dull elementary school textbooks of the 1920's. If the packaging principle of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> Avenue people is as important as they say it is, Messers. Appleton-Century-Crofts, Inc.
                    have done a disservice to what is otherwise a fine product. Once one is inside the offending
                    binding, the maps, charts, paper, and typography are excellent. The text is also often pleasantly
                    relieved by tastefully chosen and well-reproduced illustrations. (To this reader a work of history
                    without illustrations, particularly contemporary portraits and scenes, is often like an otherwise
                    beautifully furnished room that lacks pictures.) There is also a very full bibliography and the
                    usual apparatus designed to aid students—appendices containing the Declaration of
                    Independence and the Constitution; tables of political parties, federal executive officers, etc.</p>
            <p>One consequence of reviewing two such excellent specimens of the general survey-textbook type
                    history, together with the knowledge that quite a few other works of this sort are available, each
                    in their own way possessing also considerable excellence, is to wonder about the value of additional
                    time and effort being spent in producing any more—at least for the time being. It would
                    be too bad if the best historians of this generation were to be exploited by the gigantic boom
                    appearing in the textbook publishing world (reflected in the soaring of book publishers'
                    stock and the frenetic buying, selling, and reorganization of textbook publishing concerns), and

            <p>Such first-rate historical talents as we have should address themselves, it seems to this reviewer,
                    to one of the pressing historical problems of our times: the advancement of history, once again, to
                    the stature of being one of the most important <hi rend="i">literary</hi> products of our culture.
                    It is time to realize that the novel need not be the chief <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-057-1-085"/>
                    literary means of commentary on the human condition. The public success of Winston
                    Churchill's extended histories shows that the intelligent general reader of today is
                    capable of being interested in reading history, provided that it is literarily satisfying, and is
                    not at all dismayed by multivolume works in the grand manner. Perhaps now is the time for the best
                    historians to win back the place that history once enjoyed in the reading public's favor
                    during the days of Prescott, Bancroft, Irving, Parkman, Macaulay, etc. A few courageous historians
                    today are daring to return to the writing of history in the grand manner; let us hope that others of
                    literary talent as well as historical ability will emulate them.</p>

                    </placeName>. Three of these pamphlets give an account of the heresy trial of a Presbyterian

                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> criticizes the unfair manner of the trial and the theological arguments by the
                    prosecution and judges. Apparently the defendant in his sermons had emphasized the importance of
                    obedience to the laws of God and good works at the expense of justification by faith. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>

                    </placeName> more than held his own in the argument and in winning the sympathy of the people for
                    the minister until it developed that the defendant had delivered as his own the sermons of an able
                    but unorthodox and condemned theologian of the early church. <placeName>

                    </placeName> in disgust withdrew from the congregation for life but continued to contribute to the
                    church. The fourth of these pamphlets gives a description of the stoves <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-057-1-086"/> and fireplaces of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>

                    gases and vapors; and the effects of drafts when striking a limited part of the human body and their

                    men of the colonies. The number of the second group of letters increased rapidly as time passed. It
                    is clear from a reading of the letters that thinkers valued the insight and judgment of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and that he was anxious to exchange ideas with stimulating thinkers in any area of

            <p>The period of the American Revolution seems in danger of going the route of the Civil War. Before its
                    bicentennial anniversary, it may also virtually disappear in a flood of undiscriminating
                    publication. Against this threat, Professor Carl Ubbelohde has helped buttress the wall of
                    scholarship with this well-researched volume on one of the factors which contributed to friction
                    between <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and the colonies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Vice-Admiralty Courts and the American Revolution</hi> fills the need for a
                    monograph on that particular subject. While historical background is supplied, the bulk of the book
                    is devoted to the decade preceding the Revolution. The hierarchy of the courts and the mechanics of
                    the system are described and related to the problems of the time.</p>
            <p>The vice-admiralty courts did not figure much in the colonial mind before the 1760's.
                    Although the Navigation Act of 1696 gave the courts jurisdiction in trade violations, they remained
                    little known until the end of the French and Indian War. Those colonists, merchants and seamen <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-057-1-087"/> in particular, who were aware of these courts thought of them as
                    a protection against foreign intervention or as a means of swift justice.</p>
            <p>The Grenville administration changed this with the "Black Act" of 1764. As a part
                    of the new revenue system, the mother country established in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Halifax</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nsc">Nova Scotia</region>
               </placeName>, a
                    super-court with authority from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> to Newfoundland. The colonists were offended by the granting of jurisdiction in revenue
                    cases to the vice-admiralty courts which, to their horror, did not rely on juries. Quick to assume
                    injustice, Americans believed their rights restricted.</p>
            <p>From this point on the situation deteriorated as the British and their colonists began to go through
                    motions which are standard in colonial relations. The officials in the courts throughout this period
                    were in danger of mob violence if they performed their functions. Ships seized for violations of the
                    law were wrested from the British.</p>
            <p>The Empire's masters attempted to retain control by granting concessions. In regard to the
                    court system, the government established four district courts to replace the one super-court at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Halifax</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but the colonists had reached the point where they viewed this modification as a
                    further extension of British dominion rather than as an attempted compromise. As Ubbelohde aptly
                    writes: "Words were no longer of any use: the pattern of attack and counterattack had gone
                    too far" (p. 179).</p>
            <p>With the outbreak of hostilities, the courts collapsed. Ironically, Americans realized that courts to
                    handle maritime disputes were necessary and established an admiralty court system of their own. In
                    one case, the position of judge was offered to Richard Morris, who had sat on the bench under the
                    old regime. The cycle was complete.</p>
            <p>Ubbelohde has presented a scholarly study which merits its publication by the Institute of Early
                    American History and Culture. His bibliography shows that he has exhausted the sources on this side
                    of the Atlantic and, with the aid of microfilm, on the other side as well. His book is a valuable
                    aid to anyone who wishes to understand the coming of the American Revolution.</p>

            <p>This is Louis Martin Sears's valedictory work. He died May 15, 1960, just one month before
                    publication of this volume. It is fortunate that Professor Sears lived long enough to finish his
                    inquiry into <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s sources of information on the French Revolution and his reaction to that
                    violent upheaval, for this is the balanced and mature analysis of a scholar whose adult lifetime was
                    largely spent in research in the federal period of American history. In this his last and perhaps
                    his best book, Professor Sears presents his reasoned concept of a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> thoroughly human but possessing great patience and evidencing clarity of purpose and
                    depth of wisdom which few other leaders have shown.</p>
            <p>The French Revolution began in 1789, the very year of George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s inauguration as first president of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-057-1-088"/> Indeed, the first meeting of the Estates General
                    was held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
                    </placeName> just five days after <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> took office. In the beginning America was generally enthusiastic about the revolution
                    in a sister state. But the terror of 1792 and the execution of Louis XVI in January of 1793 cooled
                    such ardor. And finally war between <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>

                    chapter of Sears's book represents one year in the revolutionary era, and the author has
                    provided a brief summary of revolutionary events at the beginning of each of the chapters. Professor
                    Sears definitely limits his book to <placeName>

                    can examine the data in the same order in which it came to Washingon. Biographical sketches in the
                    appendix acquaint one with those persons of secondary importance who are named in the book.</p>
            <p>The files of correspondence exhibit some interesting side lights. Jefferson remembered the early and
                    more idealistic days of the revolution which he had observed in 1789, and neither the bloody terror
                    nor the execution of some of his closest French friends could dampen his enthusiasm. Only protracted
                    experience with Citizen Genet finally wrought the change. Gouverneur Morris is acknowledged by two
                    French historical authorities, Taine and Esmein, to be one of the best observers of the French
                    Revolution, and his brilliant reports were invaluable to Washingon. Yet Morris'
                    aristocratic ways and his outspoken antipathy to the excesses of the French radicals led the
                    revolutionary French regime to demand his recall. James <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName>, who replaced Morris, went overboard to rewin French friendship, and this led <placeName>

            <p>What did Jacksonian Democracy mean? What was the nature of the movement? Whence came its support and
                    what was its appeal? These questions have been treated by historians of the period, and various
                    interpretations of the Jacksonian phenomenon have been advanced. Recent scholars such as Arthur M.
                    Schlesinger, Jr., Richard Hofstadter, Bray <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Louis Hartz, Marvin Myers, and others have argued persuasively for one point of view
                    or another. Discussions by these men have provided us with new understanding of some of the
                    complexities of the Jackson period, and such discussions offer a continuing challenge to historians
                    of the future. Debate has, however, centered on the large questions; while many have suggested the
                    need for research of a precise and limited nature, few have been willing to undertake it.</p>
            <p>Now, in his study of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Workingmen's movement, Walter Hugins presents us with the results of that kind
                    of limited investigation necessary to fuller comprehension of Jacksonian Democracy. In so doing he
                    has established the significance of the small questions as well as the large and the importance of
                    the hitherto unheralded Workingmen as well as their more famous contemporaries. But he has done more
                    than this. From another standpoint his most important contribution is methodological. Hugins has
                    shown us how effectively techniques more characteristic of other disciplines, particularly
                    sociology, can sometimes be used by historians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Jacksonian Democracy and the Working Class</hi> is divided into three parts indicative
                    of the threefold analysis employed by the author. The first part is concerned with the relationship
                    between political parties and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Workingmen's movement. There was, Hugins argues, an evident continuity linking
                    the Workingmen's party of 1829-1830, the Democratic party of the Bank War period, and the
                    Antimonopoly and Locofoco movements of the middle thirties. The second section of the book contains
                    a chapter on Workingmen and the labor movement in which Hugins demonstrates that "the
                    interests and objectives of the Workingmen generally transcended the narrow vision of the labor
                    movement" (p. 79). This chapter is followed by biographical vignettes of various
                    individuals active in the Workingmen's movement and by a statistical analysis of
                    occupations. Having examined the socioeconomic basis of the movement, Hugins turns finally to its
                    program. His conclusion that Jacksonian Democracy in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> "was the product of the interaction of diverse groups whose common denominator
                    was not loyalty to President or Party, but the desire for social change and individual
                    amelioration" (p. 218) is based upon careful evaluation of voting records.</p>
            <p>Here, then, is a valuable book which will be widely used by students of Jacksonian Democracy. Yet the
                    kind of analysis Hugins employs, his immersion in the particular rather than the general, and his
                    somewhat pedestrian style combine to make it a book which will have few attractions for those who
                    are not specialists in the period. While this <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-057-1-090"/> reviewer agrees
                    with the rather blunt assertion that the study "sheds light" on an important phase
                    of Jacksonian Democracy, he cannot help but recoil from the frequent use of a tired
                    clich$eA. Hugins is to be commended, however, for the task he has undertaken and for his
                    diligence in carrying it out.</p>

            <p>Their hearts were black; their blood was yellow; and their minds were blank. This, Frank L. Klement
                    recognizes as the traditional description of the critics of the Lincoln administration during the
                    Civil War. In this volume he attempts to dispel this myth, which remains untouched though scholars
                    have for years been engaged in a re-examination of the history of the Civil War. The Copperhead
                    movement in the Middle West has long needed the kind of study which Klement accords it. After
                    tracing the roots of Copperheadism to various economic, social, and religious problems of the
                    period, the author then contends that much of the Copperhead tradition can be attributed to the
                    Republican administrations which needed a stimulus to improve Northern morale, an excuse for
                    arbitrary arrests, and an issue with which to discredit the Democratic opposition.</p>
            <p>For those who prefer their history in the James Ford Rhodes tradition, Copperheads in the Middle West
                    may cause some disquieting moments. Klement regards the Knights of the Golden Circle and their
                    secret society counterparts merely as bungling, inept, minor league fanatics, who at the lowest
                    level possibly hoped for personal aggrandizement and at the highest level may have wished to provide
                    competition for the very effective Republican Union Leagues. Only in the hands of the Republicans
                    did membership in the societies become legion and society activities dangerous. Klement's
                    carefully documented and well-substantiated volume further describes the Copperheads as, in the
                    main, well-intentioned Democratic conservatives who were sincerely opposed to the economic, social,
                    and political changes resulting from the Civil War. The romance of secret organizations, traitorous
                    leaders, and subversive plots dies hard, but Klement's research undoubtedly gives a truer
                    and more valid picture of Copperheadism than does the traditionl interpretation.</p>
            <p>It is perhaps in its rather broad interpretation of the term Copperhead that Klement's book
                    is weakest, for the reader may be left with the impression that all Democrats were Copperheads.
                    True, Civil War Republicans certainly struggled to create this impression, but historians have not
                    so condemned Democrats who did not work actively against the war. Indeed Klement narrowly misses
                    removing the poisonous fangs of the Copperheads completely by finding their venom for the most part
                    in the minds and hearts of Black Republicans. A further question arises concerning
                    Klement's evaluation of Logan Esarey's A History of Indiana. Careful readers of
                    Esarey may fail to discover the traditional treatment and biased glorification of Oliver P. <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-057-1-091"/> Morton, Indiana's controversial Civil War governor,
                    which Klement asserts can be found there.</p>
            <p>One final word of commendation is due this reappraisal of mid-western Copperheadism. It is a work
                    that evokes strong feeling in the reader. Klement's treatment of the petty partisanship in
                    which both parties indulged is enough to arouse any reader to indignation against some supposedly
                    patriotic Civil War leaders. That partisanship and patriotism were synonymous terms during the Civil
                    War era is undeniable, and Frank Klement has endeavored to disclose the sordid machinations of petty
                    politicians—machinations too long hidden by the golden glow of historical fiction.</p>

            <p>As the centennial observance of the Civil War is approached, students will become almost surfeited
                    with books pertaining to various aspects of the conflict. But few volumes will attain the excellence
                    of <hi rend="i">The American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War.</hi> The publishers have
                    produced a volume which can hardly be surpassed in format and contents. Bruce Catton, a Pulitzer
                    prize winner and generally considered one of the most prolific authorities on the subject of the
                    Civil War, has written the narrative for the book. This fact in itself assures the high quality of
                    the production, which cost $2,000,000.</p>
            <p>This book presents truly a panorama of the war in all its ramifications. It contains 836
                    pictures—wash drawings, water colors, etchings, photographs, lithographs, and posters,
                    with about one-third in gorgeous colors. Many of the illustrations have never been available to the
                    general public before. The eighteen battle-picture maps are of unusual clarity; and the eighty-four
                    photos of battlefields, taken today but at the same season and hour and under the same weather
                    conditions as when the battles took place, are indeed remarkable.</p>
            <p>The Introduction by Richard M. Ketchum acquaints the reader with the general scope of the contents.
                    It is followed by nineteen chapters, starting with "A House Divided," which
                    depicts an innocent America moving haltingly but inexorably from 1850 onward toward the horrors of a
                    civil war. The topics of Lincoln's election and the formation of the Confederate <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> of America conclude this chapter. The narrative of subsequent chapters covers the story
                    of the war from start to finish: the military and naval campaigns, the political atmosphere of the
                    1860's, the changing objectives of the war, the leaders on both sides, the economic and
                    social forces involved, and the war's diplomatic aspects.</p>
            <p>In the final chapter, "A Sound of Distant Drums," Catton eloquently summarizes the
                    meaning of the Civil War: "It left America with a legend and a haunting memory …
                    the enduring realization that when <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-057-1-092"/> the great challenge comes,
                    the most ordinary people can show that they value something more than they value their own lives.
                    When the last of the veterans had gone, and the sorrows and bitternesses which the war created had
                    at last worn away, this memory remained. The men who fought in the Civil War, speaking for all
                    Americans, had said something the country could never forget" (p. 606).</p>
            <p>All names, places, and events are noted in a comprehensive index of twelve pages of three columns
                    each. It contains over one thousand major references and scores of sub-items.</p>
            <p>It would be an understatement to say that this book is a collector's prize. It is much more
                    than that. For any American family, here is a dramatic record of the war. It is brief and yet
                    complete, accurate but not pedantic; it is evocative and absorbing, with language that is graceful
                    and eloquent; it is as close to life and as colorful as today's fine graphic art and
                    pictorial journalism can come.</p>

            <p>When in September, 1862, Artemus Ward referred to Edwin Forrest as a "grate acter,"
                    he reflected the view American theatregoers had held for over thirty years. From the time of his <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> debut as a twenty-year-old Othello in 1826, Forrest rose steadily in his profession to
                    become the unchallenged idol of American tragic theatre.</p>
            <p>Through ensuing years, however, the image of Forrest, the man, has been lost. Now, in a masterful
                    biography, Richard Moody has restored Edwin Forrest to vibrant reality. Judiciously weighing and
                    organizing his evidence, Moody has blended it into a vigorous narrative delineating Forrest as a
                    person.</p>
            <p>A model of then-popular concepts of masculine beauty, Forrest used his carefully nurtured strength to
                    thrill audiences by spectacular leaps from level to level on the stage and by such actions as
                    lifting an actor from the floor by the throat and swinging him about in a semicircle at
                    arm's length. His popularity allowed him to make high salary demands on theatre managers,
                    who were then obliged to raise regular box office prices for Forrest productions. At thirty-two
                    Forrest earned $33,000 a season, equivalent to an untaxed income of $125,000

                    </placeName> in 1866, for example, he averaged $2,300 per performance.</p>
            <p>When his twelve-year marriage ended in charges and countercharges of adultery, Forrest entered a long
                    period of litigation over alimony payments. At the time of his separation he faced a professional
                    challenge from an old stage rival, William Macready, the English actor. The partisan animosity
                    arising from competing <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> productions of Macbeth led Forrest's adherents among the Bowery
                    B'hoys to attack the Macready offering at the Astor Place Opera House, resulting in the
                    violent riot which Moody traces in detail in a previous book.</p>
            <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-057-1-093"/>
            <p>After a three-year retirement from 1857 to 1860, Forrest was forced by the pressure of alimony
                    payments to return to the stage. His old admirers enthusiastically welcomed his reappearance, but he
                    failed to win new supporters. Though crippled by rheumatism, Forrest trouped beyond the retirement
                    age of other leading actors—Kemble and Garrick retired at sixty, for example. In the last
                    year of his life, at the age of sixty-six, Forrest completed an eight-thousand-mile tour, playing
                    125 performances.</p>
            <p>In a cogent final chapter Professor Moody assays Forrest's "mobile magic."
                    What results is a model description of a theatrical style, a description based on fact and presented
                    in concrete terms. The place of Edwin Forrest in our cultural history is evaluated in
                    Moody's definitive summation: "In the middle fifty years of the past century no
                    native-born, native-trained actor climbed so high … and carried the raging democratic
                    fever to the stage with such fierce passion. And no actor compelled so many Americans to pay so much
                    for a tempestuous evening in the theatre" (p. 405).</p>

            <p>Hundreds of thousands of pages have been printed dealing with various phases of the wars waged by the <placeName>

                    </placeName> West between 1866 and 1891. As yet, however, no comprehensive account of this
                    "quarter of a century of conflict" has been published. Obviously such a study
                    would require several volumes, but this book gives in eleven chapters a colorful picture of the
                    campaigns and engagements of the army against the Indians in this period as seen by the newspaper
                    correspondents.</p>
            <p>The author lists twelve major campaigns in these twenty-five years in which 930 battles and
                    skirmishes were fought. Eight of these campaigns were against the tribes of the plains and deserts,
                    three dealt with those of the mountains, and only one was waged in a Pacific coast state. In the
                    various engagements the army lost 932 officers and enlisted men, and 1,061 were wounded. Military
                    records also estimate the number of Indians killed by soldiers as well as the number of actions
                    fought against Indians by civilians in this period. The figures given in both cases must be only
                    wild guesses, for the Indians always carried away their dead if possible, and many minor skirmishes
                    between civilians and Indians were never reported.</p>
            <p>Just as the veteran army officer who had served throughout the Civil War found his former experience
                    of little value in fighting Indians, so did the most seasoned correspondent find himself in an
                    entirely new situation when campaigning with the army on the Indian frontier. Here his chief needs
                    were a horse, gun, and a courier to carry his dispatches to the nearest telegraph station, which
                    might be a hundred or more miles away. He wore rough western garb, shared an officer's tent
                    and mess, ate the sometimes scanty rations of hardtack, bacon, beans, and <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-057-1-094"/> coffee, and endured the same hardships as the soldiers. At times he had
                    to fight for his life, for as a white man he was an enemy whose scalp was regarded by every red
                    warrior as a trophy with the same value as that of a soldier. In fact Mark Kellogg, representing the
                    Bismarck <hi rend="i">Tribune,</hi> died with Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn.</p>
            <p>While the work of the newspaper correspondents is Knight's primary theme, his book goes very
                    far beyond this to give a brief account of every campaign and battle of the period. As a result it
                    reveals much information as to the personal qualities of the military leaders and the strategy they
                    employed. It is a little surprising that the author bases his summary of the Battle of the Little
                    Big Horn on E. I. Stewart's <hi rend="i">Custer's Luck</hi> instead of on W. A.
                    Graham's <hi rend="i">The Custer Myth,</hi> which he later states is the most valuable book
                    on that engagment. This point is not important, however, since this conflict is one of the most
                    controversial subjects in American history.</p>
            <p>Indian fighting in the West was about over by the close of 1881 except for the efforts of the army to
                    capture Geronimo and his little band of Apaches in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="azu">Arizona</region>
                    </placeName> and the brief Sioux outbreak in Dakota in 1890–1891 culminating in the
                    Battle of Wounded Knee. A swarm of reporters covered this battle, but from 1866 to 1881 there were
                    only twenty identifiable accredited correspondents with the army in the field. They represented many
                    newspapers, largely those in the West or Middle West. Only the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> reported every major campaign from 1868 to 1881, but the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi> also reported consistently on the army in the West.</p>
            <p>The author not only describes the work of all these twenty correspondents, but in his final chapter
                    summarizes the subsequent career of each of them. They include Henry M. Stanley, later best known as
                    an African explorer, and James J. O'Kelly, who became a foreign correspondent for the <placeName>

                    </placeName>

                    Finerty, author of <hi rend="i">War-Path and Bivouac,</hi> served one term in Congress, while
                    Charles S. Diehl became manager of the Associated Press. Most of the others were to win distinction
                    as newspaper publishers, foreign correspondents, in state politics, in the development of the West,
                    and in Australian affairs. Four, including Kellogg, died before 1891 or soon thereafter.</p>
            <p>This is a most significant and interesting book which should be read by everyone interested in Indian
                    affairs during the period it covers. It is remarkably well written, and seven maps and twelve
                    illustrations add much to its value. The bibliography is imposing and the index adequate.</p>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, the same period of fear of oligarchic plutocracy, of depressions, and of panaceas,
                    witnessed the publication <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-057-1-095"/> of the nation's most famous
                    socialist novel, Edward Bellamy's <hi rend="i">Looking Backward</hi> (1888).
                    When—thanks in part to the promotional activities of Grangers and Farmers'
                    Alliances—Bellamy's book became a best seller, the market was flooded with other
                    books of this genre. Among the most famous of these was <hi rend="i">Caesar's Column</hi>
                    by the eccentric, dynamic Alliance orator and organizer, Ignatius Donnelly, who stated in 1892 at
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> meeting of the People's party founders that "not to know …
                    [Edward Bellamy] is to argue one's self unknown."</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Looking Backward</hi> delineated the evolutionary development of an ideal, democratic
                    but collectivized state of economic equality, brotherly love, and altruistic
                    cooperation—and consequently one of intellectual and spiritual growth. Although Bellamy
                    portrayed a positive picture of what man's will and idealism could create, he also
                    criticized capitalist sinners. Donnelly presented in <hi rend="i">Caesar's Column not
                    only</hi> a trenchant attack on capitalism and revolutionary anarchism but also a negative portrait
                    of what the year 1988 would be if Bellamy's inspired humanity did not evolve—if
                    the greed and selfishness and "indifference to the great bond of brotherhood which lies at
                    the base of Christianity" (p. 3) did not change. The misery and hatred of the exploited,
                    brutalized laborers would result in a bloody anarchist revolution which would destroy civilization,
                    and this destruction is symbolized by "Caesar's Column," the burial tower
                    of the dead. Like Steinbeck in the 1930's, Donnelly warned that "`the grapes of
                    wrath'" could result in "red juice … that flows thick and fast
                    …" (p. 259).</p>
            <p>Although Donnelly's ideal society as described in the chapters entitled
                    "Gabriel's Utopia" and "The Garden in the Mountain"
                    does not incorporate Bellamy's collective society, its general aims are the
                    same—and so are many of the ideas included in <hi rend="i">Caesar's Column.</hi>
                    Although Professor Walter Rideout states in his excellent Introduction that Donnelly had read <hi rend="i">Looking Backward</hi> and that he was "willing to cash in on
                    Bellamy's fame," he commends Donnelly for concepts expressed first by Bellamy:
                    that Darwinian survival of the fittest might mean the survival of the most ruthless, that rugged
                    individualism could victimize all classes, that environment could encourage crime, that solving the
                    material problem might be conducive to spiritual and moral growth, and that technology and
                    unemployment were related. Furthermore, Professor Rideout fails to note many other obvious
                    similarities between Bellamy's and Donnelly's books. Among the long list of
                    similarities which could be presented would be the use of the sermon in both books to epitomize the
                    characteristics of the civilizations depicted.</p>
            <p>Although <hi rend="i">Caesar's Column</hi> could be studied, therefore, as a presentation of
                    a counter-utopia greatly influenced by <hi rend="i">Looking Backward,</hi> the most rewarding
                    approach to it today is as an important <hi rend="i">pièce de sièele.</hi> It
                    should be read by all interested in literature and social sciences not because of its melodramatic,
                    romantic, and oratorical qualities, but because it endeavors to answer so many
                    "whys": why Jefferson feared the spirit of commercialism; why political corruption
                    and wealth have a long history; why Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest became an
                    argument for rugged individualism; why the agrarians lost their individualism and laborers organized
                    to become strong; why social legislation was necessary for the salvation of both democracy and <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-057-1-096"/> capitalism; why revolution based upon hatred and violence must
                    fail; why communism and anarchism had their appeal and their unfulfilled promises; and why the
                    peoples of the Congo and other areas of the world are on the march today—and in the wrong
                    direction.</p>

                    another cleric's story of his adventure in secreting a runaway slave, and firsthand
                    recollections of immigration and settlement.</p>
            <p>With all due respect to the secondary writers who are included—gentlemen who command
                    respect in their own right—the volume would have been much stronger had it drawn upon
                    original accounts alone. Surely diligent research would have turned up better material than, for
                    example, the opening selection which deals with Coronado's march through the Southwest. By
                    all means, Coronado must be mentioned at the start of a volume treating the history of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, but not by means of a 1940 magazine piece. That rather jars the reader, finding such a

            <p>This book presents new material in the field of public administration, being the first comprehensive
                    attempt at an appraisal of interstate compact agencies. The volume contains a valuable discussion
                    concerning the position of interstate compact agencies within the governmental structure, and the
                    increase, especially since World War II, in the formation and utilization of these agencies. The
                    formation of interstate compacts provides "a new dimension for state power" and
                    permits "states to take continuing cooperative action in fields where they cannot act
                    effectively or do not wish to act alone, fields which might fall by default to the federal power if
                    not occupied through the initiative of the states" (p. 6).</p>
            <p>The authors select six interstate agencies for special case studies: the Pecos River Commission, the
                    Atlantic <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Marine Fisheries Commission, the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> Valley Water
                    Sanitation Commission, the Waterfront Commission of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Harbor, the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and the Southern Regional Education
                    Board. The volume is actually an outgrowth of a project begun while both authors were staff members
                    of the Southern Regional Education Board, which was established in 1949 and operates successfully in
                    the southern states from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>. The experience gained by both writers is evident in their lucid description of the
                    relationship between staff and officers in the administration of interstate compacts.</p>
            <p>The authors maintain an objective approach concerning the formation of interstate compacts except,
                    perhaps, in the instance of one agency—the Interstate Oil Compact Commission. The
                    statements that "the Interstate Oil Compact Commission was formed strictly to prevent waste
                    of the nation's oil resources" (p. 91) and that the "motivating force on
                    the part of the participating states was resistance to federal intervention" (p. 196) fail
                    to take into consideration basic factors which were an intimate part of the chaotic conditions in
                    the oil producing fields prior to the formation of the compact. It is naive to suggest that the oil
                    producing interests were concerned only with conservation. Stabilization of the price structure is a
                    definite factor in the formation of a state compact.</p>
            <p>A discussion of conservation which utilizes the parlance of the oil industry is an adventure in
                    semantics. In order to understand what is meant by conservation, one must consider the definition of
                    the word "waste." In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, for example, after the decision by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Supreme Court in the <hi rend="i">Champlin</hi> case, the state legislature in 1933
                    amended the proration statute and defined the term "waste" to include
                    "economic waste" and waste incident to the production of crude oil or <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-057-1-098"/> petroleum beyond the capacities of transportation or marketing
                    facilities or beyond <hi rend="i">reasonable market demand</hi> (italics by the reviewer). This
                    decision was made during a period of turmoil and tension in the oil producing
                    fields—state militias had been called out in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The situation was stabilized in 1933 by the enactment of a federal statute—the National
                    Recovery Administration. The effects of the NRA may be illustrated by the stabilization of the
                    market and the progressive increase in the price of oil. Prior to the enactment of the NRA, oil sold
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> for 28¢ per barrel (May, 1933); in September, 1933, under the NRA the price
                    made one jump from 34¢ to 85¢ per barr 1! Federal control went out, however,
                    with the passing of the NRA via the Supreme Court's decision in the <hi rend="i">Schechter</hi> case. The industry then made some effort to obtain a federal control bill, in fact,
                    the rise and fall in the volume of demand for federal control appears to have a direct relation to
                    market conditions. Early movements in 1932 for a state compact through the instrument of the Oil <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Advisory Committee were shunted aside in preference to a pending bill for a higher
                    tariff on foreign oil imports, but this committee was the nucleus for the formation of the
                    Interstate Oil Compact Commission in 1935.</p>
            <p>Contrary to the statement in Leach and Sugg's volume that no evidence has been presented
                    which indicates attempts on the part of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission to stabilize or fix
                    prices or create or perpetuate a monopoly, such evidence was contained in the Wherry Report of 1940.
                    An outgrowth of this report was an antitrust suit instituted by the Department of Justice which was
                    settled by a consent decree in 1941. The industry has been operating under this consent decree from
                    that time to the present.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the greatest contribution of the authors is in their discussion of factors that contribute to
                    the success or failure of the agencies. Success, they find, depends directly upon the ability and
                    continuity of the staffs recruited by these agencies to carry out their work. This maxim could be
                    applied with equal validity to independent commissions within the federal governmental structure.</p>
            <p>Leach and Sugg have made some interesting conclusions and predictions concerning interstate compact
                    agencies and conclude that "interstate compact agencies can play a tremendous role in the
                    states' resumption of power" (p. 226). Theirs is a useful and pertinent volume
                    which contributes a great deal both to understanding of federal-state relations and certain aspects
                    of public administration.</p>

                    Report,</hi> Number 30. (<placeName>

                    123. Index. $3.95.) As stated in the opening paragraph of the Preface: "This
                    study deals with the development and the current status of Indiana labor relations law. Its
                    fundamental purpose is to shed light on this vital area of Hoosier society and to provide a better
                    basis for the evaluation of the content and direction of the laws regulating and controlling
                    union-management relations. The study not only highlights the substance of the legislation, but also
                    presents an analysis of its experience." Professor Witney, who probably knows Indiana labor
                    law much better than any other individual, discusses labor legislation in a broad industrial
                    context. He indicates that the Indiana state government has exercised an increased role in
                    labor-management relations during recent decades. Witney notes that the federal government has
                    exclusive jurisdiction over a very large segment of labor-management relations, but he is aware that
                    an important part is left to the states. In addition, he gives attention to that varying
                    "no man's land" which is not clearly within either state or federal
                    jurisdiction. The need for such a volume as this is increased by the fact that Indiana's
                    labor code is drawn from a number of statutes. Witney's work deserves careful study by such
                    diverse groups as lawyers, politicians, labor leaders, employers, and historians, as well as by
                    interested citizens.</p>

                    account of efforts of her family and relatives to find her. More than half a century passed in this
                    fruitless search, but in 1835 George W. Ewing, an Indiana fur trader, located an old
                    "Indian" woman near Peru who was thought to be Frances Slocum. Although her
                    brothers and other relatives were satisfied that she was their long "lost sister"
                    and wanted her to return to them, Frances chose to remain with her Indian family and friends.
                    Various of the "facts" of <hi rend="i">The Lost Sister Among the Miamis</hi>
                    remain uncertain. Nevertheless, with a bit of background explanation, most junior high school
                    students would find this an exciting book. Moreover, a thoughtful teacher could use this little
                    volume as a basis for a discussion of stimulating and important questions about the Indian as well
                    as for a discussion of relationships between them and early settlers.</p>

                    Robert M. La Follette's <hi rend="i">Autobiography</hi> was completed during the
                    presidential campaign of 1912. Though in some respects clearly a tract of its times, it remains an
                    essential document for any careful study of the Progressive era. Rereading this autobiography after
                    a lapse of about a quarter of a century was an enjoyable and stimulating experience. La
                    Follette's emphasis on issues, principles, and problems is in striking contrast to most
                    political speeches of the 1960 campaign; his emphasis on the role and importance of individuals in
                    government is in striking contrast to current American emphasis on groups and blocs; and his views
                    about the proper role of government in relation to the economy as a whole, as well as its
                    responsibility to individuals, is also at variance with governmental policies and practices under
                    both Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. La Follette, feared by many as being a radical in 1912,
                    somehow reads like a conservative in 1960!</p>

                    Illustrations, bibliography. Paperbound.) Here is an extremely useful guide regarding the care and
                    administration of manuscripts. In concise language and often using definite examples, Miss Kane,
                    curator of manuscripts at the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society, considers what controls and preliminary understandings are
                    desirable in the acquisition of manuscripts and how collections may be organized. Then she offers
                    useful information about the sorting, evaluation, preservation, and cataloging of manuscripts. No
                    librarian or curator will find "all of the answers" in this brief booklet, but it
                    would be difficult to find more significant and practical information in a discussion of similar
                    length. A five-page bibliography offers a number of useful references. Quite likely librarians or
                    curators of small libraries will find this publication especially valuable. In addition, it includes
                    much information which needs to be better understood by historians and authors, too many of whom
                    underestimate their indebtedness to curators and librarians.</p>

                    the achievements of the family make it of more than mere local significance. An article concerning

                    book, which originally appeared in 1937, now appears in a third edition is doubtless evidence of the
                    increasing interest of Americans in genealogy. According to its original Preface, it was written
                    principally for amateurs. Attention is given to sources of genealogical information, how to dig
                    needed facts out of them, how to organize information obtained, available aids, etc. Among special
                    topics treated are those of how to become a member of the DAR and how to trace one's
                    ancestors back across the Atlantic.</p>
