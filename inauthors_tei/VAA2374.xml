                <p>I<hi rend="sc">N THE</hi> fall of 1916, while visiting at the home of Mr. F. N.
                    Doubleday, a member of the house which publishes most of my books, in
                    conversation with my very dear friend Mrs. Neltje De Graff Doubleday, the author
                    of a number of invaluable books on birds and flowers, she began to question me
                    about unusual experiences I encountered afield. I told her some of the things
                    here recorded, the queerest and most peculiar things that I had seen during a
                    lifetime of personal contact with the birds. In the course of that intimate
                    conversation, Mrs. Doubleday conceived and planned this book, feelingI hope not
                    mistakenlythat these intimate personal experiences with birds, which so
                    intensely interested her, would not fail to be of equal interest to other bird
                    lovers and protectors. She felt that these records faithfully and simply set
                    down would add very largely to the sum of human achievement in a scientific
                    estimate of the habits and characteristics of birds. So, I have written for any
                    one who is interested, these sketches of personal experience, as I outlined them
                    to such a devoted lover and champion of the birds as Neltje Blanchan.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">A</hi>LMOST my first distinct memory is connected with a bird.
                        I found a woodpecker lying on the grass beneath a cherry tree. I could not
                        understand why he did not fly with the birds flocking over the fruit; I
                        spread his wings and tossed him through the air, but he only fell to the
                        ground. Then I noticed that his kind were all flying from the tree tops and
                        high places, so I carried him upstairs and launched him from a window. He
                        fell as before. Then I thought perhaps he was hungry; I took him to the
                        garden, pried open his beak, and stuffed him with green gooseberries, but
                        still he would not fly. In complete discouragement, I sat on the front steps
                        with the bird in my lap, wondering what I could do to help him. My father
                        passed, so I began asking questions. That morning I learned a new word; I
                        had not known &quot;dead&quot; before. Father very carefully
                        explained that he never permitted robins, orioles, or any song bird <pb
                            id="VAA2374-017" n="4"/> to be killed, but that woodpeckers made no
                        music, while they carried away distressingly large quantities of fruit. It
                        was then that I made my first business proposition: &quot;If you will
                        make the boys stop shooting woodpeckers, I will not eat another cherry. The
                        birds may have all of mine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>My father said that was a bargain. I never before noticed that cherries were
                        so big, so red, so tempting, while it seemed that all of our family,
                        helpers, and friends spent most of their time offering them to me. Our cook
                        almost broke my heart by baking a little cherry pie in a scalloped tartpan
                        for me. I could not say a word, but I put my hands behind me and backed away
                        from that awful temptation with tears in my eyes. At that point my mother
                        intervened. She said she had decided that we had cherries enough for all of
                        our needs and for the birds as well, so she gave me the pie.</p>
                    <p>It is probable that this small sacrifice on my part set me to watching and
                        thinking about the birds, which every day flashed their bright colours and
                        sang their unceasing songs all over and around us. For years one pair of
                        wrens homed over the kitchen door, the entrance to their dwelling being a
                        knot hole in the upper casing. While the mother bird brooded the father
                        frequently spent an hour at a time, often in the rain, on a wooden acorn
                        ornamenting the top of the pump on our back porch, becoming so tame that he
                        frequently <pb id="VAA2374-018" n="5"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2374-9">

                        <pb id="VAA2374-019" n="6"/> brushed us with his wings in going back and
                        forth to his door, sometimes alighting on our heads. In his behalf I spent
                        much time sweeping up the dbris dropped by the pair on the back porch while
                        building their nest, because my mother threatened to nail shut the opening;
                        but as she never did, I strongly suspect that she had no real intention of
                        so doing.</p>
                    <p>She was a great friend of a pair of hummingbirds that almost always nested in
                        a honeysuckle over her bedroom window. One day, the front door having been
                        left open, the male bird flew into the room and did not seem able to find
                        his way out again. When he had circled the ceiling, striking his head until
                        the feathers were worn away and tiny touches of red began to show on the
                        paper, my mother could endure no more; so she summoned help and finally
                        succeeded in capturing the bird, which she allowed me to hold in my hands
                        while she showed me how small its body was, how tiny its feet, how fine its
                        bill.</p>
                    <p>She had much trouble with the swifts that built in the chimney to a huge
                        fireplace in our living room. A number of these birds would build their
                        nests near the top of this chimney every season, beginning a raucous chatter
                        very early in the morning, constantly dropping twigs and clay over the
                        andirons and into the fireplace; while, either from imperfect construction
                        or through heavy rains loosening the fastenings, there never <pb
                            id="VAA2374-020" n="7"/> was a season that one or more nests did not
                        fall into the fireplace, frequently carrying young birds almost ready for
                        flight with them. They were very seldom killed in the fall, but they swept
                        down soot, and flopped around in the ashes to the vexation of
                        Mother&apos;s housewifely soul. The old birds often fell with the nests
                        or followed down the chimney and escaped into the room; so they, too,
                        decorated the ceiling with their blood, if they fell when we chanced to be
                        away from home and they were not released immediately. Often, if the nest
                        were not completely shattered, I gathered up the pieces, wired them back
                        into shape to the best of my ability, climbed from an upstairs window to the
                        roof of the back part of the house, which was only one story, and from there
                        to the roof of the second story. By using pieces of shingle and bits of
                        wire, I replaced the nests inside the chimney, then put the little birds
                        back into them. It was a frequent prophecy with the family that I should
                        break my neck in this undertaking.</p>
                    <p>My experience with birds began as soon as I could walk, at my home, Hopewell
                        Farm, in Wabash County, Indiana. As I recall our farm at that time, it was
                        of unusual beauty, a perfect inland location for birds. The public highway
                        ran north and south through the middle of the land. On the west of the road
                        were a number of cultivated fields and one large tract of native timber. On
                        the east of the road lay the residence, surrounded <pb id="VAA2374-021"
                            n="8"/> by a large, tree-filled dooryard, south of which was a garden,
                        bright with flowers and shrubs. Behind the dooryard spread a very large
                        orchard filled with apple trees and bordered with peach trees on three
                        sides, with rare peach, plum, and pear trees on the fourth. A lane ran from
                        the barnyard to a woods pasture where much of the heavy timber had been cut
                        away leaving only a few large trees interspersed with berry bushes and
                        thickets of wild-rose and elder. Three streams of running water crossed the
                        place, one flowing through the woods and rounding the foot of a steep hill
                        south of the residence. A smaller one flowed in a parallel direction on the
                        north, both emptying into a larger stream coming from the north through our
                        meadow and joining the Wabash River several miles south of us.</p>
                    <p>The land was new, a large part of it having been cleared and put into
                        cultivation by my father. All of the wild growth was much ranker and more
                        luxuriant than at the present time, while this was true also of everything
                        we cultivated. My mother used the natural fertilizer from the poultry house
                        and stable in her garden; the cleanings from the barn were scattered over
                        the fields; but no other fertilizer ever was talked of at that time.</p>
                    <p>The flowers and all growth were more luxuriant than now because the soil was
                        young, the temperature more equable. Summer always brought heavy rains every
                        few days; long periods of heat <pb id="VAA2374-022" n="9"/> and drought and
                        cyclones or high, raging winds were unknown. As I recall, there were small
                        flocks of birds for every <hi rend="i">one</hi> that is seen at the present
                        time. We were taught to love the song birds for their beauty, their music,
                        and the likeness of their life processes to ours. We were told that we must
                        not harm a bird&apos;s nest because it would break the little mother
                        bird&apos;s heart; but no one ever particularly impressed it upon us to
                        protect them because the berry and fruit crops would fail if we did not. My
                        father was the only person I ever heard mention the subject in my childhood.
                        The birds&apos; work as insect exterminators was not generally realized
                        or taught at that time, while the spraying of fruit trees was unknown. When
                        the trees had been pruned and the trunks given a thorough coat of whitewash,
                        everything that was known to do for their care had been done; and so
                        bounteous and fine were the fruit crops in my father&apos;s orchard that
                        the whitewash was not used there, but I did see it in neighbouring orchards
                        and dooryards.</p>
                    <p>I distinctly remember the swarms of birds that flocked over the cherry trees
                        when the fruit was ripe, and the Babel of song that went up from the
                        orchard, while the field birds were so numerous that we were always allowed
                        to take the eggs from any quail nest we found, provided we first used the
                        precaution of raking one egg from the nest with a long stick to see to what
                        stage of incubation <pb id="VAA2374-023" n="10"/> it had progressed. If the
                        quail had not finished laying or had brooded only a few hours, we carried
                        the eggs to the house, put them in cold water, boiled them for twelve
                        minutes, let them cool in the water, and divided them among the children, as
                        one of the greatest treats possible. No other egg I ever have tasted was so
                        fine in grain and delicate in flavour. Despite the destruction we must have
                        wrought in a season, the quail were so numerous that it was the custom to
                        build traps of long, fine pieces of wood, covered with leaves, and set with
                        a trigger, baited with grain. A trail of grain led to these traps, where
                        from half a dozen up to twelve and more of the birds frequently imprisoned
                        themselves at one time. The advantage over shooting was that the birds were
                        in perfect condition when taken. Now, this seems a dreadful thing to have
                        done, but at that time quail were so plentiful we never could distinguish
                        any diminution in their numbers, while rabbits and squirrels were pests,
                        which we had to fight to protect our fruit trees and for our comfort. After
                        the cold weather set in at Thanksgiving time, we always had a large supply
                        of frozen quail and rabbits hanging in the smokehouse for a treat upon the
                        arrival of unexpected guests.</p>
                    <p>The only game bird, the protection of which I ever heard mentioned in my
                        childhood, was the wild pigeon. My father never would allow our boys to go
                        to the pigeon roosts, baffle the birds <pb id="VAA2374-024" n="11"/> with
                        the light of lanterns, club them, and carry them away by bagfuls, as some of
                        our neighbours did. He said that such proceedings would eventually end in
                        the extermination of the birds; that God gave us these creatures to enjoy
                        but not to destroy; so he always cautioned all of us, either in hunting or
                        fishing, to be content with a &quot;moderate share.&quot; The
                        prophecy he then made concerning the wild pigeons has found its fulfillment
                        in my day, for a heavy reward has been offered for a number of years past
                        for even one specimen of this beautiful bird, the metallic lustre of whose
                        plumage made a gleam of light when on wing, and whose whistling flight was
                        familiar music in my childhood. These birds now seem to have joined the
                        extinct starlings of <hi rend="i">Ile de la Runion.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>All of the trees and most of the bushes surrounding the house were filled
                        with bird nests. A privet bush in one corner of the garden always had at
                        least one nest, while the grape arbour and berry bushes sheltered many.
                        There were little cups of hair even among the currant and gooseberry bushes.
                        Every bird that ever homed in an orchard in the Central States was to be
                        found in the apple trees, in a big heap of trimmings at the back of the
                        orchard, in the hollow rails of the fence, or in the grassy corners of our
                        orchard. I think too that every bird of the fields was to be found in our
                        meadow, our clover fields, and in the fence corners, while the big trees of
                        the woods pasture <pb id="VAA2374-025" n="12"/> and of the deep woods had
                        their share of crows, hawks, owls; while twenty years after we moved away, a
                        pair of golden eagles nested in the woods pasture, and were shot because
                        they were carrying off small pigs and lambs. The female of this pair is my
                        only mounted bird.</p>
                    <p>From my earliest recollection I was the friend and devoted champion of every
                        bird that nested in the garden, on the fences, on the ground, in the bushes,
                        in the dooryard, or in the orchard trees. From breakfast until dinner and
                        from dinner until supper, almost my entire day was spent in making the
                        rounds of these nests, watching the birds while they built, brooded, or fed
                        their young, championing their cause against other children, cats, snakes,
                        red squirrels, or larger animals such as skunks and foxes, which were so
                        numerous that we held organized fox-chases for their extermination.</p>
                    <p>I was always on terms of the greatest intimacy with a pewee that built on a
                        rafter supporting the roof of a log pig-pen. It was very easy to climb from
                        a rail fence to the roof, then by working loose a clapboard near the nest I
                        could watch the birds&apos; daily life and make friends with them.</p>
                    <p>I do not recall one instance during my childhood when I ever intruded myself
                        into the affairs of any bird in such a manner as to cause it to desert its
                        nest location. I always approached by slow degrees, remained motionless a
                        long <pb id="VAA2374-026" n="13"/> time, and did the birds no harm whatever;
                        so they very soon accepted me as a part of their daily life.</p>
                    <p>One of the heartbreaks of my childhood occurred when one of our hired men
                        forgot his instructions and put up the third bar of an opening in one of the
                        west field fences, which I had asked Father to have him leave down, because
                        in the opening chiselled out to hold the bar was the nest of a chippy having
                        four exquisite, speckled eggs. When I found this bar in place and could not
                        remove it, I hurried to my father in a tumult of grief and anger which very
                        nearly resulted in the dismissal of the man; but it was too late to save the
                        bird and her nest.</p>
                    <p>I can not recall how many robin nests I located in a season, but there were
                        two locations in which the robins built where access to them was especially
                        convenient. One was a catalpa tree in the northwest corner of our dooryard,
                        to the branches of which I could easily step from the front picket fence. In
                        my morning rounds I always climbed to visit this robin, sitting on a branch
                        talking to the brooding mother bird, almost always carrying her a worm or a
                        berry in my apron pocket as a friendship offering. The other location was
                        the early harvest apple tree of our orchard. This tree was especially
                        designed by nature for the convenience of children in climbing. In the first
                        place the tree grew at an angle, and in the second <pb id="VAA2374-027"
                            n="14"/> it had a growth as large as a good-sized butter bowl on the top
                        side which was in the proper position to make a first step in the ascent of
                        the tree. We used to start a few rods away on the run, take this first step,
                        which brought us in reach of the nearest branch, and from there we went up
                        the tree almost as swiftly as we ran along the path. I can not recall one
                        spring of my childhood in which the robins did not have at least one nest in
                        this tree.</p>
                    <p>Coming from it early one summer morning I heard the crack of my
                        father&apos;s rifle in the dooryard, then I saw a big bird whirling to
                        earth in the milk yard, which adjoined the garden on one side, the orchard
                        on the other. I saw my father start toward the bird, so as fast as possible
                        I sped after him, my bare feet making no sound on the hard, worn path. A
                        large chicken hawk was sitting back on his tail, one wing stiffly extended,
                        the tip hanging broken and bleeding, while in the bird&apos;s eyes there
                        was a look of commingled pain, fear, and regal defiance that drove me out of
                        my senses. My father grasped his rifle by the barrel. As the butt came
                        whirling around, I sprang before him and sheltered the hawk with my body,
                        the gun whizzing past my head so close that the rush of air fanned my face.
                        My father dragged me away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you mad?&quot; he cried. &quot;I barely missed braining
                        you!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-028" n="15"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d rather you did hit me,&quot; I answered,
                        &quot;than to have you strike a bird when its eyes are like that! Oh,
                        Father, please don&apos;t kill him! He never can fly again. Give him to
                        me! Do please give him to me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Keep back!&quot; cried my father. &quot;He will tear your
                        face!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father was an ordained minister, better versed in Biblical history than any
                        other man I ever have known intimately. To him, &quot;hawk&quot;
                        meant &quot;Ayit.&quot; This old Hebrew word, literally translated,
                        means &quot;to tear and scratch the face.&quot; That is exactly what
                        a hawk meant to my father; the word and bird were synonymous. To me, it
                        meant something very different, because I had watched this pair of kingly
                        birds carry heavy sticks and limbs, with which they had built a nest in a
                        big oak tree overhanging a bank of the brook that ran through our meadow.
                        The structure was bigger than a bushel basket, but no one else of our family
                        knew about it, because it was well screened by the leaves of the tree. It
                        was part of my self-imposed, daily task to gather up from the bank skeletons
                        of any wild bird, rabbit, or domestic fowl, which the hawks had dropped
                        there, and consign them to the current so that the telltale evidence of
                        their location was quickly carried down stream. I envied these birds their
                        power to soar in the face of the wind, to ride with the stiff gale of a
                        beating storm, or to hang motionless as if frozen in air, <pb
                            id="VAA2374-029" n="16"/> according to their will, as I envied nothing
                        else on earth. I had haunted the region of this nest so long that I knew it
                        contained a mother bird and a pair of young big enough to look down at me
                        over the edge of the nest, while I was quite sure that the birds were as
                        well acquainted with me as I was with them.</p>
                    <p>So, for the first time in my life, I contradicted my father.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He won&apos;t!&quot; I cried. &quot;This bird knows me.
                        He knows I would not hurt him. Oh, do please give him to me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>To prove my assertion, I twisted from my father&apos;s grasp and laid my
                        hands on the bird. The hawk huddled against me for protection. In a choice
                        between a towering man who threatened with a rifle and the familiar figure
                        of a child who offered protection, is it any wonder that the bird preferred
                        the child? My father gazed at us in amazement.</p>
                    <p>&quot;God knows I do not understand you,&quot; he said in all
                        reverence. &quot;Keep the bird, if you think you can!&quot;</p>
                    <p>After my father had gone, the hawk began to revive from the shock. He was not
                        so friendly as I had hoped he would be. In fact, he showed decided signs of
                        wanting to scratch and bite. I did not know how to begin caring for him. My
                        first thought was that he should be in a shady place, where he could have
                        something to perch upon. I <pb id="VAA2374-030" n="17"/> hunted a long stick
                        and by patient manoeuvring drove him to the woodhouse, where he climbed to
                        the highest part of the corded wood. There he sat in sullen suffering for
                        the remainder of the day. The next morning I went to him very early. I
                        thought that after a day and a night with a broken wing and without food or
                        drink he would surely allow me to care for him. I cautiously approached him
                        with a basin of water. He drew back as far as he could crowd into a corner.
                        I had always heard that wounded soldiers were frantic for water, so I
                        patiently held the basin before the bird, dabbling and splashing to show him
                        that it contained water. Suddenly, he thrust in his beak and drank like a
                        famished creature. Then I offered him some scraped meat, which he finally
                        took from the end of a stick. The flies began to cluster over the broken
                        wing, and I knew that that must be stopped; so with one clip of the sheep
                        shears I cut through the skin and muscle that held the dangling tip. The
                        bird uttered a shrill scream, but he did not attack me. Then I poured cold
                        water over the hurt wing, which was kept stiffly extended, until it was
                        washed clean. From the time I put the cold water on, the bird ceased even to
                        threaten me. He seemed to realize that his pain was relieved. Then I went
                        into the house to ask my mother if there was not something in her medicine
                        chest that would help heal the wound and keep away the flies. She thought
                        that there was, and as <pb id="VAA2374-031" n="18"/> she measured out a
                        white powder for me, she smiled and said: &quot;What a little bird woman
                        you are!&quot;</p>
                    <p>In two weeks, the hawk was as well as he ever could be. By that time he would
                        take food from my fingers and allow me to do anything I chose for him.
                        Inside of a month he followed me through the dooryard, woodyard, and garden
                        much like a dog, although he was a very awkward walker, probably having had
                        less use for his feet in walking than in carrying and holding prey. There
                        were times when birds of his kind, often his mate without doubt, swept low
                        above us. Then he would beat his wings and try frantically to fly. Sometimes
                        he followed them with his despairing eyes as they sailed from sight, and
                        sent after them a scream that never failed to set my heart aching. At such
                        times I could scarcely forgive my father for having deprived such a royal
                        bird of his high estate. Although he never said so, I believe from after
                        events that my father had the same feeling.</p>
                    <p>By this time I had become known in the family as the unfailing friend of the
                        birds. Every unfortunate bird caught in a reaper, wounded by having been
                        stepped on by stock, or that had escaped from the attack of a cat, a red
                        squirrel, or a snake, was brought to me for treatment. No one told me how to
                        care for them. I was so intimate with each different kind that when a member
                            <pb id="VAA2374-032" n="19"/> of any bird family was brought to me I
                        tried to do for it what seemed to be the right thing for a bird of its
                        species. I think that in doctoring them I copied very closely the methods of
                        my mother in treating our hurts.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>HE following year, one morning in early spring, my father
                        called me to him to ask whether I should like to have as a gift the most
                        beautiful thing ever made by man. Of course I eagerly assured him that I
                        should like it very much indeed. Then he told me that he had something for
                        me even finer and more precious than anything man ever had made or ever
                        could make: a gift straight from the hands of the Creator. He then proceeded
                        formally to present me with the personal and indisputable ownership of each
                        bird of every description that made its home on his land. Undoubtedly the
                        completeness of this gift was influenced by his experience with the hawk.
                        Before that time if he had been making such a gift I think he undoubtedly
                        would have reserved the right to exterminate the hawks that preyed on the
                        fields and poultry, the owls that infested the barns and chicken houses, and
                        very probably, too, the woodpeckers, which seemed to take even more of the
                        cherries than did the robins, orioles, or tanagers. That he made the gift
                        complete, with no reservations, proved that he had learned to regard my <pb
                            id="VAA2374-035" n="22"/> regard for the laws of nature, which, even
                        when very young, I seemed dimly to realize and stoutly to maintain; for the
                        worst hawk or owl was quite as dear to me and fully as interesting as the
                        most exquisitely coloured and ecstatic singer. He must have realized that
                        the gift would not be perfect to me if there were exemptions, so he gave me
                        for my very own not only the birds of free, wild flight with flaming colour
                        and thrilling song, with nests of wonder, jewels of eggs, and queer little
                        babies, but also the high flying, wide winged denizens of the big woods,
                        which homed in hollow trees and on large branches, far removed from any
                        personal contact I might ever hope to have with them.</p>
                    <p>Such is the natural greed of human nature that even while he was talking to
                        me I was making a flashing mental inventory of <hi rend="i">my
                        property,</hi> for now I owned the hummingbirds, dressed in green satin with
                        ruby jewels on their throats; the plucky little brown wren that sang by the
                        hour to his mate from the top of the pump, even in a hard rain; the green
                        warbler, nesting in a magnificent specimen of wild sweetbriar beside the
                        back porch; and the song sparrow in the ground cedar beside the fence. The
                        bluebirds, with their breasts of earth&apos;s brown and their backs of
                        Heaven&apos;s deepest blue; the robin, the rain song of which my father
                        loved more than the notes of any other bird, belonged to me. The flaming
                        cardinal and his <pb id="VAA2374-036" n="23"/> Quaker mate, keeping house on
                        a flat limb within ten feet of our front door, were mine; and every bird of
                        the black silk throng that lived in the top branches of four big evergreens
                        in front of our home was mine. The oriole, spilling notes of molten
                        sweetness, as it shot like a ray of detached sunshine to its nest in the
                        chestnut tree across the road was mine; while down beside the north creek,
                        on a top branch of a willow sheltering an immense bed of blue calamus,
                        nested a blood-red tanager, with black velvet wings. Every person visiting
                        our family was taken to see him. With what pride I contemplated my next
                        personally conducted trip to that tree to show the bird of blood-red! Now I
                        owned the pewees in their marvellous little nest under the pig-pen roof, the
                        song sparrow and the indigo finches of the privet bush at the foot of the
                        garden, the swifts of our living room chimney, the swallows on the barn
                        rafters, and the martins under the eaves. When it came to the orchard with
                        its fruit trees and its shrub-filled snake fence corners of bloom and
                        berries, I could not even begin to enumerate the vireos and bluebirds, the
                        catbirds, robins, jays, and thrushes. Mine, too, was the friendly,
                        delicately coloured cuckoo, slipping through the shrub-filled fence corners
                        and bushes of the woods pasture, with his never failing prediction of rain.
                        I remember that in the first moment of tumultuous joy, one thought was to
                        hope that a storm would come soon so that I <pb id="VAA2374-037" n="24"/>
                        might remark in careless, proprietary tones: &quot;Hear my cuckoo
                        calling for rain!&quot;</p>
                    <p>In my enumeration, I included the queer little stilt-legged killdeer that had
                        a nest on the creek bank of the meadow. I was on terms of such intimacy with
                        her during the last few days of her brooding that she would take food from
                        my fingers and even allow me to stroke her wing. There was another pair of
                        hawks nesting in the big oak overhanging the brook a short distance farther
                        in its course to the south; while I was as proud to possess the owls, from
                        every little brown screecher in a hollow apple tree of the orchard to the
                        great horned hooter of the big woods, as I was the finest song and game
                        birds. In the greed of my small soul I saw myself ordering my brothers and
                        sisters never again to take the eggs from any quail nest of the fence
                        corners. I do not recall that I made a virtuous resolve at that minute not
                        to take any more myself, but I do remember that the next time I found a nest
                        of eggs it occurred to me that if I left them to hatch I should have that
                        many more birds, so I never robbed another nest. In that hour I was almost
                        dazed with the wonder and the marvel of my gift, and to-day, after a
                        lifetime of experience among the birds, this gift seems even more wonderful
                        than it did then.</p>
                    <p>That same day the search began for new treasures. No queen on her throne, I
                        am sure, ever felt so rich or so proud as the little girl who owned <pb
                            id="VAA2374-038" n="25"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2374-11">
                            <p>&quot;I was as proud to possess the owls, from every little brown

                                of the big woods, as I was the finest song and game
                            birds&quot;</p>
                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2374-039" n="26"/> every bird on her father&apos;s land. Ever
                        since I could remember I had loved, to the best of my ability, protected,
                        and doctored the birds, but I never before had realized that they were quite
                        so wonderful. From that hour in which they became my personal property every
                        bird of them took on new beauty of colouring, new grace in flight, and
                        previously unnoted sweetness of song. So with the natural acquisitiveness of
                        human nature I began a systematic search to increase my possessions. I
                        climbed every tree in the dooryard and looked over the branches carefully.
                        Not a sweet scented shrub, a honeysuckle, a lilac, a syringa, a rose bush,
                        or a savin escaped my exploring eyes. Then I proceeded to the garden, and
                        one by one I searched the currant, gooseberry, blackberry, and raspberry
                        bushes, the grape arbour, the vines clambering over the fence, and the trees
                        and shrubs of its corners. Then I went over each vine-covered section of the
                        fence enclosing the dooryard, hunting for nests set flat on the crosspieces.
                        I almost tore the hair from my head, while I did tear my apron to pieces and
                        scratched my face, hands, and feet to bleeding in my minute exploration of
                        the big berry patch east of the dooryard, where the Lawton blackberries grew
                        high above my head. Then I extended my search to every corner of the fence
                        enclosing the orchard and took its dozens of trees one at a time, climbing
                        those that I could and standing motionless under those that I could not,
                        intently watching until I am <pb id="VAA2374-040" n="27"/> sure that few, if
                        any, nests were overlooked. After that I gave the buggy-shed, the corn
                        cribs, the pigpens, and the barn a careful examination and then followed the
                        lane fences to the woods pasture in one direction and to the woods in the
                        other. Lastly, I went with my brothers to the fields, and while they
                        cultivated the crops, I searched the enclosing snake fences, with their
                        corner triangles of green, filled with bushes and trees. It is my firm
                        conviction that at that time there were, at the most conservative estimate,
                        fifteen birds to every one that can be located in an equally propitious
                        place and the same amount of territory to-day. Before I had finished my
                        inventory I had so many nests that it was manifestly impossible for me to
                        visit all of them in a day; so I selected sixty of those, which were most
                        conveniently located and belonged to the rarest and most beautiful birds,
                        giving them undivided attention and contenting myself with being able to
                        point out, describe, and boast about the remainder.</p>
                    <p>As always ownership brought its cares. At once an unusual sense of
                        watchfulness developed. No landholder was ever more eager to add to his
                        acres than I was to increase my flock of birds. My first act was to beg my
                        mother for an old teaspoon that I might have to keep. A green warbler in the
                        gooseberry bushes, when stepping into her nest, had pierced the shell of an
                        egg with the sharp nail of one of her toes. If the broken egg <pb
                            id="VAA2374-041" n="28"/> began to leak, it would stick to and soil the
                        others and the nest. I was afraid to put my fingers into the small
                        hair-lined cup, so I secured the spoon for this purpose and afterward always
                        carried it in my apron pocket.</p>
                    <p>Life became one round of battles with cats, snakes, and red squirrels, while
                        crows and jays were not to be trusted near the nests and the young of other
                        birds. It was a long, tedious task to make friends with the builders of each
                        of the chosen nests, for I was forced to approach very slowly and with
                        extreme caution, imitating the call note of the bird the best I could; and
                        when I had gone so near a nest that the brooding mother began to plaster her
                        feathers flat to her body, to draw up her wings, the light of fear began to
                        shine in her beady eyes, and she started to rise to her feet, it was time
                        for me to pause until she regained her confidence and again settled to
                        brooding. Almost always at this point a few more steps could be taken. I
                        usually contented myself with leaving a little of the food that the bird
                        being approached liked best to eat. On going back the following day, it
                        would be possible to advance with confidence as far as I had gone the day
                        before; from there on I would be forced again to work my way slowly and
                        cautiously toward the nest. In this manner gradually the confidence of the
                        mothers could be won so completely that it was permissible to touch them
                        while they brooded. Some of the friendliest <pb id="VAA2374-042" n="29"/>
                        would look at me steadily for a long time and then, with a dart so quick
                        that I had to watch myself lest I shrink back and frighten them, they would
                        snatch the worm or berry held before them.</p>
                    <p>At that time I sincerely thought that it was my work to help those birds feed
                        their young. Half of my breakfast slipped into my apron pockets, while I
                        worked like the proverbial beaver searching the bushes for bugs, hunting
                        worms on the cabbages in the garden, digging them from the earth, and
                        gathering berries and soft fruits. I carried with me grain from the bins in
                        the barns, pounded fine with the hammer and soaked until it was soft for the
                        young of the grain and seed eaters. Few mothers were so careful about the
                        food they fed their children. I gave those nestlings only one bite at a
                        time, and never a morsel of anything until I had watched what it was that
                        the old birds were giving them. Before the nesting season was over they
                        allowed me to take the most wonderful liberties with them. Warblers,
                        Phoebes, sparrows, and finches swarmed all over me, perching
                        indiscriminately on my head, shoulders, and hands, while I stood beside
                        their nests, feeding their young.</p>
                    <p>When it was decided that I had reached a suitable age to attend a city
                        school, I stoutly rebelled, capitulating only when Father said the most
                        precious of my birds might go with me. These, of course, were unfortunates
                        that had fallen from <pb id="VAA2374-043" n="30"/> their nests in high
                        trees, where I could not replace them, those orphaned by an accident or some
                        prowling creature, while sometimes a nest of young birds was brought me by a
                        neighbour who thought he was doing me a kindness; so I left the country in
                        company with nine birds, none smaller than a grosbeak, that had been raised
                        by hand. I had to arrange my school day so that there was a morning hour in
                        which to clean the cages, change sand, scrape perches, scour bath-tubs, and
                        cook food.</p>
                    <p>My especial favourite among my pets was a brown thrasher named Peter, because
                        he had constantly called: &quot;Pe-ter, Pe-ter&quot; in the
                        distressful days when he was missing his mother and growing accustomed to my
                        longer intervals between feedings. One of my brothers had found him helpless
                        and dying beside a country road and had picked him up and put him in his
                        pocket for me. When he was given into my care, he was half-starved. After a
                        few minutes, he opened his bill for food, and in a short time spent in
                        getting acquainted we became the greatest friends. He grew to be a strong,
                        fine, male bird, and in the spring of his second year developed a remarkably
                        sweet voice, with which he imitated the song of every bird that could be
                        heard around our house. He also made excursions into improvisations, which I
                        could not recognize as familiar bird notes. One warm night of summer my
                        father suggested that Peter would be more comfortable if left on the <pb
                            id="VAA2374-044" n="31"/> veranda. That was a mistake. Either a screech
                        owl or a rat attacked him in the night and broke the tip of one wing. In the
                        morning Peter hopped from his open door and showed me his wing. We did all
                        we could to comfort each other. I doctored him as in childhood I had
                        doctored the hawk. I never shall forget the fortitude with which he bore the
                        amputation, not struggling nor making the slightest effort to get away from
                        me, although he cried pitifully. The wing soon healed, but Peter had lost
                        his equilibrium. He never again could fly. Always before, he had had the
                        freedom of the premises. Now he was forced to ride on my shoulder when I
                        went out into the yard, or to hop after me. There was one particular apple
                        tree of our dooryard in which there was a perch where I could learn a lesson
                        much more easily than in school. While I studied, Peter hopped from branch
                        to branch through the tree. One day under pressure of an especially
                        difficult Latin translation I forgot to take Peter with me to the apple
                        tree. A maid in the house saw that he was fretting to be with me, so she put
                        him outside the door. I heard his call, realized he was coming, and climbed
                        down as speedily as possible, but before I could reach him a prowling cat
                        darted from under a shed and caught him. Powerless to give him any aid, I
                        listened to his last, pitiful calls. With one exception he was the most
                        interesting bird I ever raised by hand.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-045" n="32"/>
                    <p>I still had left in my family a splendid cardinal that I think must surely
                        have belonged to the bigger, brighter red birds of the West, a pair of our
                        common Indiana cardinals, and a pair of rose-breasted grosbeaks with their
                        family of four youngsters. The rose-breasted grosbeaks had built a nest in a
                        tall maple tree growing between our sidewalk and the street. A night of high
                        wind and driving rain broke from the tree the branch on which they had
                        located and dropped it in our yard. From an upstairs window I noticed it
                        early in the morning, my attention having been attracted by the distressing
                        calls of the old birds. There was scarcely a trace of the nest to be found
                        as it had been torn to pieces in the parting of the branches, but I did find
                        every one of the four babies. They were too small for my ministrations, so I
                        repaired the nest, put it in a cage, and set it beside the branch. In a
                        short time the mother bird entered to feed the young. The door was held open
                        with a long piece of string and as soon as she entered it closed. Then she
                        was removed to a larger cage in the house. Inside of half an hour the father
                        bird was captured in the same way. Then the cage was put in a partially
                        darkened room with plenty of food and the parents allowed to take care of
                        their young, which they did with scarcely a sign of protest. I was not
                        particularly attached to this family. I merely helped them out of their
                        predicament the best I knew how and when the <pb id="VAA2374-046" n="33"/>
                        young ones were old enough to become self-supporting all of them were given
                        their freedom. During my last two years in school the work became so
                        rigorous that I could not care for my pets and make a grade that would pass
                        me, so reluctantly and not without many tears all of them were trained to
                        become self-supporting and given their freedom.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">A</hi>FTER three years of birdless estate I was so homesick for
                        my former friends that I determined again to surround myself with a bevy of
                        my favourite birds. Having established a home of my own one of the first
                        considerations that came to me was how to fill the houses I still carried
                        with me. The solution of my problem was under way when a niece of mine sent
                        me a green linnet, produced by interbreeding with the canary tribe, a Harz
                        mountain singer carefully trained. My first thought was to secure a mate for
                        him. Through inquiry a neighbour was found who wanted to sell a hen canary
                        having pure yellow colour with white beak and feet, brilliant black eyes,
                        not a discoverable feather off colour. I immediately paid a rather
                        exorbitant price for her and introduced her to my linnet. Theirs was a case
                        of love at first sight. The nest was made by me from a collar box, a piece
                        of white flannel, and some cotton padding. While the birds were busy with
                        the affairs of housekeeping I had a house built for them at a factory in
                        Cincinnati. It was six feet high, four long and three wide, the <pb
                            id="VAA2374-049" n="36"/> sides enamelled white with gold decorations,
                        and had a roof of moss green. This pair of birds accomplished three nestings
                        their first season. The initial brood contained six sturdy youngsters, the
                        second five, and the third four, so that I had seventeen birds for my new
                        house at the end of the first summer. The young birds were of wonderful
                        colour, more than half of them sweet singers. Some of them were green like
                        their father, some pure gold like their mother, some very largely gold with
                        only a touch of green, while others had the green in predominance with
                        beautiful markings of yellow; others had their colour evenly divided between
                        green and yellow, and two of the brood were a solid colour of pure warm
                        dusty tan, a shade I never before nor since saw produced in the feathering
                        of a canary. Unfortunately both of these were hens.</p>
                    <p>With the last brood, in flying from her nest in haste, the mother bird
                        dragged one of the young to the edge of the nest from which he fell to the
                        gravel below. I found him in the morning and thought him dead. Picking him
                        up I started toward the door to toss him out. While on the way a member of
                        the family asked me a question so I stood for a few minutes talking. As I
                        again turned toward the door there was a slight movement on the palm of my
                        hand. I looked down to see that the tiny bare bird with his eyes not yet
                        open was responding to warmth, so instead of throwing him away I returned
                            <pb id="VAA2374-050" n="37"/> him to the nest. Before the day was over
                        he was lifting his head and taking food with the other young. When the brood
                        left the nest I discovered that this bird had a leg out of joint at the
                        socket. He could fly and hop around the cage as well as the others but the
                        injured leg was longer, and while in use, it could be seen that the bird was
                        a cripple. At once my family began to urge that the bird be removed from the
                        cage and put out of what they termed &quot;its misery.&quot; I
                        watched the bird closely but could discover no sign that he was suffering
                        any pain and only very slight inconvenience. In plumage, he was almost the
                        clear yellow of his mother with a touch of green making a perfect cap
                        jockily placed on his head at a very saucy angle, which gave him a
                        particularly pert, ingratiating appearance. In size he was the largest bird
                        of the brood and soon the largest in the cage. This may have been accounted
                        for by the fact that he did not take as much exercise as the other birds,
                        seldom leaving the top perch except for food or water, while when feeding he
                        ate longer. Before any other of the young birds had begun to think of music,
                        this one was trying to sing. In a year he had his father&apos;s whole
                        repertoire, to which he added robin, song sparrow, and indigo finch notes
                        that he learned from outdoor birds flocking over the conservatory, inside
                        which his house stood. When he was two years old, with his feathers settled
                        tight, his head tipped at an impertinent angle, <pb id="VAA2374-051" n="38"
                        /> his beak wide open, he lifted his voice above those of his brothers and
                        father, and sang the most exquisite songs I ever heard from the throat of a
                        canary. He had especial opportunities to learn music from a distant
                        relative, the indigo finch whose nest was in a honeysuckle a few yards from
                        the conservatory. This bird, from the top of a mulberry even closer, sang
                        his full strain at the rate of five times a minute for an hour at a time
                        several hours during a day, making by reliable mathematical calculation over
                        two thousand daily renderings of his song for the greater part of a month.
                        No wonder the canaries learned his notes the master singer especially. To me
                        he was the dearest bird in the Cabin, while everyone admitted that he was
                        the finest singer; but his broken leg was a daily annoyance to a member of
                        my family. One day, during my absence, a woman, whose name and residence I
                        could never learn, called at the Cabin begging to be sold a singer in order
                        that she might raise young birds with a hen canary she had, and my best
                        beloved bird was easily caught and given to her, which was a small
                        heartbreak from which I never have recovered. When the birds of this cage
                        were asleep in a row, filling the highest perch, with their heads tucked
                        under their wings, and their feathers fluffed in cold weather, they looked
                        exactly like gaudy swan&apos;s down powder puffs.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after this, a relative of my husband, <pb id="VAA2374-052" n="39"/>
                        who had been United States consul to Mexico, came home bringing me a
                        wonderfully trained black-headed grosbeak which he had gotten from an Indian
                        bird dealer in the market at Saltillo. This bird was black over the head and
                        back, black on his wings and tail with touches of white, wearing a vest of
                        warm, rotten apple brown. He was a magnificent singer, having sweeter notes
                        than his rose-breasted cousin, and delivering them with more joyous
                        spontaneity than the oriole. His call note was loud, clear, and sweet. He
                        had an individual manner in rendering his stage performances which was as
                        new to me as his person; for he was &quot;a stranger in a strange
                        land.&quot; He sang his full strain at the top of his voice. Then he
                        dropped to a minor tone and sang exactly the same song, note for note; and
                        then, with distended throat and beak so nearly closed that it could barely
                        be seen to move, he gave the same performance pianissimo. Every note was
                        given its full value but many times diminished to such mere threads and
                        whispers of sound that I had to stand near him and listen intently to verify
                        the notes. His strain was two or three times as long and much sweeter than
                        that of his cousins the evening or rose-breasted grosbeak. As I did not know
                        the history of his youth it appealed to me that he might have been taken
                        from a nest when young and reared in the home of a professional
                        bird-catcher, where he learned the notes that made up his repertoire from
                        old birds <pb id="VAA2374-053" n="40"/> of different kinds. This same bird
                        dealer sold to the wife of the consul a gay assortment of exquisitely
                        warbling little birds of blood-red, deep and pale blue, pink, yellow, rose,
                        and purple. She released them in her conservatory with delight, but after
                        their first bath they all proved to be pale yellow canaries gorgeously
                        coloured with Diamond Dyes, which were being introduced into Mexico at that
                        time.</p>
                    <p>My grosbeak had a tender, loving disposition. He was always delighted to
                        leave his cage and perch on my fingers or have the freedom of the room where
                        the flowers were growing, but he was a shameless glutton. Undoubtedly he had
                        been fed by hand when young and never had gotten over the habit, while his
                        diet included almost everything. His gross beak proclaimed him a seed eater,
                        but he flopped his wings and cried vociferously at the sight of fruit,
                        berries, or vegetables, and almost &quot;lost his head&quot; over a
                        luscious worm.</p>
                    <p>Every time I passed the cage he would spread his wings, open his mouth and
                        cry for food like a nestling. He would fly from the perch to the floor of
                        the cage and hop back and forth the length of it, begging for food while I
                        was in sight. Because of this I formed the habit of finding, every time I
                        went to the garden or among the outside flowers, a spider, a worm, or a
                        juicy berry for him before I returned; so he grew to enormous size, <pb
                            id="VAA2374-054" n="41"/> having oily, glossy plumage, while he was
                        almost a constant singer.</p>
                    <p>At about this time, a sister living in Michigan sent me a big African parrot.
                        He was a gaudy creature, having a head and shoulders of the loveliest dark
                        bronzy green. The extreme top of his head was pale blue and light yellow,
                        his breast delicate light green, while his extended wings had feathers of
                        blood-red, deep blue, yellow, and green. He was a fluent talker and a great
                        musician, having been carefully trained to whistle a number of tunes that
                        had been taught him with a flute. He was a fine addition to my bird family.
                        When the grosbeak began to sing the canaries joined in; then the Major
                        drowned all of them by his rendition in clear high notes of &quot;The
                        Washington Post&quot; march, which was a favourite performance; but, as
                        in the case of the grosbeak, he could raise the notes high above the piano
                        or flute and still keep them all of perfect tone, accurate measure and
                        inflection, retaining pure sweetness.</p>
                    <p>That spring, merely to test his marksmanship, one of my neighbours severed
                        the tiny twigs from which depended the nest of an oriole. In the long fall
                        an unhatched egg and the youngest bird were destroyed, the two remaining
                        seeming perfect and healthy. They were very young and required delicate
                        attention and frequent feeding. I knew that in care of the woman of that
                        family, the birds would be dead shortly; so I gave her a dollar for the <pb
                            id="VAA2374-055" n="42"/> little birds and undertook to raise them
                        myself. When they were full grown I gave one of them to a friend, who seemed
                        extremely eager to have it. The one that I kept had his living room in a big
                        brass house, which was very attractive and of which he seemed to be
                        extremely proud. The greater part of the day his door was open so he did as
                        he pleased about remaining in his house. He was the bird I had in mind when
                        I wrote previously that &quot;with one exception&quot; the brown
                        thrasher was the best loved of all the birds I ever raised by hand. There is
                        only one adjective that will adequately describe my oriole, and that is the
                        much abused &quot;charming.&quot; I always gave any bird I reared or
                        accepted from a friend exquisite care. Their cages shone, their perches were
                        clean, their baths were spotless, their food was freshly prepared every
                        morning, they were given only as much as they would consume at a feeding,
                        and the remainder was kept in the refrigerator until later in the day. All
                        of my birds were larger and of richer plumage than those of their species in
                        freedom.</p>
                    <p>My oriole had black parts of jetty blackness; his yellow plumage was a clear
                        warm orange yellow; his eyes were like black diamonds; while, from having
                        been brought up by hand and associated with me and daily receiving almost
                        hourly attention, he had developed practically a reasoning, intelligent
                        brain. He loved to fly around the room and perch on my head or shoulder. He
                        liked <pb id="VAA2374-056" n="43"/> to sleep on the back of my chair when I
                        was sewing. He stuck his sharp, polished bill into almost every affair of my
                        day. Very early in his career he began picking up any bit of thread or
                        wrapping cord he could find in the conservatory or when he flew through the
                        rooms, carrying these to his cage and spending hours weaving them back and
                        forth between the wires. When I saw how busily he worked at this and how
                        much pleasure he seemed to get from it. I gave him lengths of brightly
                        coloured woolen yarn and string to see what he would do with them.</p>
                    <p>One of the biggest fallacies ever published by any nature writer is the
                        statement that male song birds do not work in the building of nests. The
                        general rule is that they carry material assiduously, frequently entering
                        the nest in the course of construction to try to help with the building.
                        This the female almost always resents. I have watched the construction of a
                        number of oriole nests from start to finish. With one in particular I spent
                        three full days, so I know that half of the weaving and more than half of
                        the material carrying was the work of the male. My oriole was particularly
                        expert in weaving. One morning I cut pieces of loosely twisted coarse, stiff
                        twine into lengths, pulling it apart and loosely rolling it into a ball
                        about the size of a pint cup, and gave it to him to play with. He
                        immediately stuck his head into the centre of the ball, worked out a <pb
                            id="VAA2374-057" n="44"/> hollow carefully, and began shaping around him
                        the structure of an oriole&apos;s hammock for its nest exactly as the
                        female bird weaves in freedom.</p>
                    <p>He loved water, often bathing two or three times during the day. He was a
                        practical joker, one of his tricks being to pick up any large pebble from
                        the sand in the bottom of his cage, carry it to the highest perch, and
                        leaning over, drop it in his bath to make the water splash. So long as I
                        watched him and laughed at him, he would keep this up. If I was reading and
                        did not notice his performance, he would resort to some other means of
                        attracting my attention. He was a fine musician and kept the house filled
                        with joyous oriole notes all day.</p>
                    <p>In those days I was experiencing constant struggle to find an outlet for the
                        tumult in my being. On a fourth of a square in a village not a mile from the
                        Limberlost, we laid the foundations of a home. The lot was covered with
                        several tall forest trees, an old orchard of eight apple trees, scattering
                        peach, pear, plum, and cherry, and had been thickly planted years before
                        with bushes, vines, and flowers. Here, my husband built the log cabin of my
                        dreams for me. During my early days in that Cabin I went through more agony
                        than should fall to the lot of the average seeker after a form of
                        self-expression.</p>
                    <p>Because I dearly loved music I thought that might be my medium. Never was any
                        one more <pb id="VAA2374-058" n="45"/> mistaken, but I had to try several
                        things before finding out what I had been born to do. While the musical
                        fever endured I practised for hours every day on the piano or violin. Soon I
                        noticed when playing that the birds set up a perfect Babel of song. If the
                        music was fast and loud, they sang in imitation. If my notes were soft and
                        low, they warbled deep in distended throats. The parrot especially enjoyed
                        whistling to the piano or violin but he disliked the song of the other birds
                        and frequently broke off his most charming strain in order to scream
                        harshly, &quot;Shut up!&quot; at the canaries. Having been taught to
                        whistle with a flute the parrot soon became expert, while the other birds
                        seemed to follow his lead. All of them did their best work with simple old
                        melodies, played slowly. &quot;The Carnival of Venice&quot; seemed
                        to be the most suitable, and the greatest favourite with all of them. After
                        a long course of special training, feeling ready to perform before an
                        audience, I grew vainglorious and wrote to my father to come and be
                        convinced of the wonder I was performing.</p>
                    <p>Then one day my little daughter caught her apron on a nail and tore a long
                        straight slit down it; so I drew the sewing machine from a closet and
                        started to mend the garment. With the exception of the parrot, every one of
                        my birds tuned up and sang &quot;The Carnival of Venice&quot; to the
                        accompaniment of the sewing machine quite as well as they <pb
                            id="VAA2374-059" n="46"/> ever had sung with the violin or piano, so my
                        concert never really materialized before an audience.</p>
                    <p>At this time I had also a pair of cardinals that had come around the house in
                        a half-starved condition during a severe winter of unusual cold and deep
                        snow, so that I enticed them inside in order to feed and take care of them.
                        By spring they had grown so tame that I added them to my bird friends, but
                        among all of them the oriole was my constant companion, my best loved bird.
                        One day, forgetting that he was free, I stepped from a door and was slow
                        about closing the screen behind me. A burst of jubilant notes above me first
                        told me what I had done. I stood heartsick and watched my bird circle up and
                        up, higher than I ever had seen any wild oriole fly. Then he slowly
                        descended in curves and alighted on my head. I walked indoors, carrying him
                        with me, but the mischief had been done. His exuberant joy in that short
                        flight had been too apparent. From that day, I began training him to become
                        self-supporting, and soon I gave him and the cardinals their freedom.</p>
                    <p>That same summer I lost the grosbeak through fatty degeneration. I discovered
                        one morning that he was sick, and taking him from his cage for an
                        examination, I was surprised at the size and weight of his body in my hand;
                        while on blowing apart his feathers to discover the condition of his skin, I
                        found that he resembled nothing so much <pb id="VAA2374-060" n="47"/> as a
                        small roll of clover butter. He died before the day was over, for no cause
                        whatever except that he was so fat that he could not live. His was a marked
                        case of having been &quot;killed by kindness.&quot; Because he was a
                        rare bird with us I sent his body to a taxidermist, who afterwards told me
                        that the bird was so fat, his skin so thin and tender, he could mount it
                        only by preparing a form and transferring to it little pieces not so large
                        as his thumb nail at a time, so his work did not last long.</p>
                    <p>The more I studied and thought, the more clearly I saw, no matter how much I
                        enjoyed having my home full of birds, I had no right to keep wild creatures
                        in captivity; so I never replaced any of these birds. Long before I owned a
                        camera or wrote a word on any nature subject my bird family was reduced to
                        the parrot and canaries. I no longer needed to keep my home full of birds in
                        order to enjoy all of the pleasure that might be had from them, for God had
                        taught me that my gift endured, that all of the birds afield were mine, and
                        that the only way to know and to study them rightly was as they lived, in
                        the abandonment of perfect freedom.</p>
                    <p>Several years later I began writing on natural history subjects, and
                        immediately the question of illustration arose. The editors who had accepted
                        my work began to send me drawings of mounted birds, articulated with wire,
                        stuffed with excelsior, and posed by men. It requires no great <pb
                            id="VAA2374-061" n="48"/> stretch of the imagination to understand how
                        those pictures repelled me. I was horrified. Editors insisted upon
                        illustration; I refused to allow the pictures they could provide to be
                        incorporated in my text; so we were at a standstill.</p>
                    <p>The parrot solved my problem. He was an especial favourite with my husband,
                        beside whose place at the dining table the bird frequently perched on the
                        back of a low chair turned toward the table. In solemn and dignified silence
                        the Major daintily ate food from a plate set before him. There were times
                        when he grew tired of crackers and coffee, and saw something else on the
                        table that he preferred. Then he would try to make us understand what he
                        wanted. Once, after completely losing patience with our stupidity, he
                        climbed from his chair to the table and with flattened feathers and in
                        tremulous haste lest he be rebuked for this breach of discipline before he
                        reached the object of his quest, he made his way among the dishes and
                        snatched up a small green onion. Hurrying back to his chair he greedily ate
                        three fourths of the hot vegetable. Several months later he displayed an
                        unusual desire for something and we could not imagine what he wanted.
                        Finally I suggested that it might be an oyster. He caught one from a fork
                        and went hurrying back and forth across his chair, his wings half-lifted,
                        fussing as he was accustomed to over something he had secured <pb
                            id="VAA2374-062" n="49"/> which he felt might be taken from him. He
                        looked so comical that all of us laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Behold the antipodes!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;Africa and
                        Baltimore Bay! How I wish I had a camera!&quot;</p>
                    <p>That was shortly before Christmas more than twenty years ago. A look not
                        intended for me flashed across the table between my husband and daughter,
                        but I saw it. Christmas brought me a small hand camera. Of course among the
                        first pictures I attempted was one of the Major. That was a most amusing
                        picture, sadly undertimed and overdeveloped; but before the weak streaky
                        print left its first bath I was shouting through the Cabin like an insane
                        creature, for although the picture contained almost every defect of a
                        beginner&apos;s work I could see clearly that it was a perfectly
                        natural, correct reproduction of a living bird. I had found my medium! I
                        could illustrate what I wrote myself! I knew that with patient work the
                        camera could soon be mastered in detail. How to make friends with the birds
                        I knew better than any other one thing on earth.</p>
                    <p>Immediately I ordered a supply of chemicals from one of the leading drug
                        houses of the country, laid in a heavy stock of print paper, and began work
                        in the most intense earnestness. By spring I could make a technically
                        perfect reproduction of the Major or any flower in the conservatory, while I
                        even succeeded in photographing the fish in the aquarium, and, through the
                        window glass, <pb id="VAA2374-063" n="50"/> I made several really remarkable
                        pictures of birds perching or feeding on the sills outside.</p>
                    <p>That spring, with the first dove of March, I went afield. I spent over a
                        thousand dollars in equipment. All of the money accumulated from nature
                        articles and a few stories went to pay for four cameras, each adapted to a
                        different branch of outdoor work, also a small wagonload of field
                        paraphernalia. I transformed the downstairs bathroom into a dark-room and
                        used the kitchen sink for plate and print washing. These arrangements were
                        extremely inconvenient and uncomfortable, as shutting out all light excluded
                        air in summer and heat in winter; but I soon made prints which brought a
                        prominent man of the Eastman Kodak Company to investigate my methods. He
                        frankly admitted that their experts at the factory were not making as good
                        prints on their paper as some I had sent them. I owned a Kodak, but as a
                        rule all of my best negatives were on plates exposed in cameras. I did not
                        subject the gentleman to the shock of showing him that my dark-room was the
                        family bath, my washing tanks the turkey and meat platters in the kitchen
                        sink. I first mastered the mechanism of my equipment, studied good works on
                        photography and experimented with compounding chemicals and developing and
                        fixing plates, and then the difficult processes of print making. At this
                        time I was doing all of the work in the thirteen-room Cabin, except the
                        washing, and was making <pb id="VAA2374-064" n="51"/> most of the clothing
                        worn by my daughter; so I was what might have been considered a busy person.</p>
                    <p>My first feeling on going afield was one of amazement at what my early days
                        among the birds had taught me. Then I was merely amusing myself, following
                        inborn tendencies. Now I learned with every approach to the home of a bird
                        that I was using knowledge acquired in childhood. I knew what location each
                        bird would choose for her nest, how she would build it, brood, and care for
                        her young. When I wanted the picture of any particular bird I knew exactly
                        where to search for its nest, so no time was wasted. When I found a nest,
                        all that was necessary was to set up a camera before it, focus it sharply,
                        cover the camera to the lens with a green cloth or a few twigs, then repeat
                        the methods of childhood. The birds had not changed in the slightest; nor
                        had I. By using tact, patience, and plain common sense, and drawing on
                        former experience, in three days or less I was on a working basis with any
                        nest of birds I ever attempted to cultivate, so that I could secure poses of
                        the old birds performing every action of their lives anywhere in the
                        locality of their nests.</p>

                        fellowship with humanity. In order to do this it is necessary to move
                        slowly, to live among the birds until one thoroughly understands their
                        characteristics and habits, to remain near their locations until they have
                        become <unclear>s-</unclear> accustomed to one as a part of their daily life
                        that they will be perfectly natural in one&apos;s presence. The best
                        friend I ever had in field work, Mr. Bob Black, an oilman operating leases
                        beside the Wabash River, spent his spare time for several seasons locating
                        nests for me. When I was extremely rushed, during the brooding months of May
                        and June especially, by copying my methods he frequently trained families of
                        birds for me so perfectly that they would endure my presence close enough to
                        a nest to allow me to begin work with brooding pictures at the time of my
                        first visit. He used a soap box set on stakes for a camera, his coat for a
                        focusing cloth. With these he imitated my approach and work so closely that
                        the birds paid no attention to me when I began operations.</p>
                    <p>Each student of bird life will rate the intelligence of the birds according
                        to his ability to make friends with feathered creatures, to insinuate
                        himself into their home life and to learn their secrets for himself. People
                        who have not had much contact with them are the ones who insist that birds
                        act solely upon instinct and are very wild. I have been <pb id="VAA2374-067"

                        life of birds ever since I began to walk, and heretofore I have hesitated to
                        put into print many of the experiences I have had with them, simply because
                        the public is not yet educated to the point where it will credit my
                        statements.</p>
                    <p>If I were compelled to pass an examination as to the number of bones in the
                        bodies of my bird friends I should be in sad perplexity. I never have had
                        the slightest desire or necessity to know so I do not intend to learn. If it
                        became necessary for me to shoot one hundred and fifty rose-breasted
                        grosbeaks in order to determine the number of potato bugs or of some certain
                        &quot;very tough worm,&quot; in their &quot;little
                        insides&quot; then I should remain in ignorance as to the exact number
                        they consume. On any point pertaining to the life, habits, and
                        characteristics of the birds I can stand securely beside the doctors of
                        ornithology, for few of them have had the incalculable advantage of
                        beginning life with a gift of the birds, where birds homed in flocks.</p>

                        work with every kind of camera on the market suitable for my purposes. In
                        all this time the birds have been the main object of my search, but it would
                        be impossible for any nature lover to spend this length of time afield, a
                        large part of it being consumed in watching set cameras from some vantage
                        point for hiding, without having accumulated a large fund of other
                        experience. Upon many occasions I have had such rare and beautiful natural
                        history subjects of other kinds literally thrust upon me that I have
                        neglected the birds for their closest rivals, the moths and butterflies,
                        while rare and exquisite flowers are always of intense interest to any field
                        worker.</p>
                    <p>Aside from work I have done among the birds, I have photographed or painted
                        in water colours every rare moth native to the Limberlost, as well as the
                        common ones, and many of the most exquisite butterflies. The moth studies
                        made the foundation for my book entitled &quot;Moths of the
                        Limberlost,&quot; while stray pictures of other insects, <pb
                            id="VAA2374-071" n="58"/> such as locusts, Katy-dids, dragon flies,
                        crickets, and the like, combined with beautiful flower and landscape
                        pictures, were the origin of another nature book, &quot;Music of the
                        Wild.&quot; I can truthfully say that with the exception of the months
                        of May and June of one season, when I gave all of my time to moths, the real
                        object of all field work I ever have done has been to bring from the deep
                        forest, the woods pastures, the open fields, the swamps, meadows, orchards,
                        and gardens, characteristic natural history reproductions of living birds. I
                        have always reproduced each nest in its own environment exactly as the birds
                        placed it, keeping the surroundings natural with the possible exception of
                        tying back a branch here and there to allow sufficient light for pictures of
                        action, such branches being released and restored to their former positions
                        the moment the exposures were made. In securing thousands of negatives
                        afield, I have resorted to every device my ingenuity could conjure up
                        without the slightest regard to the amount of time, expense, or physical
                        exertion that was required on my part. The one thing I never have done is to
                        cut down a nest or in any way interfere with the home life of the birds, but
                        gradually and with the greatest caution I have insinuated myself and my
                        cameras into the birds&apos; immediate surroundings.</p>
                    <p>One of the most interesting oriole pictures I ever made was taken by lashing
                        two long, painter&apos;s <pb id="VAA2374-072" n="59"/> ladders to one of
                        the high telegraph poles of a city and fastening my camera on the opposite
                        side of the pole slightly above the highest ladder; then by having a small
                        boy climb the closest tree and tie back a branch, I could obtain a fine
                        focus on the oriole&apos;s nest. For each picture I made in a long
                        series I was compelled to climb those ladders to change the plates and reset
                        the shutter.</p>
                    <p>On another occasion two men erected a platform for me level with the nest of
                        a scarlet tanager, high among the branches of an extremely tall tree. The
                        structure was so frail that it waved with every breath of wind and bent
                        under my weight, but, as with the ladder, I was compelled to mount it in
                        order to change plates every time I made an exposure with a long hose and
                        bulb from a hidden location.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes I have worked in deep, dark woods where it was necessary to cut
                        down a number of trees and bushes in order to obtain sufficient light for
                        instantaneous exposure; again I have worked on embankments in the scorching
                        suns of June and July without a trace of shelter. I have waded in swamps and
                        braved the quicksands of lake shores, at times having mired until it was
                        utterly impossible for me to extricate myself. I vividly recall one day at a
                        lake near Silver Lake, in northern Indiana, when I entered the water shortly
                        before nine o&apos;clock in the morning and did not leave it until half
                        past four in the afternoon, with the exception <pb id="VAA2374-073" n="60"/>
                        of a few minutes when eating a lunch at noon.</p>
                    <p>I have worked under bridges, in the unspeakable odours of vulture locations,
                        near slaughter houses and crematories, in territory that was one shallow
                        lake covering miles of surface in a June freshet; and once I worked under
                        the rafters of an ice-house, where I had a fight to save my assistant from
                        suffocation. He slipped from the top of the packed ice, on which we were
                        setting up a camera, and fell eight feet below, between the side wall and
                        the ice, the sawdust so covering and strangling him that he was almost
                        helpless, while he could not gain a foothold either against the side of the
                        building or the wall of ice. I finally got him out, while he was still able
                        to help himself slightly, by taking a rail from a near-by fence, carrying it
                        up the ladder by which we had entered a high door in the ice-house, and
                        lowering it to him.</p>
                    <p>One of my very clear recollections of a choice day afield was in a swamp
                        location of southern Michigan where there were so many big swamp
                        rattlesnakes that my native guide, a temporary acquisition, refused to step
                        from the conveyance, which carried us to the edge of the swamp; so I was
                        forced to carry my tripods, ladder, and cameras and perform the
                        day&apos;s work alone, or give up the pictures I had come to secure.</p>
                    <p>In all of these years of field work I have met with every peril that can be
                        found afield in nature, to <pb id="VAA2374-074" n="61"/> which there must be
                        added tramps, vicious domestic animals, and cross dogs. I have braved the
                        heat of the sun until my helper refused longer to work with me, and I have
                        experienced the torture of chills, fever, and delirium from incipient
                        sunstroke.</p>
                    <p>There is no way of gauging the hardships of a field worker. One of the most
                        vivid recollections I have is of a day spent in securing two chapter
                        tailpiece decorations for &quot;The Song of the Cardinal.&quot; In
                        the morning of a day of intense heat after a night of rain in late June, I
                        almost suffocated in a steaming valley beside the Wabash River, where I was
                        making pictures of a bed of wild morning glories; a few hours later, while
                        wading the river to secure pictures of a bed of rose mallows, I contracted a
                        chill which ended in congestion that gave me a ten day fight for my life.</p>
                    <p>There are hundreds of negatives in my closet, and if they could speak more
                        than half of them could relate a thrilling tale of the hardship and dangers
                        endured to secure them; but with it all I came through fifteen years without
                        any broken bones and with no permanent damage done to my health except that
                        after the near sunstroke I never again have been able to endure the same
                        amount of intense heat for the same length of time as before. During the
                        past five years, I have not been so fortunate.</p>

                        birds to such an extent it is marvellous that they survive. In handling the
                        young of a shrike family, the history of which is given in a bird book of
                        mine entitled &quot;Friends in Feathers,&quot; I covered myself with
                        these tormenting pests. Another day a friend who was helping me and I had
                        the same experience with young quail from a nest near the Wabash; and later,
                        on our farm, I had perhaps the choicest experience in this line. I was
                        working on a nest of swallows under the floor of the upstairs of the barn,
                        and in order to get the instantaneous exposure required to show the old
                        birds feeding the young, I removed a large mirror from one of the dressing
                        tables in the Cabin and set it up in the barnyard on a line with a window,
                        so that it threw direct sunlight upon the nest for the greater part of an
                        hour each forenoon. With the help of a ladder, I set up and focused my
                        camera on the nest, waiting in a stall below for the appearance of the
                        birds, climbing the ladder and changing the plates at each exposure. These
                        birds were infested with red lice that dropped from the nest and fell from
                        the old ones as they flew. Before I finished this series I made a practise
                        of binding a napkin dipped in alcohol tightly over my hair, and at the
                        finish of each hour&apos;s work I made a mad race for home, where I
                        could secure a hot bath and a complete change of clothing. It is to me one
                        of the marvels of nature that the tender young birds of a nest survive the
                        myriads of red <pb id="VAA2374-077" n="64"/> or grey or both kinds of bird
                        lice which infest them. Sometimes they are killed by the large grey lice on
                        the chicken feathers carried into nests for lining by the old birds.</p>
                    <p>I have gained a vast fund of experience in winning the confidence of birds
                        and in reproducing their most intimate habits and characteristics during
                        these twenty short years of field work with a camera. My negative closet now
                        contains series after series made of the home life of birds, each nest
                        reproduced where the birds located it, exactly as they built it, the birds
                        being free wild creatures of the outdoors. Among the plates, now numbering
                        thousands, I have a three months&apos; series of the home life of a pair
                        of black vultures, two months with a pair of kingfishers, and a complete
                        pictorial history of the cardinal grosbeak. This last series includes a
                        number of different birds, the collection extending over three or four years
                        and comprising such exquisite and intimate pictures as a male bird in full
                        tide of song, taking a bath in the rain, taking a sun bath, courting his
                        mate, standing guard on the edge of his nest beside the brooding hen, and
                        helping to feed the young, as well as the only picture I ever had the good
                        fortune to secure of a hen bird working at the construction of her
                        half-built nest.</p>
                    <p>For obvious reasons it is practically impossible to secure such a picture. To
                        those who do not understand what I mean by this I offer the following <pb
                            id="VAA2374-078" n="65"/> explanation: all birds build their nests in
                        what they suppose to be secure, sheltered locations. Very frequently they
                        make mistakes, but with the shy, wild birds which I have pictured for the
                        greater part, every nest location is chosen in the parting twigs, the crotch
                        of a branch, or some place secluded and sheltered by leaves, roofs, rails,
                        bridges, or embankments. The instant any mother bird at work on a nest feels
                        that her location has been discovered she deserts that spot and begins a new
                        one somewhere else. Always, in the work of nest building, she is in motion,
                        either carrying material or weaving it into a cup, patterned around her
                        breast, so that no picture of her is possible except through instantaneous
                        exposure. To change the surroundings of a building female by the bending
                        back of branches to let in sufficient light for instantaneous work would
                        simply mean to drive the bird to the selection of a new location. She would
                        not return to her first spot when a camera, however skilfully concealed, had
                        been intruded, and brilliant sunlight was shining on the structure she had
                        begun in deep shade.</p>
                    <p>I have made more or less complete series of the home life of the larger
                        number of our shyest, wildest song birds of the interior. It is a far
                        greater feat to secure a characteristic likeness of one of the song birds of
                        deep wood or field than to point a camera at a flock of ocean or gulf birds
                        and secure a thousand on a plate.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-079" n="66"/>
                    <p>I have spent practically every summer of my life afield, more than twenty
                        years of the time with cameras and other paraphernalia in active field work
                        among the birds, work that required living from March to November in close,
                        personal intimacy with them, and included the remainder of the year among
                        the winter residents. Five years ago, through the work of farmers and
                        lumbermen, my immediate territory had been cleared, drained, and put under
                        cultivation, until the birds had flown, the flowers and moths were
                        exterminated, there was not an interesting landscape left to reproduce.
                        Then, in desperation, I haunted the state over, finally selecting another
                        piece of true Limberlost country at the head of the same swamp region, where
                        there are lakes by the score and miles upon miles of luxuriant swamp growth
                        to attract the birds and perpetuate the flowers. Here, with the earnings
                        from my work, I bought one hundred and twenty acres of rolling land, sloping
                        abruptly to a small lovely lake, a mile of the winding shore line of which
                        is included in my purchase. Also there are two fair-sized pieces of original
                        timber, truly remarkable for the tall straightness of the trees and the wide
                        range in variety; for I have chestnut oaks, blue ash, and coffee trees, as
                        well as splendid red and white oaks, and grand grey old beeches, elms,
                        lindens, and hackberries. Here, I practically reproduced the first Cabin,
                        greatly enlarging it and adding a corner especially designed <pb
                            id="VAA2374-080" n="67"/> to facilitate my work; so I now have a
                        library, dark-room, and a printing room, shut from the remainder of the
                        Cabin, where I may work in seclusion. This I call Limberlost Cabin, north;
                        the other, south.</p>
                    <p>I have had many unusual and inexplainable experiences afield. I have come to
                        know the birds more intimately and to understand their ways better than
                        those of my fellow men, with whom I have had no such contact. So if some of
                        the happenings I record are not within the knowledge and experience of my
                        readers I ask that before my veracity is questioned or an attempt is made to
                        controvert the conclusions I draw, my lifetime of personal experience with
                        the birds be taken into consideration, and that if I am to be questioned,
                        the questioning be done by those who have had a like amount of similar
                        experience. Naturally, I feel that having lived with and among the birds in
                        such intimacy as to secure really characteristic pictures which exhibit the
                        very human attributes of joy, grief, pain, fear, greed, suspicion, and the
                        like, I should not be questioned except by those sufficiently intimate with
                        the birds to have secured similar reproductions of them. I make no apology
                        for any incident I introduce. In some cases I can offer incontrovertible
                        proof by reliable witnesses, but very frequently my unsupported word must
                        suffice, as of necessity in the more intimate and characteristic of these
                        studies I have <pb id="VAA2374-081" n="68"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2374-17">

                        <pb id="VAA2374-082" n="69"/> been obliged to go to the woods alone and to
                        work with no disturbance whatever to the birds beyond my presence, which
                        through days of intimacy they had been taught to ignore. Wherever it has
                        been possible I have made photographic records to sustain my statements, but
                        very frequently this was manifestly impossible because the subject was in
                        motion in a place too dark or secluded for a snapshot, and some of the most
                        wonderful things I record I have seen when passing through a wood alone,
                        having no camera with me. Some of these happenings I have been able to
                        verify by different birds of the same species, often enough that I have felt
                        they might be attributed to the species as a characteristic; but most of the
                        occurrences here described are isolated cases having been met with only once
                        in my experience afield, so that nothing habitual or characteristic of an
                        entire species could be adduced from such records; they are merely straws
                        showing which way the wind blows.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">O</hi>NE day in searching along a wooded slope of the Wabash
                        for birds&apos; nests I noticed a small greyish brown bird fluttering
                        among the leaves a few yards from me. I thought at first that she was
                        practising the subterfuge of the plover family and some of the other small
                        game birds by pretending that she had a broken wing, in order to toll me
                        from a nest location on the ground; but closer inspection disclosed that she
                        was a female indigo finch in great distress. From her wide-spread wings and
                        the manner in which she was gasping for breath, I imagined that her spine
                        had been injured by a sling-shot or by something having fallen on her back.</p>
                    <p>On my going nearer she proved to be so nearly dead that she was unable to
                        fly; so I picked her up to see if her trouble was apparent, and if there was
                        any first aid that I could offer to an injured bird. I first examined her
                        wings and found that they were not broken. Then I began blowing up the
                        feathers on her back to see if there was a wound of any kind, but there was
                        none. On reversing her to examine her breast and underparts, <pb
                            id="VAA2374-085" n="72"/> I was amazed to discover that her trouble was
                        an egg so large that she could not deposit it. Then I knew exactly what to
                        do because I once had a female canary in this same condition. I recalled
                        also that on two occasions I had seen my mother operate on a hen for the
                        same trouble. One end of the egg was exposed for perhaps one fourth of its
                        surface. I took the small oil can from my paraphernalia and dropped a drop
                        of oil on the exposed shell of the egg to soften the expanded parts as much
                        as possible. Then, holding the bird firmly, I pierced the shell of the egg
                        and broke it up with a hatpin so that it could be easily ejected. I then
                        carried the bird down to the river and gave her water. In a few minutes, she
                        was sufficiently recovered to perch on a small twig, and in less than five
                        minutes she felt so much better that she flew away. I have no doubt that the
                        next morning she began to deposit the remainder of her eggs in safety.</p>
                    <p>This is a thing that I have known to occur twice among birds and twice among
                        poultry. Very frequently an egg is so large for a young hen in her first
                        laying that it is deposited completely striped with her blood. Often, very
                        large hen eggs prove to be double yolked. A few times I have seen a
                        blood-stained egg in the nest of a bird, while almost without exception the
                        first egg placed in a nest is noticeably larger than the others, and the
                        last is smaller. I know, through years of experience, <pb id="VAA2374-086"
                            n="73"/> the nest of a young hen bird in the first building. A young hen
                        can be recognized by her trim freshness and the fact that her plumage has
                        not taken on the decided colour of her species that comes after three or
                        four moultings. Her location is not wisely chosen, her nest well shaped nor
                        so compactly built as the work of birds having had experience. Such a bird
                        having built such a nest, invariably produces a first egg very noticeably
                        larger than the others.</p>
                    <p>Two other finch experiences are distinct in my memory. While working in the
                        garden one May day, I noticed that somewhere nearby an indigo finch was in a
                        frenzy of the mating song, and presently discovered him on the windowsill of
                        the conservatory, hopping back and forth, his beak against the glass panes,
                        trying to get inside, undoubtedly attracted by the foliage of a lemon tree,
                        the flowers, and the song of his cousins in the canary house. This bird
                        spent the greater part of one afternoon on the sill, until I was strongly
                        tempted to open a ventilator and allow him to enter, but I could see nothing
                        to be gained thereby, as he would only become alarmed and beat himself
                        against the glass when he found he was confined in strange surroundings.</p>
                    <p>Late that evening a hen bird appeared, and the pair built a nest in a
                        honeysuckle directly opposite the conservatory and perhaps thirty feet due
                        west. There was an abundance of leaves and all sorts of <pb id="VAA2374-087"
                            n="74"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2374-19">
                            <p>Male indigo finch, having thorn-pierced eye, entering nest to
                            brood</p>
                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2374-088" n="75"/> nest material. I think that the female of this
                        pair was a young bird. In the plethora of material and the exuberance of her
                        first attempt, she built a nest twice the size of any of her kind I had
                        examined in roadside, meadow, or thicket bushes, using copiously the dry
                        last year&apos;s honeysuckle leaves, which she picked up on the ground
                        under the bush. The size and peculiarity of this nest was one thing I wish
                        to record. The other is the fact that the male appeared to be blind in one
                        eye. Every forenoon about nine o&apos;clock he entered the nest and
                        brooded for an hour or more while his mate went to find her breakfast,
                        bathe, and exercise. In setting up a camera before the nest in an attempt to
                        secure such a rare picture as that of a male bird brooding, I noticed that
                        he had flown against a thorn or some sharp projection, which had penetrated
                        the inner corner of his right eye so that the ball was somewhat discoloured
                        and partially flooded, while a small red growth had formed in each corner. I
                        thought that he was a bird several years of age, as his plumage was so fully
                        matured through a number of moultings that when he brooded with the morning
                        sun falling directly upon him, the top of his head and the feathers on the
                        back of his neck were perfectly exquisite pale, greenish blue, shining like
                        a highly polished gem of turquoise. I worked with this bird early in my
                        outdoor experience, trying repeatedly to make him enter the nest and brood
                        with <pb id="VAA2374-089" n="76"/> his perfect eye toward the lens. For a
                        number of mornings I tried to induce him to give me a study showing him in
                        perfect condition, without at that time giving a thought to the fact that it
                        might be extremely interesting to prove that the birds have accidents and
                        sickness the same as human beings.</p>
                    <p>I always had noticed afield that after the construction of the nest had
                        advanced for a day or two, each bird chose a separate route, by which to
                        approach their location, and strictly adhered to that route in coming to the
                        nest, leaving it by another and on the wing, wherever possible. This indigo
                        bird had formed the habit of approaching his nest by flying to a certain
                        twig of a bellflower apple tree near by, then to the pointed top of a board
                        of the high alley fence, against which the honeysuckle climbed. From there,
                        he would drop to the nest, every time bringing his bad eye on the side
                        toward the lens. One morning I started to focus the camera on his location
                        with my mind fully made up to saw the limb from the bellflower tree in an
                        effort to make him seek a new route and approach from the other side; but
                        when I reached the honeysuckle I found that the neighbour&apos;s cat had
                        attacked the nest in the night, probably killing the mother birdcertainly
                        tearing down the nest and eating the eggs.</p>
                    <p>The final intimate experience with an indigo bird came when driving from our
                        farm one evening. I saw an abject spectacle in the shape of a bird <pb
                            id="VAA2374-090" n="77"/> hopping beside the road and climbed from the
                        carriage to investigate. I knew by the bird&apos;s bill that it was a
                        finch, but further than that I could not go in its identification as it had
                        been completely immersed in crude oil, surrounding a well inside the fence.
                        I took the miserable creature home, prepared a bath of Gold Dust in as hot
                        water as the bird could bear, and with extreme care about the head and eyes,
                        I tried to remove the oil. Only those who have had personal contact with
                        crude oil can imagine what it meant to have the feathers of a bird soaked in
                        it, then liberally sprinkled with the dust of the summer highway. I worked
                        with all patience for the greater part of an hour, and nearly as long in
                        cleansing the wash bowl afterward. I gave my bird a drink, some food, rolled
                        him in a flannel cloth, and tucked him away for the night. His struggle in
                        the oil had been too severe, too long endured, the bath too strenuous. In
                        the morning I found that I had been working with an indigo finch, which was
                        now extremely clean, also extremely dead.</p>
                    <p>For fifteen years all of my work was in oil country, which gave me the
                        invaluable assistance of many oilmen in locating nests and working around
                        them. I was at the same time in constant contact with crude oil, which is
                        perhaps one of the nastiest things on earth upon footwear, clothing, and a
                        working outfit, while in combination with a living bird I know of nothing
                        worse. Ordinary soap <pb id="VAA2374-091" n="78"/> will not faze it. In
                        order to cut it, some especially strong compound like Dutch Cleanser, Snow
                        Boy, or Gold Dust must be used with extremely hot water. The loss of the
                        finch did not deter me from trying to save all of the birds I found in field
                        work suffering from having fallen into oil or through having mistaken its
                        glassy surface in some lights for water. The finch was the only oil-coated
                        bird that died.</p>
                    <p>About the same time I had this experience, one of my friends among the oilmen
                        brought me a much larger bird so plastered with dust and grease that I had
                        no idea what it might be. The same methods I used on the finch brought this
                        bird out the next morning, a lark fully grown, perfectly clean, but so
                        utterly broken in spirit by his contact with the oil and his handling
                        previous to and in the course of his cleansing that when I raised the
                        flannel covering him, he crouched in the box like a young bird in a nest,
                        opened his beak, and begged for food. I fed him the customary preparation of
                        the yolk of egg made into a paste with equal parts of boiled potato and
                        rolled hemp seed, freed as much as possible from the husk of the grain, and
                        gave him water. After feeding him I lifted him to the edge of the box but he
                        made not the slightest attempt to fly no matter how near any of us
                        approached him. We even stroked his wings. I decided to try a daring
                        experiment with him. I set up a camera, focused it upon an appropriate <pb
                            id="VAA2374-092" n="79"/> spot outdoors, carried him out as he perched
                        on one of my fingers, cupping the other hand over him, and setting him on
                        the spot, made almost a life-sized portrait of him. As he evinced no
                        inclination to fly, I turned him in several positions; and finally, when I
                        was ready to release him, he still showed not the slightest inclination to
                        go.</p>
                    <p>At this time my daughter was closely associated with me in field work and it
                        always had been her privilege to return to freedom all of the sick and the
                        wounded that we had found or that had been brought to us for treatment; so
                        when I finished every picture I could think of to make with the lark, I put
                        him into Molly Cotton&apos;s hands that she might start him on his way
                        to freedom. He sat there in perfect contentment until, at my suggestion, she
                        shook him up a bit. Then he stood on his feet, but failed to fly. The Cabin,
                        south, was located in a small village, immediately surrounded by fields,
                        over which larks were constantly flying. Just at that point, one of his kind
                        passed over our heads at no great height, singing the &quot;Spring
                        o&apos; year&quot; song of the lark. Instantly our bird found his
                        voice, his wings, and his wild spirit. He uttered a sharp cry and flew at
                        such speed that his going was merely an indistinct flash.</p>
                    <p>My worst experience with an oil-coated bird was that with a shitepoke,
                        brought me by some boys who had found him while playing. I can not imagine
                        what occurred to a bird with his length of <pb id="VAA2374-093" n="80"/> leg
                        and strength of wing to immerse him so completely in crude oil, unless from
                        some high perch he saw an unfortunate small frog leap into a pool of oil,
                        and like the frog mistaking it for water, he plunged also. Never before nor
                        since have I seen a feathered creature make such an abject spectacle as did
                        this oil-and-dirt-covered shitepoke, but my sympathies were so entirely with
                        the bird that it never occurred to me to take his picture before giving him
                        a bath. As was the case with the lark, he was so miserable and so cowed in
                        his misery that he stood in the washbowl of my bathroom and allowed me to
                        begin at his beak with a toothbrush and gradually move onward, cleaning
                        every feather on him, and the skin as well, without making the least effort
                        to get away; but when he was finished, thoroughly dry, and had rested over
                        night, his broken spirit disappeared. He was ready to fly, also to fight for
                        his freedom the instant he was uncovered in the morning.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing in an experience I once had with a pipit lark, except proof
                        that birds are as subject to accident and injury as human beings. While I
                        was driving one evening about six o&apos;clock, a pipit lark on wing
                        arose above a snake fence on one side of the highway, and crossed the road a
                        few rods ahead of my carriage, dropping low as he flew. I thought he
                        intended to pass between the rails of the fence he was headed toward and
                        alight in a clover field. Whatever might have been his <pb id="VAA2374-094"
                            n="81"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2374-20">
                            <p>A nestling cardinal grosbeak that would have fallen to its death, had
                                it not been helped to safety</p>
                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2374-095" n="82"/> purpose, his estimate of space was wrong.
                        Instead of passing between the rails, as birds do constantly in flight, he
                        struck with full force, and fell on the grass of the wayside, lying
                        motionless. I hurried to him, picked him up, and examined his beak to see
                        that he had not broken it nor his neck. While I was handling him he began to
                        revive and in a few minutes he was able to sit up, so I placed him on the
                        top rail from which he very shortly flew to the clover field.</p>
                    <p>In writing of examining this bird&apos;s beak to see if it was broken,
                        there comes to my mind the remembrance of a robin I once noticed in the
                        dooryard in extreme distress. I was unable to capture this bird, but I could
                        distinctly see that he had flown against something, squarely breaking off
                        three fourths of the upper mandible, exposing his tongue, and incapacitating
                        him either for pulling up angleworms, eating fruit, or taking a drink. He
                        was crying pathetically. There is no question but he must have died very
                        soon in much suffering.</p>
                    <p>While on the subject of robins, I might record my most unusual experience
                        with these birds in having seen a white one in a flock, when they were
                        massing for fall migration, congregating over some wild grapes on a country
                        fence. This bird was robin in form, uttered robin notes, and was in robin
                        country and company but had every feather on him of a soft dusty tan colour,
                        much like my canaries.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-096" n="83"/>
                    <p>Among albino birds, in addition to the white robin, I once saw a robin with a
                        large white spot on his shoulder, extending down one wing. The rest of his
                        plumage was natural, so I figured that possibly this peculiar feathering
                        might have resulted from a bruise, as I always have noticed that bruising or
                        rubbing the hair from the skin of a domestic animal is very apt to result in
                        the injured spot becoming covered by white hair.</p>
                    <p>I also have seen a large flock of English sparrows, of which two were a solid
                        dusty cream colour, and up to 1919 I have seen two white blackbirds.</p>
                    <p>I once worked with a pair of robins, one of whose young kept its head
                        extended above the top of the nest, waving it and crying unceasingly, even
                        immediately after the old bird had been to the nest with food. In the
                        absence of the parents I climbed to the nest and discovered that the young
                        one had been fed something of a poisonous nature, which had irritated its
                        throat. A big water blister closed the entire food canal, while, the wind
                        pipe was badly crowded from the swelling in the neck. The bird could not
                        shut its mouth, and could not swallow. I pricked the blisters, letting out
                        the water, and tried the soothing influence of oil in the throat, but the
                        bird died a few hours later in much distress. I wish now that I had taken
                        the pains to see what its crop and gizzard contained. Undoubtedly its
                        trouble arose from something it had been fed, as its entire body was full of
                        inflammation, <pb id="VAA2374-097" n="84"/> while at the same time it had
                        slowly starved to death.</p>
                    <p>Another instance of extreme suffering was on the part of a robin I found in
                        the orchard of our farm. Driving down the lane to the highway one evening at
                        dusk, I noticed something unusual dangling from the branch of an apple tree,
                        and heard pitiful robin calls of distress. I responded immediately and found
                        a young bird so fully feathered that its condition seemed to indicate that
                        it should have been several days from the nest, which gave no signs of
                        having been occupied more recently. Being unable to reach the nest by means
                        of the branch, which was too light to bear my weight, I went to the house to
                        bring a ladder. As I approached the tree on my return, I found an old robin
                        clinging to the side of the nest putting food into the mouth of the young
                        one. When I reached the nest I discovered that this bird had a long, stout
                        horsehair tightly looped around one of its legs just above the knee joint,
                        both ends being firmly plastered in the mud of the nest foundation. It had
                        hung by this hair for so long that the skin was cut to the muscle. The wound
                        was so old that it had ceased to bleed, while the flesh had drawn back and
                        was partially healed all around the cut, exposing the muscle, which was
                        slowly being cut through by the struggles of the bird. I could draw no other
                        conclusion than that this robin had hung there since it was <pb
                            id="VAA2374-098" n="85"/> old enough to leave the nest. During all this
                        time the old ones must have fed it, as it was in fairly good flesh and its
                        crop was well distended with food at the time I found it. All that was
                        necessary in that instance was to break the hair and release the bird. I put
                        it back in the nest, where it remained, as it seemed unable to stand on its
                        hurt foot; but I hoped that after having been in an upright position for a
                        time, it would regain its equilibrium and establish enough circulation to
                        enable it again to use its foot.</p>
                    <p>At another time I saw a robin in our dooryard that had so nearly been the
                        prey of a cat, red squirrel, or an owl that he had been forced to exercise a
                        bird&apos;s prerogative and let his tail go to save his body. Farmers
                        and people experienced in handling poultry know that a rooster or turkey, if
                        grasped by the tail when pursued, can release the tail feathers to escape. I
                        have noticed several instances and had my attention called to additional
                        cases proving wild birds have the same power. This robin was full-grown, a
                        bird of several seasons. I knew this by the ruddy colour of his breast and
                        the dark feathering of his back; but his tail, which was growing out again,
                        was not more than three fourths of an inch in length and it could be seen
                        that he missed it, for he attempted only short flights in which he seemed to
                        experience constant difficulty, plunging forward, head down.</p>
                    <p>A very peculiar thing, which I have seen but <pb id="VAA2374-099" n="86"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2374-21">
                            <p>When farmers shot the old birds Molly Cotton often adopted and raised
                                the young.</p>
                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2374-100" n="87"/> once afield, occurred in a piece of swampy,
                        low ground, filled with sturdy scrub oak, button bush, and low shrubs, where
                        the presence of many birds proved it especially good nesting territory. Here
                        one morning, on a dead limb in plain sight so that I could not possibly
                        mistake my identification, sat a young blackbird squalling lustily for food.
                        There were many blackbirds flying over him and feeding young of their kind
                        in the bushes all around him, but not one of them gave this half-famished
                        youngster a morsel. He evidently had left the nest only that morning, and I
                        thought prematurely at that, for he had much difficulty in maintaining his
                        balance on the limb. This may have been caused by his reaching toward every
                        blackbird that passed him a widely yawning mouth, while he flopped his wings
                        to attract their attention. This went on for so long that I decided his
                        mother must have met her fate at the hands of a farmer, the crack of whose
                        gun could be heard occasionally while he was planting corn in an adjoining
                        field. Finally the young blackbird held his position with difficulty and
                        seemed to be completely discouraged. A hen robin that had been carrying food
                        to her young in a cottonwood in a line of flight directly over the blackbird
                        evidently became as much exercised about the plight of the youngster as I
                        was, for the next time she came with food she flew to the limb beside the
                        blackbird and gave him a very generous feeding, which he seemed greatly <pb
                            id="VAA2374-101" n="88"/> pleased to take. This is the only incident of
                        my life in which I have seen a bird of one species feed the young of another
                        with the exception of small birds feeding cowbirds they had hatched in their
                        own nests. The robin knew that all of her brood were intact in their nest in
                        the cottonwood; she could only have deviated from her course and fed the
                        young blackbird because he was a hungry youngster vociferously begging for
                        food.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of wild cherry trees located very near Limberlost Cabin,
                        north. When the fruit attains a juicy degree of ripeness and there has been
                        a high wind during the night there are more cherries on the ground and these
                        are more easily obtained for bird food than the fruit on the trees. Such a
                        condition existed one morning in summer, as I was on my way downstairs to
                        breakfast. I paused at a window at a turn in the stairs and looked into the
                        west woods attracted by sounds of warfare among the birds. I was amazed to
                        count seven pileated woodpeckers, four old and three young not long from the
                        nest four red-headed woodpeckers, and four robins on the ground engaging in
                        a battle royal over the cherries. This was the first time I ever had seen
                        robins really fight with other birds. They seemed to be as pugnacious as the
                        red-heads, which are stronger than they, and they seemed fearless in
                        attacking the pileated woodpeckers, which are both larger and stronger. The
                        battle raged the <pb id="VAA2374-102" n="89"/> greater part of the day and
                        it ceased entirely only when the ground was fairly well cleared of the
                        fruit.</p>
                    <p>Probably from over two centuries of brooding near houses, robins have become
                        tamer and more trustful of humanity than any other bird. Possibly there
                        should be an exception in the case of the wren, but I am not sure; there are
                        always three pairs of robins to one of wrens with us. They build where the
                        logs cross at corners, under porch ceilings, and among the vines climbing on
                        the verandas. Last year a robin built her nest on a windowsill directly
                        against the sash of a summer residence belonging to my daughter. The nest
                        was in a corner, its mud foundations so plastered to the sash that it was
                        impossible to raise the window from the bottom until the young birds had
                        flown, so the ventilation of the room was managed by the upper sash for the
                        length of time the bird used the lower one, but as it was cool spring
                        weather this worked no hardship for any one.</p>
                    <p>One of the most peculiar nesting locations I have encountered afield was on
                        the running gear of a hay rake that had been left standing where the farmer
                        had finished using it. The only protection that had been afforded it from
                        the weather was the unscrewed seat turned upside down. On the crosspiece of
                        the frame the bird had located her nest, so centred under the shelter of the
                        overturned <pb id="VAA2374-103" n="90"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2374-22">

                        <pb id="VAA2374-104" n="91"/> seat that it was perfectly protected from sun
                        and rain.</p>
                    <p>A man in Richmond, Indiana, once sent me a photograph of a brooding robin. He
                        wrote that the bird had been carried into the Union Depot of that city on
                        the running gear of a freight car, having ridden on her nest, which the
                        train crew said had been built in freight yards in New York City. The bird
                        was the pet of the men about the yards, and much food from the dinner pails
                        of the workmen was left near the nest for her convenience. The picture was
                        certainly that of a live, brooding robin on the gear of a freight car, while
                        the story seemed to be supported by ample and reliable proof, although it
                        was in no way a personal experience of mine.</p>
                    <p>Heroic as the Richmond robin may have been, I have one robin experience which
                        proves the bird of even greater devotion to her nest and young than that
                        previously related. This robin arrived early and built in an apple tree
                        outside the music-room window of the Cabin, south. The tree had been
                        struggling with a bad case of scale for several years and had succumbed the
                        past winter. The bird built in all confidence nearly fifteen feet from the
                        ground at the branching of two large limbs, but not one leaf opened to
                        shelter her from alternate driving spring rains and hot sunshine, as she
                        surely expected. One day she baked in the sun; the following, she chilled
                            <pb id="VAA2374-105" n="92"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2374-23">

                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2374-106" n="93"/> in a flurry of snow. How she breasted one
                        flood rain always has been a marvel to me. The tree stood on sloping ground
                        outside a French window. Taking into account two feet of foundation and the
                        slope, the nest was almost level with the face of a person standing inside
                        the window. The rainfall began on Monday morning quite early. From that time
                        until ten o&apos;clock on Thursday there was not an hour of daylight
                        during which there was not rain heavy enough to keep the bird on her nest to
                        shelter it and her eggs. Much of the time there was a deluge that forced her
                        to stick her beak straight up and gasp for breath. During daylight some
                        member of the household was almost constantly on watch. Never once did the
                        bird leave her nest or the male bird bring her food or relieve her long
                        siege of brooding. It rained and it rained, until I thought that the mud
                        plastering of the nest foundations would dissolve so that it would wash away
                        from under her, but she had built an unusually large nest with much grass
                        and straw covering the outside of the body so that it endured. I thought
                        that she would become so wet that the water would run down her body through
                        her feathers and chill the eggs until they would be spoiled. In the heaviest
                        of the downpour I truly thought that the bird would drown on her nest or die
                        from hunger. We seriously discussed trying to wire an old umbrella over her
                        or fixing a box above the nest but any shelter we could <pb id="VAA2374-107"
                            n="94"/> arrange before her eggs quickened to bind her to them would
                        drive her from them so long that they would be chilled. So we watched,
                        marvelled, but did nothing. At ten o&apos;clock Thursday the rain
                        ceased, the clouds scattered, the sun shone. From the length of time the
                        robin had remained in the same position during all of those hours of cold
                        drenching and hunger, she staggered when she finally arose in her nest,
                        uttered the robin tribal call, and attempted flight. I was watching,
                            <unclear>s-</unclear> I saw her miss the branch of a near-by plum tree
                        and fall among the bushes below. There she gained a footing, rested awhile,
                        and then flew to the branch she had first started toward. After another rest
                        she wavered to earth and ate angleworms until my next fear for her was that
                        she would burst. While she was feeding her mate flew down to her and they
                        talked over the situation. I certainly should have been interested in
                        knowing exactly what she said to him. He flew to the edge of the nest and
                        carefully inspected it and the eggs, but even then he did not enter it to
                        brood awhile for her. The mother bird soon went back to her nest. She left
                        it more frequently than usual the remainder of that day, but the following
                        day she seemed to have recovered from her rough experience. Three eggs of
                        that nest hatched, so that only one bird was lost and I have no proof that
                        it failed to develop on account of the storm. That mother robin stands
                        monumental to me as <pb id="VAA2374-108" n="95"/> the most heroic of the
                        birds of my personal experience. I am convinced that she brooded under the
                        conditions described without having once left her nest from the time she
                        entered it for night, about four o&apos;clock Sunday afternoon, until
                        ten o&apos;clock Thursday morningninety hours. This experience clearly
                        proves that human mothers are not the only ones who make sacrifices for
                        their young.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">O</hi>NE spring morning, after the owls had raised pandemonium
                        in the night in the wild grape vines surrounding the spring at the Cabin,
                        north, when passing along the path leading to my east woods I found under a
                        small wild crab tree heavily loaded with bittersweet vines most of the tail
                        feathers of a cardinal grosbeak; and a few yards farther along, the
                        remainder. Later in the day, I saw the cardinal without a vestige of tail.
                        He was experiencing even greater difficulty in flight than had the tailless
                        robin. He could fly in stretches of a few yards, but he did not seem to be
                        able to keep his head up and guide his course in the usual manner.</p>
                    <p>A woman in the southern part of the state wrote a few years ago to tell me
                        that for the greater part of one winter a male cardinal roosted under the
                        eaves near a kitchen window on a vine climbing the side of her residence.
                        One night during the winter he had perched in such a manner that his tail
                        touched a water spout running horizontally from the eaves to a turn at the
                        corner of the house. During the forepart of the night water <pb
                            id="VAA2374-111" n="98"/> had dripped from the eaves, wetting his tail.
                        As the night advanced and grew colder, ice formed, freezing the tail to the
                        pipe. In the early morning when the woman looked to see if the bird was
                        there she saw only his tail fast to the pipe. She had taken a step-ladder
                        and secured the feathers. She wanted to know whether losing the tail would
                        kill the bird, and she also stated in her letter that he did not again
                        return to his former perching place.</p>
                    <p>I had another letter concerning a cardinal. This bird was reported to have
                        visited a certain western window every afternoon about four o&apos;clock
                        and in repeated instances fought with his own reflection on the glass for an
                        hour at a time. I had had this same experience in a limited degree. Three
                        different times in one afternoon a blackbird put his bill against the glass
                        of my bedroom window and tried repeatedly to walk through it, not seeming to
                        understand why he could not. My bird did not seem to be pugnacious, merely
                        inquisitive. The window was rather heavily covered with a wild rose bush,
                        and the glass had only that morning been highly polished during the course
                        of spring house-cleaning. At the third appearance of the bird I went outside
                        to see what his view would mean to me. The late sun in travelling around to
                        the west shone obliquely across the window, which faced due south, and what
                        I saw where the bird had been appeared to me <pb id="VAA2374-112" n="99"/>
                        exactly like a pool of water surrounded by wild rose leaves; so I have no
                        doubt that the bird from the same point got the same effect.</p>
                    <p>All one season a song sparrow having a broken wing lived in the honeysuckle
                        of the blue finch and among the rose bushes, blackberries, raspberries, and
                        wild roses of the west fence where it extended down to the garage beside the
                        garden, at the Cabin, south. He could hop from the ground to the branches of
                        the bushes and from there make his way higher even to the girder of the
                        fence, from which it was possible to reach two different apple trees. By
                        extending his sound wing and spreading his tail he could fly from the low
                        branches of the apple trees to the ground without seriously hurting himself.
                        I watched him with anxiety and always kept crumbs on the ground under the
                        honeysuckle and in a secluded place on the fence girder. He was there
                        throughout the summer and until very late in the fall, his chirp constantly
                        sounding, but his spirit had broken with his wing, for I never heard him
                        sing a note. When the leaves fell and he lost their shelter he was
                        peculiarly exposed. Early in November he disappeared. I think very likely he
                        was the victim of a prowling cat, as these birds or others exactly like them
                        from farther north were with us all winter.</p>
                    <p>One morning as I was walking through the woods of our farm after a night of
                        heavy rain my attention <pb id="VAA2374-113" n="100"/> was attracted by the
                        alarm cries of grosbeaks and scarlet tanagers, while from the ground I could
                        hear the feeble cries of young in distress. I was not prepared for field
                        work but I entered the swamp, balancing myself from hummock to hummock and
                        walking on old logs and fallen branches, where a short search revealed one
                        young grosbeak and one scarlet tanager. There remained traces of the
                        grosbeak nest in a thicket of wild grape vines but I could not find the
                        location of the tanager nest. The frail tree with the vines creeping over it
                        was too light to bear my weight. To leave the young birds meant for them to
                        flutter into the water or be trampled by cattle, which frequently made mad
                        rushes through the vines to rid themselves of the torment of flies settling
                        on their backs, so I carried the nestlings home in my hands.</p>
                    <p>That night I read in a work on ornithology that a young hawk taken from his
                        nest of large sticks and coarse rough material and put in a soft nest would
                        die miserably. The following morning I returned to the swamp with a ladder.
                        There had been some woodland tragedy other than the storm. The grosbeak nest
                        contained one baby, dead and badly abused, so I carefully cut away the
                        surrounding vines and brought the cradle home to my birds. Then for ten
                        days, in the midst of my busiest season afield, I stopped every fifteen
                        minutes to feed those two youngsters a mixture of equal <pb id="VAA2374-114"
                            n="101"/> parts of boiled potato and hard boiled egg, varied by the
                        addition of a little fruit, at times bread and milk or rolled hemp seed.
                        When I was compelled to go afield, for a week or ten days, their nest placed
                        in a small box and covered with a cloth was carried with me so that they
                        might be fed regularly. Sometimes their field feedings were farther apart
                        than those at home but at no time did they go longer than half an hour. They
                        grew finely. When they were large enough to fly well they had the freedom of
                        the conservatory. Then the door was left open and at last they were placed
                        in an apple tree near the back door with their food and water convenient. It
                        was not long until they could take care of themselves. For several weeks I
                        could see them and hear their voices as they flew through the orchard. Then
                        they wandered farther afield and finally deserted me altogether.</p>
                    <p>One of the greatest tragedies I have known of afield was revealed by the body
                        of a Baltimore oriole hanging from a loop of cotton cord in a cottonwood,
                        not far from a partially completed nest that evidently had been abandoned on
                        account of the accident. In carrying material one of the pair had dropped a
                        piece of cotton cord mixed with heavy sewing cotton. This had lodged on the
                        stiff point of a dead twig, then had been worked back by the wind until it
                        caught on a tiny projection of the twig made by a falling leaf. The male
                        oriole in working to free this material in order to <pb id="VAA2374-115"
                            n="102"/> use it as a lashing to fasten his nest had slipped his head
                        through a loop in the string, so fashioned that when he had pulled it to
                        slip it off the twig it became a veritable noose, which grew tighter with
                        his struggles until it had choked him to death.</p>
                    <p>As this oriole and the robin are the only examples I recall having seen of
                        birds trapped in nest material, when almost every nest visited has hair,
                        string, and plant fibre in which they easily could entangle their heads or
                        feet, I deem these isolated cases excellent proof that the birds are
                        extremely deft in the business of building; and it is one of the rarest
                        experiences of the woods to find a bird in difficulty through its
                        awkwardness in handling its building material.</p>
                    <p>The nest of a scarlet tanager is a beautifully built structure, placed, in
                        comparison with the average locations of other birds, at extreme heights. I
                        have not examined many of them, but all I ever have seen at close range or
                        observed through glasses were neat and clean, giving every evidence that the
                        old birds emptied the cloaca and carried away the excrement, as is almost
                        the universal rule. In climbing to the heights of a tanager nest one day to
                        make a record of the state of its progress, one of my field assistants
                        reported to me that one of the nestlings, perhaps four or five days from the
                        shell, was in serious trouble which he thought I might relieve; so I told
                        him to slip his fingers under the feet of the little bird so that it <pb
                            id="VAA2374-116" n="103"/> would not cling to and tear up the bottom of
                        the nest, put it in his pocket, and bring it down with him. When he placed
                        it in my hands I found that the top of its head, both of its eyes and its
                        nose were thickly plastered with a deep coat of excrement, to which the down
                        of the other nestlings and the fine feathering of the mother bird had
                        adhered until it was blinded. Having no conveniences with me with which to
                        operate on such a case I carried the young bird home, warmed some milk,
                        dipped a cloth into it, and bound it over the top of its head until I had
                        soaked loose all foreign substance. Its eyes and the entire region
                        surrounding them were the palest of coral pink. It seemed at first as if the
                        bird would be permanently blind. I put it in the dark, fed it for a day or
                        two, gradually introducing light, and by the end of the second day its eyes
                        had returned to almost normal colour, while a number of experiments
                        convinced me that it could see as well as any young bird. It was then
                        returned to the nest, from which the rest of its family had not yet taken
                        wing.</p>
                    <p>I have had trouble with a window on the front porch of each Cabin on which
                        the surrounding trees throw green reflections, while the glass takes on the
                        lights of water. Several times birds have been deceived by this and in
                        striking the glass in flight have either killed or severely injured
                        themselves. One of the first instances of this kind was <pb id="VAA2374-117"
                            n="104"/> that of a ruby-throated hummingbird that was knocked limp and
                        helpless, but soon after being picked up he revived sufficiently to fly.</p>
                    <p>Very late in the fall I once found on my front porch the dead body of a
                        ruby-crowned kinglet, a tiny pinch of bone, muscle, and delicately coloured
                        feathers, with a little dab of red on the crest. The bird was the first of
                        the kind I ever had had in my hands, as kinglets live farther north and come
                        to my locality only as winter migrants. Because he was so rare and so
                        beautiful I sent this bird to a firm of taxidermists, considered reliable;
                        but when I called for my bird no one knew anything about him. I took the
                        pains to trace the firm&apos;s signature for the receipt of the package
                        containing him, on the books of the express company, but still they insisted
                        that they had not seen him. Undoubtedly some collector paid them far more
                        for his mounted body than they would have dared ask me for doing the work,
                        since they would scarcely have signed for an express package and failed to
                        open it.</p>
                    <p>The largest bird that I ever found dead from striking the glass was a
                        woodcock. Between these extremes, perhaps half a dozen other birds have lost
                        their lives on these windows, while repeatedly there is evidence on the
                        glass that it has been struck by some bird in flight, injured so slightly
                        that it has soon flown away.</p>
                    <p>While about my work in the oil fields one morning <pb id="VAA2374-118"
                            n="105"/> I was told by one of the oilmen that a neighbouring farmer had
                        just shot a hawk for carrying away young chickens. The oilman knew the
                        location of the nest and thought the bird killed was the female. We went to
                        the spot. He climbed the tree and found one egg in the nest, which he
                        carefully brought to the ground. We put it in the nest of a hen that was
                        brooding in a tool-house. I considered it a scurvy trick to ask a patient,
                        law-abiding hen to brood on the egg of her worst enemy, but the egg had
                        become so chilled during the length of time it had been uncovered that it
                        never hatched.</p>
                    <p>I have had two very intimate experiences with hummingbirds. On the streets of
                        our village one morning a man who always made an effort to help me about my
                        work held his hands cupped together before me, saying after the manner of
                        the old game: &quot;Hold fast all I give you.&quot; What he gave me
                        was the body of a ruby throat. I thought at first that it was dead, that he
                        had brought it so that I might make a minute examination of its plumage and
                        anatomy or have its body mounted. Before I reached the Cabin it showed signs
                        of life, so I put a drop of brandy into a few drops of water, added a few
                        grains of sugar and gave it a drink. The time was late fall and there had
                        been a heavy frost the previous night. For some reason this bird had been
                        slow about migrating so it was almost frozen to death. When I saw that it
                        was reviving I carried it back of the Cabin, where I <pb id="VAA2374-119"
                            n="106"/> had covered a la France rose bush the night before in order to
                        save the buds as long as possible. I set the bird on the rose bush and took
                        its picture. Then I gave it another drink. It sat straighter and seemed to
                        feel much better so I tried another pose. Then I administered another drink
                        and put a fresh plate in the camera. By this time the bird had fluffed its
                        feathers and settled its plumage, which had been somewhat ruffled through
                        handling. As I reached for the bulb to make a third exposure the familiar
                        hum of wings above my head told me that my subject had taken leave of me. As
                        far as I could see the little creature, it headed its flight due south. I
                        doubt that it made a prolonged stop until it reached Florida or Central
                        America.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps my most puzzling experience with a hummingbird occurred when Molly
                        Cotton gave her ice cream money to a boy as the purchase price of a
                        hummingbird he had accidentally hit with a stone from his sling-shot. She
                        brought the bird to me, demanding in all confidence that I doctor it. From
                        the position in which it lay in her extended hand I thought its back was
                        seriously injured if not broken. I had not the faintest idea how to render
                        first aid to an injured hummingbird, nor could I fail the expectant eyes or
                        disappoint the tone of conviction in my girl&apos;s voice when she so
                        confidently demanded that I &quot;do something.&quot; More in order
                        to convince her that I was doing something than because I felt I could do
                        anything <pb id="VAA2374-120" n="107"/> effective I put the hummingbird into
                        an empty nest in the conservatory, giving the little creature a drink of
                        sweetened water. It drank as if it were famished, running its long,
                        threadlike tongue over the bowl of the spoon, searching for particles of
                        sugar. We then surrounded it with the bloom of honeysuckle and trumpet
                        creeper. When the flowers were held within its reach it fed on the pollen
                        and never refused the water.</p>
                    <p>I confidently expected that it would be dead the following morning, but
                        instead it had folded its wings, which drooped the day before, and was
                        clinging to one of the coarser twigs of the nest with its feet. At these
                        signs of improvement I began to work in earnest. I removed the nest to a
                        cool, shady place, and added to the bird&apos;s diet hard boiled egg,
                        thinned almost to liquid and sweetened. By the third morning it could move
                        its body and use its feet, for it had climbed to the edge of the nest. Both
                        of us rejoiced, seeing that our bird was going to recover. I blame myself
                        for the accident which followed. From the fact that the bird was strong
                        enough to climb to the edge of the nest, I should have been warned that it
                        would attempt to fly and placed it in a lower position. Shortly afterward,
                        it tried to take wing, falling from the shelf four or five feet to the
                        cement floor of the conservatory, so aggravating its original injury that it
                        soon died.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps my most unique experience with a bird <pb id="VAA2374-121" n="108"/>
                        occurred rather late one fall. On the way to the river one morning I noticed
                        a bird acting peculiarly on a fine specimen of pokeberry. There had been a
                        frost the night before. A hot autumn sun was shining on the frozen fruit. On
                        going closer to see what was happening I found a cedar waxwing, a bird
                        native to my location but for all that extremely rare, one seen less
                        frequently than almost any other bird of my acquaintance. The waxwing was
                        feasting continuously on the frozen berries, and almost as continuously
                        raining them down in the form of scarcely digested excrement. He was in such
                        a state of intoxication that he did not always secure the berry at which he
                        aimed and the plumage of his face and throat was badly stained with the
                        juice. He was so unsteady on his feet that he frequently lost his balance
                        and plunging headfirst he fell to the underside of the little branches to
                        which he clung with his feet; but hanging head down, and even while he was
                        struggling to gain an upright position, he still continued eating every
                        berry he could reach. Approaching as close as I thought I dared I exposed
                        two or three plates, while my assistant hurried back to my base of supplies
                        for more plates. I first began so far away that the picture included the
                        whole bush, which was shaped like a small tree, having two or three trunks,
                        then advanced gradually until my last plate was gone. When no longer able to
                        take pictures I tried the <pb id="VAA2374-122" n="109"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2374-25">

                        <pb id="VAA2374-123" n="110"/> experiment of seeing how close I could
                        approach and found to my surprise that the bird was unable to fly. I could
                        pick him up in my hands. He did not exhibit the least sign of fear, so I put
                        him back on the bush and left him in what could be considered nothing less
                        than a state of intoxication, which I could have reproduced even more
                        intimately than in the pictures I had secured if I had known that he was
                        past flight before using my last plate.</p>
                    <p>Previously, I had one experience with wild creatures becoming intoxicated,
                        when, in order to get more light on my subject, Mr. Black trimmed the lower
                        branches of a young crab tree while the sap was still running. The liquid
                        quickly fermented in the hot spring sunshine. Soon the trunk was covered
                        with butterflies, moths, bees, ants, and flies, all of them becoming rapidly
                        intoxicated. This occurrence happened early in my field work with a camera
                        and was both pictured and described in my first nature story. I have
                        frequently been told that our robins and other Northern birds become
                        intoxicated on fermenting fruit and berries during their stay in the South,
                        getting themselves into such a soiled and repulsive condition that people
                        have small compunction about shooting them to reduce their numbers.</p>
                    <p>During my experiences afield I have met with several instances of isolated
                        birds not supposed to belong to my territory. Early in my work <pb

                        and confined to the same stretch of territory for two seasons, I heard the
                        notes and frequently saw the high-flying form of a lark, which could have
                        been nothing but an English skylark. I called upon my undefended head the
                        harsh criticism of a number of writers on ornithological subjects by
                        describing the high flight of this bird and his exquisite song among the
                        clouds, when he seemed literally to soar to the gates of Heaven. As I
                        recall, I described him as flying higher than any other bird which sang on
                        wing, and this is exactly what he did. I never succeeded in getting
                        sufficiently close to him to differentiate his markings and feathering from
                        our meadow larks which were constantly singing from rod lines, high fence
                        posts, and other points of vantage about as high as the average tree, or
                        singing on wing, but in flight not so high as the goldfinch or oriole. Just
                        at the time when I was most severely criticized for describing this lark of
                        high flight and exquisite song, the facts were made public in the newspapers
                        of the East that several men had some British skylarks captured, brought to
                        this country and released in an effort to add them to our ornithology. I am
                        sorry that I lost this clipping and can no longer give its origin, for
                        undoubtedly it was a skylark from these importations, which for two seasons
                        sang above the Limberlost. The reference to bird importations in the West
                        met a better fate and can be <pb id="VAA2374-126" n="113"/> quoted in its
                        entirely. Mr. C. F. Pfluger, Secretary of the Association for the
                        Importation of Songbirds into Oregon, makes the following report: <q
                            rend="block" direct="unspecified">
                            <p>In the month of May, 1889, the society imported from Clausthal, in
                                Germany, under a contract with a German bird-dealer, the following
                                birds in pairs of males and females, viz.: ten pairs of blackheaded
                                nightingales, eight pairs of gray song thrushes, fifteen pairs of
                                black song thrushes, twenty-two pairs of skylarks, four pairs of
                                singing quail, twenty pairs of black starlings, nineteen
                                bullfinches, three of which were females and sixteen males (the rest
                                of the females had died on the way), forty pairs of chaffinches,
                                thirty-five pairs of linnets, forty pairs of ziskins (green
                                finches), twenty pairs of cross-beaks, one pair of real nightingales
                                (the rest had died on the way), and several pairs of red-breasted
                                English robins, the European wren species, forest finches,
                                yellow-hammers, green finches.</p>
                            <p>When these birds arrived here, each species was put into a large
                                wooden cage six feet high, six feet long, and four feet deep, with
                                wire-net front, with plenty of water and their favourite food, thus
                                giving them a good opportunity to rest and exercise their wings
                                before they were turned loose. All these birds, with their cages,
                                were placed on exhibition for four days to the public. Thousands of
                                people went to see them, and the society realized about five hundred
                                dollars by this show, which went toward paying for the expense of
                                bringing them here. At the close of the exhibition the birds were
                                turned loose under direction of Frank Dekum, president of the
                                society, in the suburbs of Portland and in other counties here.</p>
                            <p>The larks were let loose outside of the city near clover meadows.</p>
                            <p>The birds have done well ever since they were let loose; <pb
                                    id="VAA2374-127" n="114"/> we watched them all through the
                                summer of 1889. Some nested in Portland and some in the suburbs,
                                while others went far off into the State.</p>
                            <p>We have had very flattering reports of these birds from all parts of
                                the State.</p>
                            <p>The birds left here in the fall of 1889 and returned in the spring of
                                1890, except the black thrush and the skylark; they did not migrate.</p>
                            <p>The society has received reports from numerous places in this
                                vicinity which show that the birds brought here and turned loose a
                                year ago last spring, have prospered, and that the scheme has been a
                                grand success.</p>
                        </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>These birds did so well that the same society ordered for March, 1891,
                        through a Portland bird-dealer named Stuhr: <q rend="block"
                            direct="unspecified">
                            <p>Twenty-four pairs of skylarks at $4 per pair, twenty-four pairs of

                                bullfinches at $4 per pair, twelve pairs of black song thrushes at
                                $7.50 per pair, twelve pairs of gray song thrushes at $8.50 per

                                pair. Some special orders for different parties were of goldfinches

                            <p>The aforesaid birds have to be delivered here in first-class order
                                and healthy condition by Mr. Stuhr, the bird-dealer, and upon such
                                delivery he will be paid for the same at the aforesaid prices.</p>
                        </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>This is a move in a most interesting direction. Why should we not have
                        nightingales, bulfinches, <pb id="VAA2374-128" n="115"/> linnets, and larks,
                        if they can be bought so cheaply and will acclimatize and be happy with us?
                        Near this time, Mr. Bok wrote me concerning the feasibility of releasing
                        some European nightingales on his residence grounds at Merion, Montgomery
                        County, Pennsylvania. I advised Mr. Bok and two other men, who asked the
                        same question, by all means to try acclimating the nightingales and larks
                        also. There is no reason why we should not add exquisite singers to our
                        ornithology as well as rare orchids and other imported flowers, shrubs,
                        vines, and trees to our horticulture.</p>
                    <p>In the case of two other strange birds, I have no hesitation in saying:
                        &quot;I know.&quot; One day while working with a guide in an open
                        piece of woods pasture with clumps of thickly growing trees while we
                        crouched motionless in hiding waiting for a pair of rose-breasted grosbeaks
                        to come to their nest on which I had two set cameras focused, there burst on
                        our ears such a bedlam of song that we were fairly dazed. The time was about
                        half past three in the afternoon. I thought at first that the notes were
                        those of the brown thrasher, but presently I discovered that this bird was
                        singing as no thrasher ever sang. He was imitating the bold, clear notes of
                        the lark, and every song that lay between that and the tiniest wisps of
                        sound made by a gnat-catcher or hummingbird; and when he interrupted this
                        performance to imitate the crowing of a rooster, the bark of a dog, the
                        rattle of a <pb id="VAA2374-129" n="116"/> hay wagon on the highway, and the
                        neigh of a horse in an adjoining field, we came from hiding, cautiously
                        crept through the willows and underbrush until we could get a clear view of
                        the singer, perched in the tiptop of the highest poplar tree of a clump
                        nearby, singing to split his throat. He was a bird of pure greys with a
                        greyish white vest and touches of white on his dark wing feathers. There is
                        nothing he possibly could have been except a Southern mocking bird. I was
                        extremely familiar with three birds of this kind, which were kept in
                        captivity at that time in a home of a friend of mine whose residence lay
                        scarcely a mile away on the outskirts of the village. I was so sure that one
                        of his birds had escaped that I stopped at night on my way home to tell him
                        where his pet could be found, and to make sure again that I could not be
                        mistaken in the identity of the singer. The birds were all in their room.
                        They were exact reproductions of the one I had heard. Returning to work the
                        following morning in the same location, I took with me my daughter, who
                        recently had been visiting in Asheville, North Carolina, where, I had heard
                        her say, these birds were very numerous and almost impudently tame. I did
                        not tell her of my experience the day before, but took her with me to the
                        blind where I had been hiding, fervently hoping that the mocking bird would
                        be in the same locality and sing again. About ten o&apos;clock I heard
                        him calling in the bushes, and a few minutes later <pb id="VAA2374-130"
                            n="117"/> he began to sing. Then I led her where she could see him and
                        asked her what he was. She promptly answered that he was a mocking bird, so
                        I had her corroboration and that of my helper who knew the caged birds well.
                        I worked throughout the summer, the greater part of the time in or near this
                        location, but never saw or heard the bird again. The ornithology of Indiana
                        now includes this bird in the southern part of the state, while it is listed
                        as a stray even as far north as the southern part of Michigan.</p>
                    <p>The other incident, concerning which I know I shall be questioned but in
                        which I also know I am right, occurred about fifteen years ago, while I was
                        in field work with a camera. I was hiding in a fence corner on one side of a
                        highway lying about a mile south and three miles west of the Limberlost. On
                        the opposite side of the road I had a camera focused on the nest of a pair
                        of birds in some bushes in a fence corner. While I was waiting for the birds
                        to return from food hunting there was a whistling of wings, suggestive of
                        wild doves or domestic pigeons, but much clearer and higher than anything I
                        had heard since childhood. A bird alighted on the telephone wire almost
                        directly opposite where I was hiding. It was as large as the largest
                        domestic pigeon I ever had seen, longer and trimmer in shape, having a long
                        tail of only a few feathers; its beak and feet were unusually red, as was
                        its nose. Over the top of its head and <pb id="VAA2374-131" n="118"/>
                        shoulders there was a most exquisite metallic lustre of bronze, tempering to
                        shifting shades of the same colour only lighter on its breast. Its back was
                        a slate grey with faint bronze lights, while here and there over its wings
                        there was a tiny, dark feather. The bird was very alert, its head high-head,
                        its big, liquid eyes searching the landscape in all directions. As it struck
                        the wire it gave a queer crynothing like the notes of our doves or pigeons,
                        but in a high key and interrogative tone it called as nearly as I can
                        express it in words: &quot;See, see, see.&quot; Then it searched the
                        landscape all around it, called again not so loudly, listened intently, and
                        again took up its course straight west. There was nothing this bird could
                        have been except one of the very last of our wild pigeons. I had heard it
                        described all of my life, had seen it in our woods in my childhood, and
                        before this experience I had carefully studied the pair in confinement in
                        the Cincinnati zoological gardens; so I know I was not mistaken in my
                        identification.</p>
                    <p>Another extremely rare bird in my locality which I have seen only once in a
                        flock in the woods of the Cabin, north, early in November, is the white snow
                        bunting of the North, lightly touched with rusty red brown over its back and
                        wings. It may be common with other field workers, but I have seen it in only
                        this one instance.</p>
                    <p>To birds noticed in locations which were unusual <pb id="VAA2374-132" n="119"
                        /> for them I might add the loon. Early one spring while working beside the
                        Wabash River I was amazed to see a loon swimming toward me. I examined him
                        carefully to make sure of my identification, but there was no mistaking his
                        pointed beak, white band around his throat, and his extreme agility in the
                        water. I imagined that he had alighted flock in migration for a drink or to
                        feed upon the bank. As I never had seen a loon in flight I tried to make him
                        take wing, but he swam steadily with the current, all the time coming closer
                        to me. At the wildest demonstration I could make he dived and very shortly
                        came to the surface quite a distance below me. Then I took a straight cut
                        across a bend in the river bank so that I should once more be in front of
                        him. When he approached me the second time, from what I hoped was
                        concealment, I threw a stick into the water directly in front of him,
                        counting surely on this forcing him to flight. At the splash so near him, he
                        drew back, seeming to rise on his feet on the water, lifted his wings, then
                        instantly folded them, plunging forward and diving again; but in the flash I
                        was quite sure that something was wrong with one of his wings. The next
                        morning, I noticed among the local items of a daily paper published in the
                        first town of any size on the river that a hunter had shot a loon which he
                        found on the river unable to fly because of a damaged wing. Then I thought
                        that the bird <pb id="VAA2374-133" n="120"/> had been slightly wounded,
                        while on wing with his flock, and had taken to the river as his only means
                        of travelling when he could not fly.</p>
                    <p>In my present location, in the summer of 1917, a pair of loons nested on the
                        lake shore about half a mile above the Cabin, making the only nest I have
                        had personal experience with in Indiana.</p>
                    <p>In the winter of 1902, a farmer living near the Limberlost region brought to
                        the Cabin the body of a large white Arctic owl which he had shot while it
                        was perching on one of his fences. We sent the bird, its feathers a moving
                        mass of tiny, red lice, to a taxidermist, and it came back beautifully
                        mounted. No doubt it is still in this man&apos;s possession. That same
                        winter the papers described the finding of a number of these birds in Ohio
                        and Indiana, where they were most uncommon.</p>
                    <p>A sister, who was with me at the time I definitely decided to make my
                        permanent home on the lake where I live to-day, declares that I paid the
                        purchase price for an acre of blue-eyed grass, which I acquired with my
                        holdings. She is only partly right. A wood duck also figured in the
                        equation. Two different times I saw him riding the water dressed like the
                        favourite of the Shah of Persia. He floated among the lily pads of a small
                        bay on the bank of which his mate nested, only a few rods from my purchase.
                        So I bought the wood duck and the blue-eyed grass, with a wealth of tall
                        hardwood trees for good measure.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-134" n="121"/>
                    <p>Linnaeus called this duck &quot;the bride,&quot; but he should have
                        explained that the male wore the nuptial dress and that the dress was that
                        of the most colourful orientals; for this loveliest of our ducks is as
                        gorgeous in dress as &quot;Solomon in all his glory.&quot; My
                        bird&apos;s beak, with its very dark, hooked, pointed tip, had a
                        triangle of blood-red on each side at the base; from that a wide irregular
                        mark of pale yellow ran down the sides. The top of his head was exquisite.
                        It was pure green of several shades in places, bronze-maroon in others,
                        bronzy green between. White lines ran from the red at the base of the beak
                        above the eye on each side to the tip of the long crest, which hung far down
                        the back of the neck. Secondary lines of white started back of the eyes and
                        ended with the crest. The eyes were large, having wide circles of red around
                        the iris. The cheeks and sides of the head were dark bronze. The throat was
                        snow white, this colour rounding the cheek and running up to the eye in a
                        narrow strip, again circling the side of the head and coming to a point at
                        the crest. The white came far down the throat, and stopped at an even line
                        where the breast changed to a lovely shade of maroon, lighter than that of
                        the head, yet having the same bronzy tints. This broad band covered the back
                        of the neck below the shoulders, shading lighter over the crop, where it was
                        flecked with almost invisible feathers of white at the top, the line
                        widening and <pb id="VAA2374-135" n="122"/> the feathers growing larger
                        where they met the white underparts. At the wing butts, a narrow band of
                        white faced the maroon, then one twice as wide of black; then came delicate
                        pale yellow feathers finely traced with black, and broader bands of black
                        and white. The back was green overlaid with maroon and hints of yellow, with
                        a white band across the top of the tail base, the tail very long for a duck,
                        green above, maroon at the sides. The feet were invisible in the water.</p>
                    <p>I used every caution to observe the bird closely without flushing it, as it
                        was the only one I ever had seen in freedom, although my father knew this
                        duck well when it was plentiful. He said it flew among the trees around
                        water as gracefully as any bird, and walked large limbs lengthwise. This
                        comes from its habit of nesting in cavities in large trees near or over the
                        water. Our ornithology knows no lovelier bird, yet it is now close
                        extinction through the greed of hunters and farmers. If it is not especially
                        and rigorously protected, soon it will be lost to the world forever; and it
                        is the handsomest duck alive, not excepting its near relative the Chinese
                        mandarin.</p>
                    <p>Two days after my purchase was concluded, the duck was shot by a fisherman
                        having a gun concealed in his boatshot during the heart of the nesting
                        season of June. In this same way vanished the last lovely wood pigeon, and
                        the wild turkeys are going fast. If the men do not take <pb id="VAA2374-136"
                            n="123"/> active conservation measures soon, I shall be forced to enter
                        politics to plead for the conservation of the forests, wildflowers, the
                        birds, and over and above everything else, the precious water on which our
                        comfort, fertility, and life itself depend.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">A</hi>BOUT the time of the publication of &quot;The Song of
                        the Cardinal&quot; a man in Indianapolis published a sharp criticism of
                        my natural history, because I had described these birds as occasionally
                        eating a stray bug or worm. He said that the cardinal grosbeak was named for
                        its heavy sharp beak, which is especially designed for crushing seeds, so
                        everyone knew that these birds were seed-eaters. So they are, as a rule, but
                        all cardinals with which I have been intimately acquainted during a lifetime
                        of experience have taken a few bugs and worms to change their diet, while in
                        captivity they greet a bit of fresh scraped beefsteak with every sign of
                        intense pleasure. The one lure that I found most effective in attracting
                        cardinals to given locations before set cameras was to wire bits of bright
                        red fresh beefsteak to the shrubbery I had in focus. Every woman who has
                        ever kept a canary as a pet knows that this bird will sicken and die if she
                        does not intersperse its staple diet of seed with lettuce leaves and apple;
                        and unless canaries are given scraped beefsteak in the spring at the
                        brooding time they <pb id="VAA2374-139" n="126"/> will pull out their
                        feathers and nibble the ends of them, so ravenous are they for the taste of
                        meat.</p>
                    <p>This criticism set me to watching the seed-eaters afield particularly, and I
                        soon learned that there was not one of them that did not vary its diet with
                        fruit or a few berries and a bug or a worm here and there. On one occasion I
                        saw one black vulture from a nest of which I was making a series of pictures
                        in the Limberlost, fly down into a fence corner and eat a quantity of catnip
                        leaves. A few days later I saw its mate snipping grass. Every one has seen
                        dogs eat grass, and every cat lover knows what a treat catnip is to a cat.
                        Both vultures ate freely of a handful of red raspberries I once placed in
                        the mouth of their log; while every summer the kingfishers that fish around
                        my stretch of lake shore in front of the Cabin, north, come into the wild
                        cherry trees and eat fruit.</p>
                    <p>I once dug open the nest of a kingfisher in an embankment, after the young
                        had left it, in order to measure the circumference of the nest room and the
                        length of the tunnel, and to examine carefully the structure of the nest. It
                        seemed to be formed entirely of regurgitated pellets that the brooding bird
                        had ejected in a circle around her during incubation. Microscopic
                        examination proved that nine tenths of the nest wall were the bones and
                        scales of small fish; the other tenth was about equally divided between
                        berry seeds and the bony structure of grasshoppers.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-140" n="127"/>
                    <p>I one day picked up the body of a dead kingfisher in a section near the
                        Limberlost, which I called Paradise Alley. Hunters were not allowed there,
                        and the region was devoted solely to my work by its owner, who did all in
                        his power to keep even fishermen and boys playing during their summer
                        vacation out of the long wooded stretch where I had the greatest number of
                        nests located; so I could not imagine what had happened to the bird. I could
                        find no broken bones, no marks on its body, no displacement of plumage. It
                        seemed to have starved to death, as its body was emaciated, so I took time
                        to dissect it. I found that the trouble had been caused in regurgitating the
                        bones of an unusually large fish. These birds swallow whole fish, tossing
                        them in air and catching them headfirst so that they go down smoothly. The
                        coming up seemed to have been another matter, with this bird at least, for a
                        large sharp bone from a back fin had turned crosswise in the food canal near
                        where it enters the crop, and was firmly imbedded in the flesh in such a way
                        that the bird could not regurgitate the indigestible parts nor take other
                        food.</p>
                    <p>Owls swallow their food in the same way, taking whatever prey they can whole,
                        assimilating the digestible parts and regurgitating bones, fur, and
                        feathers. Of course in the case of an owl, a hawk, or an eagle carrying away
                        prey too large to swallow whole, that food is torn up and eaten in pieces.
                            <pb id="VAA2374-141" n="128"/> One of the most disagreeable experiences
                        I ever had afield was in moving a dead calf which I found in our woods,
                        about two miles farther south to the location of the black vulture. I hoped
                        by placing that delectable vulture feast near the nest to coax the birds to
                        become so tame that I could picture them feeding on the carcass; but the man
                        who was a tenant on the land spoiled my scheme by burying the calf and
                        ordering me not to make his land a dumping place for the stock that died on
                        mine. I went so far as to tell him that I put the calf there for bird-food,
                        but I was afraid to point out the vulture location or explain exactly what I
                        was doing, because there was every probability that he would immediately
                        take his gun and shoot the birds. He was a man who charged me a fee for
                        driving down a lane and following a road through the swamp, which he and the
                        oilmen of the region used every day. I should like to add that he is the
                        only man in all of my years of field work who ever did this.</p>
                    <p>On the disagreeable subject of unusual food taken by birds: in company with
                        my brother-in-law, driving from one village to another in southern Michigan
                        I one day watched a red-shouldered hawk killing a snake. He was using the
                        methods attributed to the eagle, which dropped from aloft the tortoise that
                        struck the head and caused the death of the poet Aeschylus. This very unkind
                        proceeding is described as having taken place in an <pb id="VAA2374-142"
                            n="129"/> open field where the poet had sought refuge upon a day when it
                        had been predicted that he would meet his death by something falling upon
                        his head. In an open field I saw the hawk rising from the ground, in its
                        talons the body of a long blacksnake squirming and twisting. The bird
                        ascended in almost perpendicular flight to a height perhaps three times that
                        of the tallest trees bordering the field. It dropped the snake and plunged
                        headlong after it, reaching the ground at practically the same time. It
                        immediately caught up the stunned snake, mounting again even higher than
                        before, where it again dropped its prey. When the hawk took up the snake the
                        next time its body hung straight and limp, so the bird sailed away toward an
                        adjoining piece of tall timber.</p>
                    <p>Another time I saw only a part of the efforts of a hawk to secure a dinner
                        which made a very amusing spectacle. I was riding north on the Grand Rapids
                        and Indiana Railway, when I saw a big chicken hawk drop on a chicken, which
                        was about three fourths grownor if full-grown, a small hen. The hen saw the
                        hawk in time to make a frantic plunge for the shelter of a snake fence,
                        separating two fields. She came so near being caught that the interested
                        passengers on the train could see her feathers fall from the hawk&apos;s
                        talons as he arose. The chicken gained the fence and darted through a crack.
                        The hawk arose and dropped on the other side of the fence. The chicken
                        turned and <pb id="VAA2374-143" n="130"/> again struggled between the rails,
                        before the hawk reached it. When the train carried us from sight this
                        performance was still going on. I walked to the back of the ear to watch the
                        struggle as long as possible; when I could no longer distinguish what was
                        happening, the chicken had crept through the fence crack for the fifth time.
                        I am unable to say whether it eventually escaped or not, but I have an idea
                        that the hawk finally succeeded in catching the chicken, which was in a
                        panic.</p>
                    <p>Another peculiar and intensely interesting instance of feeding in the wild
                        occurred in a bit of swamp which lies almost directly across the lake from
                        Limberlost Cabin, north. Every season red-winged blackbirds nest among the
                        water willows, marsh grasses, and cat-tails of this swamp, but one season,
                        four years ago, a large flock took possession of this stretch of swamp,
                        remaining there until they left with their young after they were able to fly
                        for a combined attack on the grain fields of the region. While slowly
                        pushing a boat around the outside of this swamp, searching for a red-wing
                        nest, I saw one of these birds alight on a branch of water willow and lean
                        down to the water either to pick up something on the surface or to take a
                        drink. He chose his location without exercising any judgment or using the
                        precaution of examining the water carefully. More quickly than I could tell
                        the story, a big black bass sprang <pb id="VAA2374-144" n="131"/> one third
                        of its length out of the water, snapped its huge jaws shut on the blackbird,
                        and disappeared. This is the only time I ever saw a fish take a bird for
                        food, but the following season I dressed a four and one half pound black
                        bass the stomach of which contained a red-wing blackbird. The stomach of
                        another large bass I once dressed contained a sunfish fully as large as my
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>My daughter and I one day, attracted by a commotion among the flowers at the
                        end of the steps, saw a red squirrel run for the distance of a rod over the
                        earth and then climb a wild cherry tree, carrying in its mouth the
                        squirming, struggling body of a field mouse. A few weeks later, a red
                        squirrel from the nest in this same tree caught a ground squirrel across the
                        back and despite the little fellow&apos;s cries and struggles he was
                        carried up the tree and forced headfirst into the opening, which goes to
                        prove that squirrels vary their customary diet of nuts with some meat. I
                        have also seen them eat berries and fruit. If my strawberry bed could speak,
                        it could &quot;a tale relate&quot; as to the depredations of
                        squirrels, mice, ground hogs, birds, ants, bees, and bugs. The bed has to be
                        unusually large so that any berries are left for us.</p>
                    <p>Writing of fish recalls the fact that, while working in the Valley of the
                        Wood Robin beside the Wabash, a few days after the water of a high flood had
                        subsided one spring, I found the body of a large carp firmly impaled on a
                        thorn tree. The <pb id="VAA2374-145" n="132"/> fish evidently had been
                        carried sidewise by the stiff swirl of the current, as the thorn was driven
                        squarely into its side and penetrated the entire body.</p>
                    <p>One of the most peculiar nests it has fallen to my lot to work around was
                        originally built by a shitepoke. It rested in the sharply branching crotch
                        of a young elm tree, where two small limbs had grown out from the side of
                        the trunk, and from the pressure of the surrounding thicket had kept nearly
                        parallel with the trunk of the tree. The entire structure started in this
                        narrow crotch, widening as the limbs spread until it was fully twenty inches
                        in height. Toward the top the sticks used in the outer wall were the
                        thickness of a lead pencil and two feet in lengtha few of them even longer.
                        The nest was so weather-beaten that it undoubtedly had stood for several
                        seasons, and it was so firmly constructed that it gave promise of standing
                        for as many more. Using this structure as a foundation, a yellow-billed
                        cuckoo had begun in the nesting cavity and built her usual nest, a few
                        sticks and twigs loosely laid, with a slight lining of dried willow catkins
                        and the down of last year&apos;s weed growth. At the time I first
                        investigated the nest it contained four beautiful big cuckoo eggs. The nest
                        made such a lovely picture I hastily set up my highest step-ladder, and from
                        the top of it, about level with the top of the nest, I reproduced the
                        structure from <pb id="VAA2374-146" n="133"/>

                    <p>There have been a few times in field work, while I was on the editorial staff
                        of <hi rend="i">Outing</hi> doing some magazine work or particularly pressed
                        for some special picture needed to complete the work of illustrating an
                        article or book, when I have had such rare luck in securing a subject that I
                        almost felt encouraged to believe that the Lord was with me, and putting it
                        into the hearts of the wild creatures to come at my call and give me exactly
                        the pose wanted. Very distinctly in my memory there stands out one day when
                        I especially desired the picture of an owl. I was not particular what kind
                        or what size, for a screech owl can look quite as dignified and wise as its
                        great horned cousin of the big woods. I had been writing an article on what
                        the birds know, and I wanted an owl head for a first paragraph inset as this
                        bird is always used when a bird picture is wanted to illustrate wisdomnot
                        that the owl is by any means the wisest bird of the woods for it happens to
                        be one of the most stupid, but like a great many people, if it will consent
                        to keep its mouth shut and content itself with merely looking wise it serves
                        the purpose admirably.</p>
                    <p>The time was in early December. All day I cudgelled my brain to think where
                        or how I could secure a study of an owl to complete my article. About nine
                        o&apos;clock that night, passing through the <pb id="VAA2374-148"
                            n="135"/> back row of rooms in the Cabin, south, next to the orchard, I
                        heard a screech owl calling very close. Not long before, I had come as
                        nearly perfecting myself as was possible in owl notes for a recitation I
                        intended to give. I turned out the lights, darkening the entire back part of
                        the house; lowered the upper sash of a kitchen window; lighted a candle to
                        make a dim glow, screening it with a piece of pasteboardso that it would
                        have the effect of diffused light from the outside; and then crouched
                        beneath the window. After listening carefully, I began low imitations of the
                        bird&apos;s cries with all the exactitude possible to me. After a few
                        efforts I felt sure that the bird was answering me, so I waited, as nearly
                        as I could gauge, the same interval of time he did, and kept up the calls,
                        carefully intoning and accenting, encouraged by the fact that the calls
                        outside were beyond question drawing nearer. I think that my heart stood
                        quite still for a second, when there was a shadow above my head. Instantly,
                        I arose, pushed shut the window, and turned to find the owl sitting on the
                        back of one of the kitchen chairs, steadily gazing at the light. He had the
                        freedom of the kitchen until morning, as I dared not put him in the
                        conservatory with the canary house. The following day, when he was
                        bewildered by the light and unusual location, I reproduced him, back, front,
                        and sides, in every posture I could imagine an owl might assume in <pb

                        the door and I gave him freedom. Then I developed my plates, and the
                        following day my completed article was on its way to the publisher. Several
                        times after that I amused visitors at the Cabin by calling screech owls in
                        at the open window merely to prove that it was possible.</p>
                    <p>Frequently in field work I have met with cases of birds and animals trusting
                        to protective colouration for security. There have been times when I think I
                        could have picked up a rabbit while he was playing this game, had there been
                        any object in so doing. Beyond all question the most complete instance of
                        the kind happened on the lake on which we live. One spring morning my
                        husband came in saying that the black bass were
                        &quot;baitfighting&quot; by which he meant that while the females
                        were preparing their nests and getting ready to spawn, the males were in
                        shallow water making mad rushes at anything that struck the surface. I knew
                        that he wanted me to row the boat for him while he would cast, at least one
                        trip, around the head of the lake. Without stopping to think of anything
                        except fishing I took my rod and stepped into the boat. After rowing around
                        our lake I rounded the point of a big island lying in front of us, crossed
                        the branch of the lake on the far side of it, and started around that shore
                        line. At this point my husband took the oars and I began to cast. We had
                        proceeded up the lake <pb id="VAA2374-151" n="138"/> shore through the
                        narrows and dropped back around the side of a bay near an old water tank,
                        used by the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railway Company when they had a dummy
                        track laid at the head of the lake to bring out gravel for the construction
                        of the road. Not far below the tank, in a sort of pocket formed by a big log
                        extending from the shore into the water and bordered by cat-tails,
                        bulrushes, and several kinds of swamp grasses, in glancing ahead I saw a
                        beautiful big brown bittern quite close to us. He was wading along the lake
                        shore, lifting his feet silently, setting them down carefully, his beak not
                        far from the surface, intent on watching the water for small fish, frogs or
                        worms for his breakfast as he advanced. At the same instant I saw him he saw
                        the boat.</p>
                    <p>I cautioned my husband not to move a muscle not absolutely necessary, to
                        propel the boat as I directed, and to use great care to lift the oars slowly
                        and lower them quietly. That was the first time in years that I had started
                        to do anything afield or on the water without a snapshot camera in my hand.
                        Before me was an opportunity to take a splendid picture of one of our most
                        attractive water birds, which would have the added value of giving its exact
                        pose when trusting to protective colouration, exactly what this bird was
                        doing; for the instant he saw me he stopped as if petrified in his tracks,
                        compressed his feathers <pb id="VAA2374-152" n="139"/> to his body so
                        tightly that he appeared not more than half of his original size, drew down
                        his neck and pointed his beak almost straight up, putting his entire body
                        into a position as nearly perpendicular as possible. He was only a few
                        inches from his grassy background, while the morning sun was shining
                        directly on him, for he was on the north bank of the lake. I said to my
                        husband: &quot;I have no camera, but let me make a test of what I could
                        do if I had one.&quot; Slowly dropping to my knees I picked up a tackle
                        box in the bottom of the boat, pulled to me a coat which my husband had
                        discarded, set the tackle box on the seat where I had been sitting, and,
                        using the coat for a dark-cloth, I went through every motion that would have
                        been required to set up a camera, focus it, expose, and change plates. The
                        bird stood motionless. I suggested to my husband that he carefully move the
                        boat five or six feet closer, then again I went through the performance of
                        taking a picture. We repeated this several times, until my end of the boat
                        was exactly ten feet from the bird. I could not see that an eyelid quivered
                        or that he moved the tip of a feather; nor did I see any reason for flushing
                        him, because there was a faint hope that I might come around the lake shore
                        some other morning and find him in the same spot, when I was prepared to
                        reproduce his likeness. So with exactly the same caution we had used in
                        approaching him we slipped away and left <pb id="VAA2374-153" n="140"/> him
                        there. As far as I could distinguish the bird from his background he
                        remained motionless.</p>
                    <p>It would be impossible to make anyone who had not seen this bird in the same
                        location believe how completely he became a part of his surroundings when he
                        threw himself into position. His bare, slender feet and legs were greenish
                        yellow exactly like the grass-shaded water and the sands on which he stood.
                        His breast was striped in even bands, almost exactly the width of the blades
                        of marsh grass, seeming as if it had been measured and pencilledone stripe
                        precisely the yellowish tan of last year&apos;s dead leaf, the next
                        stripe the richer brown of an older leaf having had longer exposure to the
                        weather. His eyes were rimmed with pale yellow, with yellow rings around the
                        iris, while his upturned beak was almost too good to be true. On his throat
                        was the tan of the grasses, on his head exactly their brown, while the
                        large, sharply pointed beak itself was striped with this tan shading to
                        brighter yellow, with the green of the bulrushes, the paler tannish green of
                        the cattails faintly lined with a touch of dull red exactly reproducing the
                        rust-red effect of some of the grasses, and the extreme tip of the beak was
                        the same old ivory as the dead outer leaves from which this year&apos;s
                        fresh cat-tails were springing. For the remainder of that season I
                        frequently hunted him along this same stretch of lake shore, and while I
                        often saw him flying over the lake or alighting in <pb id="VAA2374-154"
                            n="141"/> bays opposite me, I never again succeeded in getting within
                        working distance of him at a time when I was prepared for work.</p>
                    <p>A pitiful and peculiar bird experience occurred in my presence on a lake in
                        Michigan where I was rowing a boat while my brother-in-law, with an
                        artificial minnow, was making a series of particularly long and expert casts
                        for bass. As straight as if it had been shot from a gun a swallow darted in
                        front of the flying bait, which struck it squarely and there was nothing to
                        do but to reel in and attempt its release. From the impact of the bait at
                        nearly a hundred feet, being dragged through the water for the length of the
                        cast, and the pain of having most of the hooks deeply imbedded in its body,
                        the bird was dead before it reached the boat I hope. It was so terribly
                        abused and wounded that I made sure that it was beyond suffering before
                        attempting to remove the hooks. A man might try for an average lifetime to
                        strike a bird on wing at that distance with an artificial bait and not
                        succeed in hitting it. It is scarcely necessary to say that neither of us
                        would have had this accident occur for any consideration if we could have
                        prevented it, as swallows are particularly inoffensive and peculiarly
                        graceful and attractive birds in flight, while their benefit in winnowing
                        the air of countless gnats, mosquitoes, and almost invisible winged pests is
                        beyond calculation.</p>

                        home from a near-by village where we had spent the night with a friend. We
                        stopped and watched, until we had no more time to spend, a sight as unusual
                        as I ever have seen in the woods. In a dense piece of woods well toward the
                        foot of the Limberlost country, on a heavy limb topping a stack of wind-fall
                        brush there perched the biggest and oldest great horned owl of my
                        experience. Because I was so particularly interested in birds, my friends
                        waited while I climbed the snake fence and cautiously crept through the
                        woods until, screened by the thicket only a few yards away, I could
                        distinctly see what was going on. Again, I had no camera with me, and there
                        was too much shade for the constant motion of the subject besides. The owl
                        was in some physical troublejust what, I could not discover, but he had
                        every appearance of being almost ready to die of old age. In a long,
                        well-fed life, he had grown to magnificent proportions, which probably
                        appeared double, because every feather on him was standing on end. These <pb
                            id="VAA2374-157" n="144"/> feathers were grey with age. He showed
                        scarcely a trace of the dark or even the lighter brown shades of his
                        species, being more of a dirty white and washed-out greyish tan. His big
                        feet and huge nails, and his toes and legs seemed to be encrusted with
                        scale, probably contracted by lack of cleanliness after having torn up prey
                        with them; for he was big enough and had the strength to handle a chicken, a
                        small pig, or even a newborn lamb, although I never heard of an owl taking
                        such animals. His eyes were wide open as was his mouth. He constantly
                        uttered a hissing sound, rapidly turning his head from side to side as he
                        snapped at a bevy of small birds that were tormenting him. Forgetting
                        everything elseeven their fear of each otherall of the denizens of that
                        woods had collected around the owl. Prominent among his tormentors were two
                        crows, two or three blue jays, several kingbirds, while further removed, yet
                        not failing to take a peck at him occasionally, were a number of robins.
                        Several orioles were surprisingly pugnacious. There were a number of
                        sparrows and even little things like warblers and vireos. One summer yellow
                        bird made a streak of light as he dashed chattering past the owl&apos;s
                        head, and several wrens were jabbering insanely when they darted in among
                        the other birds. Perhaps the most amazing feature of the spectacle to me was
                        that in combining against the owl all of these smaller birds were fighting
                        in <pb id="VAA2374-158" n="145"/> perfect accord with the crows, and in the
                        half hour or possibly longer that I detained my party to watch this
                        performance I never once saw the crows make the slightest aggressive move
                        against any of the other birds.</p>
                    <p>It would be a wonderful thing if I could make you see the great horned owl in
                        a frenzy of anger and fear, hissing and snapping right and left, his head
                        seeming positively to turn a complete circle on his neck when the most
                        impudent of the tormentors actually flew against his head and shoulders and
                        succeeded in pulling a feather from him in passing. He made repeated strokes
                        at them, hissing and threatening constantly, even striking with the butts of
                        his half-lifted wings a motion I never before saw an owl make in
                        self-defense, while circling around him, darting over and at him, each
                        uttering the high, shrill alarm call of his kind, flashed the black bodies
                        of the crows and blackbirds, the blue of jays, the brown and grey of the
                        sparrows, the steel of the kingbirds and wood pewees, and the gold of the
                        orioles and summer yellow birds. At the time I left, so slow were the
                        movements of the owl and so imperfect seemed his sight that he had not
                        succeeded in pulling even a feather from one of his tormentors. I never have
                        been able to rid myself of the feeling that the owl&apos;s time as a
                        fighter was almost over, on account of the condition of his beak and feet
                        and his plumage. Of course I made allowance for the fact that the <pb
                            id="VAA2374-159" n="146"/> strong colouring on a bird is usually
                        confined to a very small touch on the extreme tip of the feathering, the
                        deep effect resulting from these thickly overlapping. Any bird with its
                        feathers standing on end so that the greater part of the feather and the
                        downy covering next the flesh show naturally appears much lighter and of
                        different colour than when the feathers are folded; but even making all due
                        allowance in this respect, I still maintain that the owl of this encounter
                        was a patriarch very near the close of his days.</p>
                    <p>Writing of this owl reminds me of three other instances in which I have seen
                        birds of many species mass to attack a common enemy. One of my neighbour
                        boys had a crow that he had taken from a nest and was raising by hand. This
                        bird had the freedom of the neighbourhood and even came to visit me at the
                        Cabin, where I frequently gave him food if I had anything convenient for
                        which I thought he would care. One morning while passing through the kitchen
                        I heard a small pandemonium going on in the back yard. On investigating, I
                        found the crow perched on a lower crosspiece of the grape arbour, while
                        taking a peck at him in flight as they passed, were the orioles from a nest
                        in a pear tree across the alley, my bluebirds from a box on the abour, a
                        pair of wrens that had a house on the arbour, the martins from the windmill,
                        and the robins from half a dozen nests, while there was a liberal sprinkling
                        of English sparrows, <pb id="VAA2374-160" n="147"/> which were always
                        hanging around ready for any mischief they might do. The crow solved his
                        difficulties by spreading his wings and flying home.</p>
                    <p>Once in a big field beside the Wabash River, my field assistant, my daughter,
                        and I watched a pair of kingbirds and several other birds, smaller but
                        flying so high we could not differentiate them without field glasses, fly
                        after and over a big hawk, the kingbirds constantly dropping to pick its
                        head and eyes, then rising straight in the air. At times, they seemed
                        actually to perch on its back between its shoulders, but the height was so
                        great and the flight of the hawk so rapid I could not state positively that
                        they did this.</p>
                    <p>The first summer that we lived in our present Cabin, an immense flock of
                        red-winged blackbirds nested in the reeds in a small bay directly across the
                        lake from us. A pair of big grey and tan chicken hawks had their nest
                        somewhere in the tall timber of Kestler&apos;s Island high above the
                        bay. Throughout the summer these hawks hung above the cattails and
                        bulrushes, swooping down as often as they were hungry, almost never failing
                        to carry prey as they arose to sail back to the woods. Then with angry
                        cries, practically the whole male population of the swamp would arise and
                        pursue the hawks. Sometimes crows would come to the assistance of the
                        red-wings, but so long as they remained about their nesting affairs so long
                        the hawks preyed upon them. When the red-wings were gone, the hawks <pb
                            id="VAA2374-161" n="148"/> merely dropped lower and made their attacks
                        on the grebe, the cinereous coot, and the other water birds swimming around
                        the edges of the marsh with their young.</p>
                    <p>One of the most exquisite birds I ever had in my fingers was carried to me a
                        few seasons ago by my driver. It had flown in the open door of the garage,
                        and was beating itself on an opposite window, unable to find its way out. It
                        had battered itself until it was so tired that he was able to pick it up and
                        carry it to me. It was a chestnut-sided warbler, having a white throat,
                        yellow cap, white beak, chestnut sides, and half a dozen different shades
                        running from white to steel grey over its wings. In a few minutes it revived
                        so that it was able to fly.</p>
                    <p>Mentioning this driver recalls the fact that he told me on several occasions
                        that there was a stray cat which had been abandoned by some of the cottagers
                        at the head of the lake and left to run the woods until it had returned to
                        the wild, or there was some kind of prowling animal of the cat species in
                        the woods behind the garage, where he said at times its screams almost
                        &quot;raised the hair of his head.&quot; One night the screams came
                        particularly early, so he hurried down to the veranda to call me. I went
                        with him to the woods, very shortly located his screamer, and was able to
                        satisfy him that it was merely one of our great horned owls uttering one of
                        its most blood-curdling cries, when <pb id="VAA2374-162" n="149"/> it flew
                        with wings widely spread into a clump of bushes to drive out some of the
                        cardinals, warblers, or other small birds that might be nesting or perching
                        there. I have no doubt that other stories carried to me of some wild
                        animal&apos;s infesting our northern Indiana woods and making the night
                        hideous with its screams had their origin in nothing more than a hungry
                        horned owl&apos;s using this original method to scare up prey.</p>
                    <p>While orchid hunting one day on the banks of one of the most beautiful lakes
                        in northern Indianaor in the world for that matteron a moss-covered log far
                        back among the dim tamaracks deep in the ooze and slime of the swamp, I
                        caught a glimpse of an exquisite shade of rose-colour. Almost at the same
                        time, our State Entomologist, who was engaged in field work with me, saw it
                        also. Each of us started by a different route to make our way toward it,
                        climbing over rotten logs, clinging to button bushes or swamp holly, or
                        recklessly supporting ourselves with poison sumach. We at last reached the
                        log at practically the same time to see embedded among the exquisite fine
                        moss and lichens covering it, a thickly petalled flower shaped much like a
                        wild rose, lying flat and completely surrounded by the mosses, among which
                        it bloomed. Stooping to try to trace its root system in order to identify
                        it, I discovered that it was a pink rose, blown of glass, very probably
                        carried to its location far in the swamp by a crow, where it had lain until
                            <pb id="VAA2374-163" n="150"/> the moss crept up and so surrounded it
                        that even standing above it anyone would have mistaken it for a natural
                        flower. I brought our wonderful rose home where I keep it among my mementoes
                        of field work, because I especially enjoy a good joke on myself.</p>
                    <p>Last season my husband came to me and said he wanted my interpretation of a
                        piece of natural history that was worrying him. Between the parks in which
                        he kept his crested Polish and white Plymouth Rock chickens, he had found
                        the gate-pin hole completely corked with tiny bits of wood. I went with him
                        and watched him take his penknife and remove the little pieces. Behind them
                        we found the hole packed full of beechnuts, so I told him to watch for a few
                        days and see what bird he found there. Before the day was over he came to
                        tell me that a downy woodpecker was busy refilling the hole with more bits
                        of wood, which it was collecting for the purpose.</p>
                    <p>I might add among peculiar experiences afield the history of a picture I made
                        in a lake only a short distance from Silver Lake, Indiana. The shores of
                        this lake, I was told by natives, were badly infested with a snake I have
                        not yet been able to identify, which they called
                        &quot;red-bellies,&quot; and persistently asserted their bite meant
                        instant death; so I was constantly warned by my guide to watch out for
                        snakes and to be very careful. With my paraphernalia in a boat, the guide
                        rowing <pb id="VAA2374-164" n="151"/> around the lake shore, wherever I
                        found a subject on which I wanted to work and could not manage efficiently
                        from the boat, I climbed out in the water, after testing its depth with an
                        oar, and set up my camera in the muck. This was particularly messy business,
                        fraught with dangers of going under in a fretwork of musk-rat burrows or
                        quicksand, but I was collecting illustrations for a portion of a book
                        devoted to swamp subjects and the only place to secure my illustration was
                        swampy lake shore or inland swamp; so there was nothing to do but forget the
                        discomforts and absorb myself beyond any other thought in the work of
                        securing my pictures. When I had set up my camera, and focused it on the
                        subject, it was my custom to take an exposure bulb with several yards of
                        hose attached in my hand or let it float on the water, while I went forward
                        and put the bed of flowers or whatever composed my picture into the best
                        shape possible by removing out-of-focus limbs, flowers, or leaves from the
                        foreground, straightening out the whole subject into the most artistic
                        composition possible to me. One particular stretch of lake shore was thickly
                        covered with pickere weed at the height of bloom, with its background of
                        higher bushes and arrow-head lilies, while a rippling current in the water
                        before it made a particularly exquisite picture. I walked the length of this
                        bed, bending over it, pulling out some growth I did not want, here and there
                        removing leaves that were too <pb id="VAA2374-165" n="152"/> prominent. It
                        seemed in retrospection that there was not a foot of the bed in which I did
                        not have my fingers. Ten days afterward, at home in my dark-room developing
                        these plates, I was amazed to see in the midst of this picture, lifting its
                        head and with open mouth, a snake, his fangs plainly showing; so I must have
                        made the exposure at the very instant at which he struck at me and hit a
                        lily leaf instead. - I had been intent on my footing or the camera so that I
                        did not see him; and I should have paid no attention to slight motion in a
                        composition of this kind, because I was constantly running on to musk-rats,
                        ground-puppies, frogs, and water snakes while working in such locations.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of snakes, I must add one other incident of my career. The
                        little boy, Billy, described in &quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot;
                        was a very real character, the truth being that the incidents attributed to
                        him in the home of the Sintons really occurred at the Cabin, south. He was a
                        brave little soul, faithful beyond telling, entirely devoted to me and to my
                        daughter. One morning during a midsummer of intense heat he heard me express
                        a desire for rain. He immediately remarked: &quot;I can get the rain for
                        you,&quot; to which I questioned: &quot;How can you get it,
                        Billy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He answered: &quot;Mrs. Smith says that if you kill a snake and turn its
                        belly up, it will rain before night. I know where I can always find a snake,
                            <pb id="VAA2374-166" n="153"/> &apos;cause us boys go snake-hunting
                        lots of times. I can get you rain.&quot;</p>
                    <p>I answered: &quot;Oh, no, you can&apos;t, Billy. That is a silly, old
                        superstition.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Shortly afterward, Billy disappeared without telling me where he was going.
                        About half past three in the afternoon, he returned, an object demanding an
                        immediate tubbing. His face was red, his neck and hands brier-scratched. He
                        was dirty beyond belief, but his small features shone with a look of
                        confident triumph.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now you&apos;ll get your rain,&quot; he said conclusively.
                        &quot;I found a good big snake, and I have killed it and laid it right
                        out in the road, where everybody can see it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The sky was cloudless, the sun shining clear. I said to him: &quot;What
                        nonsense! Killing a snake never made rain!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It didn&apos;t?&quot; shouted Billy. &quot;Oh, but look
                        out the window!&quot;</p>
                    <p>I turned to the window and to my utter confusion saw the rain pelting down in
                        big drops that splattered on the walks as it fell straight from a clear sky.</p>
                    <p>I do not recall the exact date, but it was a season from eight to ten years
                        ago during which we experienced the most peculiar rainfall I ever have seen.
                        Half a dozen times during that summer rain <unclear>f-ll</unclear> from a
                        clear sky enough to wet the sidewalks and grass at the Cabin, while the main
                        street of <pb id="VAA2374-167" n="154"/> the village, two blocks away, was
                        dry. These rains were often so local that at one time my sidewalk on our
                        side of the street was quite wet, while my neighbour&apos;s across the
                        street had not a drop.</p>
                    <p>My husband and I, sitting on the veranda one Sabbath afternoon shortly after
                        dinner, saw one of these local rains falling a short distance east of us,
                        over an area that looked to be no larger than an average building lot in a
                        village. At the same time the martins on our windmill behind the house saw
                        it, and high in a flock they began taking a bath in air by flying through
                        the rainfall, turning and plunging into it again. They kept this up with
                        constant chatter and manifest delight until they attracted the attention of
                        a large flock of chimney swallows, living in the belfry of the village
                        school-house about two blocks away, air line. The swallows came chattering,
                        dozens of them in a flock, and dashed into the rain for a bath or a drink on
                        wing. All of this time, the sun was shining brightly almost directly behind
                        our backs so that the falling drops were tinted in rainbow lights, and the
                        bodies of the birds, heading into the water, seemed to be bordered with
                        rainbow colours, making one of the most exquisite sights imaginable.</p>
                    <p>Crossing a field in the region of the Limberlost late one afternoon in fall,
                        in approaching a road I heard a confusion of bird voices, all seeming to <pb
                            id="VAA2374-168" n="155"/> belong to the warbler family. Keeping behind
                        some bushes on my side of the fence, I crept up and so drew very close to a
                        wonderful picture. In a line on a wire fence, there was a string the length
                        of a city lot, of warblers gathering for migration, while over several
                        bushes before and close behind the fence flocked dozens upon dozens more of
                        these trim exquisite little birds. Of course, the predominant colour was
                        yellow, there being the pure gold of the summer yellow bird and the slightly
                        deeper shade of the prothonotary. There were the deep orange of the
                        Blackburnian and the mottled yellow of the magnolian. There appeared
                        prominently on the wire the yellow head and throat of the blue-wing, the
                        stronger touch of yellow of the redstart, the black-throated green warbler,
                        the yellow pine and the yellow-touched hood and mourning warblers. There
                        were a number of specimens of the black-throated blue warbler and the still
                        paler cerulean. There was at least one specimen of the bay-breasted warbler,
                        with robin-breast colour on the top of its head and all over its underparts,
                        and there were enough chattering, little warblers I could not identify to
                        have made a large flock. I do not profess to be acquainted with all of the
                        warblers of my locality. When one takes into consideration that in almost no
                        instance are the male and female alike, while a flock collecting for
                        migration might contain more than half of its members in the form of young
                        birds, which until <pb id="VAA2374-169" n="156"/> a first moulting would not
                        resemble either of the parents, it can readily be understood how bewildered
                        I, or any other field worker, would have been. The birds seemed to wait on
                        the wire and bushes for several minutes, while numbers of their kind joined
                        them from small bushes over the field and the adjoining woods. The whole
                        flock seemed excited, on high nervous tension, and constantly chirped and
                        chattered. In a short time, as one bird they took wing, rising higher than I
                        ever had seen warblers fly about the business of living, and headed due
                        south. As a rare and unusual sight I can think of no experience in field
                        work to surpass the beauty of this picture.</p>
                    <p>In the spring of 1918 at the Cabin, north, on a warm May Sabbath morning,
                        with occasional showers falling, the cook came to ask me to go to the back
                        porch. All of the warblers described in the previous instance had returned
                        to the North in a body, and having just landed in the dense tangles of vines
                        climbing over the high growth above the spring, they paused to hold a
                        Sabbath service of thanksgiving for their safe arrival. For several
                        hoursuntil midafternoon, in facta rolling, trilling volume of sound ascended
                        from the region of the spring. Then it ceased, and after that not more than
                        a dozen could be heard at one time.</p>
                    <p>Two other instances of particularly exquisite things I have seen in nature
                        occurred on my own <pb id="VAA2374-170" n="157"/> premises at Limberlost
                        Cabin, south. One was the mating of a pair of Baltimore orioles. They had
                        selected a nest location in a cottonwood across the street, but they were
                        bathing, feeding, and gathering nest material on our premises. I was
                        standing in the conservatory talking with my daughter and a New York friend
                        who was visiting me, when the female oriole flew to a beautiful specimen of
                        Killarney rose bush growing against the west fence, which we had changed
                        from the original broad boards to a high wall, laid up with large blocks of
                        Wabash River limestone. Behind the green foliage of the rose bearing blooms
                        of magnificent size, one being seven inches in diameter, the cream stone of
                        the wall made a perfect background for the cutting of the rose leaves and
                        the luscious pink blooms, while in front of it spread a fine sweep of turfy
                        lawn grass. Like a meteor of gold the female bird dropped from high flight
                        to the rose bush. Almost a-wing with her flashed the orange and black of the
                        male. He perched beside her and they locked beaks in a long caress. I had
                        not known before that orioles locked bills in their love making and I do not
                        know now that they do in every instance. Three of us distinctly saw what
                        occurred in the incident I am describing. The female fluttered to the
                        delicate green grass, her wings half-lifted and outspread, her head turned
                        to one side, her beak lifted. The male followed her in a frenzy of the
                        mating fever, repeatedly <pb id="VAA2374-171" n="158"/> kissing her,
                        delicately stroking her wing feathers, finally consummating his mating.</p>
                    <p>The other case when I was present at the finale of the love affairs of a pair
                        of birds occurred with a pair of cardinal grosbeaks that were building a
                        nest in a wild rose bush climbing over the music-room windows. The
                        foundations of the nest were laid and one day had been spent by the female
                        in industrious work. Toward evening she left the location, flying east,
                        probably on her way to the river to hunt for food or to get a drink. During
                        her absence the male bird flew to a lower branch of a big elm tree in a
                        corner of the dooryard, not far from where I was sitting in company with a
                        friend on the front steps. The western light struck him fully, lighting his
                        plumage to its most gorgeous colouring, touching his black beard with lights
                        of silver. He called and chirped inquiringly. Getting no answer from the
                        rose bush he flew there to investigate. Not finding his mate there he
                        returned to the perch on the elm tree. Almost as he reached it the female
                        came flying from the east, and, in answer to his calls, joined him on the
                        elm branch. Immediately, he burst into his most impassioned strain of song.
                        He lifted his head, swelling his throat, flaring his crest to the utmost,
                        half lifting his wings, rocking from side to side, turning and twisting on
                        the limb before her, displaying his colouring and his grace to the utmost
                        advantage, while note for note he threw all the <pb id="VAA2374-172" n="159"
                        /> tenderness and pleading and passion of his heart into his vocal
                        performance. He stressed each note to its highest reach, its most poignant
                        pleading, its mellowest tone, with impassioned gestures, singing and
                        whistling his complete repertoire; when the hen bird gave a faint cheep of
                        assent, as his notes died to a mere whisper of sound in his throat, their
                        mating was accomplished.</p>
                    <p>During a fall expedition in nest collecting made as a basis for the chapter
                        of this book entitled &quot;Nest Building,&quot; with my clippers I
                        once cut the main twig of a small thicket of oak sprouts growing around the
                        stump of a tree long felled, to collect what I imagined was a leaf-filled
                        catbird nest. As the severed nest tipped toward me, I caught it with one
                        hand and received directly in my face and over my breast the father, mother,
                        and half a dozen young from a nest of field mice. After recovering from a
                        shock which any woman will understand and few men would covet, I examined
                        the nest to find that it was securely roofed with large sycamore leaves
                        woven and firmly fastened to the outer edge of the nest. The nest cavity
                        under this roof was filled with grasses, feathers, fur, and down. At one
                        side there was a round hole about the size of a silver quarter, which was at
                        a spot convenient for the mice to enter by running up the stem and following
                        out one branch that passed beside the opening.</p>

                        field worker I should not include those having wonderful backgrounds, good
                        composition, atmosphere, or any fine example of pictorial art, but rather
                        enumerate the reproduction directly from life of birds exhibiting some
                        especial characteristic, performing some particularly intimate act of their
                        lives, or in some pose which is of peculiar scientific value. In the
                        illustration of my first book &quot;The Song of the Cardinal,&quot;
                        there are more instances of these things than in any other series of studies
                        of the home life of a pair of birds that I have been fortunate enough to
                        secure. In order to carry the pictorial history of these birds through the
                        entire gamut of bird life I worked around every cardinal nest I could find
                        for three years, using many lures to attract the birds before set cameras,
                        such as wiring beefsteak to limbs and bushes, and subterfuges such as
                        introducing lemon trees from my conservatory into the immediate surroundings
                        of a nest so that I could secure reproductions of the birds portraying their
                        time of residence in the South.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-175" n="162"/>
                    <p>The very cream of these illustrations is two courting pictures, both of which
                        were made near a nest on which I had worked for several weeks. At a time
                        when the first of the young had flown, while the last remained a day longer
                        in the nest, the old birds began courting, preliminary to building a new
                        nest, the site which they had agreed upon being only a few rods down the
                        river from the first nest in the same stretch of sumac thicket. These were
                        genuine courting pictures, in each instance the birds having mated scarcely
                        a second after the picture was taken. I also count as very rare the picture
                        of this female at work on her second nest, as, for reasons I have explained,
                        it is almost impossible to photograph the birds in the act of gathering
                        material or weaving it into a nest they are building.</p>
                    <p>An unusual picture, and one I have had few other chances to secure, was the
                        one of this series in which the male bird carried the female a morsel of
                        foodI could not see what, but a seed or something hardon which she bit for
                        several seconds before she swallowed it. The picture was snapped while the
                        hen was still nibbling the food. A few inches away, the male, after
                        delivering the food, ran his beak down the length of her wing next him in
                        what seemed to be a caress; then, with an expression of extreme solicitude
                        on his face, watched her an instant before he took wing. I also made three
                        pictures of this male cardinal <pb id="VAA2374-176" n="163"/> standing guard
                        on the edge of the nest while the female went to bathe and drink. Two of
                        these were unusually interesting, one was an exposure showing his head
                        turned to one side as a bird does when it is intently watching and
                        listening; the other was taken immediately after a bath, while his wet
                        feathers were so plastered to him in patches that anyone not understanding
                        the situation would marvel at his condition. This picture I did not include
                        in the book, as I wished to use it for the frontispiece of another book
                        exclusively on birds, for which I was gathering material at that time.</p>
                    <p>Another picture of extreme interest occurs twice in the book, where the male
                        is photographed sidewise, his head turned directly toward the lens, his
                        mouth open enough so that the curved line of his beak and the incisor, which
                        might almost be the remnant of vanishing teeth, show. There is no way to
                        estimate the scientific value of such a picture of a living bird, because
                        the bird is shown in the freshness of life, and not in the dried, shrunken
                        condition of a museum specimen. In each of these pictures the formation of
                        the upper mandible also is clearly outlined. This series includes studies of
                        the male bird with his feathers on end, his body tipped to such an angle as
                        would allow the sun to shine on his skin, as birds place themselves for a
                        sun bath. Another pose is without a suspicion of crest, his feathers
                        plastered tight as they are held by the birds to keep a dash of rain <pb
                            id="VAA2374-177" n="164"/> from wetting the body. There are also several
                        in the series of the male in full tide of song.</p>
                    <p>During the length of time I was at work collecting the illustrations for this
                        book I made a photograph having all of the pictorial value possible to me,
                        of every cardinal nest I could locate or that any of my friends could find
                        for me. Many of these were of extreme beauty but none approached, from the
                        points of beauty and historical value, that nest found by my daughter in the
                        Valley of the Wood Robin, long after the complete illustration of the life
                        history of these birds was assured, and at a time when the book was almost
                        finished. We were working together, systematically searching through every
                        shrub and bush for birds&apos; nests, when her cry of delight brought me
                        to her. She had flushed a hen cardinal, brooding in a thicket of wild rose
                        growing over a stack of brush on an old stump at the edge of the swamp. It
                        was not the swamp wild rose but the genuine sweetbrier with its pungent
                        leaves, stout long climbing stems; and the immediate region of the nest was
                        a mass of lovely pink blooms, shading from the deep red of the unfolded buds
                        to the strong pink flowers just opened and the delicate pinkish white petals
                        almost ready to fall. The hen bird of this nest could easily reach out and
                        catch insects attracted by the sweetness of the bloom when she was brooding,
                        while more could be had by rising to her feet or hopping to the edge of the
                        nest.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-178" n="165"/>
                    <p>I have made many series of pictures quite complete in historical value of the
                        homes of most of our birds, but never a series to equal this one of the
                        cardinals, which I carried to the farthest extent I possibly could on
                        account of writing an entire book concerning one pair of birds. It will be
                        easy for any naturalist, examining the pictures, to see that the birds are
                        not the same pair throughout the illustration, although the story represents
                        them to be.</p>
                    <p>A number of these pictures are not reproductions of our common Indiana
                        redbird, but of the larger, brighter redbird of Kansas and Iowa, which for
                        some reason had strayed into the Limberlost, found him a mate, and homed
                        there for a season. He was an old bird of bloody red plumage, jetty beard,
                        and having had so much association with man that he showed almost contempt
                        for the cameras introduced into his vicinity. After a few days spent in
                        becoming accustomed to me, he went about his affairs in utter disregard of
                        my cameras, very frequently perching on them in leaving the nest, which he
                        made a practice of <hi rend="i">entering</hi> from one direction, although
                        he left it as the spirit moved him. This is a habit pertaining to all birds
                        with which I ever have worked.</p>
                    <p>What is probably as good, if not the best, likeness of a bird I ever made
                        afield, I got through this characteristic. I had my camera focused on the
                        nest of a pair of kingbirds to which both of the <pb id="VAA2374-179"
                            n="166"/> old birds were coming constantly, each by a private route, to
                        feed the young. The male at each approach to the nest flew to the end of a
                        twig on which the nest was located. This branch was alive and small apples
                        were sticking up around the nest, but the extreme tip, on which the bird
                        alighted from a higher point in his route, was dead and bare so that every
                        natural history point possible to include in one picture was shown almost
                        every time he alighted. Noticing this, I decided to move the camera a few
                        feet, focus it on the tip of the branch, and see if I could secure a picture
                        of him during the instant he perched there before he flew to the nest. After
                        he had left from one feeding I moved the camera, made the focus as sharp as
                        possible, and retired to hiding. The picture I secured was made the first
                        time he alighted on the twig. As he struck it, he noticed the camera was in
                        a different position. He drew back his head, but did not move his body. The
                        picture shows him breast toward the camera, his head slightly turned to one
                        side, which resulted in giving the exact shape of his beak, his eye, the
                        height and rounding of his crest, his wings not tightly folded to his sides,
                        his feet both in view as they naturally grasped the twig, his tail
                        widespread showing the white border, his pose alert. I searcely see how it
                        would be possible to crowd more interesting points into one reproduction of
                        a bird, while on his face is plainly to be seen the <pb id="VAA2374-180"
                            n="167"/> curiosity he undoubtedly was experiencing as to what the
                        camera was, and why the strange object had moved since his latest trip to
                        the nest.</p>
                    <p>I regard a picture of a male bird brooding or standing guard on the edge of
                        the nest as a real triumph; carrying food to his mate so that both old birds
                        are included in the picture comes next; and third I would place a good
                        picture of a male bird feeding his young, although it frequently happens
                        that, with a camera focused on a nest, I have pictured both birds attending
                        to the young at the same time.</p>
                    <p>Among my oriole pictures, I have made one that stands preminent. In the first
                        place the nest was very large, finely woven mostly of what I call natural
                        material. Plant fibre and hair comprised the entire purse part of the nest
                        with the exception of a long piece of cotton cord and one white carpet rag,
                        which formed the anchorage at one side. The cord ran across the top of the
                        nest, wound three or four times around a limb, then was tucked in and tied
                        at the other end. It was carried perhaps an inch higher than the full length
                        of the nest, where it was tightly lashed, fastened, and reinforced with
                        plant fibre. The whole nest was very light in colour, silver grey and white.
                        When I made this exposure the young were old enough that their open beaks
                        were lifted above the edge of the nest when they stood for feeding. The male
                        bird flew into the tree. He alighted on the <pb id="VAA2374-181" n="168"/>
                        branch just above the lower edge of the nest, bringing his full breast and
                        underparts, the underpart of his tail and under tip of his wings into view.
                        The butt of one shoulder and full line of one wing appeared in the picture.
                        His head was turned at such an angle that his upper and lower mandible were
                        clearly cut; his eye shone like a bead of light; while his bill closed on a
                        small, wiry worm, extending beyond it perhaps an inch on one side, and an
                        inch and a half on the other. This picture I regard as very beautiful as
                        well as rare.</p>
                    <p>Another of my favourites is a reproduction of a brooding cuckoo. Mr. Black
                        had trained the bird with a soap box and coat by pretending to take her
                        picture until she was so tame that after a few efforts with her, I was able
                        to walk my camera to a focus that brought the lens within six feet of her,
                        as she entered or left her nest. I cut my way to her through a thicket at
                        such an angle that I pictured her broadside, including a full sweep of her
                        back from the curve of her beak to the utmost tip of her long, graceful
                        tail, in her eyes the calm, meditative, reasonable expression that always
                        rests on the face of a cuckoo under natural conditions. I achieved the
                        triumph of stroking this bird&apos;s wing without driving her from her
                        nest, after having made her picture. Then I urged her by a slight push on
                        her wing, to leave the nest that I might reproduce her eggs. I was very
                        sorry the instant she went, because a nestling was just <pb id="VAA2374-182"
                            n="169"/> struggling through the shell, which explained her conduct. I
                        had approached her at the psychological moment when the brooding fever bound
                        her in its strongest hold. Hastily gathering up my camera and other
                        paraphernalia, I hurriedly slipped away, but remained where I could see the
                        nest, to which she returned almost at once, so no real damage was done.</p>
                    <p>One picture that I especially prize in my field work is that of a king rail
                        turning and tucking an egg from sight among the feathers of her breast. In
                        order to secure studies of this bird, it was necessary to don waist-waders
                        and enter a swamp, where I stood much above knee-deep in muck and water
                        while I established sufficient intimacy with her to allow me to open the
                        grass of her nest wide enough for an exposure from beak to tail. I have
                        several pictures of her in which she appears to be very placidly brooding
                        without the least fear; but the first time I approached her to open her
                        nest, with her long sharp beak she peppered my bare arms, where I had rolled
                        my sleeves to my elbows to keep them dry while cutting grass under water,
                        until she broke the skin to bleeding in more than a dozen places on each
                        arm.</p>
                    <p>I highly prize the picture of a barn owl with her back toward the camera, and
                        her head turned over her shoulder looking toward the lens, as she entered
                        her nest.</p>
                    <p>Another prime favourite of mine is a study of a <pb id="VAA2374-183" n="170"
                        /> brooding male indigo finch, showing an injury to one of his eyes,
                        undoubtedly received during a former nesting period in a thorn bush.</p>
                    <p>A picture I greatly appreciate is of a male goldfinch feeding his young. This
                        was the first goldfinch nest I ever found that I could work on with comfort
                        from the ground. The four youngsters filled it almost to overflowing, and
                        from its location at the base of a levee beside the river, I had light on it
                        for only a part of the forenoon. At this nest I secured a picture of the
                        male bird clinging to the largest branch, from the intersection which held
                        the structure, his side toward the camera so that the picture showed his
                        folded wing and tail, one foot, his head, his eyes, and parted beak sharply
                        cut, holding a morsel of food, white in colour, which he was in the act of
                        regurgitating to drop into one of the four open, upturned beaks in the
                        cradle. This nest also showed the rain of excrement dropped over its edges
                        by the young, for goldfinches are among the birds that do not pay any
                        attention to this feature of parenthood.</p>
                    <p>In another location I once made a good reproduction of a brooding mother
                        goldfinch standing on the edge of her nest turning her eggs before she
                        entered it to brood. In all my field work I have secured such a study but
                        twice.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to the question of temperament, I have many pictures of
                        different kinds of hawks <pb id="VAA2374-184" n="171"/> and a number of
                        other birds which portray a look of calm and intelligence that is very
                        wonderful to me. Chief among these stands a picture of a pair of dusky
                        falcons, which I used in the illustration of &quot;Birds of the
                        Bible.&quot; There is also a hawk picture with a very wonderful
                        expression of power and calm on the face of the bird, among the
                        illustrations of that book.</p>
                    <p>At other times I have pictured anger very plainly to be discerned in a bird,
                        which was really exhibiting anger over being disturbed at a feast of some
                        fresh meat that I had wired to a limb on which I had focused a camera near
                        its nesting place. There never was any trouble in getting all the pictures
                        of greed I wanted on the faces of feeding birds, the vulture especially.</p>
                    <p>A few times I have pictured fear to such an extent that the bird&apos;s
                        eyes seemed fairly to pop from its head. I have many pictures of birds
                        either singing or uttering their tribal calls or cries of warning. I regard
                        any picture which truly portrays a definite characteristic of any species on
                        the face of a bird as very rare and interesting. I never gave my nesting
                        birds any occasion to exhibit anger near their nest, nor was a nest on which
                        I had a focus ever attacked by any other bird in such a way that I could
                        reproduce the feeling of the owners. I have no study of a parent bird when
                        it flies like a little fury to defend its brood, and none of a bird of
                        either sex in mourning. <pb id="VAA2374-185" n="172"/> The dissected eye of
                        a bird shows lachrymal glands, so it may weep real tears at the loss of a
                        mate or nestling. I never have been close enough to make sure of that.</p>
                    <p>Once from a blind, I saw a male bird come as close to laughter as a bird ever
                        approaches outside the bubbly joy of song. My camera was focused on the nest
                        of a pair of chewinks. I was hidden sixty feet away. The male came within a
                        yard of me, food hunting, scratching like an industrious hen. A small
                        rootlet was in his way and he pulled it with all his might. It broke
                        suddenly and he fell over backward. He picked himself up, a most astonished
                        expression on his face; then he laughed. So did I.</p>
                    <p>From a natural history standpoint, one picture of a young black vulture, made
                        just before it learned to straighten its legs at the first joint and stand
                        on its feet, contains more natural history than any other bird study I have
                        so far succeeded in securing. This one picture shows how the young of these
                        birds use the whole length of the first joint from the foot to the knee in
                        walking. The feet are set flat upon the ground so that the partial webbing,
                        the lining of the skin, and the size and sharpness of the toenails are
                        clearly defined as is the immature wing. The bird is posed three quarters
                        front toward the camera. The carrion sack plainly shows on the front of the
                        breast in a flaccid pouch, while the bald round head is turned <pb

                        appearance of the cheeks, the rounded point of the lower mandible, the sharp
                        overlapping hook of the upper; while his mouth is open to such an extent
                        that the length, breadth, and peculiarly humanlike shape of the tongue are
                        fully reproduced. I can not conceive how it would be possible to crowd more
                        natural history into the likeness of one bird.</p>
                    <p>Because the robins were my father&apos;s favourite birds, and because
                        they have such particularly charming dispositions and are so numerous and
                        friendly, through all of my work I have been intrigued into making numbers
                        of pictures of them. This was especially true in the Cabin, south, because
                        it was surrounded by fruit trees and flowering shrubs and covered with vines
                        of half a dozen different kinds. One robin picture I regard as particularly
                        rare, because the exposure was made from my library table through heavy
                        plate glass on the twenty-seventh of February. Counting on my protection and
                        care, for several years this robin had been around the Cabin from one to two
                        weeks earlier than any other bird of his kind could be seen or heard
                        anywhere in the country. This year he outdid himself by appearing in
                        February. The day the picture was taken the snow was six <pb
                            id="VAA2374-188" n="175"/> inches deep over the earth. The bird
                        repeatedly flew to the back of an oak bench on the veranda, and with his
                        feathers fluffed until he appeared twice the size of an ordinary robin he
                        sat a long time looking into the housesat so long, in fact, that I was able
                        to make several time exposures of him.</p>
                    <p>Another robin picture which is unique is that of a male bird from a nest
                        built in the parting of four quite large branches of a mulberry tree at the
                        same Cabin. Thoughtlessly, to see how much they would use, I had provided
                        these birds with torn strips of white cotton, over which they chattered and
                        which they gathered so greedily that they advertised their nest to all
                        creation. I had a ladder set up on a level with the nest a few yards away
                        and had been making a very complete series of the home life of these birds.
                        I noticed that both the male and female had the habit when they came to the
                        nest with a beak full of worms for their young of feeding them in what might
                        be considered turns, beginning with one and taking the four in order.
                        Sometimes the food would all be gone before the fourth one got a bite. He
                        would be so disappointed that he would stand in the nest, his beak wide
                        open, and cry and beg so pitifully that both of the old birds sometimes
                        resorted to the subterfuge of <hi rend="i">pretending to feed a
                        youngster,</hi> when they had nothing to give. They would stretch to full
                        height, draw up the neck, <pb id="VAA2374-189" n="176"/>

                        the youngster, which quieted him, although I am sure he got no food. I tried
                        a number of times and finally succeeded in getting a picture of the male
                        bird in this position, when one of his nestlings was begging with particular
                        insistence to be fed. I captioned this picture: &quot;When Father Robin
                        Regurgitates&quot; without fully explaining the situation. I supposed
                        that the picture would speak for itself, that everyone was familiar with the
                        feeding habit of these very common birds, for they can be seen carrying
                        beakfuls of worms from early spring to midsummer more frequently than any
                        other of the birds of our country, at least in the northeastern United
                        States. I understand that this picture has been questioned. Both the picture
                        and its title are perfectly good natural history as they stand, as to
                        feeding. It is quite true that robins carry worms in the beak to feed their
                        young. It is equally true that they peck a long time at ripe fruit, which
                        they swallow, and collect several ripe berries. These they regurgitate. They
                        also make the pretense described above, while they regurgitate in yet
                        another instance. After feeding the young, they empty the cloaca, swallowing
                        the contents as they relieve each bird, and then on wing as they fly from
                        the nest, I have seen them open their beaks and eject a stream half a yard
                        in length.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-192" n="179"/>
                    <p>Another picture which I prize highly is that of a male kingfisher, whose
                        long, heavy beak from base to tip is scarred and worn into tiny pits from
                        contact with the gravel and small stones in the clay backwall of a gravel
                        pit, in which he made his tunnel. I have always greatly appreciated an
                        opportunity I had to secure a picture of a pair of young of this nest, when
                        they were almost fullgrown, fully feathered, and debating the question of
                        taking wing, both of them sitting side by side in the door of their tunnel,
                        wanting to go, yet afraid to spread their wings and launch themselves into
                        the big world.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">I</hi> AM particularly partial to a pair of wren pictures I
                        have secured. At the time one of these was made an article had been
                        published by a man had managed to set his name very high and whose word in
                        ornithology carried weight with the people. He wrote concerning song birds
                        that they delivered their songs with distended throats and beaks closed. I
                        had only begun publishing and had small background before the public to
                        sustain my word on any subject, but it appealed to me that if I could
                        picture a number of birds in full tide of song I certainly could prove to
                        the public that it was no more nearly possible for a bird to sing a loud,
                        full note with its beak closed than it would be for a human being with
                        closed lips; so with each nest worked upon I bent every effort toward
                        securing a study of a male bird singing or the female uttering her tribal
                        call. In the case of birds with long beaks, the width to which the points
                        part is both surprising and amusing. I secured an excellent study one
                        evening of a male wren that stopped on a little platform before his door and
                        delivered himself of <pb id="VAA2374-195" n="182"/> a long, effusive,
                        bubbling song, before he went back to the business of catching small
                        insectsnot such small ones eitherto feed his large family. After I began
                        working especially for them, I soon had pictures of crows and jays calling,
                        several singing cardinals, and enough other birds to convince anyone that
                        birds sing with parted beaks.</p>
                    <p>Another good wren picture was made at a sixfoot focus on this same platform,
                        as the male wren emerged from his house, his beak widely parted on a globule
                        from the cloaca of one of his young.</p>
                    <p>Another picture I always have regarded as rare was one I secured from the
                        shelter of an old saw-mill on the shore of Burt Lake, where it narrows to
                        the Indian River, on what is known in northern Michigan as the
                        &quot;Inland Route.&quot; The water of the shoreline was excellent
                        feeding ground for every kind of aquatic bird of the locality, while the
                        shelter of the mill afforded an unusual opportunity for work at close range.
                        I had my camera focused on a blue heron, standing motionless, as he searched
                        the surrounding water assiduously for small fish, frogs, or any living thing
                        he might fancy for food. I had watched him so long that I had grown slightly
                        careless. The movements, with which his beak shot down, then up, then the
                        toss he gave the frog so that he caught it headfirst were so nearly
                        instantaneous that I missed the rarest picture which might have been secured
                        of him. The snap I got shows the frog at length in the <pb id="VAA2374-196"
                            n="183"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2374-36">

                        <pb id="VAA2374-197" n="184"/> course of slipping down the bird&apos;s
                        long oesophagus, and while it is not the prize I might have had, I still
                        regard it as rare, a true case of &quot;a frog in the throat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>I have previously mentioned securing the likeness of a male kingbird, which
                        seems to me almost, if not quite, my greatest triumph in bird portraiture
                        from both scientific and artistic standpoints. The birds of this nest were
                        so very confiding and their location was such that I could work around it
                        with great ease and no inconvenience whatever to the birds. Among a series
                        of two or three dozen exposures made of these birds, there was one in which
                        the nest was sharply defined; each of the heads of the four nestlings was
                        well outlined. The mother bird perched with her breast at about a three
                        quarters angle toward the camera. The exposure was made just at the instant
                        when she was regurgitating food for her young. The cutting of her beak, her
                        eyes, her crest, and the entire detail of the picture were so fine that for
                        scientific and artistic reasons, I regard it as very good indeed.</p>
                    <p>Twice in my life I have succeeded in photographing a brooding dove. One of
                        these pictures was made of a bird nesting on some dbris that floods had
                        heaped on the river bank. I approached the dove by degrees with extreme
                        caution and succeeded in setting up my camera and taking a picture of her
                        the very first time I visited her nest. It was not a good picture. The
                        bird&apos;s back was <pb id="VAA2374-198" n="185"/> turned directly
                        toward the lens and there were pieces of board and sticks that stuck up in
                        the foreground so that they were out of focus. I worked with the lens
                        between the spacings of a wire fence. The only way to remove the
                        obstructions was to climb the fence and approach to within two or three feet
                        of the bird. I did not feel that she would endure this on first
                        acquaintance, so I made a preliminary exposure too late in the afternoon for
                        a really good picture and went away congratulating myself upon what
                        interesting work I should do in the morning. When morning came I found that
                        the bird had been bound to her nest the afternoon before by the appearance
                        of one or both of her young. As they were safely delivered from the shells
                        and she had brooded over them all night and possibly fed them several times
                        before my arrival, the spell was so broken that she went tearing from her
                        nest like a mad creature while I was still several rods away. On my return
                        from this nest, I had an encounter with a cross mare nervous over a colt
                        barely able to walk. This was one of my most threatening and dangerous
                        experiences afield.</p>
                    <p>In an orchard adjoining the meadow stood a decayed old apple tree having a
                        flat piece of weather-beaten apple wood, which boys had undoubtedly thrown
                        among the branches to knock down fruit, lodged on a low limb. The piece was
                        wedged at one end between two branches, lay <pb id="VAA2374-199" n="186"/>
                        straight on a horizontal limb, the other end fitted against a good-sized
                        twig. The concave side was up. On one end of this insecure platform, the
                        doves had heaped a few coarse sticks and twigs for a nest, in which the
                        mother bird was now brooding. The nest was so low that I could locate it on
                        my finder by extending my tallest tripod full length and standing on a box
                        about eighteen inches high to operate the camera. I secured of this bird my
                        only pictures of a brooding dove, with the exception of the mediocre one
                        just described. This bird brooded sidewise to the lens so that the line from
                        the tip of her beak to the tip of her tail was unbroken. I began several
                        rods away, but she soon told me that I <hi rend="i">could</hi> come into her
                        location, set up my camera, take her picture, and go away. I <hi rend="i"
                            >could not</hi> move the camera a few feet closer by walking it forward
                        on the tripod legs, as I constantly did with other birds. <hi rend="i">She
                            would not endure having the camera move one inch toward her.</hi> As
                        each approach gave me a more beautiful picture of her, I kept working
                        closer, perhaps two or three feet at a time, but for every exposure, I was
                        forced to take down the camera and tripod, carry them away, and remain
                        awhile. Then, I could go back, approach the nest a few feet closer, and
                        repeat the performance. Doves are universally lauded for their gentle,
                        loving characteristics. They have a habit of searching the open roads for
                        grain dribbling from passing wagons and the undigested <pb id="VAA2374-200"
                            n="187"/> corn in horse and cattle droppings, of waiting to fly until
                        they are almost under passing wheels, settling a few seconds on fences, and
                        at once returning to the road. These proceedings lead people into believing
                        that doves are very tame and friendly. I never have worked around the nest
                        of a shyer, wilder bird than a brooding dove. A male dove I never have had
                        in range of a camera during all of my work afield, and only two different
                        females among many I have tried for. I finally secured a picture of this
                        orchard dove which filled a seven by nine plate, at slightly less than ten
                        feet; but in all of my experience afield, no bird has made me exercise more
                        patience or work harder than this bird, brooding in plain sight in an old
                        orchard.</p>
                    <p>Another picture, which I regard as rare for its artistic as well as its
                        scientific value, is one of a long pictorial reproduction of the history of
                        a cowbird that invaded the river bank in my territory. This bird laid her
                        first egg in the nest of a song sparrow, which the sparrow had just
                        completed, but in which she had not yet deposited her first egg. The sparrow
                        obviated the difficulty by carrying material and burying the cowbird egg,
                        building a new floor completely over it, and raising the walls slightly
                        higher. The next cowbird egg went into the nest of a vireo a few rods
                        farther down the bank. I made a picture of this nest, containing two vireo
                        eggs and one of the cowbird&apos;s. I was forced to remove one of the
                            <pb id="VAA2374-201" n="188"/> vireo eggs, because the cowbird had
                        broken it, when dropping her own in the nest, while she had eaten one to
                        make room for hers. Two more cowbird eggs were found in the nest of a black
                        masked warbler, about the same distance from the vireo nest that it had been
                        from the sparrow&apos;s. This nest we decided to leave untouched so that
                        we might make a record of what would happen there. I had supposed that these
                        four eggs would account for the cowbird&apos;s efforts in this
                        direction, but the following morning Mr. Black and I saw her leave a thicket
                        across the river and start down the bank in a perfect frenzy of exultation.
                        No hen of the barnyard ever cackled and fussed over her first egg as this
                        cowbird exulted over the successful placing of the last.</p>
                    <p>A picture which I regard as one of the most beautiful and rarest of my
                        experience afield was made when the cowbirds were old enough to leave the
                        nest of the warbler. The nest was built in a scraggy, little wild plum bush,
                        the structure of dainty architecture as is the custom with warblers. By the
                        time the cowbirds were ready to leave the nest, all of the warblers had been
                        starved and trampled to death save one. This was a hungry little creature
                        that from continuous fasting had put all its strength in feathers. I never
                        have seen a young bird so curiously feathered; its plumage seemed to curl. I
                        have seen several young chickens that had eaten something that made <pb
                            id="VAA2374-202" n="189"/> them sick, develop an abnormal amount of
                        curly feathers afterward. The warbler&apos;s eyes were drawn into its
                        head, its beak pale, and its feet scarcely had the strength to hold it; its
                        body seemed a little pinch of bone with no flesh on it, but feathers enough
                        for two young birds. Each of the cowbirds was easily three times the
                        warbler&apos;s size, and five times its weight, both of them having
                        crops so distended with food that it seemed as if they would burst, for they
                        stood in the nest obscuring the young warbler, and with beaks wide open
                        vociferously called for food all day long. The old warblers flew around
                        frantically trying to still their hunger cries. As I reproduced this picture
                        the first cowbird to abandon the nest was left where he placed himself; I
                        helped the baby warbler to a position above, halfway between him and the
                        nest; and the other cowbird remained in the nest during the exposure. Being
                        sure that I had a good exposure on this rare and unusual spectacle, the
                        young warbler was left in full possession of its home, where it is to be
                        hoped that it finally succeeded in getting a full crop.</p>
                    <p>Among the pictures of birds uttering their cries or singing, I once secured
                        one of a male jay near his nest, when he was crying: &quot;Ge-rullup,
                        ge-rullup, ge-rullup!&quot; This bird&apos;s back was toward the
                        camera so that the markings of his shoulders, wings, and tail showed very
                        plainly. The back of his head and his crest were well defined; his <pb
                            id="VAA2374-203" n="190"/> position brought his left eye in outline;
                        while between his open mandibles the <hi rend="i">position of his
                        tongue</hi> in uttering his cry could be seen.</p>
                    <p>Two other jay pictures which I prize very highly for sentimental reasons are
                        a pair of studies of a mother bird more closely paralleling human processes
                        than any other bird picture which it has been my lot to secure or to see
                        among the pictures of other field workers. I had a clear view of this nest.
                        The bird was unusually beautiful. She persisted in brooding, with a calm and
                        tranquil expression, even when the camera approached her to within less than
                        ten feet. While I watched her from a blind at the end of sixty feet of hose
                        one day, one of her young thrust its bare little head between the feathers
                        of her breast, resting its chin on the edge of the nest; and in this
                        position it went to sleep and so remained for some timelong enough at least
                        that I had made the exposure, changed the plates, and returned to my
                        position, before it lifted its head, opened its beak, and asked to be fed.
                        This position I also secured.</p>
                    <p>Another favourite study of mine is almost a perfect likeness of five young
                        shrikes. I can not claim that there is anything particularly rare from a
                        scientific standpoint in a study of young birds, which have been handled,
                        taken from and returned to their nest until they will allow themselves to be
                        placed in any position; but certainly, rarely beautiful pictures with
                        wonderful art value may <pb id="VAA2374-204" n="191"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2374-205" n="192"/> be obtained in this way. These proceedings
                        result in no harm whatever to the birds as I never have failed to return to
                        a nest, and have it remain, any young bird that I handled for pictorial
                        purposes. I was particularly happy in the selection of a perch for these
                        young birds, for just at the time it was needed I was able to find a maple
                        branch having two nearly parallel limbs small enough for the young birds to
                        perch upon without an appearance of discomfort or awkwardness. I made
                        several studies of them before returning them to their nest and their
                        parents. In the best of these the oldest and youngest nestlings were placed
                        for contrast upon the top limb, the oldest one in a cleancut profile, the
                        baby face front. On the limb below were the three intermediate birds, the
                        one to the left breast front with his head turned so that his beak is in
                        profile, the middle one with his back toward the lens, his head sufficiently
                        turned to give a good view of the beak and eye, and the one on the right
                        perched in profile giving a different view of his head, beak, and eye. The
                        limbs were covered with lichens, which so harmonized with the feathering of
                        the young birds that it made of them almost perfect examples of protective
                        colouration. Added to all of the care used in posing these birds, it must be
                        noted that all birdland does not contain nestlings surpassing them in beauty
                        or interest. In family, they are near enough the hawk tribe to have big,
                        liquid eyes, curved beaks, <pb id="VAA2374-206" n="193"/> and the appearance
                        of wisdom and poise, while their soft feathering is so spineless that it is
                        like down of a dim grey colour, faintly peppered with darker touches almost
                        invisible, the wing and tail feathers at their first appearance being
                        sharply touched with patches of black and white.</p>
                    <p>While on the subject of young birds, which I have reproduced by the hundreds,
                        there come to my mind preminently half a dozen pictures of a pair of young
                        kingfishers which I had taken from their nest, handled, and returned so
                        often that they would remain in any position in which I placed them. Two
                        pictures of these young ones are particularly good. To these I might add the
                        likeness of a pair of young cuckoos, which never fail to bring a cry of
                        delight to the lips of anyone to whom I show them. I have also one study of
                        a pair of young cardinals, male and female, which is conspicuous among
                        dozens of the kind.</p>
                    <p>From a perching hummingbird on a la France rose I secured an unusual study of
                        this bird of humming, tireless wing; while quail once gave me an excellent
                        example of protective colouration, as have killdeers, larks, and bitterns in
                        the Wabash River. I have no brooding study of which I am prouder than that
                        of a hen lark, which entered her nest, after I had opened it slightly wider
                        than she had designed it, and before a hidden lens settled herself to
                        brooding at an angle which gave a long sweep from tip to tail, her head and
                        eyes beautifully <pb id="VAA2374-207" n="194"/> outlined, her head and back
                        colouring almost indistinguishable from her nest. A careless observer might
                        have looked straight at her and never seen either the bird or her nest. Her
                        position in brooding hid her neck and breast decorations. Among my rare
                        robin studies I should have mentioned one of a mother bird standing her
                        feathers on end, just as she stepped into her nest to hover her brood, so
                        that the young might lay their heads against the warmth of her bare breast.
                        This study is the only one of its kind I have secured or have seen.</p>
                    <p>I always have-been particularly pleased over the picture of a hen calling a
                        flock of fluffy little chickens, twenty in number, to the shelter of her
                        wings, a study for which I worked long and hard to illustrate the Biblical
                        passage: &quot;like as a hen gathereth her chickens.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After much experience with pigeons in cotes extending the length of an old
                        barn on a back lot at Limberlost Cabin, south, I succeeded in securing only
                        one picture of a male kissing his mate.</p>
                    <p>I always shall regard the pictures of the drunken waxwing, discussed in a
                        previous chapter, as extremely unique and of much interest.</p>
                    <p>Among studies of birds uttering their tribal calls, I have one very fine and
                        characteristic crow picture, and I also have a unique study of a crow
                        stealing a lens. I secured this by placing the lens with its shining brass
                        rim in a conspicuous place <pb id="VAA2374-208" n="195"/> on a log, focusing
                        and covering a set camera, and hiding in a blind at a distance until the
                        bird was tempted, as I hoped it would be, to pick up the lens. Almost
                        simultaneously I was forced to hurl a stick at the bird in order to make it
                        drop the lens, which was a fine rectilinear nearly two inches in diameter.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">I</hi>N STUDYING the birds in their native haunts it is the
                        greatest help imaginable to know their language and to be able to recognize
                        their voices. The first thing to learn is the tribal call of each species,
                        that note which in its most frequent utterance on the part of the female is
                        the simple question: &quot;Where?&quot; and on the part of the male
                        the reply: &quot;Here.&quot; This question is repeatedly asked and
                        answered by all birds, even before and after the brooding season, when they
                        are pleasuring or food hunting through the-fields and forests. It is the
                        out-cropping of the love of company, a feeling ingrained in the hearts of
                        birds and beasts, as of men. It is a direct result of the dread of being
                        alone, a love of friends, a wish to know if kindred are near. So at this
                        quick, inquiring call, usually of one note, wren answers wren, robin calls
                        to robin, jay replies to jay.</p>
                    <p>After courting is over and a pair is nest building, this call comes with
                        greater frequency, since the strongest tie existing between birds has just
                        been formed, they being paired in some instances for several matings,
                        frequently for life. During incubation <pb id="VAA2374-211" n="198"/> it is
                        scarcely heard from the female except in time of alarm, as its utterance
                        would attract attention to the nest location. When the young are hatched and
                        both the elders are busy gathering food a period of greatest anxiety ensues,
                        and the call and answer pass between the parents with almost clock-like
                        regularity. This serves the double purpose of letting the pair know of the
                        safety of each other and the young that they have not been deserted.</p>
                    <p>In no case in my experience with the birds have I ever heard this call given
                        with such frequency and precision as by a pair of chewinks. For two days
                        before the young left the nest, my camera was focused on their location. The
                        old birds went before it from the first, without the slightest hesitation.
                        There was a long hose attached; I was hidden in a near-by thicket. As a
                        protection from swarms of mosquitoes, I covered myself with a long
                        cravenette, matching the shade of the dead leaves under foot, so that it
                        concealed me entirely and fitted into the surroundings perfectly. Those
                        birds hunted altogether on the ground; their use of the tribal call was
                        regular and frequent. Four and five times to the minute, by my watch, came
                        the question of the female: &quot;Che-wink?&quot; and the immediate
                        answer of the male: &quot;Che-wee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>If for any reason the male was slow in answering, a change could be detected
                        instantly in the tone of the female. Her call was a degree sharper, <pb
                            id="VAA2374-212" n="199"/> tinctured with a faint hint of anxiety. If
                        the male still failed to answer, she immediately flew to the region of the
                        nest and called again, this time a call so filled with anxiety and
                        excitement that it constituted an alarm cry. So they talked every minute of
                        the time I worked around them. The case is similar with almost any bird of
                        bubbling song of which I can think. Brown thrashers and cuckoos are quieter.</p>
                    <p>With most sparrows and finches, the call is, &quot;Chip,&quot; with
                        cardinals the male calls, &quot;Chip&quot; and the female frequently
                        answers, &quot;Chook.&quot; The male robin calls,
                        &quot;Kip,&quot; and the female answers, &quot;Cut.&quot;
                        Both quail use the same call, &quot;Chet.&quot; With doves the call
                        and answer are &quot;Coo.&quot; Wood thrushes call,
                        &quot;Pit,&quot; and wood-peckers, &quot;Kerr.&quot; Crows
                        call, &quot;Caw;&quot; king rails, &quot;Gyck;&quot; and
                        shitepokes, &quot;Couk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Some birds utter an elliptical call that can be expressed only by the use of
                        an apostrophe. Blue jays have the same call and answer,
                        &quot;D&apos;jay;&quot; kingbirds,
                        &quot;T&apos;sheup;&quot; blackbirds,
                        &quot;T&apos;check;&quot; skylarks,
                        &quot;Z&apos;sst.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With a large class, the call has two clearly defined syllables. Blue herons
                        call, &quot;Ker-awk.&quot; Both catbirds call,
                        &quot;Me-ow,&quot; and often, &quot;Ma-a-ry! Ma-a-ry!&quot;
                        Killdeers say, &quot;Te-dit,&quot; and bluebirds call,
                        &quot;Su-gar.&quot; These tribal calls are used ordinarily as a
                        method of ascertaining the location of a pair, and to assure each other that
                        all is well.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-213" n="200"/>
                    <p>The danger signal is nothing more than the tribal call repeated in a <hi
                            rend="i">quicker</hi> time, touched with <hi rend="i">anxiety</hi> and
                            <hi rend="i">raised</hi> in tone. If the danger is great and immediate
                        these tones are intensified and the call almost invariably repeated, three
                        times, at least among small birds. In case their nest is invaded or they are
                        taken rudely in hand they utter a shrill, prolonged scream and defend
                        themselves by scratching and picking when possible. Among big birds like the
                        blue heron the cry is simply prolonged and rasping in proportion to the size
                        of the bird. A heron can be heard nearly a mile on land and farther across
                        water.</p>
                    <p>About the business of living, a hawk utters a high, weird cry, but in case of
                        actual battle all members of the family, whenever possible, lie on the back
                        and present a formidable array of claws and beak, hissing, as is the habit
                        of an angry gander.</p>
                    <p>Owls are extremely noisy in their first hunting after much early winter
                        sleeping. Ours become active the latter part of January unless the cold is
                        extreme. Until the females begin brooding the great horned owls of the
                        Cabin, north, hunt in pairs, crying regularly to each other. Either of the
                        pair selects a favourable shelter for small birds and with spread wings
                        flies into it with full force, crying: &quot;Wack, wack, wack!&quot;
                        in guttural tones. In case prey is flushed, the pair joins forces, both
                        crying excitedly and both sinking their claws into the same bird, rabbit, or
                        groundhog. Often <pb id="VAA2374-214" n="201"/> they carry prey to the roof
                        of the Cabin and pitiful screams of a rabbit are added to the
                        birds&apos; excited pandemonium. The still higher, prolonged, wildcat or
                        panther scream of the great horned owl is infrequent, uttered, many think,
                        to scare up prey or to paralyze with fright some creature that has been
                        sighted, but I am not sure. This would seem to be the reasonable explanation
                        of it, but every time I have heard it the scream was uttered from high
                        locations and in such a manner that I thought its most probable intent was
                        to breed fear in the forest, to say to all living things that a frightful
                        creature was abroad; therefore it would be highly proper to quake and
                        tremble. I really think this owl scream is uttered with the same intent as
                        the challenging roar of a full-fed lion, secure in his strength, out seeking
                        trouble. I interpret it: &quot;I am here in my might! Come on, if you
                        dare!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Danger signals are always heeded by the birds, in no case of the wild more
                        intuitively than by barnyard fowl, which use a prolonged scream. When a
                        little girl, I peeped with breathless interest over my mother&apos;s
                        shoulder while she removed newly hatched chickens from under a brooding hen
                        in the fear that the hen would think all of her family had emerged and leave
                        her nest too soon. As my mother lifted the hen to see if she had found all
                        of the chickens, a tiny, triangular piece of shell flew up on an egg.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There!&quot; said Mother, &quot;that is the beginning. <pb
                            id="VAA2374-215" n="202"/> The little chicken has broken the shell with
                        its bill; now it will soon be out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Mother!&quot; I begged, &quot;do please let me take it.
                        Let me hold it in my hand when it comes out!&quot; My mother picked up
                        the egg, laid it in my hand, while I stood with my back to the wind,
                        carefully cupping my other hand over the shell, issuing a series of
                        bulletins: &quot;There goes another big piece!&quot;
                        &quot;It&apos;s struggling hard now!&quot; &quot;There goes
                        an awful big piece!&quot; &quot;It will be out in a
                        minute!&quot; Near us an old rooster uttered that prolonged scream which
                        means: &quot;Hawk coming! Hide for your lives!&quot; that danger
                        signal which sends every hen in the barnyard to cover with her brood. Turkey
                        hens crouch in the tall grass, sometimes even gobblers hide, while guineas
                        dart under the fences. As a rule turkey gobblers and ganders stand on
                        defense, ready to fight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That settles it!&quot; exclaimed my mother, carefully replacing
                        the egg. &quot;That chicken will not move again for half an hour, and I
                        can not possibly spare that much time.&quot; When I read in the writings
                        of Darwin that an unhatched chicken that had neither breathed nor seen light
                        would lie dormant for a long period, at the danger signal of a cock, I
                        instantly remembered this experience of my childhood, and wondered where my
                        mother learned it; yet, things like this which my parents taught me always
                        have proved true afield.</p>
                    <p>The tribal call once repeated, raised, and intensified <pb id="VAA2374-216"
                            n="203"/> to a scream of rage, is the battle cry of the birds, and comes
                        when they attack a rival, a crow around a nest, a cat, a squirrel, or a
                        human being.</p>
                    <p>The same cry, in greater agony and prolonged, comes when a bird is wounded,
                        caught in a trap or by a cat, or when its young are being taken from the
                        nest by strangers. This cry is commonly described as a
                        &quot;squall&quot; or &quot;squawk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A large number of songbirds have one song of greater or less length, which is
                        sung in differing ways in different circumstances. Of course, the imitators
                        such as catbirds, brown thrashers, and mocking birds change their song in
                        imitation of whatever sounds they hear while singing or remember from former
                        songs. But most of the others sing a succession of notes in individual ways,
                        while some improvise as they sing, like the bobolink.</p>
                    <p>In the early spring, after the disbanding of families for the season, and
                        through the winter, the song of the birds is one of joyful abandon. When
                        they are full-fed, free, content, the music bubbles from their throats in a
                        swelling chorus. Sometimes they sing their notes at the highest pitch they
                        can reach, then in middle tone, and then with scarcely parted beak they
                        warble them over in a greatly distended throat, diminishing to a mere
                        whisper of sound, which they sometimes continue for the full length of their
                        strain. The black-headed grosbeak is probably master of this art, but in
                        much experience in study of the songs <pb id="VAA2374-217" n="204"/> male
                        birds sing, while I am hidden with a camera near the mate to which they
                        sing, I have learned that this is much more common among birds than is
                        generally known. Almost all of them sing whisper songs that must be for
                        their own pleasure.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes bird song is trailed over the fields, beside the river, and through
                        the woods, interspersed with snatches of food and playful darts after other
                        birds. But when really singing and enjoying their own performance, the beak
                        is pointed upward to a greater or less degreegreater among very small
                        birdsthe throat swells, the feathers of the breast and back ruffle over the
                        wings so that the impression is formed that the wings are pressed tightly to
                        the sides; the tail is folded and bends under the body slightly, and the
                        beak parts narrowly in some species, widely in others.</p>
                    <p>The song of all songs is the passion song. In this the males make their
                        supreme effort. It begins when the mating fever attacks them, intensifies in
                        pursuit of a mate, and reaches the acme, the fullest force and expression,
                        immediately prior to the act of mating. The catbird then surpasses himself;
                        the wood thrush, hermit thrush, and brown thrasher outsing their sweetest
                        performances; the oriole flames in voice as in body; and the chewink is an
                        insistent and irresistible wooer. But I know of no other bird that in the
                        stress of mating fever, so swells, prolongs, and trills his notes, so
                        spreads and rocks himself, and displays his charms, as the <pb
                            id="VAA2374-218" n="205"/> cardinal grosbeak. With feathers upstanding
                        on breast and back until his wings are almost obscured, with swollen throat,
                        crest flared to the utmost, and parted beak, he begins; and as he approaches
                        and reaches the greatest degree of intensity, he sways, his wings half
                        lifted and half spread, and whistles and trills and tumbles out his notes in
                        a frenzy. Although not generally conceded, it is a fact that nearly every
                        female sings a number of times a day, during courtship and feeding, never
                        when brooding, except the merest whisper. These songs suggest the notes of
                        the male, but they are low, hesitating, uttered in such a way that they do
                        not compare favourably with the efforts of the master musician.</p>
                    <p>When you see a bird about the daily business of life, suddenly stop, plaster
                        its feathers to its body, and its eyes snap and pop, it is so paralyzed with
                        fear that until it has a second in which to recover it can not decide in
                        which direction to fly. And very frequently birds save their lives when
                        overtaken by imminent danger by flattening their feathers, remaining where
                        they are, and trusting to protective colouring to hide them.</p>
                    <p>When a bird flares its crest, or lacking a crest raises its crown feathers,
                        lifts its wings from its body, leans forward, and peers from side to side,
                        it is inquisitive, not really frightened; but it has discovered something
                        sufficiently out of the ordinary to awaken its interest. In such case, if
                        nothing happens to cause it to take flight, it usually begins <pb
                            id="VAA2374-219" n="206"/> talking and soon calls up all the feathered
                        folk within hearing to help decide what interests it. Frequently in case of
                        flight the bird reconsiders and cautiously approaches at times very near the
                        object which first alarmed it. Some birds are much more curious than others.
                        A wren or a vireo among small birds, or a catbird or a jay among larger
                        ones, can assemble the whole wood to investigate a camera, which, until
                        their attention was called to it, the other birds were passing with
                        indifference. My father used to say that more wild turkeys fell victim to
                        their own curiosity than to the snares and traps of men. Wild and domestic
                        animals have a manifest propensity to run from an object that frightens them
                        at first sight, then reconsider, return to investigate, and frequently the
                        wild animals, through curiosity, enter a trap from which the first impulse
                        was to run.</p>
                    <p>Once as I lay tired out in the bottom of a boat on the Wabash, a tiny
                        red-eyed vireo came peeking and peering, softly repeating to himself:
                        &quot;Du, du, du!&quot; Nothing happened, so he ventured closer,
                        until he was on a twig not a yard from my face. &quot;Peai?&quot; he
                        began asking. &quot;Peai?&quot; No response or motion was made, so
                        he ventured even nearer, raised his voice, and bravely screamed,
                        &quot;Tishvon! Tishvoo!&quot; at me, until he awakened the woods.
                        The birds of all kinds came flocking from all directions, and, following the
                        example of the vireo, drew close to investigate. I was having one of <pb
                            id="VAA2374-220" n="207"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2374-40">

                        lot of a field worker, when a drove of pigs came near, and to keep them from
                        becoming entangled in the hose attached to my best camera I was compelled to
                        move. The investigating committee hastily dispersed in every direction.</p>
                    <p>The expression of greed flashes instantaneously into the eyes of a crow,
                        hawk, or vulture when the <pb id="VAA2374-221" n="208"/> bird is discovered
                        at a feast particularly to its liking. Birds prove that they are greedy by
                        risking their lives to remain with food they are eating, by almost choking
                        themselves and at times their young by trying to force down bites too large
                        for their throats. Sometimes they raise the head high, twist, stretch, and
                        turn the neck to force down an especially large fragment.</p>
                    <p>Action, voice, and expression combine when birds are angry. Usually the
                        plumage is raised in the scream of anger, and then more swiftly contracts
                        with action, as they make the plunge which carries them to their foe.</p>
                    <p>Some of the larger birds, the eagle, hawk, and vulture, speak a plain
                        language of defiance. With sleek feathers and flashing eyes, they part their
                        beaks and utter a hiss which means: &quot;I will fight before you shall
                        touch my young.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Last of all, and hardest to learn, and with no way of understanding just how
                        or why it happens, you can study the language of intuition among the birds.
                        You can see that in some way you can not fathom, a whole flock, perching on
                        a tree, feeding on the ground, or drinking at the river, can become alarmed
                        as one bird, rise with one accord, and fly for their lives. Sometimes, by
                        careful watching, you can see a man coming with a gun, a snake crossing the
                        river, or a weasel slipping under a log; and sometimes, try as you may, you
                        can in no way discover the cause of alarm. It is the same <pb
                            id="VAA2374-222" n="209"/> impulse of fear that at times sets herds of
                        cattle and horses in motion, or drives a large body of men to panic.</p>
                    <p>Hunters and woodsmen depend greatly on the birds for news of the forest.
                        Sometimes a catbird or a jay discovers their presence and alarms their game;
                        but to repay that, the birds often tell men that game is approaching. A bird
                        especially disliked among duck hunters is the godwit. It is a regular alarm
                        clock, while other ducks heed its warnings every time, to the great disgust
                        of hunters hidden in blinds, or shooting over decoys.</p>
                    <p>By a careful study of bird calls, cries, and notes, any good imitator can
                        talk with more birds than one would imagine possible. I know a man who can
                        toll an oriole across an orchard, and another who can bring a lark across a
                        meadow. My husband taught my parrot a perfect &quot;Bob White&quot;
                        call. One day there was a knock at the door and when I opened it a man said:
                        &quot;There is a quail among your rose bushes. My wife is ill, and if
                        you don&apos;t mind I&apos;d like to get it mighty well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>I asked him to step inside, and showed him the &quot;quail&quot; he
                        wanted to shoot. He surely was surprised.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, my mouth is so very large and my tongue so contrary I can not
                        whistle, so my repertoire is very limited. I learned the screech owl call,
                        practising a poem. I tried it on an owl and got an answer. By accident I
                        learned that <pb id="VAA2374-223" n="210"/> I could call a goldfinch. I was
                        washing negatives in the kitchen sink. The back door was open. In the
                        backyard grew a forest of sunflowers for the parrot&apos;s winter food,
                        and over them the goldfinches hovered constantly. As I worked, I kept
                        repeating the goldfinch call to perfect myself in it.</p>
                    <p>I did my very best, and to my astonishment, from the yard came a male
                        goldfinch&apos;s answer, &quot;P&apos;tsee me?&quot;
                        Instantly I changed to the female cry, &quot;P&apos;tseet!&quot;
                        The goldfinch answered from the sweet pea rack. I hid behind the door, and
                        watched through the crack.</p>
                    <p>&quot;P&apos;tsee me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;P&apos;tseet!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The goldfinch was on the walk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;P&apos;tsee me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;P&apos;tseet!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The goldfinch was on the paper barrel beside the steps.</p>
                    <p>&quot;P&apos;tsee me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;P&apos;tseet!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The goldfinch was on the back porch.</p>
                    <p>&quot;P&apos;tsee me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;P&apos;tseet!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The goldfinch was at the screen door, hopping back and forth to find an
                        entrance, and had the door been open undoubtedly I could have called him
                        inside. Since then I talk with these birds whenever I choose, having ample
                        opportunity; for they are always with us from June until November.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-224" n="211"/>
                    <p>I learned the tribal call of the king rail in the hope of locating him in a
                        swamp, so that I could find and picture his young; but while I could win a
                        reply easily enough, I never could get near enough to secure anything save
                        an effect of snakes in the grass, as he darted among the rushes.</p>
                    <p>That I could speak shitepoke with sufficient fluency to get a reply, I also
                        learned by accident. I was driving east of the Cabin, south, with a helper,
                        over the levee which crosses the Valley of the Wood Robin, on a trip to the
                        old Aspy orchard. A shitepoke flew up south of us, crossed the road before
                        us, and perched in a scraggy, dead top limb of a big sycamore north of the
                        road.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is a shitepoke, isn&apos;t it?&quot; asked the lad.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is,&quot; I answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What does it say?&quot; questioned the boy, who was a lover of
                        birds and one of my most ardent helpers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Couk, couk, couk!&quot; I answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Couk, couk, couk!&quot; instantly replied the shitepoke.</p>
                    <p>In amazement, we stared at each other. He slackened the horse to a walk,
                        whispering: &quot;Call again!&quot;</p>
                    <p>I turned, stood on my knees on the seat, and, shielded by the raised carriage
                        top, cupped my hands around my mouth and did my best. The bird replied
                        immediately. I waited a second and called with greater caution, with accent
                        and inflection <pb id="VAA2374-225" n="212"/> nearer the bird&apos;s own
                        than before. Instantly the shitepoke gave a cry and spreading its wings flew
                        to the road, where it followed three rods in our direction before it
                        realized that the call was coming from the carriage. Since then I talk with
                        the shitepokes and call them across the valley whenever I choose.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing to prevent anyone from talking with those birds whose tribal
                        calls can be imitated with the voice, and a throaty or half-whispered nasal
                        utterance. A commotion can always be raised in the woods by hiding in a bird
                        neighbourhood and uttering a series of judiciously spaced and intoned
                        screech owl calls. A large number of birds will answer a call that can be
                        made by placing the lips on the back of the hand, and producing a sharp,
                        loud, indrawn, kissing sound inflected like a chirp. A perfect brown
                        thrasher alarm cry results, and a very good crested flycatcher&apos;s.
                        All thrushes are interested, and catbirds. Even the domestic canaries,
                        hatched and raised in the bird-house in my conservatory, will answer and
                        become much agitated over this call. Slight practice is all that is
                        required.</p>
                    <p>Anyone who is an expert whistler can soon combine vocal and whistled calls,
                        so that he can depend on a reply from almost any bird he attempts to
                        imitate. The instant he receives a response, comes the feeling that the bird
                        is his, and a closer tie than ever before existed is established. This <pb
                            id="VAA2374-226" n="213"/> possessive feeling comes only through
                        knowledge acquired by personal contact with the birds. The bird that you can
                        teach to bear your presence about its young arouses a warmer feeling than
                        you ever have had for any other of its kind, while the bird which will talk
                        with you is a friend indeed.</p>

                            ages,&apos; when the birds had emerged from the state of
                            monstrosity, each raw singer having chanted continuously his individual
                            tonic, there came a time when they must take a long step forward and
                            enter the world of song. In the vast multitude of feathered creatures
                            there must have been an endless variety of forms and sizes, and a
                            proportionate variety in the pitch and quality of their voices. Day to
                            day, year to year, each bird had heard his fellows squall, squawk,
                            screech, or scream their individual tones, till in due time he detected
                            here and there in the tremendous chorus certain tones that had a special
                            affinity for his own. This affinity, strengthened by endless
                            repetitions, at last made an exchange of tones natural and easy. Suppose
                            there were two leading performers the key of one being G, and the key of
                            the other being D, a fifth above G, what could have been more natural
                            than for these two voices to unite, either on D, or G, or both, and to
                            vibrate into one? This accomplished, the bondage of monotony and chaos
                            was broken forever, and progress assured; the first strain of the
                            marvellous harmony of the future was sounded, the song of the birds was
                            begun. One can almost hear those rude, rising geniuses exercising their
                            voices with increased fervor, vibrating from one to five and five to one
                            of the scalepushing on up the glad way of liberty and melody. With each
                            vibration from one to five and from five to one, the leading <pb
                                id="VAA2374-229" n="216"/> tone of the scale, the other member of
                            the common chord, which so affinitizes with one and five, was passed
                            over. The next step was to insert this tone, which being done, the
                            employment of the remaining tones was simply a matter of time. So it
                            was, to my notion, that the birds learned to sing.&quot;S<hi

                    <p>The song of some of the birds at its present state of evolution is such a
                        rolling jumble of sound that I never have heard any scientist or musician
                        attempt to translate it into our languageeven in the crudest form of
                        syllablesor to set it in notes on the musical staff. The best example of
                        this kind of music is that of the common house wren. He is an indefatigable
                        singer, yet no one has ever tried to syllabify or register his notes on the
                        staff, to my knowledge. I doubt gravely if anyone ever will. The wren is
                        such a rollicking, bubbling, little whiff of spontaneity, feathers, and
                        bones that his jumbled notes are hopeless of reproduction. He sings
                        constantly around nesting locations, aggressively during his courting
                        season, endlessly while at the joyous task of rearing his brood. He sings
                        while industriously searching fruit trees for slugs, bugs, and spiders; he
                        sings past a beak crammed full of worms and insects; he sings during heavy
                        downpours of rain; he sings in any location, under any condition, during the
                        entire time he remains with us. When he leaves his nesting location, having
                        his brood successfully reared, and goes to the seclusion of the woods to <pb

                        for the most part invisible, one still hears the notes of the wren; and this
                        is quite remarkable, for other song birds are almost voiceless when
                        moulting, sluggish of flight, and appear as if they enjoy life less than at
                        any other time. Dressed in his new coat, for a week or ten days before his
                        winter tour to the South he returns to the haunts of spring, and sings
                        almost as continuously as he did at that time. His call note is a wiry wisp
                        of sound, no more reproducible than his song. In case his nest and young are
                        interfered with he is a valiant little fighter, but what he says can be
                        described no better than as angry chatter. He is profane on provocation,
                        and, pushed to the limit, swears like the proverbial sailor. He does not
                        hesitate to make physical attack on anyone disturbing his nest or mate,
                        flying like a small fury at the head and eyes of a human, who must appear
                        bigger to a wren than an elephant does to us.</p>
                    <p>No bird of our ornithology is more beloved in the North than the bluebird. In
                        company with the martin or sometimes a day or two before or very shortly
                        after, the bluebird is one of the first to put in an appearance in the
                        earliest spring. Poets have written much concerning the gorgeous blue of his
                        back, the sweet, friendly twitter of his homecoming, the cheerfulness of his
                        disposition, but no one has very much to say concerning his song. The first
                        we hear of the bluebird in the spring is a <pb id="VAA2374-232" n="219"/>
                        long-drawn, melodiously inflected call note: &quot;Sugar!
                        Sugar!&quot; often accompanied, especially around a bird-box, with a
                        flutter of wings, which might truly be described as a combination of sound
                        and feathers. His song falls into the same measure as the robin&apos;s,
                        but it is very different in cadence. The robin selects a choir loft, looks
                        around him to make sure that he has at least a feathered audience, while
                        very frequently he seeks a human one; then he throws up his head, parts his
                        beak widely, and rolls forth the notes with vast assurance. The bluebird has
                        a timid, deprecatory manner, and always to me there is a plaintive tone.
                        When his life history with us is taken into consideration, this is not much
                        of a marvel; for in my experience, bluebirds come to grief ten times to a
                        robin&apos;s once. The bluebird arrives so early in March, coming
                        sometimes even as early as February, that he faces cold, ice and storm,
                        spring gale, heavy downpour, and scarcity of food. Frequently a pair lose
                        their nest, because they love to build in bird-houses placed for them. These
                        houses very frequently are set with poor judgment, so that they are
                        constantly preyed upon by cats and red squirrels; while it is impossible so
                        to construct bird-boxes that they will admit a bluebird and exclude its
                        bitterest enemy, the English sparrow. Very frequently, bluebirds bring off
                        two or three broods to the season; so I <unclear>fee-</unclear> justified by
                        the facts in stating that this singer <pb id="VAA2374-233" n="220"/> has a
                        touch of melancholy in his voice, while I am surely right in attributing to
                        him only minor notes. He has a placid face and appealing character, because
                        he keeps on singing even when his nest has been destroyed repeatedly. As
                        nearly as the song can be put into syllables, it is best translated:
                        &quot;Pu-ri-ty, pu-ri-ty, pu-ri-ty!&quot; with plenty of quaver and
                        not much height or depth of tone.</p>
                    <p>The bird of our dooryard and orchard, best known of all and probably best
                        loved, is the robin. His tribal call is: &quot;Kip, kip!&quot; and
                        he speaks loudly and plainly when he says it, often as if he desired to
                        attract human attention. This I think he does undoubtedly, since from the
                        beginning of homes in America he has been a bird protected and loved more
                        than any other throughout the North. There are occasions when he has been
                        shot on the grounds that he ate too many cherries, but for one person of my
                        experience who has shot robins, I could name a small host who would be more
                        inclined to shoot the person who shot the bird, than to do the robin any
                        damage. I have been told that in the South, especially in Texas, the robin
                        multiplies in great numbers and becomes intoxicated on fermenting fruit so
                        that his appearance is that of a bedraggled toper, and his manners decidedly
                        questionable; but with this phase of his life I am not acquainted. There is
                        no bird song dearer to my heartnot even that of the inimitable wood thrush.
                        Of course, the wood thrush far <pb id="VAA2374-234" n="221"/> surpasses the
                        robin in melody, but until building the Cabin, north, I have been compelled
                        to follow this thrush to the woodseven to the deep woodsand efface myself
                        completely, often in most unpleasant places, in order to hear his notes. All
                        day, busy with the affairs of life, from basement to garret of any home I
                        ever lived in, I have heard the robin singing most exquisitely, as plainly
                        as anything I ever said myself, the tender words: &quot;Cheer up,
                        dearie, cheer up, dearie, cheer up, cheer up, cheer!&quot; Frequently
                        during the heaviest field work of May and June I have come back to the Cabin
                        at the point of exhaustion from one of my hardest days afield with burning,
                        blistered shoulders, aching feet, and tired eyes, for we often have extreme
                        heat in late June; and I have gotten a fresh grip on life and my work from
                        the robin&apos;s melodious and infectious admonitions of cheer. From a
                        musical standpoint it is an excellent song that he sings, with a clear,
                        melodious beginning, well sustained notes, and pleasing ending. I am
                        particularly fond of a bird that ends his song. After experiencing the
                        suspense of waiting for an oriole to complete his strain, I feel
                        particularly thankful to a robin for coming to a happy, definite ending.
                        Robins of several seasons enlarge their repertoire with lovely notes,
                        learned from their closest neighbours, the orioles, song sparrows, and
                        bluebirds. I often hear my robins dropping in these notes at random in their
                        song.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-235" n="222"/>
                    <p>Another household pet, a part of the family life at the Cabin, is the
                        chickadee. His call note is given in the freest manner, with the most human
                        inflection of any bird note I know. The little whiff of grey feathers,
                        sharply touched with black and white, comes fluttering around the back door
                        for crumbs, conversationally remarking:
                        &quot;Chick-a-dee-dee-dee!&quot; Sometimes he leaves off the first
                        two syllables and simply says: &quot;Dee, dee, dee!&quot; His song
                        is two or three pure sweet whistled notes that I can not reproduce in words,
                        and can not find reproduced in any book on bird music in my library. He is a
                        winter bird that takes the summer place of the wrens around the Cabin, even
                        tamer than the wrens; for with a few minutes of immovable offering of food,
                        when the chickadee is cold and hungry in winter, he can be induced to alight
                        on the head or hands to pick at a piece of bread.</p>
                    <p>I have had as much, if not more, personal experience with the cardinal than
                        with any other bird of our ornithology. He was a close friend of my
                        childhood, handled constantly as a pet bird during my school days. When I
                        went afield with a camera, I set it up before more cardinal nests than those
                        of any other birds, because my first book dealt only with his kind; so it
                        was necessary to have a large number of interesting reproductions of his
                        free, wild life for the illustrations. The cardinal is a bird extremely
                        alert, living on <pb id="VAA2374-236" n="223"/> high nervous tension. If a
                        bird has any idea of self-protection, it would seem that a cardinal, making
                        a flaming target every time he wings his flight in the open, would naturally
                        keep to the shrubbery and underbrush, but not so. Beside public highways, in
                        all kinds of thickets and bushes on the banks of rivers, in orchards, grape
                        vines, and gardens, he builds; and one pair, in my childhood, nested on a
                        bough of a Norway pine only a few feet from our front door and not four feet
                        from the ground.</p>
                    <p>With every intrusion of human, animal, or other bird, both cardinals begin to
                        fly around excitedly, the male crying, &quot;Chip! chip!&quot; each
                        note cut off in a manner extremely abrupt. In times of excitement, the
                        female answers, &quot;Chip!&quot; but when she is brooding or has a
                        nestful of young in her care, and the cry of the male bird is merely a note
                        of inquiry, she frequently answers with a soft, throaty
                        &quot;Chook&quot; that reminds me of the tones of a clucking hen. In
                        his music, the cardinal is a whistler, and he varies his strain much more
                        frequently than the average feathered musician. One of his famous whistled
                        tunes is a repetition of the same notes: &quot;Wheat, wheat,
                        wheat!&quot; Again, he very distinctly cries: &quot;Here, here,
                        here!&quot; and like the flicker in using the same word but entirely
                        different in the sound, he also whistles: &quot;Wet, wet, wet!&quot;
                        In his more elaborate strains he very clearly whistles: &quot;Come
                        here&quot; in <pb id="VAA2374-237" n="224"/> three or four repetitions,
                        but beginning on a lower note, rising higher, and prolonging and trilling
                        different notes so that the song is full of sound variations. Numbers of
                        different interpretations, equally apt, may be put upon the notes of the
                        cardinal. Once a sweet faced old lady asked me to name the bird, which came
                        through her orchard singing: &quot;Pretty, pretty, pretty!&quot; She
                        imitated the cardinal so perfectly that I knew instantly which bird she
                        meant. In the course of my childhood around nests and in my field
                        experiences with a camera, I have watched the love affairs of many birds,
                        but I know of no bird that in the ecstasy of the mating fever becomes so
                        obsessed as the cardinal.</p>
                    <p>He is not the only musician in the family; his mate does very well on a low
                        whistled repetition of most of his notes. In truth the hens of almost every
                        species with which I am intimately acquainted sing a few soft, low songs
                        during courtship, sometimes after family cares are over in the nest.</p>
                    <p>The best thing ever said about a cardinal in my experience was a remark made
                        by Ross Lower, a small boy of Wabash, Indiana. He was standing on the
                        sidewalk in utter absorption, listening to a thrilling courting song of a
                        cardinal in a tree close the fence. A woman passing noticed his interest and
                        pausing asked: &quot;What do you think he is saying?&quot; to which
                        he promptly replied: &quot;I think he says: &apos;Keep the home
                        fires burning.&apos;&quot; I agree with the <pb id="VAA2374-238"
                            n="225"/> lad. That is exactly what a cardinal says in his mating song,
                        which is his most finished utterance</p>
                    <p>The nuthatch is another resident at the Cabin, north. His tribal call is:
                        &quot;Yank, Yank, Yank!&quot; He is a very free bird, coming around
                        the Cabin frequently during the summer when he is nesting in hollow trees in
                        the woods; but in the winter he fellowships with the chickadee, titmouse,
                        junco, and downies, picking at the suet baskets, feasting on the store
                        provided on the deep windowsills of the bird porch, and performing the
                        acrobatic stunt of running headfirst down the trees. His sustained song is
                        an elaboration of his cry. He seldom takes time to sing. When he does, his
                        tone is low and almost human. Quite conversationally he remarks, rather than
                        sings: &quot;Yank! Yank! Yank-ee! Yank-ee! Yank! Yank! Yank!&quot;</p>
                    <p>A very quiet and well conducted little member of our winter choir, with
                        habits similar to those of the nuthatch, is the junco, with dark head and
                        back, white breast, and grey sides. With an ivory white bill, he feasts
                        daintily at our winter offerings, occasionally remarking:
                        &quot;&apos;tsip, &apos;tsip.&quot; This is merely a whisper
                        of sound. Occasionally he pauses and whistles a high, halting strain of a
                        few notes with small variation that I am unable to give any form of
                        syllabication.</p>
                    <p>Another extremely interesting small bird sometimes seen in the summer, but
                        constantly with us in winter, is the titmouse. His soft, delicate plumage,
                            <pb id="VAA2374-239" n="226"/> his sharp crest, his bright eye, and his
                        gaudy vest make him a beautiful creature, reminding me of the cedarbird in
                        form. Clear and high, when food hunting around the Cabin and especially in
                        spring, he calls: &quot;Hewit, hewit!&quot; very seldom repeating
                        the words more than once, each time making them clearly words, as I should
                        speak them; at other times he drags his utterances. His song is high, clear,
                        and beautifully musical in the winter woods, but so nearly like the
                        wren&apos;s in bubbling spontaneity that I again confess myself unable
                        to put it into syllables or give it sympathetic description.</p>
                    <p>The master singer of our winter woods, with one exception the bird dearest to
                        my heart, is the song sparrow. His call note is a clear &quot;Chip!
                        chip!&quot; One of these birds homed on a small point and was nesting
                        there, when I purchased my present location. I staked off his site, and
                        every man of dozens of workers, spending a year in the construction of the
                        Cabin, knew about the song sparrow&apos;s nest; while most of them
                        tossed him crumbs from their dinner pails. Every winter he has homed with
                        us, and at times when no other birdnot even the cardinallifts his voice, the
                        song sparrow, perching on a maple down at the shore line, in bold, clear
                        tones, has given at least a short concert in the morning during our
                        bitterest January weather, until the extreme cold of 1918, during which I
                        lost him. A song sparrow came to the <pb id="VAA2374-240" n="227"/> point in
                        the spring and nested near the old site. He is there the winter of 1919
                        singing each February morning as I work on this book, but he is not the
                        master musician we had the four years previous. There is a world of
                        difference between his halting, imperfectly pitched rendition of the song
                        sparrow&apos;s notes and that of his loved predecessor, who was a grand
                        opera singer, his tune gay and colourful. He always started on three short
                        notes, sometimes preceded by a grace note quite an octave lower. He reached
                        the last A on a piano keyboard. From that, he rose to a D above, fell back
                        to A, dropped lower to F, rose to B, and finished with the A on which he
                        began. As nearly as his song can be reduced to words, it runs:
                        &quot;Fitz, fitz, fitz, we, wesir, sir-wee, sir-witz, witz.&quot;
                        This syllabication may help amateurs in bird song to recognize the song
                        sparrow notes when they hear them, but the words look so awkward in print
                        and fall so far short of conveying my ideas of the melody of this
                        performance that I hesitate to set them down. No bird of the sparrow or
                        finch tribes can come anywhere near the song sparrow in improvisation. He
                        can deliver half a dozen different variations, all based on the same strain.
                        Every song sparrow I have heard almost invariably begins a concert with:
                        &quot;Fitz, fitz&quot; on A. Several experts on bird song consider
                        him &quot;nature&apos;s cleverest song genius.&quot; In summer
                        his music is not so noticeable in the Babel of warblers, finches, <pb
                            id="VAA2374-241" n="228"/> robins, orioles, catbirds, thrushes, and
                        blackbirds, which pour a confusion of song around the Cabin; but in winter,
                        when he has only chickadees, juncoes, and titmice, with an occasional song
                        of the cardinal, with which to compete, he easily holds the centre of the
                        stage as the most continuous and melodious performer.</p>
                    <p>Dropping in among the other winter singers and at times in the summer as
                        well, comes the metallic &quot;Chink, chink&quot; of the downy
                        woodpecker. If he has any other song I am not familiar with it.</p>
                    <p>At the same time the flicker is crying: &quot;Wet, wet, wet.&quot;
                        One writer on bird notes translates this cry: &quot;Quit, quit&quot;
                        but to my ear he very distinctly says, &quot;Wet.&quot; He is a bird
                        of cheery disposition, noisy and conspicuous of voice as he is of colour in
                        the winter woods. Sometimes, when drumming on a hollow tree, he lifts his
                        head and in high, clear tones cries: &quot;Keeyer!&quot; It is
                        difficult to say whether his notes are sung or whistled. There is something
                        of the quality of both. The bird seems to vocalize them. In an attempt to
                        reproduce them it would certainly be necessary to whistle the tones at least
                        partially.</p>
                    <p>Among our Cabin musicians, the wailing quaver of the screech owl is heard
                        from half a dozen different directions at the same time. The cry might be
                        likened to a sneeze imperfectly syllabified:
                        &quot;T&apos;cher-r-whieu&quot; the last syllable drawn out <pb
                            id="VAA2374-242" n="229"/> and wavering until it makes you shiver at
                        times, again it is cut off in rather short, sharp delivery.</p>
                    <p>The barred owl and the barn owl deliver a succession of:
                        &quot;Whoo-who-hoo, to-whoo-ah&quot;&apos;s their cries
                        differently divided and inflected, but both birds uttering a succession of
                        these syllables in different combinations. To the ear of the average human,
                        any owl cry is harrowing, yet these owls seldom lift their voices except
                        when they are making love or feeding, neither occupation being in the least
                        disagreeable to humanity.</p>
                    <p>One of the component parts of life at Limberlost Cabin, north, either summer
                        or winter is the great horned owls. We have magnificent specimens, standing
                        over two feet in height, with a yard of wing sweep; their residence I shall
                        not betray. For these birds I have a peculiar feeling of compassion, since
                        the hand, the trap, and the gun of everyone else are against them. It is my
                        business to guard their location, to dump into the lake the bodies of
                        poisoned chickens set for them, to release them from traps, to forbid guns,
                        and to protect them in every way possible to me; although I very well know
                        that on summer nights they prey upon many of my most beautiful and musical
                        song birds perching in thickets and grape vine entanglements. In a
                        prolonged, wavering cry, the utterance of the horned owl runs:
                        &quot;Whoo, hoo-hoo! Whoo, hoo-hoo-hoo!&quot; There is a time during
                        December and early January when these <pb id="VAA2374-243" n="230"/> birds
                        are seldom heard, but late in January and through February, unless the
                        winter be unusually severe, they cry almost incessantly through the woods at
                        this their mating season; toward spring, when the young have hatched and
                        begun to have growing appetites, the wavering cry of the owls, when food
                        hunting, is nothing less than hair-raising. Added to this cry they have a
                        scream, which I think many uninitiated persons have attributed to the
                        wildcats and panthers. This cry is a hideous prolonged scream, sounding more
                        like the voice of a wildcat than any other note I ever heard from the throat
                        of a bird. My owls use it from a high perch with seeming intent to terrify
                        to paralysis all woodland creatures. On wing, just as they plunge into a
                        thicket of bushes or vines striking with full force in order to scare up
                        sleeping birds, they cry in horrid, guttural tones: &quot;Wack! Wack!
                        Wack!&quot; the pair often voicing the cries in a jumble of repellent
                        sounds. In describing the horned owl&apos;s scream, Chapman calls it
                        &quot;one of the most blood-curdling sounds I have ever heard in the
                        woods,&quot; while Schuyler Matthews says: &quot;No cat on a
                        backyard fence can produce a sound as hideous.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Always, summer and winter, we have with us an abundance of crows with their
                        &quot;Caw! caw! caw!&quot; Listening to these notes, Morning Face,
                        fresh from a city residence, once remarked to me: &quot;Hark the
                        caw-bird!&quot; In a family discussion, which <pb id="VAA2374-244"
                            n="231"/> takes on a tone of dissension, in prolonged syllables there
                        comes from the summer woods the crow cry:
                        &quot;Ca-cack-ca-caw!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Like our titmouse in syllabication, but the notes raised in tone, every
                        summer the oriole comes into my woods crying: &quot;Hewit?
                        Hewit?&quot; These birds have a beautiful, rolling, whistled song of
                        many notes. They have the irritating habit of opening a song with a note,
                        clear and exquisite, then stopping to swallow a berry or snatch up an
                        insect, delivering another note, making a flight to an adjoining perch,
                        where very probably they forget that they have started a strain, thus
                        leaving the listener in irritated suspense. When one becomes utterly
                        provoked with them, they may remember and finish the strain, or they may
                        take wing, bubbling out in complete spontaneity notes so high and sweet and
                        musical that they wipe out the memory of the former indignity to the
                        feelings. I can think of no words in which to syllabify this song. The
                        orioles have an alarm call, delivered around their nests and young, very
                        clearly uttered and very appropriately, a staccato cry: &quot;Check!
                        Check!&quot; like the blackbird&apos;s notes in syllabication,
                        entirely unlike them in delivery.</p>
                    <p>There are no birds more voluble than orioles, the females having many things
                        to say when they are gathering nest material and while they are busy
                        building. They openly rejoice over every string and hair they find suitable
                        for their purpose. <pb id="VAA2374-245" n="232"/> The males are extremely
                        active on wing, and colour almost every flight they make with their song as
                        well as their plumage; while the volubility of both parents is inherited by
                        the youngsters, which talk incessantly throughout the day, and keep me awake
                        half of the night, if it happens to strike the parents&apos; fancy to
                        hang their pendent purse a yard from the foot of my bed outside the screen
                        of my sleeping-porch, as a pair of these birds did in the summer of 1916.
                        The youngsters in that nest carried on a conversation all nightsleepy, low
                        chips and peepswhile for several nights after they left the nest, each one
                        of them sang himself to sleep and then sang in his sleep the remainder of
                        the night on near-by limbs. One writer on ornithology has pronounced them
                        &quot;the cry-babies of birdland,&quot; but with this I can not
                        agree except in so far as to admit that they keep up a continuous sound; I
                        can discover no complaint or unhappiness about it. It is simply oriole
                        volubility working out in them through the only sound possible to the
                        youngsters in expressing themselves. I am perfectly sure that these notes on
                        the part of the oriole nestlings are not crying, because they are uttered by
                        birds full-fed, in perfect comfort, and during the night, when, they are
                        half asleep.</p>
                    <p>Some of our writers on bird music find strains, especially in the operatic
                        performances of some of our great European composers, very similar to the
                        strains of the song sparrow, oriole, and a number of <pb id="VAA2374-246"
                            n="233"/> our finest songsters. The similarity of these songs to the
                        notes of our birds could be only accidental, since it is highly improbable
                        that any of these composers ever heard our larks and orioles sing.</p>
                    <p>Associated with the oriole in my mind is the red-winged blackbird, which
                        comes earlier and some seasons nests in large numbers in a strip of swamp
                        directly across the narrow channel of the lake in front of the Cabin. One
                        summer in particular, they crossed the channel and swarmed all over the
                        woods food hunting, scratching over the ground like industrious chickens,
                        pausing with swollen throats and wings half-lifted to deliver their cry
                        beautifully clear in accent and inflection: &quot;Konka-ree.&quot;
                        Again, it comes plainly in the call form: &quot;O-kalee!&quot; Their
                        song is nothing more than a sort of whistling-humming:
                        &quot;Gug-lug-a-ree!&quot; These notes are long-drawn, pure, and
                        very sweet.</p>
                    <p>Meadow larks we have always with us, coming from the cultivated fields
                        adjoining our woods on the south to hunt food in our thickets, vines, and
                        bushes, over the open garden and the meadow behind it. Their tribal call is
                        difficult to render, short, sharp, and unmusical: &quot;Z&apos;stt,
                        z&apos;stt.&quot; The notes of no bird of our ornithology are better
                        known than the sweet, lovely song of the lark. In words appropriate to the
                        season and easy to understand, the larks cry: &quot;Spring o&apos;
                        year!&quot; just as distinctly as the whippoorwill pronounces his name.
                        Over the alfalfa fields of Nebraska, I <pb id="VAA2374-247" n="234"/> heard
                        meadow larks in tones of sweetness quite equal to our birds add two notes to
                        this strain making it in complete form: &quot;Spring o&apos; year,
                        my de-ar!&quot; a wonderfully lovely song beautifully rendered; while
                        above the Limberlost we had the notes of an English skylark a few years ago,
                        but I fear that he did not survive, as I heard him for only two season.</p>
                    <p>The night hawk&apos;s tribal call is a hiss when disturbed, and his music
                        is usually described as booming, since to produce it the bird flies aloft to
                        a height of eighty feet or more and then drops vertically to earth with
                        extended wings, so that the air whistles through the primaries in a queer,
                        booming sound.</p>
                    <p>Among the almost songless birds may be classed the cowbird, which sits on the
                        fences with swollen throat, half-lifted wings, tucked tail, and with deep
                        guttural utterances wheezes forth something that sounds like:
                        &quot;Gluck-zee-zee!&quot; these notes being brought forth with such
                        apparent effort that once is as often as the bird delivers them at a time as
                        a rule. Most rules concerning bird music are extremely flexible, since these
                        little creatures, having the freedom of the earth and air, are about as
                        irresponsible as the wind that &quot;bloweth where it listeth,&quot;
                        this being a very good description of the manner in which birds sing.</p>
                    <p>Coming back to the Cabins, we always have the chimney swift, which glues its
                        nest inside the fire <pb id="VAA2374-248" n="235"/> place chimneys, seeming
                        to pay not the slightest attention to the smoke of occasional summer fires
                        on chilly evenings. With neither rhyme nor reason and with no particular
                        musical tone nor inflection, they cry above us: &quot;Chip, chip, chip,
                        chippy, chip, chip!&quot; They are beautiful birds of tireless wing and
                        invaluable insecticides.</p>
                    <p>Another familiar bird of ours which invades the verandas of the Cabin, north,
                        and hunts sweets over the wall-pockets and big jardinires of wild flowers on
                        the broad stone copings, is the rubythroated hummingbird. These birds come
                        to us surrounded by the humming of their invisible wings so that we know of
                        their presence by their hum and their passage through the air near to or
                        over our heads. With squeaks of delight, they greet masses of blood-red
                        Oswego tea, lavender bergamot, and deep yellow butterfly flower. I have
                        heard hummingbirds, with open bill and distended throat, perching on an ash
                        limb above a widely spreading bed of Oswego tea, sing an amusing murmuring
                        continuous sound that I think undoubtedly they intended for song; but it is
                        even more hopeless of translation than the song of the wren.</p>
                    <p>Without fail, under the boat-house, under the dock, on the logs of the Cabin,
                        north, and through the woods, every year we have Phoebe birds. The male
                        begins early in the morning, and an unbelievable number of times to the
                        minute for <pb id="VAA2374-249" n="236"/> several hours at a stretch,
                        monotonously, insistently, yet in clear sweet tones, he cries:
                        &quot;Phoe-be, Phoe-be!&quot; After screaming for her insistently
                        for four years, the bird at last achieved the triumph of bringing the young
                        lady, who is now taking these cries at my dictation.</p>
                    <p>A near relative and sweeter singer is the wood pewee, which builds its tiny
                        and exquisite lichencovered cup on oak and maple branches. He is invaluable
                        as a fly-catcher, being in the same class with his cousin Phoebe, martins,
                        and swallows. His call note is clear and high &quot;Pe-wee!&quot;
                        His song consists of clearly uttered, exquisitely intoned notes, drawn out,
                        accented, and inflected, according to the mood of the singer, usually
                        delicate and of fullest perfection just at the approach of twilight, when
                        most other birds are quiet. At this hour there seldom is bird music, with
                        the exception of the wood and hermit thrushes. The pewee begins on a clear,
                        high note, &quot;pe,&quot; drops a fourth, sings
                        &quot;A&quot; and ends a minor third above with
                        &quot;wee.&quot; Then he pauses, until you are exasperated with the
                        waiting, and drops in a final note, which is a pure pearl of sound and song,
                        &quot;peer!&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the orchard of the Cabin, south, and thickets, surrounding the Cabin,
                        north, we have constantly in summer the conversational
                        &quot;Ker-rip?&quot; of the kingbird. Sometimes he asks the question
                        without the hyphen, sometimes he screams: &quot;Quirp!&quot; and

                        this bird with &quot;a soft, pleasing song.&quot; I can produce
                        perhaps two dozen pictures of a number of kingbirds about the affairs of
                        home life. He has built his nest and reared his brood, in one instance, not
                        two rods from my back door. I can testify to his beautiful plumage, his
                        valiant disposition, his unusually loving consideration of his mate, and
                        untiring devotion to his young, his implicit trust in me, surpassing that of
                        all other birds, but I never heard one note of this &quot;soft, pleasing
                        song.&quot; When he has managed to sing it during my lifetime of
                        acquaintance with him, I can not imagine.</p>

                        </hi> of our friends is the jay bird, a beauty in plumage, friendly in
                        disposition, a good husband and father, but dangerous to the nests and eggs
                        of other birds. His call note is high, clear, and rather antagonistic:
                        &quot;D&apos;jay, d&apos;jay,&quot; certainly an obtrusive
                        and self-satisfied note. He asks no favour, courts no bird but his mate. He
                        may utter this cry once or a dozen times. I always get the impression from
                        it that he would not avoid trouble if he met it, and usually he finds it.
                        Perched on a conspicuous branch in early spring, when other birds are
                        singing mating songs, the bluejay sings: &quot;Ge-rul-lup&quot; over
                        and over, making rather an attractive song of it. The bluejay notes that
                        really are pleasing to my car are those uttered by a number of jays having a
                        party after nesting affairs are over, when they gather in the top branches
                        of a tree and in soft tones tell each other to &quot;fill the kittle,
                        fill the tea-kittle,&quot; and there are times, when Father Jay perching
                        near his nest looks at his mate with an expression of extreme devotion, and
                        in whispered, throaty utterances says to her something that sounds to me
                        like <pb id="VAA2374-253" n="240"/> &quot;Chinkle-chee-tinkle, tankle,
                        tunkle! Rinkle, rankle runkle! Tee chee, twee?&quot; The jay can imitate
                        perfectly the &quot;Killy, killy&quot; notes of the sparrow hawk or
                        the &quot;Ke-ah&quot; cry of the red-shoulder. For this reason, he
                        can cause undue commotion in the woods. As an interpretation of jaybird
                        character and notes a poem by LeRoy T. Weeks, published in <hi rend="i">The
                            Century</hi> in 1906, is equal to any attempt I ever have seen. I should
                        like to quote the entire poem, but must content myself with a few lines of
                        two verses:</p>

                    <p>On fences surrounding an old orchard and the horse pasture every season we
                        have the bobolink at the Cabin, north. He is commonly called by his tribal
                        note: &quot;Bob o&apos; link&quot; twice repeated, to <pb
                            id="VAA2374-254" n="241"/> which he usually adds: &quot;Spink,
                        spank, spink!&quot; We have few, if any, birds that sing a longer song
                        from the vantage of any fence post or wood stump around our meadow. This
                        veritable music-box pours out his song, the whole of which is an interrupted
                        run, interspersed with his call note and ravishing variations which run high
                        and drop again in a sort of fantasy of irrepressible, spontaneous clearness.
                        Many writers on bird song have been able to follow him through the first two
                        repetitions of his name and a choice assortment of &quot;spink, wink,
                        tink, link,&quot; only to be forced to give up when the outpouring
                        reaches flood tide. The description of a bobolink in song which called him
                        an &quot;irrepressible music-box&quot; is the best that I have seen.</p>
                    <p>There are birds which at times fail us, but I can remember no season during
                        which we have not had goldfinches nesting in the bushes around the edges of
                        the woods, in the woods pasture, and beside the field fences of the Cabin,
                        north. These birds come late, nest but once in a season, and after nesting
                        spend the greater part of their time in country gardens. They pass back and
                        forth from these to the woods, singing on wing, so that they sow the air
                        with warbled notes, impossible to syllabify because they are of such
                        bubbling spontaneity. Our gardens seem to be full of lettuce, vegetable
                        oyster, radish, and flower seeds on which these birds feed, and they flock
                        over and claim possession <pb id="VAA2374-255" n="242"/> of the long rows of
                        Mr. Burbank&apos;s red and brown sunflowers, the small seeds of which
                        are much more appreciated by them than those of the large variety, which
                        have seeds the size of a grain of corn and are awkward for the small bills
                        of these birds. Flocking over the sunflowers they constantly pass back and
                        forth to each other their tribal call in the form of a question:
                        &quot;See me? See me?&quot; Then they have a shorter, detached cry
                        sometimes uttered in an exclamatory way, sometimes given in answer to the
                        &quot;See me?&quot; call. The nearest anyone has arrived, at this
                        cry rendered in our speech, is: &quot;P&apos;tseet!&quot; I have
                        had considerable experience with these birds and I frequently have heard the
                        male bird give the &quot;See me?&quot; call and the female, brooding
                        or feeding her young the &quot;P&apos;tseet&quot; cry in answer.
                        It appeared to me that these cries were used much as human beings would when
                        a man asks, &quot;Where are you?&quot; and his wife answers,
                        &quot;Here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There are three sparrows that always home in Wildflower Woods, particularly
                        beside a winding private road leading from the woods across the fields and
                        out to the public highway. In the buckthorn bushes bordering one side of
                        this road, in the grasses creeping to the wheel tracks, in the wild rose
                        bushes, and even under rankly growing flowers, these sparrows are always
                        with us. One is the white throat, with his cry of &quot;Chip,
                        chip,&quot; crisply and tersely uttered when about the business of life,
                        changing to nervous and excited tones when <pb id="VAA2374-256" n="243"/> a
                        snake or squirrel approaches the nest location. His song, in pure, sweet
                        tones, but of monotonous delivery, is the famous &quot;Old Sam
                        Peabody&quot; so human in utterance that country folk call him the
                        &quot;Peabody bird.&quot; His cousin the chipping sparrow has a call
                        note which is a sharper, more tensely inflected &quot;Chip,&quot;
                        and a song of scarcely more than a persistently reiterated note which is the
                        least interesting music of the sparrow family. The field sparrow uses the
                        same call note, very similar to the others, and has a song which he varies
                        in a number of ways. These songs are difficult to put into words, while the
                        musician&apos;s ending is almost invariably a roll of piping trills,
                        sweet and melodious. In the length of the road from the woods to the
                        highway, we had seven nests of these birds the season of 1918.</p>
                    <p>The chewink is a bird which comes to us at every spring migration,
                        industriously scratching the earth among the leaves and roots and making
                        himself extremely familiar all around the Cabin, north, especially in the
                        thickets near the spring. The birds have a very distinctive dress, the male
                        being conspicuous for a black head and coat touched with white on the
                        sleeves and tail, white shirt, and a russet vest never closed in front,
                        merely showing before the folded wings. The female has lovely shades of the
                        same colour. Her russet is lighter and where the male is black she is a
                        soft, warm, dust colour, a shade as effective as dove colour, but <pb
                            id="VAA2374-257" n="244"/> difficult to describe. In the business of
                        rearing their young these birds seem to be extremely uneasy about each
                        other. They find almost all of their food on the ground, much of the time
                        scratching among the leaves for it, so that they are the prey of snakes and
                        rodents. The male&apos;s call, frequent and distinct, is
                        &quot;Chee-wink?&quot; from which these birds take their name.
                        Sometimes the female answers him with a reproduction of the note in
                        exclamatory form, where his call is interrogative. One pair I worked with
                        more intimately and for a longer time than with any other I have known. The
                        female&apos;s answer was always plainly given:
                        &quot;Chee-wee!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The song of the male bird starts in clear, whistled tones, and is one of
                        those previously referred to as extremely disappointing in its ending. The
                        notes raised to twice eight va., begin on D, rise to A, on to E four or five
                        times repeated. The best translation I ever have seen is that of Thompson
                        Seton, who hears the chewink sing: &quot;Chuck-burr,
                        pill-a-will-a-will-a-will!&quot; Sometimes the musician sings on low
                        shrubbery near his nest, but when he is really giving a concert he selects
                        the top branch of the tallest tree in hearing of his mate and sings the song
                        described, with several variations.</p>
                    <p>Because of the same colouring, this bird calls to mind the rose-breasted
                        grosbeak, with which I was intimately acquainted in childhood and during my
                        residence in Limberlost Cabin, south. The rose-breasted <pb id="VAA2374-258"
                            n="245"/> bird has not appeared to any extent in my new location, nor do
                        I hear his notes save very rarely while in field work. He is conspicuously
                        black and white like the male chewink, but on his white breast there is a
                        splash of purplish-blood-red. His call note is a high
                        &quot;Chink!&quot; which does not very well describe the sound. He
                        makes this cry extremely emphatic when he is anxious about his mate and
                        eggs. His song is lovely, of even tone, continuous, and of almost perfect
                        rendition. These notes are as difficult for an amateur to catch in pitch as
                        the song of any field bird I know. Experts agree as to the attractive
                        character of his song, although they differ in its interpretation, several
                        prominent writers insisting that the bird warbles the notes, a thing I never
                        heard him do in a lifetime of closest intimacy. I know the male bird to be
                        as tender and devoted to the female as is the mate of the brooding dove. It
                        may be for this reason that I find his notes toned and inflected with
                        sentiment; for in much work with set cameras before the nest of this bird it
                        has been my experience that every morning about ten o&apos;clock he
                        enters his nest and patiently broods while his mate takes a bath and finds
                        her breakfast, about which she does not in the least hurry herself, for very
                        frequently she fails to return before twelve and sometimes not until one
                        o&apos;clock.</p>
                    <p>Always beside the road and through the fields we have &quot;Bob
                        White&quot; calls, and on summer <pb id="VAA2374-259" n="246"/> evenings
                        while the female quail are nesting, the males, perched on fence riders,
                        prolong this call into a real musical performance by repeating the first
                        note once and quavering the last, making the song: &quot;Bob, Bob
                        White!&quot; The beauty of this performance depends very largely on the
                        age and experience of the singer; old birds content, fullfed, and having had
                        much experience in life and making music, develop a mellow, pleasing tone.</p>
                    <p>Two birds of summer, seldom seen but very frequently heard, are the
                        yellow-billed and blackbilled cuckoo. These birds are sneakers, travelling
                        through shrubbery with a serpentine motion equalled only by the brown
                        thrasher. Their nests are crudely constructed, their eggs large and pale
                        blue, the bird&apos;s plumage a delicate grey dust colour with touches
                        of white on wings and tail, the body long and slender, the head almost
                        hawklike in shape, with exquisitely cut, curved beak. The tribal call of the
                        yellow-bill begins with two or three preparatory notes and ends with four
                        clear and distinctly enunciated ones. He says: &quot;Ur-r-r-coulp,
                        coulp, oulp, olp!&quot; The black-bill, very similar in shape and colour
                        with the exception of his black bill, and almost identical in habits,
                        probably named the species by his cry: &quot;Cowk-coo, cowk-coo,
                        cowk-cu-coo, cowk-cu-coo.&quot; This is repeated five or six times. In
                        the scene beside the brook in &quot;The Pastoral Symphony,&quot;
                        Beethoven used the <pb id="VAA2374-260" n="247"/> song of the nightingale,
                        the call of the quail, and the notes of the cuckoo. If this bird can be said
                        to have a song, it is merely a repetition of its call notes differently
                        accented and inflected.</p>
                    <p>A bird which reminds me of the cuckoo in the handling of his notes is the
                        whippoorwill, named from his cries singly uttered. These constitute a call
                        note. In trouble, he hisses almost like a hawk. In giving a musical
                        performance, he employs the &quot;Whip-poor-will,&quot; cry. The
                        notes are differently accented by different birds, but most of the time in a
                        show performance they manage to quaver the &quot;poor&quot; and one
                        can hear a sort of catch of breath before the falling note, when the quaver
                        is unusually long.</p>
                    <p>A distinctive note, without which no summer at the Cabin, north, would be
                        perfect, is the clearly intoned, incisive cry of the scarlet tanager. With
                        the Cabin site, which included the song sparrow, there was a tanager thrown
                        in for good measure. The bird does not truly belong to me. He does his
                        courting and food hunting in Wildflower Woods, but he builds his nest every
                        year in a maple tree about six inches on my neighbour&apos;s side of the
                        line fence. His tribal call &quot;Chip-bird, chip-bird!&quot; sounds
                        constantly around the garage and through the grounds as near to the Cabin as
                        the woodshed. I never have seen him visit the lake front even once. If I
                        wish to show him off to visitors in all the glory of his bloody coat and
                        black silk wings, I must <pb id="VAA2374-261" n="248"/> take them to his
                        location, which he hugs very closely. He is one of the latest birds to
                        arrive, nests but once with me, and although he comes late he immediately
                        takes a cold, which persists throughout the season. The manner of his song
                        suggests the robin, with nothing like the robin&apos;s cheerily
                        inflected tones. The tanager is a serene, lazy bird alike in lovemaking,
                        nesting, paternity, and above all in his song. He never voices his
                        utterances with a touch of the joy of the song sparrow or the goldfinch, and
                        as for the emphasis of the cardinal, there is no such vim in his system. I
                        know no combination of syllables that will give an idea of his song, for to
                        reproduce his notes a human being would be compelled to hum and whistle at
                        the same time. Any syllabication that could be strung together would abound
                        in r&apos;s and suggest Spanish rather than pure American.</p>
                    <p>In all my experience afield, no one bird, which I might have expected to meet
                        frequently, has been so scarce with me as the cedar waxwing, which I have
                        met only once while the bird was on a pokeberry debauch. His nest I never
                        have found. I knew him well in my childhood. He was one of the most frequent
                        feeders on our cherry trees, and I once had a living specimen, slightly
                        winged, in my fingers, and had the privilege of minutely examining the soft,
                        exquisitely shaded feathers of his back and breastnot grey, not brown, not
                            <pb id="VAA2374-262" n="249"/> olive, not yellow, but the daintiest
                        shades that could be formed from delicate mingling of all of them. His crest
                        was shaped much like the cardinal&apos;s but carried mostly in a line
                        horizontal with the beak. There were bars of yellow on his tail and red
                        touches like wax on his secondaries, from which he takes the name of
                        waxwing. His cry is a queer, whistled complaint like a gust of steam
                        escaping from a small pipe, and higher than the last note on a piano. If he
                        has a song, I never have heard it.</p>
                    <p>A bird with which I am extremely familiar through much experience around his
                        nest, is the red-eyed vireo. His call note: &quot;Preach-er,
                        preach-er!&quot; is constantly used as a nickname for him. His song is
                        so divided and intoned that it lends colour to this translation of his
                        tribal call. Wilson Flagg&apos;s inimitable interpretation of his song
                        is the best that I have seen. He imagines the little orator standing in his
                        pulpit of leafy green, addressing a feathered audience, at whom he shouts:
                        &quot;You see it! You know it! Do you hear me? Do you believe
                        it?&quot; My enjoyment of this translation of the red-eye&apos;s
                        song does not prevent my giving the ideas of another expert in bird music,
                        who sees nothing clerical about the bird and thinks he says: &quot;Tom
                        Kelly, whip Tom Kelly!&quot; How he ever heard or imagined that the bird
                        made a note that could be so translated, is a mystery to me. More pleasing
                        is the version of the third <pb id="VAA2374-263" n="250"/> writer, who makes
                        the vireo a gourmand and hears him sing:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;Fat wormsplenty to cat</l>
                        <l n="2">Gobble &apos;em updon&apos;t delay</l>
                        <l n="3">Come, deardon&apos;t delay</l>
                        <l n="4">I&apos;m herefly this way.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>All these experts do agree upon seems to be that there is a pronounced
                        oratorical effect about the bird&apos;s delivery, and that his song is
                        broken into distinct groupings of notes.</p>
                    <p>The chestnut-sided warbler warbles a strain of bubbling, rolling notes after
                        the manner of his kind, but his call note is a clear
                        &quot;T&apos;see, t&apos;see.&quot; To him is attributed the
                        famous rendition of his song: &quot;I wish, I wish, to see Miss
                        Beecher.&quot; These words he enunciates as clearly as any killdeer or
                        Bob White I ever heard afield.</p>
                    <p>Every spring our woods are full of warblers. On a day of warm, drizzling rain
                        interspersed with bright sunshine, in May, 1918, the tall trees, with grape
                        vines and bittersweet climbing in tangled masses through the tops, were used
                        as a landing place for a whole flock of warblers, most of them seeming to be
                        males that had arrived in spring migration during the night or early
                        morning. By slipping into the location and remaining motionless against a
                        tree for a few minutes, I saw countless little painted creatures, gleaming
                        in strong tints of yellow and green, black and grey, blue and rose, <pb
                            id="VAA2374-264" n="251"/> while they sang a rolling chorus full of
                        &quot;See-see, zip-zee, wee, wee, tu, tu, &apos;tswee-e, zillup,
                        zip, zip.&quot; Which note belonged to which bird it was out of the
                        question to say in the dense foliage so nearly the delicate yellowish green
                        of many of the birds that it was impossible to distinguish the green and
                        yellow ones until they moved.</p>
                    <p>I have had several experiences working around the nest of a Maryland
                        yellow-throat, but I can describe his call note no better than to say that
                        it is a sweep of sound, which I can not express in syllables of even the
                        crudest form, but when it comes to a song in tones distinctly human and
                        clearly defined, the yellow-throat sings:&quot;Witchery,
                        witchery&quot; and again: &quot;What a pity,&quot; two or three
                        times repeated. Then, like a breath of grace notes, he warbles:
                        &quot;You, you&quot; followed by a clear tide of pure, full song:
                        &quot;I beseech you, I beseech you, I beseech you!&quot; These notes
                        are so clearly uttered and so charmingly intoned that there is no question
                        whatever that the little singer would have his demands granted if he only
                        would go so far as to say what it is that he wants.</p>
                    <p>Another of our star performers is the catbird, named from his tribal call:
                        &quot;Me-ouw&quot; sometimes cut short and sometimes long-drawn,
                        always of such feline quality that it is easy to see how he gained his
                        common name. As a singer, he is one of our choicest. He sings a mocking
                        conglomeration of high notes of the robin, chat, vireo, several <pb
                            id="VAA2374-265" n="252"/> of our best thrush singers, song sparrow, and
                        oriole, while he intersperses this charmingly melodious performance with
                        stray cries of the whippoorwill, killdeer, and quail, and he imitates the
                        whistle of the redbird to perfection. He sings from the bushes, doing his
                        best work by no rule about ten o&apos;clock in the morning. No catbird
                        ever sings twice the same, since he is so purely an imitator that he
                        reproduces not only the sounds of birds around him, but also the crowing of
                        the barnyard cock, the cries of the guinea and peacock, the squeal of the
                        pig, bawl of the calf, the whinny of the colt. I have heard him reproduce
                        even the rattle of wheels on the loose floor of a bridge spanning the Wabash
                        River, while he could imitate the rattle of loose spindles in a cart-wheel
                        to perfection.</p>
                    <p>I can think of no combination of letters, and I have found none in the
                        writings of any ornithologist, that will reproduce the tribal call of the
                        brown thrasher. It is a weird, wailing, whistled note. Because his song is a
                        medley, it is usually compared with that of the catbird. The thrasher is a
                        larger bird, and his first difference from the catbird lies in the fact that
                        the catbird sings solely to please himself, while in seclusion. The thrasher
                        seems to demand an audience. For exhibiting his best art, he selects the
                        highest perch he can find, where he is sure to attract the attention of
                        every bird and human in sound of his voice. Then, as a rule, he sings out
                        loudly and clearly, although he can drop <pb id="VAA2374-266" n="253"/> to a
                        faint whisper of sound when he chooses. His second difference from the
                        catbird lies in the fact that, while he starts in to give a public recital
                        he presently becomes so entranced with his own remarkable performance that
                        he grasps the twig upon which he perches, presses his wings tight to his
                        sides, ruffles the feathers of his breast and back until his wings are
                        obscured, and tucks his tail until a line dropped from the point of his beak
                        straight down would very nearly touch the tail tip. From a widely parted
                        beak he pours out a rolling volume of song that even the most expert
                        collector of birds&apos; records never succeeds in truthfully
                        reproducing. His is a more colourful and spectacular performance than the
                        catbird&apos;s, but to me the little grey bird, hanging on an elder over
                        the spring, doing all nature from the goldfinch coasting on waves of summer
                        air above him to the soft gurgle of the running water below, is the more
                        finished performer. To the brown thrasher has been attributed the following
                        advice to farmers: <q direct="unspecified">
                            <lg>
                                <l n="1">&quot;Shuck it! Shuck it! Sow it! Sow it;</l>
                                <l n="2">Plow it! Plow it! Hoe it! Hoe it!&quot;</l>
                            </lg>
                        </q> and by some this has been elaborated to include starting in a hurry,
                        harrowing, seeding, covering, raking in, pushing in, weeding, pulling up,
                        ending with, &quot;Leave it alone!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The choicest singer that belongs to my personal choir of birds at the Cabin,
                        north, is the wood <pb id="VAA2374-267" n="254"/> thrush, a bird which I
                        love to call the &quot;bell bird&quot; on account of the exquisite
                        bell-toned sweetness of his notes. His home is in a spice thicket over and
                        surrounding a pool in the deepest woods behind the ice-house. I am very
                        familiar with this bird, as a number of times I have set up my camera in
                        front of his nest. The tribal call is a wispy whisper. The song, as nearly
                        as it can be expressed, is: &quot;A-e-o-lee.&quot; Each note is
                        dropped into the dim green of our woods like a pearl slowly slipping from a
                        thread of pure gold. No bird of field or forest can surpass him, with the
                        exception of the hermit thrush. The hermit is his relative, not quite so
                        highly coloured as the wood thrush, even shyer, and more timid, seeking
                        deeper woods and more seclusion for his nest. Many people consider the
                        hermit&apos;s song the purest, loveliest bird notes. A free translation
                        of what he sings might be summed up: &quot;Oh fear all! Oh holy! Oh
                        holy! Oh Klr-h-wh! Klr-h!&quot; The wood thrushes sing in slightly
                        faster time, with a touch of passion&apos;s more colourful note at
                        nesting time, and I think this also is true of the hermits; but when they
                        sing the latter part of August from four in the afternoon to six in the
                        evening, their notes are pure, cool, high, and passionless so that no other
                        bird&apos;s song surpasses them.</p>
                    <p>One of our earliest arrivals and one that remains with us until late in the
                        fall is an ever-welcome signal of spring with me. I am quite sure that <pb
                            id="VAA2374-268" n="255"/> I am wide awake every spring at the sound of
                        the first note of the killdeer over the lake. He always comes calling about
                        half past three or four in the morning, crying in tones that one could
                        imagine were plaintive, if it were not remembered that the bird is coming
                        home and probably as happy to arrive as a human being after a time of exile.
                        I feel bound to claim my location as the home of the killdeer, because he
                        comes to me sometimes in late February, always in March, and stays until
                        late November, and where a bird or human spends nine months out of twelve
                        certainly is the location that could be justly called home for him. This
                        bird has a plaintive tribal call, as it flashes around the lake shore,
                        sweeping low on wing, trying to guard the flashing feet of its young too
                        small to fly. At these times, the old bird cries: &quot;Te-dit!

                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>HE nesting of birds pre-supposes mating, and of this we
                        of necessity can know very little. Whenever naturalists write largely on the
                        mating of birds, you may be sure they are largely guessing. This function
                        takes place soon after migration; at that time the birds are enjoying the
                        boundless freedom of all outdoors. Save in a very few cases they have no
                        lure to any particular spot and so it is impossible to make accurate and
                        continuous observance of the same pair. They are with us one moment, a mile
                        away a few seconds later, feeding here and there, singing snatches from
                        every inviting perch, making what look like irresponsible dashes of flight
                        wherever fancy leads them. How can one tell which bird he is observing for
                        any length of time or what it is doing?</p>
                    <p>There are times when we feel assured that certain birds remain mated season
                        after season, and return every year to the same nesting location. As well as
                        I know anything that I can not prove, I know this was the case with a pair
                        of robins which homed with us for several summers at the Cabin, south. My
                        neighbour was sure that for three seasons he <pb id="VAA2374-273" n="260"/>
                        had the same pair of orioles. Certain it is that he has had orioles in the
                        same tree, on the same side of the tree, at the same height, and twice on
                        twigs of the same branch. The nests appear exactly the same and the birds
                        pursue the same course in the affairs of life. That they are the same birds
                        he firmly believes, and so do I, but we have no way to prove it.</p>
                    <p>In the case of last year&apos;s birds, there are enough pairs to be mated
                        each year to keep us busy watching and to furnish notes on bird courtship,
                        even if their parents remain paired and make love indifferently a second
                        season, as some suggest. In my experience, this is never the case in a first
                        pairing for a season. Each spring brings its frenzy of pursuit and song in a
                        first nesting. I do think matters take on a more casual aspect in the second
                        and third matings of the same pair. But very little information that can be
                        vouched for is to be had, because with the birds, courting is a thing of
                        flight on the part of the female and of pursuit on the part of the male, and
                        we can not flyat least, not where birds are courtingso we get only hints and
                        glimpses.</p>
                    <p>Of a very few cases I can write with assurance. Take the birds which every
                        year live and nest around my home. With some of them their affairs are of
                        broad daylight and for everyone to see and interpret as sanely as possible.</p>
                    <p>English sparrows are polygamous. One male <pb id="VAA2374-274" n="261"/>
                        mates successively with several females. But they are such unspeakable pests
                        they are worthy of mention only to advise their extinction.</p>
                    <p>Every year we have wrens. The male comes alone and often spends all of a week
                        carrying sticks and twigs by the peck into three different wren houses,
                        singing ecstatically at the entrance to each in turn. Such bubbling,
                        persistent song I never have heard from the throat of any other bird not
                        even the indigo finch. When timed, a wren has sung for an hour in a spring
                        rain. Then one day I suddenly become aware that there are two wrens on the
                        premises busy with nest building. This has gone on for years, but tell how
                        Madame is courted and mated I never can; for with closest watching, I have
                        not been able to catch the slightest glimpse of a love affair. Surely she
                        must be drawn to her male by that outpouring of song, for he never seems to
                        leave the premises.</p>
                    <p>We have song sparrows with us all winter and song sparrows nest low in the
                        honeysuckle or rose bushes or on the ground, at least three times every
                        summer. Whether they are the same birds we can not be sure, but we rather
                        think they are. We never see but two; their song begins on sunny winter
                        days, grows sweeter and more prolonged with spring; no rivals disturb them
                        after migration and they go about their nesting quietly.</p>
                    <p>There were never less than a dozen pairs of martins on the windmill at the
                        Cabin, south, but <pb id="VAA2374-275" n="262"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2374-276" n="263"/> the height was great, and they kept to equal
                        altitude in all the affairs of life, so that nothing can be told of them
                        with certainty. They have homed there for years, but I never have seen a
                        pair mate or had a glimpse of anything that looked like courting. How or
                        where these things happen, no clue can be had from our birds. On wing, at a
                        height of nearly forty feet, it takes sharper eyes than mine to tell which
                        is male and which female.</p>
                    <p>But the love making of the bluebirds is casual. On the first day that the
                        chirp of a bluebird is heard, several males come around either Cabin and
                        orchard and two or three days later the females arrive. The males court the
                        females and dart at each other by turns, often settling to the ground and
                        fighting stubbornly. One custom of the males in courtship is to pick up a
                        blade of dry grass, carry it into one of the houses prepared for bluebirds,
                        and try to induce the females to enter. They remain around the premises
                        until several pairs have mated and all the houses are filled, and then the
                        others go away.</p>
                    <p>Whether a low voice is a pleasing thing in a bird, whether signs of
                        constancy, sweet temper, and judicious motherhood can be detected and
                        influence the lover in his choice, who can say? The females perch nearby and
                        seem to await the outcome of the battle for their favour, almost with
                        indifference. When the conqueror of all his rivals presents himself for her
                        favour, the female usually <pb id="VAA2374-277" n="264"/> flies away. If she
                        is quite ready to begin housekeeping, she condescends to indicate the fact
                        most casually, and the pair is mated.</p>
                    <p>Our robins come to us immediately on their arrival from the South. Some of
                        them come in pairs and with the understanding that they are to mate and
                        build within a few days, but not all. Some males come alone, and seem to be
                        seeking a mate for days. Nearly all that can be seen of their courtship is
                        the male chasing away any other male that ventures on the premises. They are
                        very staid and lack the flame and ardour of the orioles or cardinals.</p>
                    <p>In the fields and woods I frequently see birds mating in the trees, on
                        bushes, and in a very few instances on the ground, but I do not see and can
                        not describe the courtship which precedes these unions. Often I see a male
                        in pursuit of another male, when I am sure he is driving a rival from his
                        preserves. And again, I see a male in pursuit of a female, when I am
                        positive he is making a strenuous effort to win her for a mate.</p>
                    <p>Of one thing I am sure: birds of very gaudy plumage like the goldfinch,
                        oriole, cardinal, and rose-breasted grosbeak, bobolink, and chewink, have
                        spirits as fiery and flashing as their coats. In courting, they reach a
                        pitch not too strongly described as &quot;frenzy.&quot; They pursue
                        the mates they covet with ardour, dash, and courage unknown to birds of
                        sombre colour like cuckoos, all <pb id="VAA2374-278" n="265"/> thrushes, and
                        doves. Their gaudy colouring seems to beget reckless spirits and they go
                        about their courting with an abandon never seen in the shy, slipping
                        creatures of deep wood.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, they love to display their &quot;coats of many
                        colours.&quot; Who ever saw one of these brightly plumaged birds select
                        a deep, lonely, secluded place for a residence? They flaunt themselves in
                        the open, come near houses and the affairs of human life, and exhibit nerve
                        and boldness wholly lacking in the sombre, deep forest dwellers. Remember
                        the goldfinch piping on your lettuce heads and sunflowers. The indigo
                        bluebird has built along the public highway and prempted the telephone wires
                        for a choir loft, until as a bird of the wire he rivals the swallowin
                        confidence in humanity, not in numbers. The fences belong to the lark. From
                        every stake and rider, high post carrying rod-lines, or dead stump, he rolls
                        his song up to Heaven.</p>
                    <p>The cardinal grosbeak is a bird of the bushes, but nine tenths of the time
                        his bush is beside the road or river. In many instances he locates in
                        orchards and even in grape arbours; and once in my childhood a pair nested
                        on a flat cedar limb not ten feet from our front door. It would seem if
                        there were exclusively &quot;instinctive&quot; action on the part of
                        a bird it would cause this, the brightest of all our songsters, to seek deep
                        wood and seclusion, for every flash of his brilliant body in a conspicuous
                            <pb id="VAA2374-279" n="266"/> place is a temptation to the itching
                        fingers of straying and unprincipled gunners.</p>
                    <p>The bluejay homes in our dooryards and orchards not only in summer, but he or
                        his kind remains with us all winter.</p>
                    <p>That these brilliant birds love their colour and flaunt it where it will
                        oftenest be seen, they prove by living, nesting, and bringing up their
                        families among us and not seeking the seclusion and developing the
                        characters of doves, cuckoos, and thrushes.</p>
                    <p>I have had more experience with the cardinal than with any other one bird,
                        and once a weakling in a nest held a pair close a first location until they
                        were ready to mate and choose a second. On branches where I had made studies
                        of them while around this nest, I secured two pictures of the male in
                        pursuit of the female. But a second mating of a pair is taken for granted
                        and is carried on with nothing like the ardour of the first. At the time I
                        made this series, the hen bird had a small, calloused spot at the base of
                        the beak, not entirely effaced by time, which she undoubtedly had acquired
                        by striking against a fence wire in precipitate flight during the former
                        courtship.</p>
                    <p>Doves are quiet, gentle, and almost sickeningly effusive; larks are gay, glad
                        lovers; I have seen a few measures of the stately dance a blue heron
                        executes for the charming of his beloved; and the tender advances of a black
                        vulture are quite the <pb id="VAA2374-280" n="267"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2374-281" n="268"/> most ludicrous of all my experience in
                        birdland. I hope my sympathy with the birds is as active as that of most
                        field workers, but the humping, shuffling clumsiness of the male
                        vulture&apos;s advances and the demure elusiveness of the equally
                        humping, shuffling female, the way she glided from a limb and left him to
                        the surprise of empty space when he confidently expected surrender, were
                        most amusing to me.</p>
                    <p>Careful study compels me to admit that this is the crme of what I know. In
                        comparison with the stacks of notes on building, brooding, and feeding, it
                        does not seem very much. But it tends to confirm my first statement that
                        there is very little anyone can honestly relate concerning the courtship of
                        the birds.</p>
                    <p>At nesting time, the processes of bird life are so similar to human processes
                        in similar conditions that a warm heart, lack of sound judgment and
                        scientific training cause many people, trying to write on the subject of
                        birds, to sin gravely against the laws of nature, which are distinctly
                        coldblooded. It is so easy to suppose because we do a given thing in a given
                        circumstance that the birds are doing the same thing for the same reason,
                        while there is a strong tendency to humanize them until interest in them is
                        lost. If we look upon the birds as irresponsible beings, needing our
                        protection to survive, our hearts are touched and we strive to repay their
                        benefit to our crops and our joy in their <pb id="VAA2374-282" n="269"/>
                        beauty and song with tender care. If we come to feel that they have the same
                        mental processes as we have, there is a sort of inclination to let them
                        shift for themselves, since they are so wise.</p>
                    <p>The birds are the free wild tenants of field and wood; they are so erratic
                        and so irresponsible in most of their acts, and their range is so wide that
                        for three fourths of their lives little can be learned of them by their
                        closest students and lovers. When they are scattered from east to west,
                        range from the Arctic Circle to Patagonia, and make two migrations yearly,
                        it is impossible to know everything about them with certainty.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">A</hi>T THE nesting season, for a short time, we may come in
                        close contact with bird life. We may feel that we really understand bird
                        processes; for the language of motherhood during cradle-making is universal.
                        When a location is wanted by a pair, the male often takes the lead, carries
                        sticks and blades of dry grass to one place and another, turning and fussing
                        over the spot as if to indicate to his mate that he has found a first class
                        nesting site.</p>
                    <p>We see our male robins doing this around the Cabins every summer. Male wrens
                        prepare all the wren boxes on the premises for a nest. Male bluebirds carry
                        nest material to boxes even before the females arrive. If it were true, as
                        some writers assert, that male birds do not assist in nest building, these
                        would be very deceptive and misleading acts on the part of the birds; for by
                        them they surely show the female that they consider a certain location
                        suitable for a nest, and with her consent, will begin building. Our male
                        song sparrows always try to dominate the nesting site; while in the hedge,
                        pairs of these birds are always close together, <pb id="VAA2374-285" n="272"
                        /> but it is the female that makes the final choice, and drops the first
                        twig on or coils a hair in the place selected. How far she has been
                        influenced by the male in her selection, no one knows certainly.</p>
                    <p>On this point my experience differs from some nature writers&apos;. I
                        have photographed hundreds of nests; many of them I have <hi rend="i"
                            >watched</hi> in the course of construction; while by the hundred I have
                        carefully picked them to pieces after the birds have finished with them to
                        see exactly what they contain and how they are woven; so I know I am right
                        in the cases with which I am familiar, and to which I confine myself.</p>
                    <p>The female of tree, bush and some ground builders constructs her nest, by
                        laying a foundation of mud, if she is of the turdidae family, omitting the
                        mud if she is a sparrow, finch or warbler. Then she holds her breast as a
                        model, around which she packs her chosen material as she turns while
                        building the walls; but the male almost always helps carry material. He
                        brings his contributions and drops them on the nest, while the female places
                        and builds them in. On a few occasions, in the absence of the female, I have
                        seen a male enter a half-completed nest and try to place material. He was
                        always picked and chased away immediately on her return, as if he were doing
                        something improper, except in the case of orioles. Their nests are so large,
                        so intricate, that the females <pb id="VAA2374-286" n="273"/> seem glad for
                        all the help offered them. The real nest of an oriole, inside the covering
                        purse of plant fibre and string, contains as much fine material, carefully
                        placed, as the average bird structure. The weaving of the hammock necessary
                        to support it is all extra work.</p>
                    <p>Male wrens are credited with being great workers at nest building by writers
                        of theory who lack experience with the habits of the birds. As this matter
                        never has been rightly explained, it is time someone told the truth about
                        it. We often read articles by writers, who tell about the patient, little
                        male wren carrying sticks and twigs for his nest. <hi rend="i">There is not
                            a twig in the nest of a wren.</hi> I have examined them by the dozens.
                        Their nest is a tiny cup, woven of hair and down, often arched with chicken
                        feathers. The truth is this: almost every box placed for wrens is much too
                        large for their soft, tiny nest; so the male wren spends all the time
                        preceding the coming of his mate, tugging at twigs so large he can not
                        always get them into the box, building a barricade between the entrance and
                        the very small space required for his nest. If half a peck is needed, he
                        carries that many, and if the entrance is large enough to admit sparrows and
                        bluebirds, he partially fills it. So when in answer to his persistent song
                        he wins a mate or his mate returns, he can immediately show every wren box
                        on the premises ready for her work on the nest. In the actual building of
                        the nest, he helps no more <pb id="VAA2374-287" n="274"/> than numbers of
                        other male birds. This is the truth of the fallacy for years published and
                        re-published to the effect that the male wren &quot;builds the nest <hi
                            rend="i">before</hi> the female arrives or mates with him,&quot; or
                        that he &quot;builds several false nests,&quot; to deceive people as
                        to his real location.</p>
                    <p>The song sparrow carries material to his mate while she is at workhair and
                        down for liningmaking many trips to horse stables, watering troughs, and cow
                        barns for long tail hairs clinging to entrances, fences, and stalls. When I
                        was a child, Mother&apos;s carriage pair was white, and I always
                        recognized their hair in birds&apos; nests. I even differentiated
                        Ned&apos;s, which was pure white, from Joe&apos;s, which was grey,
                        while the brown work horses had black mane and tail, as did an elder
                        sister&apos;s pony.</p>
                    <p>Male bluebirds sit outside their doors with building material and wait until
                        the female comes out in order that they may enter and place it. The robins,
                        which every year build on the logs of the Cabin, in the vines covering it,
                        and on the near-by trees, both work on their nests; the male carries
                        material, the female carries and builds. All of us see this repeatedly;
                        there can be no mistake about it. Male robins are among the birds that
                        frequently enter half-built nests to place material; the females always make
                        an angry dart at them when they catch them doing it, clearly proving that
                        the hen considers it her province to build the nest.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-288" n="275"/>
                    <p>My husband and I once watched the building of a pair of indigo bluebirds.
                        Attracted by the songs from a bird-house in the conservatory, the bluebirds
                        settled in a honeysuckle nearby, where we watched their construction while
                        we worked among the flowers. Both birds carried material, the female
                        building. They used what grass they could find, loose bark of the
                        honeysuckle, and dry leaves beneath it, with the result that their nest was
                        the largest and loosest that I ever saw built by their species.</p>
                    <p>The martins carry quantities of dead twigs broken from tree tops, and at the
                        Cabin, south, stripped the top of a pear tree bare of green leaves, but at
                        the height of their box on the windmill, I could not tell whether the work
                        was done by males, females, or both. I was puzzled as to what use they made
                        of all of the green leaves they carried, until I climbed to their location
                        to clean sparrow nests from the house, and found the martin nests in
                        construction as green as fresh leaves would make them. All of the birds flew
                        ceaselessly, and I am sure that all of them work.</p>
                    <p>Among birds of the woods, where male and female are very similar in
                        colouring, such as cuckoos, all thrushes, and catbirds, the only way to tell
                        whether the male and female both work is to see both birds at a nest with
                        building material at the same time. This I have seen in the cases of
                        catbirds, thrushes, and doves, but never cuckoos.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-289" n="276"/>
                    <p>The male catbird keeps near his mate after their union and carries twigs,
                        fine roots, leaves, and grass for their nest.</p>
                    <p>Both brown thrashers carry coarse sticks for the base and finer material for
                        the lining of their nest, and the female builds in rare instances on the
                        ground, always very low in brush heaps or thorn trees.</p>
                    <p>One spring, I watched almost the entire construction of the nest of a wood
                        thrush. When I found the location the birds had worked only a short time.
                        Clay had been spread over the branching of two stout limbs on a scrub elm
                        bush and on it was laid a handful of fine roots, thready and fibrous. In
                        collecting abandoned nests, I find clay to be very common, especially among
                        the turdidae family. The following day, the female mounted this heap,
                        pressed down, worked out a hollow in the middle, shaped it to her breast,
                        and interwove loose ends. The male brought her a quantity of fine sticks and
                        twigs which she worked in around the base. Often she left the nest and flew
                        for some particular bit of material she wanted. The third day she daubed the
                        inside with clay, lined it with dry grass blades, and deposited the first
                        egg. The building of this nest required three days&apos; work on the
                        part of both birds, from nine in the morning until three in the afternoon.
                        Substituting different material used by different species, the history of
                        the making of this nest is <pb id="VAA2374-290" n="277"/>

                    <p>I can almost hear someone asking: &quot;Why didn&apos;t you make a
                        series of studies of the building of that nest?&quot; Impossible! Almost
                        every nest location chosen is in deep shade, among branches and twigs; the
                        building birds move constantly and in a tremor of anxiety. At no other time
                        in their lives are they so shy, secretive, suspicious of man and animal as
                        when building. There is no light for a snap-shot, and too much movement for
                        a time exposure. If a camera could be so hidden that the birds would not
                        discover it, it would be utterly impossible to let in sufficient light to
                        reproduce motion, before the birds have brooded until their eggs have
                        quickened, at which time they will risk much to stay on their nests. When
                        building they are abnormally shy and discreet, and will desert a location,
                        often if they merely feel that it has been discovered. Any attempt to work
                        around a nest in the course of construction would instantly cause the bird
                        to desert and change building sites.</p>
                    <p>A dove&apos;s nest is a ramshackle structure containing only a small
                        amount of material; the male keeps close and helps carry the few small
                        sticks and twigs used. The customary location is about the height of or
                        slightly above the top of the average rail fence. Some nest on fences
                        sheltered by bushes, some in brush heaps lower, some in thorn and wild crab
                        bushes higher. One pair of doves on a fence on the <pb id="VAA2374-292"
                            n="279"/> Wabash, having had a low nest destroyed by grazing cattle, at
                        once set about building the highest dove nest I ever have seen, on an elm
                        branch at least thirty feet above ground.</p>
                    <p>I never have seen cuckoos building, but their nest is such an artless,
                        loosely constructed affair, composed of such a small handful of twigs that
                        it would be no tax if the female carried the material and built alone. Twice
                        in work with perhaps a dozen cuckoo nests, I have come across the abandoned
                        nests of other birds that cuckoos have relined and used. One was the nest of
                        a shitepoke, and the other the nest of a robin. I notice that several
                        writers on natural history describe the cuckoo&apos;s nest as
                        &quot;filthy.&quot; I have examined them by the dozen in my
                        lifetime, reproduced at least a dozen, and never have I found a soiled nest.
                        I can produce many pictures in proof of this taken even so late as on the
                        day the young leave home.</p>
                    <p>Only a few days ago I read the amazing statement that some of our cuckoos,
                        like their European relatives and our cowbirds, impose their eggs upon the
                        mercy of other birds. It was especially specified that the nests of robins,
                        catbirds, and others having an egg very similar were chosen. Never have I
                        seen or heard of such a thing as a young cuckoo in the nest of a robin,
                        catbird, or any other bird. I should have to be very thoroughly
                        &quot;shown&quot; before I should believe that these writers are not
                        mistaking the first very large egg of a <pb id="VAA2374-293" n="280"/> young
                        robin or catbird in her first nesting for the larger cuckoo egg. Nor have I
                        ever seen a cuckoo give the slightest attention to the nest of any other
                        bird. Cuckoos are lovely in colouring, sedate and calm in temperament, and
                        invaluable in any orchard, as one cuckoo crop was found to contain two
                        hundred and fifty tent caterpillars, which few other birds take on account
                        of the hairs, and two hundred and seventeen fall web-worms. The cuckoo is
                        suited to feeding on caterpillars, as he has a thin, flexible gizzard,
                        especially designed for disposing of hair.</p>
                    <p>One recent European writer says that the European cuckoo places its eggs in
                        the nests of other birds with its beak, implying that it lays them elsewhere
                        and then carries them to the nests selected. This, I gravely doubt. The
                        birds of my experience have the same habits and characteristics as the
                        European species, but I never see them carrying their young and their eggs
                        through the woods in their beaks. Our cowbirds that have the European
                        cuckoo&apos;s habit stand astride the nests of smaller birds and drop
                        their eggs where they want them. The old wood duck does not carry her young,
                        but gives a signal cry, at which they tumble from the nest and scamper to
                        the water. The only egg or bird I ever see in the beak of another bird is
                        being eaten.</p>
                    <p>Nothing but energetic work on the part of both birds could complete in a
                        reasonable time the deep, compact cup of the goldfinch or the summer
                        yellow-bird, <pb id="VAA2374-294" n="281"/> the thick felt-like nest of the
                        black masked warbler, or the pendent purse of the oriole. Picked to pieces,
                        the nests of these small birds prove that they contain half a peck of moss,
                        fibre, fine roots, down, hair, wool, et cetera.</p>
                    <p>I once watched a pair of orioles building their nest. The first day both
                        birds carried material that looked at the height selected like excelsior and
                        hung it under and over a small elm twig. The second day, the female worked
                        her way into the heart of the hanging mass and began pushing it from her on
                        all sides and lashing it over the twigs above her, while the male constantly
                        carried material to her. The hammock was finished, and on the third day the
                        nest was built inside and an egg deposited, I think. Of course I could not
                        see, but the young arrived allowing that day as the beginning of incubation.</p>
                    <p>The rose-breasted grosbeak breaks off and carries most of the dead dry
                        curlers of wild grape, of which her artless nest is constructed. The male
                        frequently enters a nest and tries to help build. Usually he is picked when
                        he does it, but then he is a hen-pecked husband anyway.</p>
                    <p>The cardinal is quite willing to help build his nest, but his disposition is
                        so fiery and he becomes so excited that he accomplishes very little actual
                        work, often betraying a location and driving his exasperated mate to begin
                        work anew in a more secluded spot.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-295" n="282"/>
                    <p>I have one wood-thrush nest study, in which the entire nest is made from the
                        fine, red roots of wild raspberries and nettles. These were dug fresh, woven
                        into the nest while wet, and lined with very fine roots of the same. When
                        dry, the complete structure was a bright red brown, nearly as hard as spun
                        glass, and with the full clutch of blue eggs made one of the loveliest nests
                        I have ever pictured.</p>
                    <p>Enlargement of several kingfisher negatives, where the male and female appear
                        on one plate, proves that the beak of the male was more scarred than that of
                        the female, from working out their tunnel in the back wall of an abandoned
                        gravel pit. There can be no question of the male&apos;s having performed
                        the greater share of the work on their home. The wall opening of the tunnel
                        to the nest was three feet from the top of the quarry, six inches wide, four
                        high, and five feet long. When the excavation reached this length, it turned
                        sharply to the right, and a room about the size of a boy&apos;s
                        flat-crowned straw hat had been made. All the stones, gravel, and clay in
                        the hard wall that had been loosened had been pushed the length of the
                        tunnel and formed a heap as big as a bushel basket eight feet below, on the
                        edge of a frog pond. Some believe that all this earth and stone is carried
                        out in the beaks of the birds, but this seems incredible; while the
                        appearance of the heap suggested that it had been shoved out. The bottom of
                        the tunnel was concave the size of the birds&apos; <pb id="VAA2374-296"

                    </p>
                    <p>The sitting room was large enough for the male to share it at night. The nest
                        was a rim of fish bones, crayfish shells, grasshopper bones, and berry seeds
                        that the brooding bird had regurgitated in a wall around her. After the
                        young were a few days old, I dug into the tunnel, where it entered the nest,
                        cutting out a piece of surface sod, and arranged a board to support it. In
                        this way, I had access to the nest while the old birds were fishing. I
                        frequently removed and photographed the young. At the same time, I began
                        training the old birds to become accustomed to a camera, focused on their
                        location from the top of a tall ladder, set up in the frog pond below the
                        nest. During the winter, the rains ran into the opening I had made, causing
                        the tunnel to cave in. On their return in the spring, the same pair of birds
                        dug another tunnel and nest not two feet north of and on a line with the
                        first. The face of the wall from a distance looked like that of a frowning
                        giant, having deeply set eyes. I always have felt rather conscience stricken
                        over imposing this second task of tunnelling on these birds. They surely
                        were experts, taking turns at the work and completing the heavy task in ten
                        days.</p>
                    <p>I never have seen larks or bobolinks construct their nests, so I do not know
                        whether these males work. I should think probably not. There is <pb
                            id="VAA2374-298" n="285"/> little they could do. Their nest is built by
                        the female sitting down and turning around until she has a small hollow
                        worked out in the earth, which she lines with bits of dead leaves and grass,
                        picked up near her, and slightly arched with growing things pulled together
                        above her; at times the nest is wide open. Bobolinks love to build in clover
                        fields, larks in grasses.</p>
                    <p>The quail I have seen build, and she does it in this way and alone; although
                        the male remains near her and is very faithful in the care of an emerged
                        brood. The hen broods twenty-four days, during which time rankly growing
                        fence corner grasses envelop her, each day hiding her more completely.</p>
                    <p>Chats, flycatchers, and vireos build in trees such elaborate nests that it is
                        probable that the male does a large share of carrying material at least.</p>
                    <p>The daintiest nest I ever have seen is that of a hummingbird in my
                        possession. It is set on a limb scarcely larger than a lead pencil, a
                        shallow cup that a silver dollar will cover, the outside walls covered with
                        bits of lichen bound on with cobwebs, the interior lined with chestnut burr
                        down, as fine as silk velvet.</p>
                    <p>Next to this comes a gnatcatcher nest, slightly larger, higher in side walls,
                        with moss lining, and the outside very similar.</p>
                    <p>The nest of a wood pewee is larger in circumference, lower in side wall,
                        similar in lichen covering <pb id="VAA2374-299" n="286"/> with cobweb
                        fastenings. All these nests appear like small knots on the limbs where they
                        are placed. All of them are wonderful examples of the highest art in nest
                        building and perfect examples of protective colouration.</p>
                    <p>The nests of warblers are tiny, hair-lined cups, while goldfinches and indigo
                        birds build deep cups of many different fine materials in crotches or where
                        small twigs branch. The yellow-breasted chat builds in the same manner using
                        slightly coarser materials. She is credited with introducing an occasional
                        cast snake skin, as do the wood thrush and crested fly-catcher.</p>
                    <p>No birds build lovelier nests than the vireo family, which lash a perfectly
                        round cup by its rim at the intersection of small twigs, and then
                        deliberately decorate its exterior with spider-webs in clots, and the finest
                        outside birch peelings like silk tissue.</p>
                    <p>So lavish are these birds in the use of cobweb festoons that the possibility
                        is suggested that they are intended to trap tiny flies and insects.</p>
                    <p>Orchard orioles use lengths of grass for their pendent purse; Baltimores,
                        plant fibre and string. As birds increase in size, they use heavier material
                        up to the big, coarse structures of hawks, herons, or eagles.</p>
                    <p>Among the &quot;lilies&quot; of the bird field that neither
                        &quot;toil&quot; nor &quot;spin&quot; are the males of marsh
                        and water birds that are ground builders, such as the <pb id="VAA2374-300"
                            n="287"/> coot, grebe, rail, and duck. Take the rail for an example.
                        Undoubtedly the choice of a location depends upon the fact that a certain
                        spot slightly above water offers all the material required for a nest. The
                        female snips the green blades of this year&apos;s grass from as large a
                        place as she wishes for her nest. Then she steps in among the crisp, dead
                        grasses of last year, breaks them off with her feet, and sitting down turns
                        around repeatedly, at the same time gathering all dry grass blades with her
                        beak and working them into a slight rim around her breast. Then she catches
                        this year&apos;s green, growing blades outside her location above her
                        head, and literally ties them into knots. With material needed in reach, and
                        granted that the female is the architect, really there is nothing for the
                        male to do. The case is similar with the other water birds mentioned.</p>
                    <p>The experience of my whole life afield, all my convictions based on hints and
                        glimpses, and all the proof that can be adduced from my negative closet show
                        that the tie between birds is strong enough that the male helps build the
                        nest, frequently carries morsels of food to the brooding mother, especially
                        in the first days after the emergence of the young, when they must be fed
                        and are too tender to be left uncovered; he remains close to his family at
                        all times, holding himself ready to risk his life for his nest, in case of
                        an attack of any kind. The nest is the objective point around which both <pb

                        them until they look as large as their parents. I have had <hi rend="i">much

                        every time I set up a camera before a bird home, I have the <hi rend="i"

                        my lens. Several times I have photographed a male bird standing guard on the
                        edge of a nest containing eggs, and once as he entered a nest to brood while
                        his mate went to bathe and drink.</p>
                    <p>After lending what assistance they can in nest building, most males select
                        two locations nearby, and when not feeding and exercising they sing to their
                        brooding mates. One indigo bluebird, whose mate brooded in a clump of
                        horse-weeds along the levee between the Wabash and the outlet of the
                        Limberlost, sang so persistently from one stretch of telephone wire nearest
                        his nest that for all of one season, I could take friends from cities there
                        and tell them with all assurance that they would see and hear him.</p>
                    <p>It was the persistent singing, from one branch, of a male wood thrush that
                        led me to his location and a series of the affairs of his life. The
                        rose-breasted grosbeak sings morning and evening near his mate, and when he
                        relieves her while she goes for her morning bath and food, he resignedly
                        enters the nest and settles himself to brood until noon, which is what I
                        meant by calling him a hen-pecked husband. Most male grosbeaks can be found
                            <hi rend="i">brooding every morning</hi> between nine and twelve. I have
                        recorded this repeatedly.</p>
                    <p>If a dove does not brood on his eggs, he spends hours brooding beside his
                        mate, as near her as he can crowd. Bobolinks keep close to their mates, <pb
                            id="VAA2374-303" n="290"/> and their bubbling song and chatter are
                        unending. What a treat it would be, if we could have what they are saying
                        translated for our understanding!</p>
                    <p>The material birds use in building, manifestly must be what their locations
                        afford. As a rule, there is nothing they can use except twigs, leaves,
                        grass, plant fibre, roots, bark, mud, lichens, moss, snake skins, thistle
                        and milkweed down, and cobwebs in the woods; and these same things combined
                        with wool, string, rags, papers, horse-hair, and feathers in the fields.
                        Because they must use these things or build no nest, they use them. But
                        their use of them does not prove that if they could go into a store and buy
                        a yard of yellow and red calico and tear it into strips for nest material,
                        they would not be delighted to do so; for by every act of their lives the
                        birds prove that they appreciate colour.</p>
                    <p>I am aware of the fact that in all probability that statement will be
                        challenged; but I am ready for the challenge. If birds do not appreciate the
                        gaudy colours on their backs and love to flaunt in the open showing
                        themselves before men, how does it happen that cardinals, orioles, bluejays,
                        bluebirds, goldfinches, rose-breasted grosbeaks, tanagers, and almost
                        without exception our brightest birds live in the open and are constantly
                        seen; while thrushes, cuckoos, doves, and birds of sombre colour seek the
                        deep wood and slip around as if in hiding?</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-304" n="291"/>
                    <p>If there were any such thing as &quot;instinct&quot; in this matter,
                        these inconspicuous birds, perfect examples of protective colouration, would
                        be the ones to live by roadside and stream, where their colour would save
                        their lives; and the bright birds would hide in deep wood and slip around
                        unnoticed, for every flash of their gay colour in a public place is a
                        challenge to unprincipled gunners. But who ever heard of a cardinal
                        &quot;slipping&quot; in any location? He is generally in the most
                        conspicuous place, displaying himself before men. It seems as if the
                        bobolink dances on the fences, and literally <hi rend="i">rubs</hi> himself
                        into one&apos;s attention. Every brilliant bird is out where he will <hi
                            rend="i">show</hi>, and if one does not see him, he manages to make
                        sufficient disturbance or call one&apos;s attention with his song. Did
                        you ever see a peacock after his tail had been plucked? I have known them to
                        be so ashamed, so humbled over their loss that they hide until they almost
                        starve to death before they will show themselves in the open to take food.
                        Does anyone, who has ever seen a peacock strut, doubt that the bird is proud
                        of his tail or that he suffers near to death on losing it? Birds of the open
                        evolved in the open. Their native food and nest locations are there. Bright
                        light produced the gay plumage on birds, just as it produced the strongest
                        yellows, reds, and blues on flower faces of the open swamps and fields, and
                        kept the fragile, pale ones in deep shade.</p>

                    <p>Of the hundreds of nests of which I have made studies, and picked to pieces
                        after the birds have finished with them, <hi rend="i">every nest</hi> proves
                        that birds, even the shy, slipping, deep wood creatures, avail themselves of
                            <hi rend="i">bright material</hi> wherever possible. I have seen summer
                        yellow-birds use so much milkweed down that their nests fell prey to crows
                        and hawks on account of being so conspicuous. After building a pendent cup,
                        firmly timbered and lashed to a branching limb, red-eyed vireos festoon
                        cobwebs over the front of it; and before a set camera, one bird added fresh
                        cobwebs to a nest from which one of her young had already taken wing. The
                        cobweb was simply draped over the front of the nest, and not used to bind on
                        outer covering or lash a nest to a limb, as cobwebs are used by flycatchers
                        and hummingbirds. This nest also had curious tiny seed pods stuck over the
                        front of it, for purely ornamental purposes.</p>
                    <p>A small collection of the nests of vireos was sent me from Cuttingsville,
                        Vermont, in 1918. The home of the warbling vireo was gay with the delicate,
                        white tissue of the outer bark of birch trees and cobwebs draped over the
                        pale fawn colour of the primary decorations, among which were several bits
                        of newspaper. On one of these, the words, &quot;clock for
                        mantle&quot; could be read distinctly. The house of the red-eye was much
                        the same only whiter; while the yellow-throat used none of the coloured
                        bark, almost completely covering the <pb id="VAA2374-306" n="293"/>

                        impossible to distinguish from their surroundings, had it not been for the
                        lavish use of conspicuous material.</p>
                    <p>Shrikes use so many chicken feathers around their nest rims that they
                        sometimes infest their young with lice, and one shrike nest I reproduced had
                        a roll of grey wool at the top.</p>
                    <p>One kingbird nest was conspicuous on account of the use of large tufts of
                        black and white wool and cotton cord strung around but serving no purpose.
                        Wood thrushes and chats use cast snake skins, which are showier than most
                        nest material. These skins are no component part of the nest, but festooned
                        over the outside as an ornament; and so far as I can learn, are used only by
                        these birds and crested flycatchers which build in hollow trees. It has been
                        suggested that these birds use the snake skin as a means of protection to
                        their nests, but this grants the birds power to plan and think. However,
                        there is some reason why only these three birds use the skins, which I
                        frequently find afield but never in the nests of other birds. Very peculiar
                        things, which evidently have been carried from houses some distance away,
                        can be found in quite secluded nests.</p>
                    <p>Many women can testify to having had orioles snatch bits of bright ribbon and

                        <pb id="VAA2374-310" n="297"/> I went to my front veranda one spring to wipe
                        a soiled place from a window. Someone called me inside, so I laid my cloth
                        on the railing, and went to see what was wanted. On my return the cloth had
                        vanished; after a thorough search, I discovered a pair of robins gleefully
                        tugging at it on the branch of a big elm tree nearby. It served as a part of
                        the foundation of their nest. Luckily, they found it so early in their work
                        that the other material almost covered it; the nest was not so conspicuous
                        as I feared it would be. One summer, a pair of robins that had previously
                        built two nests of material gathered in the orchard, near the Cabin, south,
                        had just laid the foundations of a third nest in a plum tree beside my
                        bedroom window, when they discovered a bundle of long, white, newspaper
                        trimmings that had been used for packing. Instantly those birds abandoned
                        what would have been considered &quot;instinctive&quot; or natural
                        material, and with such chatter and excitement as I never before heard from
                        brooding birds, both of them attacked the paper. They had to fly much
                        farther to secure it than the material they had been using, while it was in
                        long strips, troublesome to carry and place. Tags two feet long streamed
                        from the birds as they flew and the completed nest on all sides. This paper
                        and mud to hold it were the only materials used after its discovery. The
                        nest was as large as a half-peek measure and snow white. It was so
                        conspicuous that it required <pb id="VAA2374-311" n="298"/> constant
                        watching by all of us to protect it from sparrows, jays, hawks, owls, and
                        cats attracted by it. All winter it stood, while rains and winds did their
                        worst. The following March that nest remained the most prominent feature of
                        the backyard.</p>
                    <p>Anyone who desires can prove for himself that the birds will leave such
                        material as they can glean from nature, and build a nest rivalling the
                        rainbow, by cutting bright rags and string and scattering them over the
                        ground and bushes, where nest material is being gathered. Understand, I am
                        not <hi rend="i">advising</hi> people to do this systematically, for every
                        particle of bright material used in the construction of a nest advertises it
                        to all of its natural enemies. I am only pointing out how my statement can
                        be proved if doubted.</p>
                    <p>I have gone further and placed gaudy rags and yarn beside twine and plain
                        colours. The birds see the plain material, because they use it, after the
                        last shred of bright stuff is gone. Here is another problem for believers in
                        instinct only. If birds build by instinct, why do they persist in using
                        bright stuff, foreign to natural selection, that will inevitably end in the
                        destruction of their nests?</p>
                    <p>Not only do birds build of surprising material when they have the
                        opportunity, but they build in queer places, without question foolishly
                        chosen. If &quot;instinct&quot; guides their selection then it is
                        often sadly at fault. I find nests on the ground where <pb id="VAA2374-312"

                        by herds of cattle, overturned with the plow, torn by hay rakes or reapers.
                        Often they are on bridges and fences, where they are picked to pieces by the
                        first passing boy. They are in bushes in plain sight of roads and pathways,
                        when if placed a few yards farther back, they would be effectually
                        concealed. Birds build in clearings, where the trees are falling fast, and
                        it would seem that any degree of foresight would teach them that their tree
                        would go next. Once, in a clearing, a pair of doves built a nest in a brush
                        heap and the hen deposited her eggs, between the time the cuttings were
                        stacked and the workers were ready to apply the torch. Luckily, that nest
                        was on our land and I could order the workers to leave the heap and give it
                        all possible protection, or that nest would have been burned three days
                        after it was built. A pair of wrens built in a sprinkling can that was hung
                        in a tree to drain, and a pair of robins on the cross beam of a hay rake
                        left standing in an open field. I previously described the nest built on a
                        freight car. Last summer, I was called to the backyard of a neighbour to
                        take a picture of a nest of a wren, built in the hip pocket of a pair of
                        trousers hung on the line. The garment was left until the wrens had finished
                        with it.</p>
                    <p>On our dock at the Cabin, north, during the summer of 1918, I ran my hand
                        into a bait can left standing a few hoursone of the small tin cans four <pb
                            id="VAA2374-314" n="301"/> and one half inches high and three inches in
                        diameterand found it contained the nest of a bird. I thought it had been
                        placed there by some member of my family for a joke. I thought possibly my
                        driver had found it and put it where he thought I should be sure to notice
                        it; but most of all, I thought it looked so dainty, so fresh, so fitted to
                        its place that, although I knew the can was half full of fresh grub and
                        living angle worms, I stood it back on the seat where I found it. Inquiry
                        elicited the fact that no member of my family knew anything about it. The
                        next day, the cook, fishing from the dock, reported that she saw one of the
                        prettiest little yellow birds she ever had seen enter the can. I went to
                        see, flushed a prothonotary warbler, and found an egg. The next day she
                        failed to deposit an egg; the following three consecutive days she filled
                        out the clutch, then brooded, and reared her young, which all left the dock
                        safely, All the time, the bait can stood on a seat running along one side of
                        the dock. Many birds bring off broods from the most unwisely chosen
                        locations. Every year I see nests destroyed in large numbers through the
                        injudicious site selected by the builders.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, nests can be found adroitly placed in such secure
                        positions that the only way one ever finds them is by stumbling over them. I
                        have known many birds that brought off full broods in trampled pastures, by
                        locating under the base leaves of big pasture thistles, under logs, <pb

                        build in the open, others hide in deep wood and conceal nests with a
                        foresight which seems uncanny. It is certain that birds learn by experience.
                        One is left to wonder in summing up if there are not wise and foolish birds,
                        and if these nests in ill-chosen places are not the first attempts of last
                        year&apos;s birds that will learn by experience.</p>
                    <p>Bird architecture proves experience and even wisdom on the part of some
                        builders. I have in my possession the nest of an oriole, built like every
                        other nest of its kind save that under the limb to which it is fastened
                        there is framed a window large enough to admit the bird&apos;s head for
                        light and air, and if necessary it could be used for egress. The nest was in
                        a cottonwood, and the limbs were large and heavy for oriole use. The limb to
                        which the nest was attached formed the upper sash, the lower was a loop of
                        cotton cord, firm and strong. Over this loop, the nest material was passed
                        and drawn down into the body of the nest so closely that it was more deftly
                        finished than at the top. Evidently the builder had decided on having this
                        window, for a first attempt too high for use had been begun and abandoned
                        for this one at just the right height.</p>
                    <p>It was impossible for this oriole to build this window without knowing for
                        what purpose she intended using it; in fact, it required thought to plan and
                        construct it. She had to remember the <pb id="VAA2374-317" n="304"/>
                        confinement and inconvenience of former nests, and determine that in the
                        future she would obviate these difficulties. So remembering the past and
                        providing for the future, in this nest she built a window. She did not build
                        it &quot;instinctively&quot; or the trees would be full of oriole
                        nests with windows. She was in advance of her time, and if her progeny
                        follow her example, coming generations may see all orioles building windows.
                        This certainly would be an improvement, for as these nests are built at
                        present the brooding bird is dropped into a deep purse, with no ventilation
                        except at the top, and no way to see a threatening danger in time to avoid
                        it. How this bird must have enjoyed sitting with her head out of the window
                        while she brooded, thus having light and air and seeing any danger to be
                        avoided! Moreover, if she did make this window large enough to admit the
                        passing of her body, as it appears to be, it would furnish her a chance to
                        escape in case she was attacked by a night hawk or screech owl at the top of
                        her nest. In the construction of the hammock for this nest the bird carried
                        a piece of cotton cord from the nest, passed it around a limb, tied it into
                        slip knots and then incorporated the loose end in the body of the nest. It
                        can also be proven that the window idea is beginning to exist among birds,
                        for after six years of search among the trees around the Cabins I found
                        evidence that another oriole made the same attempt, but not very
                        successfully <pb id="VAA2374-318" n="305"/> as her window was planned in the
                        same way but was too small for use. Disappointed in this the bird then <hi
                            rend="i">greatly shortened the length of the hammock</hi> in which her
                        nest swung, so that she could brood with her head free. There is no room for
                        argument about these nests; their structure proves what I record of them.</p>
                    <p>A careful study of building and brooding birds, at least in the intimate
                        relations required in making photographic studies of them, will convince
                        most people that different birds of the same species have different degrees
                        of mentality and different characteristics. Some are friendly and confiding,
                        and soon learn to trust one. Some are so nervous and wild it takes patient
                        work to win their confidence, and some can not be won at all. Some build in
                        well-chosen places and make their work secure, and some select their
                        locations so unwisely they see their nest destroyed before it is complete;
                        so it goes, very like humanity after all.</p>

                        <unclear>prehistori-</unclear> slime, later developing feathers, are older
                        than man. These early birds had heavy jaws, teeth set in sockets, clawlike
                        fingers on the first wing joint, and long, jointed tails having feathers
                        running down each side. Coming down through the ages since that time, our
                        birds of to-day have lost their teeth through lack of necessity for them;
                        have developed such power of flight that the wing claws have become useless
                        and vanished until they are now represented by only a tiny, blunt tip at the
                        first joint; the encumbering jointed tail has contracted in almost every
                        species to an inch or less of tiny, closely set vertebrae, while miraculous
                        power of flight has developed.</p>
                    <p>Birds that remained on the water evolved flat, boat breasts for swimming,
                        grew webbing between their toes to make them efficient paddles, and
                        shovel-like bills for scooping up wet, wormy food. In sharp contrast with
                        them, the birds of the shore line grew narrow, slender bodies, extremely
                        long legs developed from constant wading, no webbing <pb id="VAA2374-321"
                            n="308"/> between the toes, remarkably long pointed beaks, designed for
                        probing for food among the stalks of growing rushes and watery
                        vegetationsuch birds as storks, cranes, and herons.</p>
                    <p>Birds that sought the mountains and remote places grew wide tireless wings,
                        eyes of magic from constantly sighting food at long distances, and stout,
                        sharply hooked beaks for tearing it up. Those that homed in caves and hollow
                        trees in their dark confinement developed enormous eyes, surrounded by
                        feather reflectors, softly feathered short wings, stout feet for seizing
                        prey, and thick necks with wide gullets for swallowing what they captured
                        whole.</p>
                    <p>Then a large body of small birds that took to the open country evolved, some
                        the long sharp beaks of fruit-eaters; some the hard short beaks of
                        seed-eaters; all bright eyes, great agility on wing; in most families,
                        exquisite song.</p>
                    <p>As our planet shook itself together, settled, and took up the business of
                        following an orbit, it began growing fruit and vegetables, which developed
                        seed, while revolution and rotation resulted in changing climatic conditions
                        until the birds acquired the habit of following the seasons from north to
                        south in search of the food suitable to each species.</p>
                    <p>It would be foolish to claim that our birds of to-day have learned nothing
                        during all these ages of constant change. Man has evolved from his <pb
                            id="VAA2374-322" n="309"/> cave or his garden, to his present state of
                        form, feature, and accomplishment. Equal to, if not antedating him, the
                        birds have kept pace with him in evolution, the difference being that man
                        develops after the manner of human beings, while birds develop after the
                        manner of their kind. Man is endowed with a reasoning, thinking brain, which
                        grows more capable by being used through the ages. The birds are equally
                        well endowed after a different manner. It is not theirs to reason and think
                        as man does, yet if left in wholly natural conditions the birds know more
                        than man. Man becomes lost in a trackless waste; the birds know the way
                        across great deserts or a thousand miles of water. Man has often starved in
                        the open; the birds know what food they may take with safety. Man learns
                        through his own experience and by heeding the experience of his ancestors.
                        The birds learn a different lesson which is their birthright. How much they
                        know, we can only guess by what they do. We can know how far they fly
                        through a close study of migration. We learn how far they can see when we
                        watch a hawk or eagle drop unerringly from the clouds and snatch up a snake
                        from earth.</p>
                    <p>We know of their devotion to each other, because we constantly see birds
                        risking their lives in defense of a mate or nestling. We know that they can
                        communicate with each other, because we constantly hear them call and
                        answer, see numbers <pb id="VAA2374-323" n="310"/> of them aroused by the
                        curiosity of one, see a whole flock take wing at the warning of one, see
                        them fight over food, see them exhibit the very human attributes of love,
                        anger, greed, suspicion, curiosity, pride, et cetera.</p>
                    <p>We know that they have a spine, on the top of which sits a skull, enclosing a
                        brain, also provided with fine eyes and a beak for taking food and to be
                        used in self-defense. To what extent a bird uses its brain, it is impossible
                        for a human being to state. Whether we believe that birds act solely upon
                        &quot;instinct&quot; or exercise the brain, as they do the eyes,
                        feet, wings, and the remainder of their anatomy, we are all forced to
                        concede one thing: no matter by what name we call it, <hi rend="i">the birds
                            know</hi>. Exactly how <hi rend="i">much</hi> they know, and exactly <hi
                            rend="i">how</hi> they know it, we can only surmise. This thing is sure:
                        as the ages go by, they are gradually improving, even as man progresses.
                        Since the birds&apos; ancestors crawled from the water and took up life
                        upon the land, they have fallen into divisions, based upon the locations in
                        which they remained. These divisions have now become so distinct that the
                        form and habit of each bird are suited to life upon the water, on shore, or
                        mountain, or in the cave, hollow tree, or field. They have learned to
                        migrate, to build their nests, and what to feed their young, each after its
                        kind. They are not the same creatures that crept from the original slime of
                        things to begin life that had flight as <pb id="VAA2374-324" n="311"/> the
                        eventual means of transportation. They have moved forward in a slow, steady
                        progression, directed by a form of knowledge the source of which we can not
                        divine, since they are birds and we are human beings.</p>
                    <p>We feel that the birds are closer kin, of greater interest, more nearly
                        paralleling our life processes than are forms of life lower than they. Yet
                        to all lower life, no matter how lowly, we must grant the power to know how
                        to live after the habits and characteristics of its kind. The life processes
                        of a bee or ant are more complicated than those of a bird, yet these tiny
                        creatures, which would make the average bird but a small mouthful, have the
                        same knowledge of how to live their lives.</p>
                    <p>There seems to be no room for comparison between an oriole, exquisite in
                        colour, tireless of wing, of beautiful song, weaving her complicated hammock
                        of plant fibre in which to swing the nest for her eggs and young, and a
                        squashy, big caterpillar on a hickory twig beside her. It is difficult to
                        discover eyes, brain, or much power of locomotion in the worm, yet if that
                        caterpillar is taken from its hickory twig and carried a long distance, in
                        case it is a regalis, it will travel in a straight line to the nearest
                        hickory tree, which it will climb, feed through a series of moults to
                        maturity, descend to earth, burrow to a depth of six inches, prepare its
                        winter residence, cast its skin, and take on the form of the moth, which
                        emerges in the spring. <pb id="VAA2374-325" n="312"/> At the proper time,
                        the moth will appear, take wing, mate, find a hickory tree, and deposit her
                        eggs on the undersides of the leaves, which are best suited for food for the
                        tiny caterpillars when they emerge. Then the moth will nestle down in the
                        grasses and pass out, never having taken food herself. The tiny caterpillars
                        leave their shells knowing upon what leaves to feed, how to conduct
                        themselves during a series of moults and how to take their part in all the
                        processes of their lives, even more unerringly than the birds, for I have
                        frequently seen birds make mistakes. I never saw a moth or caterpillar make
                        a mistake, unless it had been subject to some outside interference. Whether
                        the caterpillar of to-day enters a different pupa case or spins a better
                        cocoon than those of the first century, I do not know; but I think they do,
                        since creatures that have performed the same operations since their
                        evolution to the cocoon stage should attain great facility. By several forms
                        of conclusive evidence, I hope to prove that the birds are progressing.</p>
                    <p>The aged Simeon Pease Cheney, for fifty years a professional musician, after
                        a lifetime of bird friendship and study, at the age of sixty-seven, began
                        recording bird songs for a book. Unfortunately, he was unable to complete
                        it. Shortly before his crossing, he used the expression: &quot;The birds
                        improve.&quot; He had reference to the development of their voices from
                        the first guttural squeaks, <pb id="VAA2374-326" n="313"/> screams, and
                        cries of prehistoric forms to the exquisitely modulated notes of to-day,
                        which should go on increasing in number through notes learned from each
                        other and in timbre with the constant use of the vocal chords. I am
                        satisfied that our birds of to-day sing truer to form, more surely modulated
                        notes than the birds of the ancients; while I can not conceive the delicacy,
                        the molten sweetness that ages to come will hear. There is no way to
                        estimate how long the birds have been singing; when we recall that the
                        oldest bit of translation existing in the world is the lament that
                        &quot;the good old times are gone forever,&quot; this seems a very
                        old world indeed.</p>
                    <p>The birds have been building longer, in all probability, than they have been
                        singing. Here a change can be better noted. In my personal experience, it
                        appeals to me that the hummingbirds and gnatcatchers build more nearly
                        perfect nests. I know that the vireos of my childhood went to no such extent
                        in decoration as that family goes to-day. Vireo nests were compact, dainty,
                        and lovely, but I never saw them decorated with unique seed-pods, snow-white
                        festoons of cobweb and birch tissue, and newspaper, as the nests reproduced
                        in this book.</p>
                    <p>The oriole nest with a window is an arresting thing. This nest could not have
                        been built &quot;instinctively&quot; since the bird possessed no
                        inborn instinct to guide her in its construction. It could <pb

                        impression from her ancestors, since they did no such building. It is going
                        beyond any mentality I have ever attributed to a bird in natural history
                        work, but this nest proves a number of separate mental conceptions on the
                        part of the bird. She had to realize the confinement of her usual structure,
                        which gave her no means of escape in case of attack from above. She had to
                        resent her shut-in condition while brooding, and decide that she would try
                        to remedy it. The nest proves her first trial a failure. She outlined a
                        window and began weaving around it; then realized that it was too high for
                        her to brood and use it at the same time. So she abandoned her first effort
                        and designed and completed her window where she could sit on her eggs, and
                        at the same time, have light, air, and a view from her location. Also, the
                        window was large enough to afford her means of escape in case a squirrel or
                        screech owl attacked her from above. This nest was also stayed at one side
                        so it would hold firmly in a gale. Notice the lashing of cord that runs from
                        the nest to the branch which holds it at this twig, where it is plainly tied
                        in two slip knots, then carried back into the body of the nest. The heavier
                        stay wound several times around the top limb outlines the window and is then
                        carried below and looped around the limb, brought back, and woven into the
                        nest. The entire structure gives evidence of extraordinary skill in
                        construction, <pb id="VAA2374-330" n="317"/> resulting from what we should
                        call &quot;original thought and plan&quot; in the case of a human,
                        since the bird to my knowledge had no precedent. If orioles the world over
                        have been building with windows, and tyingslip knots scientists and natural
                        historians have forgotten to mention it.</p>
                    <p>I reproduced two views of this nest in a book of mine, &quot;Friends in
                        Feathers,&quot; <figure entity="VAA2374-62"/> published in 1917. Ever
                        since, I have hunted for oriole nests, hoping to find other birds in
                        rebellion against accepted form, but with no success until the spring of
                        1919, while I was at work on this book, one of my field men brought me the
                        nest here reproduced. This bird had attempted a window and failed. She made
                        it too small and too high. Lacking the ingenuity and brain power of the
                        other bird, yet having the window idea in her head, she compromised by
                        shortening the hammock, in which she swung her nest, until raised by the
                        diameter of her eggs, she could brood and look from the top of the nest.
                        Truly, the old bird lover was right when he said in passing: &quot;The
                        birds improve.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Quite as remarkable as the oriole nests with windows is a double vireo nest,
                        found and photographed by Professor Lynds Jones, ornithologist of Oberlin
                        College, reproduced in Dawson&apos;s &quot;Birds <pb
                            id="VAA2374-331" n="318"/> of Ohio.&quot; Professor Jones found this
                        nest in Iowa, and graciously permits me to reproduce it here. The twin nests
                        would not be so remarkablefemale birds often locate in colonies or near each

                        </figure> but Professor Jones asserts that the double structure was built by
                        one pair, that the female divided her eggs between them in laying, while
                        both male and female were brooding when he found the nest. I can not
                        attribute the work on this structure either to &quot;instinct&quot;
                        or &quot;subconscious mind.&quot; It appeals to me as plain
                        knowledge. The birds surely knew that they were building two nests and why
                        they built them. The hen knew she was laying in two nests and the male bird
                        that he was brooding when <pb id="VAA2374-332" n="319"/> he occupied one of
                        them. Nothing more remarkable than this ever has occurred among the birds to
                        my knowledge. My oriole was the originator of the comfort of a window for
                        the <unclear>-asement</unclear> of labour for her sex, but this vireo in
                        building two nests and halving the labour itself was ahead of her. These
                        signs of the times surely indicate progress in birdland. If our feathered
                        sisters are demanding improved homes and equal sharing of the labour of
                        rearing families, this may be a hint to women who need convenient homes and
                        help in family cares. Let the men &quot;improve&quot; or beware!</p>
                    <p>If I have less to say than might be expected on the subject of what the birds
                        know, consider a moment and you will realize that there is very little
                        anyone can advisedly relate on any phase of bird life outside of nesting
                        time. It must be remembered that for four or five months the birds, which we
                        call ours, are hundreds of miles away; so no one can say certainly where
                        they are or what they are doing. Again, while they are with us, except for
                        the short space of time when they are bound to their nests by the brooding
                        fever, they are shy, wild citizens of all outdoors. No other living
                        creatures have the freedom of the birds, accorded them by their power of
                        swift flight. They spend their lives snatching bits of food here and there,
                        swaying on every inviting twig, playing tag with a friend, in hot pursuit of
                        an enemy, trailing broken notes from every available choirloft, with <pb
                            id="VAA2374-333" n="320"/> us one minute and a mile distant the next.
                        Who can write of them with absolute certainty? Also, in many cases, the
                        sexes are so alike they can not be told apart in freedom without glasses,
                        and when they differ, all males and all females of the same species resemble
                        each other so closely that it is a dubious guess, with the exception of
                        nesting time, as to how long one can observe the same bird.</p>
                    <p>One thing that they know is when to migrate and when to return to us, for
                        there is no question but certain birds do return season after season not
                        only to the same state and county, but to the same vine on the veranda and
                        the same knot-hole under the eaves. What determines the precise minute of
                        their starting to come to us or to leave us, or how they follow their
                        trackless path high in air across seas and continents mostly under cover of
                        darkness, we do not know. The birds must know, since barring disaster, they
                        arrive, prompt to the day and almost to the hour.</p>
                    <p>I often read of &quot;the birds that remain with us in the
                        winter.&quot; The birds that remain with me are very few, confined
                        almost entirely to owls, which if undisturbed will spend a lifetime in one
                        hollow tree. I have other birds in winter, but I have no way of proving that
                        they are the same birds which have been with me during the summer. Instead,
                        I think that it is very probable that they are birds which have spent the
                        summer farther north and now make their migration to us, <pb

                        which guides them and enables them to perform miracles, almost passes the

                        necessary and remain where they are when it is not. For example: during the
                        bitter winter of 191718 when extreme cold began in November and lasted in
                        such prolonged form that we experienced killing frosts in June, there was
                        not a robin <pb id="VAA2374-335" n="322"/> in the swamps and gullies or deep
                        woods surrounding Limberlost Cabin, north. In the unusually mild winter of
                        191819 these birds never left us. In flocks of half a dozen, at any time
                        during the winter, they could be found in the spice thicket back of the
                        garage or in the sheltered ravines, and their appearance indicates that they
                        are living fatly upon dried berries, frozen fruits and vegetables, and food
                        which they pick up in chicken-parks and around the farmers&apos; back
                        doors.</p>
                    <p>Our bluebirds, cardinals, robins, doves, king-fishers, and other hardy ones
                        in our extremely cold winters go farther south, frequently stopping in
                        Kentucky and Tennessee. Often some of the cardinals remain all winter or
                        others come from the north. One of our ministers to Mexico told me that
                        there are cardinal grosbeaks exactly like ours in Old Mexico all the year,
                        but there are <hi rend="i">three times as many there during our winter.</hi>
                        Our wrens, thrushes, bobolinks, and blackbirds proceed to the coast. Our
                        orioles go to Panama, and hummingbirds to Brazil; our kingbirds and some
                        bobolinks go as far south as the West Indies and Bolivia; and most of our
                        warblers stop in Central America; but some of our thrushes go on to Peru;
                        the golden plover ranges to Patagonia, and the knot to Cape Horn. Exactly
                        where the swallows go is their secret. It is supposed to be some island east
                        or west of South America or to some inland cave. So far, no one has learned
                        where they winter.</p>

                    <p>The impulse to migrate is so ingrained in the birds with their evolution
                        through the ages that it is a matter of life and death with them. When
                        migration time comes in the fall, the birds of a family begin flying around,
                        uttering their tribal call until large flocks of them gather. Then with one
                        accord, for the most part under cover of darkness, they take wing and fly
                        until they reach their southern home. In some species, the males leave
                        first. Our ruby-throated hummingbird is accused of deserting his nest while
                        his young are quite small, leaving the female to finish feeding them and
                        remain with them until they learn to fly and care for themselves, and then
                        make the long migration with them. This I doubt. I see ruby-throats over my
                        Oswego tea bed, during August, after the young are as large as their
                        parents. Sometime, for some reason, certain ones of a species remain after
                        the major part of their kind has migrated, and sometimes they are found
                        suffering and helpless with cold, as in the case of a hummingbird previously
                        described.</p>
                    <p>If it is true that birds act subconsciously, performing the act of migration
                        under an impulse they are forced to follow, then we must admit that very
                        frequently they are driven to their death through following a law of their
                        nature. For example: large flocks of several different kinds of birds chose
                        a cold, stormy night in 1881 to cross Lake Michigan. They became chilled,
                        confused by the icy <pb id="VAA2374-338" n="325"/>

                        </figure> winds, until they lost their way, were exhausted, and fell into
                        the lake. For several days following, thousands upon thousands of birds were
                        washed up on the shores of Lake Michigan, covering stretches of miles, where
                        they were examined closely by many bird lovers. One man published an
                        estimate, based on the number counted in a given space, that half a million
                        birds lay drowned on the west shore of Michigan. Now to reverse this
                        instance, in a lesser degree but coming under my own observation: one
                        spring, about 1900, the birds <pb id="VAA2374-339" n="326"/> made their
                        northern migration too early. For ten days immediately following their
                        arrival there was snow a foot deep, unabated cold, and zero weather, so that
                        the birds became so sickened from hunger that they starved and froze in
                        large numbers. They can endure extreme cold; it is lack of food that kills
                        them. There were very few bluebirds and doves that season. The larks came
                        into the barnyards and asked the farmers for food. A number of friends of
                        mine fed larks with their chickens, while for those two weeks I daily
                        carried corn, chop, and table scraps to the Valley of the Wood Robin for the
                        cardinals and other early arrivals more tender than they. One night flight
                        to the south would have saved the lives of thousands of the birds in my
                        immediate vicinity, but once they had migrated they remained to starve and
                        freeze rather than to make the short return trip, which would have saved
                        them. It appeals to me that one could not find clearer proof than this that
                        the birds do migrate at the dictates of a subconscious command. When they
                        receive this command, they change locations, but nothing suggests to them
                        that they could make a return trip for a few days and save themselves. This
                        is a very wonderful thing, when you comprehend it, and it can be carried
                        even further than this. Take, for example, the members of the grebe family.
                        Grebes are migratory birds. They are capable of flight, which carries them
                        in the neighbourhood of a <pb id="VAA2374-340" n="327"/> thousand miles,
                        often farther, but once they have arrived at their destination they will
                        allow themselves to be picked up by hand and killed, but they will not take
                        wing until again moved by the migratory impulse. When they prove that they
                        can fly by having made the long migration, why it is that they will not fly
                        when plume hunters are gathering them up and peeling the skin from throat to
                        vent on the living birds, is one of the secrets of nature which is difficult
                        to learn.</p>
                    <p>Very few birdssome cardinals, for exampleare what might be called walking
                        migrants. They change their locations day by day through easy stages of
                        flight from wood to wood; and again some specimens have been seen collecting
                        in very small flocks and starting their southern migration much in the
                        manner of other birds. When our birds of winter have gone farther south,
                        there come to us from their extreme northern range such birds as the
                        titmouse, song sparrow, cardinal, jay, nut-hatch, flicker, sap-sucker, crow,
                        and sparrow hawk. I am sure that our mated owls remain, and I think our
                        quail do also. Owls that have not mated and found a satisfactory home may
                        change with the seasons until they pair and settle. It is absolutely certain
                        that the birds farther north come as far south as my location at least in
                        winter, for I have seen snow buntings in the woods back of the Cabin, north;
                        and in one instance there was brought to our <pb id="VAA2374-341" n="328"/>
                        Cabin, south, during the winter, the body of a big snow-white Arctic owl.</p>
                    <p>Alfred Newton and Hans Gadou claim in their &quot;Dictionary of
                        Birds&quot; that certain North American species, particularly limicolae,
                        are at times found in eastern England and Scotland. The only possible
                        explanation for this would have to lie in the fact that these birds with us
                        breed in high northern latitudes, and in their southern migration they are
                        blown from their course by stiff west winds, the strongest of which prevail
                        on the Atlantic, so that the birds, unable to breast these fall gales, are
                        blown before them to the coast of Norway, where they establish friendly
                        relations with flocks of closely allied species and so find their way on a
                        southeasterly course to Scotland and England, where they are recognized by
                        dealers extremely familiar with their own species through constant handling
                        of them. This opens up the question of whether it is not possible for
                        reverse winds to carry European species to us. The distance would remain the
                        same, but we are forced to admit that there are no east winds so strong on
                        the Atlantic as the gales from the west.</p>
                    <p>There used to be a theory that birds in migration flew in wedge-shaped
                        formation, following a chosen leader. Small birds that I have observed in
                        migration seemed to me rather to fly in wavesthose that I recognized as
                        finches and sparrows, robins and larks. There is more inclination <pb
                            id="VAA2374-342" n="329"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2374-68">
                            <p>Why is it, having once migrated, a grebe will not fly, even to save
                                its life, until migration time comes again?</p>
                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2374-343" n="330"/> among blackbirds to assume the wedge-shaped
                        formation, but they collect in larger numbers. All the water fowl I ever
                        have watched in migration across the open water of my lake flew in the
                        wedge, one bird apparently leading at the point. If it is true that before
                        they take wing the birds hold a primary and elect one of the oldest and
                        wisest to lead them in flight, then it must also be true that they elect
                        dozens of subleaders to take his place in case of accident; for on my lake I
                        frequently see hunters shooting down the foremost birds of a low-flying
                        wedge, in which case the formation scatters but always re-forms, another
                        bird taking the lead. I also <unclear>-</unclear> have grave doubts
                        concerning the theory of the oldest and wisest. When my birds migrate, after
                        the old ones have performed the strenuous work of nest building, feeding
                        their young, and have gone through the enervating process of moulting, I
                        very seriously doubt that they are stronger and better prepared for the long
                        flight than some of their young.</p>
                    <p>The greatest authority on the migration of birds, the one man having the
                        widest opportunity, and who spent fifty years of uninterrupted watchfulness
                        of bird migration, was Herr Gtke of Heligoland. His observations covered
                        larks, starlings, wrens, and many other smaller birds, as well as plover,
                        sandpipers, owls, and larger water birds. He states in his records that the
                        young and the old migrate separately, generally by different routes, <pb
                            id="VAA2374-344" n="331"/> wiping out that beautiful theory that the old
                        birds make their migration by landmarks they recognize, and teach the young
                        the routes. He amply sustains the contention that birds are frequently
                        deceived. He states the proper time for migration and then gives figures to
                        prove that thousands lose their lives in a night through flying into a storm
                        and breasting adverse conditions. He mentions puffins among the birds which
                        frequently make mistakes as to when it is safe for them to migrate.</p>
                    <p>Three points of intense interest in migration are how birds find their way on
                        nights of fog and darkness, when the theory concerning their following river
                        valleys or recognizing bridges and light-houses is utterly untenable; the
                        height to which they fly; and the speed. Herr Gtke&apos;s records show
                        that the greater part of successful migration is carried on so high that
                        while he heard the chatter of passing throngs and saw the shadows between
                        him and the moon, he saw nothing of the birds except the weaklings and
                        strays, which often dropped to his level through exhaustion, and paused to
                        feed and rest. In support of the theory of high flight, Mr. G. Tennant
                        states in his book, &quot;Stray Feathers,&quot; that while studying
                        the sun through a telescope,&quot; he identified as kites flocks of
                        birds passing through his vision. This brings the nearest bird a mile above
                        the earth, and the farthest several miles higher. These birds were not in
                        migration; they were soaring. I mention the fact merely to prove <pb
                            id="VAA2374-345" n="332"/> to what vast height the birds can fly. Mr. W.
                        E. D. Scott made a record on a night in October, 1880, in Princeton, New
                        Jersey, of seeing through an astronomical telescope large numbers of birds,
                        which crossed the face of the moon, flying between one and two miles in
                        height. Among these, he positively identified warblers, finches,
                        woodpeckers, and blackbirds. Chapman made a record of having counted three
                        hundred birds in migration at a height of between two and three miles. In my
                        own experience in a boat on the lake, with an unobstructed view on nights of
                        very early spring, I frequently hear the notes of flocks of small birds
                        passing over so high that I can not see them, but I can recognize the
                        voices; while I also know by my own experience that on dark cloudy nights
                        birds in migration make twice the chatter and noise that they do on a
                        moonlight night. This probably is to enable them to keep together, to let
                        stragglers know the position of the main flock. I frequently hear them from
                        my sleeping porch anywhere from two to six o&apos;clock in the morning.
                        I think it a well-established fact that the average flight of birds in
                        migration is at such a height that it is utterly impossible for them to see
                        objects, which could guide their course, and I know that this is impossible
                        on cloudy nights, when more birds seem to be in migration than in fairer
                        weather. It is probable that the impression of numbers is obtained by the
                        birds&apos; chattering, caused by the fact <pb id="VAA2374-346" n="333"
                        /> that they can not see well in a fog so they call to each other in order
                        to keep together. Since we know that birds unerringly cross miles of water
                        at a height from two to three miles and find the location suitable for them,
                        it seems that the old theory of landmarks can well be abandoned, while there
                        is no question of the figures as to height given by astronomical observers,
                        who are the most skilled mathematicians in all the world.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to the speed at which birds fly, it appeals to me that the
                        scientists of former days made great mistakes. In a sustained flight at a
                        fair height a carrier pigeon will average thirty-six miles an hour. It seems
                        to me that the flight of a carrier pigeon, a bird of strong wing and
                        unerring sense of direction, might very well be taken as a basis of
                        computing the average flight of birds, at least of the pigeon and plover
                        families. It may also be recalled that when riding on a railroad train,
                        going at a speed of about forty miles an hour we often leave behind birds
                        flying in the same direction. Of course such birds would not be in migration
                        and so would not be flying so swiftly nor surely in one direction as at that
                        time, but such a test would be of some value in determining the average
                        speed of flight. So great an authority as Herr Gatke estimates that birds in
                        migration are capable of a speed of four English miles to the minute. This
                        seems perfectly incredible, as at that rate a bird would total two hundred
                        and forty miles an hour.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-347" n="334"/>
                    <p>In a final summing up of the migration question, I think that it is well
                        proved that birds migrate at the demand of a subconscious impulse, that they
                        know unerringly the line of travel to follow. Even when hindered in low
                        flight by the blinding lights of cities and light-houses, or when turned
                        from their course by heavy winds, unless lost and driven until they meet
                        death, they continue their flight across long stretches of land and water,
                        arriving eventually at their destination. I think that it will be agreed
                        that for the most part birds that have flocked and are really in the course
                        of long migration are at least a mile above the surface of the earth, often
                        two or three miles. The low-flying flocks are those which have collected
                        near to us and are not yet under headway, or strays and weaklings from
                        larger flocks. Also, I think that it will now be conceded that the old idea
                        of a bird&apos;s being able to make a straight sweep of a thousand miles
                        in four or five hours is utterly out of the question. Certainly, the whole
                        subject needs deeper investigation and more thorough study than has yet been
                        given to it; but when the best that the human mind can do is summed up, it
                        will probably resolve itself into this, &quot;The stork in the heaven
                        knoweth her appointed time&quot; concerning when birds migrate. Their
                        speed in flight can be determined.</p>
                    <p>One comparison which irritates me is that between birds and humans to the
                        detriment of the <pb id="VAA2374-348" n="335"/> birds. There is no way in
                        which to make a fair comparison between the mentality of a creature, gifted
                        with speech and reason, and a fowl. Recently I have heard people compare the
                        length of time a bird droops, cries, and mourns the loss of a mate with
                        human grief in the same circumstances. A human child, during my days of
                        motherhood, was nourished at the breast of its mother on an average of
                        fourteen months. In that length of time a pair of birds mate, brood, and
                        raise three sets of four nestlings to become self-supporting. These
                        nestlings make their southern migration, return, go through the building and
                        brooding process, and rear their three broods of four birds each, train them
                        to become self-supporting and ready for their first migration, while the
                        human child is still helpless at the breast of its mother. Man&apos;s
                        allotted span of years is seventy; five is a good average for the birds; so
                        that they must know more when they come into this world, be ready for the
                        ordinary functions of life much earlier, and complete them in a shorter time
                        than does a human. Reasoning on this basis, birds are old enough when they
                        leave the nest to know what sort of nest it is; they are old enough when
                        left to care for themselves to know on what they have been fed, what sort of
                        food it is, and where to find it; they know their locality before they
                        migrate, and how to return to it or a similar place suitable to their needs;
                        while if the few days a bird mourns a mate are to <pb id="VAA2374-349"
                            n="336"/> be compared with human grief, they are quite as proportionate
                        to the length of the bird&apos;s life as is the year of the average
                        widower to his allotted seventy. Compare a crow with a raven, a finch with a
                        warbler, a wren with a sparrow, if you will, but to compare a
                        bird&apos;s life with a man&apos;s is folly. This is very frequently
                        done from the fact that birds are building homes and caring for their young.
                        These processes are very similar with bird, beast, and human.</p>
                    <p>That a young bird, returning from its first migration, should know what
                        location to select and of what material to build its nest is no more
                        remarkable than that it should know when to migrate, what to feed its young,
                        and when to leave us again. It must be conceded by any field worker of
                        experience, however, that few young hens in their first migration build as
                        compact and perfect specimens of architecture for a bird of their species,
                        as old birds that have built for several seasons. This I know: the songs of
                        yearling males are never so mellow, so high, so clear, so trilled and
                        thrilled, so varied and original as those of birds, the feet, beak, and
                        plumage of which indicate age. It is an incontrovertible instance of
                        &quot;practice makes perfect.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The sane thing to do is to admit that the birds are guided by an influence,
                        of which we obtain hints and glimpses but do not fully understand; and
                        whether it is called by the name of &quot;instinct,&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2374-350" n="337"/> &quot;subconscious mind,&quot; or
                        covered by the simple statement that <hi rend="i">the birds know</hi>
                        matters little.</p>
                    <p>In an effort to learn exactly what the birds know in order to protect them
                        and educate ourselves, great care should be used to keep the head level and
                        leave the heart out of the question. The processes of nature are distinctly
                        cold-blooded. Everywhere the strong preys upon the weak. Poetic
                        interpretation and romancing make beautiful reading, but bad natural
                        history. Some things which birds do are done for such obvious reasons that
                        anyone can understand them, some we can only surmise, and concerning some we
                        can not make a plausible surmise. It is reasonable to suppose that birds eat
                        the food they do because when nestlings they were fed those things. Why
                        birds of the same size, of closely related species, living in the same
                        places and having access to the same foods, are taught some to eat
                        grasshoppers, some worms, and some seeds, is a mystery. If they had the same
                        food to eat, they still would remain different. You remember that grass from
                        the same meadow makes feathers on a goose, wool on a sheep, bristles on a
                        pig, and hair on a horse; and the same grass gives different form and
                        feathering to the goose and the duck, eating it side by side. Certain birds,
                        having accomplished their evolution on certain kinds of food, have gone on
                        eating them until their structure unfits them for anything else. The
                        seed-eaters have evolved heavy, short, sharp <pb id="VAA2374-351" n="338"/>
                        beaks, the fruit and worm-eaters long, finely pointed ones, the flesh-eaters
                        strong, sharp hooks. The water feeders have broad, flat, round-pointed,
                        shovel-like bills as the ducks, or extremely long, slender ones for probing
                        as the cranes and herons. In each instance the beak is suited to the
                        requirements of the bird. Further than this, certain birds are formed
                        internally to live on certain food. Perhaps the best example is the cuckoo,
                        provided with a flexible gizzard, lined with hair, so that it can assimilate
                        its chosen diet of matured caterpillars without irritation. The kingfisher
                        has such a large mouth and throat that it can swallow small fish or crabs
                        whole and then eject the scales, bones, and other indigestible parts.
                        Pelicans do the same. Hawks swallow parts of their prey, which they tear up,
                        regurgitating the indigestible parts. Most of the owls swallow their prey in
                        its entirety.</p>
                    <p>Once I saw a young crow that had been taken from a nest and raised by a boy,
                        preparing a caterpillar for its use. It rolled the worm on the gravel at my
                        feet until its spines were broken and then wiped it back and forth on the
                        sawed stone walk until they were worn off. Over and over, it repeated this
                        process until the caterpillar was a long, smooth worm. Then the crow
                        swallowed it.</p>
                    <p>As this bird had been raised by hand, it can not be claimed that it had been
                        taught to dress caterpillars for its food by its parents. It knew how. If
                        one admits that this bird knew that it would <pb id="VAA2374-352" n="339"/>
                        make it sick to eat the caterpillar with the spines on, then one grants to
                        the bird the ability to think and reason up to two separate perceptions on
                        the point. It had to think that the caterpillar would be injurious if eaten
                        whole, and then it had to think out how to prepare it for food. One might
                        reason a degree further and say it had to recognize when the spines were
                        removed and the caterpillar suitable for food. Nor was it stress of hunger
                        which drove the bird to do an unusual thing, for it was well fed at home,
                        many of the neighbours fed it, and it was regurgitating and hiding the food
                        I was giving it around the border of a pansy bed when it espied the
                        caterpillar.</p>
                    <p>All I could make of it was that what I was offering was unnatural food, and
                        the bird would eat it only in stress of hunger; the caterpillar was nearer
                        to its taste and though it was only a young bird, raised in unnatural
                        conditions, it <hi rend="i">knew</hi> how to prepare the worm for its food.
                        It would not do to mention &quot;instinct&quot; in the case, because
                        caterpillars are not a staple of crow diet. But there are staple articles in
                        the diet of every bird, things for which they hunger; and they do not thrive
                        if they do not get them.</p>
                    <p>Birds pay slight attention to a dog crossing the woods and go beside
                        themselves at the presence of a cat, so beyond all question they know which
                        animal is dangerous to their welfare. It seems to be in the blood of a
                        falcon to love horses and dogs. You <pb id="VAA2374-353" n="340"/> can see
                        the little dusky falcons, relatives of the birds formerly used by English
                        women of rank and leisure, sweeping almost against the backs of grazing
                        horses in the meadows, and with slight training they will perch upon the
                        head of a dog in all confidence. I should like to see someone try to teach
                        one to perch on the head of a cat.</p>
                    <p>When I was small, I repeatedly saw my father demonstrate that a flock of
                        crows, feeding on corn and cut worms at a time when crows are most annoying
                        to farmers, will pay no attention to a man approaching with a hoe, but if he
                        carries a gun, every crow makes a sweep for a treetop out of range. You say
                        that is simple, crows see a hoe used with no effect on them except to
                        prepare food they like; while with a &quot;bang!&quot; a gun drops
                        one of the flock. Very well, but if you admit that, you concede to the crow
                        the power to distinguish the hoe from the gun, to remember from day to day
                        which is harmless and which kills, and further, to have enough knowledge and
                        fear of death to avoid things which threaten it.</p>
                    <p>We know that birds communicate with each other by cries and calls, and of
                        course their songs have a meaning to them, but no one ever has and probably
                        ever will explain the concerted action of a flock in the presence of danger.
                        With us, in similar circumstances, we say, &quot;Something tells
                        me!&quot; In the same way, &quot;something tells&quot; the
                        birds, but what it is, only the birds know.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-354" n="341"/>
                    <p>Long before we know, the birds are aware of the approach of those sudden
                        summer storms. While fisherfolk are busy casting, hunters searching the
                        wood, and picnickers gay in the parks, the birds have their warning and
                        silently steal away to shelter, so that when the first black cloud drifts
                        across the sky, and the first ominous peal of thunder rolls, we suddenly
                        become aware of how <hi rend="i">still</hi> it is, and realize that previous
                        to our warning, the little feathered folk have had theirs and are safe.
                        Whether there is a change in air currents imperceptible to us, whether birds
                        of high flight see the storm clouds gathering, and their dropping to earth
                        warns the small folk, or how they know is their secret. Any woodsman can
                        tell you that it is quite true that the birds know first.</p>
                    <p>Slacker Cowbird knows a few things of vast importance in placing the eggs
                        which perpetuate her species in the nests of other birds. She knows that her
                        eggs will hatch one day sooner than those belonging in the nest in which she
                        places them. She knows that if she places them in the nests of catbirds and
                        thrushes of her size they will hatch at the same time as the other eggs and
                        her young will have only an <hi rend="i">equal</hi> chance with its
                        nestmates. This does not suit the shirk of birdland, so she places her eggs
                        in the nests of birds not <hi rend="i">half</hi> her size, song sparrows,
                        indigo finches, vireos, warblers, where her young will hatch first and be
                            <hi rend="i">twice</hi> the size of the other nestlings and so can lift
                        their heads higher, <pb id="VAA2374-355" n="342"/> take all the food, and
                        eventually starve and trample to death the rightful occupants of the nest.
                        Most small birds submit in meekness to this imposition, but a few have
                        learned to know Slacker Cowbird and the egg she imposes upon others. Many
                        field workers are beginning to report and to show pictures of the nests of
                        small birds, having cowbird eggs walled under a false bottom built over
                        them. But in this act of walling in the foreign egg I can see only conscious
                        mind equal to the occasion on the part of the bird imposed upon, since it
                        can scarcely be claimed that the cowbird has systematically imposed her eggs
                        upon any one species long enough for it to have become instinctive with that
                        species to bury the egg. My cowbird, previously described, laid five eggs,
                        the one the song sparrow buried, one I destroyed in a vireo nest, two left
                        in a warbler nest, and one I destroyed in an indigo finch nest. What the
                        cowbird should learn is not to deposit her egg in the new nest of any bird,
                        for in that case it can be buried and lost. Where the owner has laid part of
                        her eggs and must continue to fill out the clutch at the rate of one a day,
                        the problem becomes insurmountable, since our birds do not carry eggs around
                        in their beaks, unless they are English sparrows carrying broken ones from
                        nests they are destroying.</p>
                    <p>My father always insisted that the wild turkey awoke the day in the forest. I
                        know that the coot heralds dawn in the marshes, and the robin in the <pb
                            id="VAA2374-356" n="343"/> fields. This has been the custom for ages,
                        but why? Other birds join the chorus with almost the first note, why not
                        start the music occasionally?</p>
                    <p>Probably birds know why they select a certain one for a mate. To us it looks
                        very much as if several males surround a female, and the one which can drive
                        away the remainder takes her. When songbirds are mated, no one knows whether
                        it is for life or the season. If undisturbed, owls seem to live a lifetime
                        in one hollow tree. One pair of bluejays remains about our premises every
                        winter. Flickers seem to be in pairs in winter, and so do falcons. Cardinals
                        and crows are in small flocks so that one can not judge. There are great
                        numbers of dainty little folk, shy, timid creatures, with whom we reach
                        terms of sufferance only when they are bound to their nests during brooding
                        time, and who take to deep wood with their families as soon as brooding is
                        over and spend the winter in the South. Whether they migrate and return in
                        pairs is their secret; I scarcely see how anyone is going to find it out.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps bluejays know why, when they prey upon the eggs and young of almost
                        every small bird, they give a danger signal to others the instant anything
                        threatens them. It scarcely seems that it can be done for their protection,
                        for as a bird protector a bluejay is a failure. Perhaps it is for the
                        selfish reason that they do not want anything else poaching near their
                        location.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-357" n="344"/>
                    <p>Several years ago, when the winter was unusually prolonged and severe, a fine
                        big male cardinal frequently came around the Cabin searching for food. He
                        was very beautiful in a white setting, his song acceptable past belief; so I
                        asked the gardener to take a ladder and place a big piece of bark on top of
                        the grape arbour on which to scatter some wheat and chop every day for the
                        bird. The English sparrows passed along the word that food was there, and
                        soon flocks of them gathered and took all of it. So I suggested that it
                        would be well to wait until we heard the cardinal coming, before placing his
                        food. That set us to watching for him. We began listening for his whistle,
                        and when we heard it, the food was placed. In a week, we were on a working
                        basis. Every morning at nine o&apos;clock, the cardinal came over from
                        the Valley of the Wood Robin and perching in a large elm in the yard of a
                        residence a square below us, sang and whistled and trilled. He came closer
                        and perching in a hickory tree directly across from us he repeated the
                        performance. Then he flew to a small oak on the property next west of us,
                        closed the concert, and came directly to the grape arbour and feasted at
                        leisure. When he finished, without uttering a note, he flew back to the
                        Valley. At four o&apos;clock in the afternoon he repeated the
                        performance, always from exactly the same choir lofts. Great singers give
                        their concerts first, and dine afterward. So did this bird.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2374-358" n="345"/>
                    <p>The question of exactly how much the birds know is a vast one freighted with
                        scientific importance. It should be handled stripped of all sentiment and
                        devoid of all illusion, based wholly on what the birds prove they know by
                        what they customarily do in given circumstances. It is time to repudiate
                        what scientists who went gunning for specimens to articulate and study for
                        the classification of species have written of bird mentality. They shot
                        every specimen they saw before they knew its species, not to mention its
                        characteristics. In the question of the scarcity of birds and the consequent
                        scarcity of fruit, the work of the would-be scientist must be taken into
                        consideration. When I read of the man who shot fifty rose-breasted
                        grosbeaks, one hundred and fifty-two cedar waxwings, or fifty warblers to
                        see what their crops contained, I grow indignant. Ten would furnish
                        sufficient proof in each case and save the lives of two hundred and forty
                        birds. This kind of work should be prohibited immediately and forever. It is
                        wholly unnecessary to kill such numbers of birds as have been sacrificed for
                        years. It is time to repudiate what romanticists and the fakers of city
                        flats have been presenting to us as bird history; they have no personal
                        acquaintance with the birds nor experience in the woods. It is time to
                        refuse to tolerate natural history written and illustrated in parks and
                        zoological gardens. Natural history is the history of nature, and nothing in
                        all God&apos;s <pb id="VAA2374-359" n="346"/> great world is so far from
                        nature as despondent, helpless, caged birds. It is time for every man and
                        woman wanting knowledge on the subject to go to the woods and from the
                        unconscious birds learn what they prove they know by what they do in the
                        daily business of living.</p>
                    <p>Added to this, I wish to register my most serious protest against the work of
                        professional ornithologists in hastening the extermination of rare and
                        unusual birds in their greed to secure specimens for museum collections.
                        Museum collections at best are frail affairs, subject to moth, fading
                        rapidly in light. Yet, let any bird be reported as rare; immediately pursuit
                        of it with a gun begins.</p>
                    <p>Kirtland&apos;s warbler always has been the &quot;rara avis&quot;
                        of our ornithology. He is an especial beauty, having a back of slaty blue
                        with black stripes, a breast in the adult male of clear, rich yellow, sides
                        striped with black. His history is one of the bloodiest pages of
                        ornithology. The way of science is to shoot every Kirtland on sight. Of
                        course, Audubon and Wilson shot all their specimens: one male Kirtland near
                        Cleveland, &quot;shot&quot;; five near Cleveland,
                        &quot;secured&quot;; one near Cincinnati, &quot;shot&quot;;
                        one near Oberlin, &quot;shot&quot;; twenty-five in Canada and the
                        United States altogether, &quot;captured&quot;; fifty in winter
                        haunts in Bermuda, &quot;taken&quot;; two on coasts of Virginia and
                        South Carolina, &quot;shot.&quot; One writer states: &quot;The
                        pursuit of this woodland beauty, whose only offense is rarity, has <pb
                            id="VAA2374-360" n="347"/> been so keen that most observers have shot
                        first and questioned afterward.&quot; Exactly! This is the history of
                        every rare bird of the country. Of course, these methods result in the
                        birds&apos; &quot;multiplying and replenishing the earth&quot;
                        with their species!</p>
                    <p>Then at last the nesting locality of the Kirtland, hunted from Bermuda to
                        Minnesota, was found in Oscoda County, Michigan. Did the finder shut his
                        eyes and his mouth and muzzle his gun, and leave this rarest bird of our
                        ornithology to its chance to enrich the earth with its beauty and song and
                        to help preserve our lives with its work in worm extermination? Did he? A
                        woman would; but did the man? The report reads: &quot;Very gratifying
                        success. Fine series of skins, male, female, nestlings, full-fledged young,
                        nest, and eggs.&quot; The only nesting haunt of the Kirtland ever found
                        invaded with a gun! The rare bird once more a fugitive at the hands of
                        science! This is a real crime, and a law should be enacted to punish it, at
                        least in the future to prevent it. Let the word be sent abroad that the next
                        man who kills a Kirtland becomes in Biblical phrase &quot;a
                        stench&quot; in the nostrils of bird lovers, which term is synonymous
                        with bird protectors.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">A</hi>LL ornithologists have agreed for a long time past that
                        we owed much of our comfort to the birds. To-day, it is being generally
                        conceded that if every form of bird life were swept from the face of the
                        earth &quot;at one fell swoop&quot; man could not long survive. This
                        will seem extreme to those who have not made a study of the situation, but
                        if anyone having access to cultivated country and villages will keep his
                        eyes open and think out the subject to its ultimate limit, he will see that
                        the destruction of all plant life is inevitable without the work of the
                        birds in its preservation.</p>
                    <p>The most intimate part of my life work among the birds has been at their
                        nesting time, when I was able to see exactly what was collected by the
                        parents in rearing their young. All of my life I have been deeply interested
                        in this subject because much of my life I have been in a position where I
                        was forced to feed and care for young birds personally or to let them die;
                        so for the birds of my location I can speak with authority as to their
                        feeding habits, in so far as they can be followed with the eye or the field
                        glass. It is my self-appointed <pb id="VAA2374-363" n="350"/> task to
                        preserve useful bird life, not to take it on any excuse whatever. But going
                        beyond the limits of my work, comes that of the statisticians, who have
                        carefully counted how often birds fed their young in a given time, and who
                        have not hesitated to kill our most exquisite songsters by the dozen in
                        order to analyze the contents of their crops. The general summing up of both
                        branches of investigation results in the verdict that life on this planet
                        would be insupportable without the protection afforded us by the birds
                        against winged pests, bugs, worms, and caterpillars, larvae, aphis, and
                        lice. With the usual exactness of nature in working out her evolution, every
                        square yard of earth and air seems to be especially policed by these
                        watchful, feathered servitors of ours, busy in their daily work of
                        sustaining bird life, having not the slightest knowledge of what their work,
                        beauty, and music mean to us.</p>
                    <p>Over the waters of my lake, during the fall and spring migration, I see wild
                        geese, ducks, loons, galinules, coots, gulls and grebes feeding in flocks.
                        They keep our lakes from becoming overcrowded with fish, and feed on
                        countless larvae and worms around the shore. During the summer, a few of the
                        ducksonce a loonand uncounted coots and grebes nest around the shore lines,
                        reducing objectionable water larvae and keeping the frog production within
                        the balance demanded by nature. Around the swampy shore line, stalk cranes,
                        herons, bitterns, <pb id="VAA2374-364" n="351"/> and shitepokes, keeping
                        down the excess frog population, water-puppies, lizzards, tiny soft turtles,
                        grubs, and worms.</p>
                    <p>Over the sands race the flashing legs of rails, plovers, and sandpipers,
                        picking up snails, larvae, spiders, bugs of all sorts, and eating the seeds
                        of weeds and wild rice from the green majolica plates grown by the pond
                        lilies.</p>
                    <p>Over the earth of the fields and open country go flocks of quail, cleaning up
                        the fallen weed seeds in the fence corners, putting wasted grain to
                        excellent use, snapping up grasshoppers and other insects here and there,
                        helped in all this work by woodcocks, snipe, and prairie chickens, although
                        hunters are rapidly exterminating the last. In the clover fields and meadows
                        the larks are busy searching out wireworms and cutworms, and cleaning the
                        breast of earth of every visible bug and worm with the assistance of
                        bobolinks and oven birds. In gardens and dooryards, the robin is the
                        greatest hunter of earthworms, taking uncounted thousands, also cutworms and
                        other injurious insects comprising over one third of his food. Many people
                        object to the robins and cedar birds because they are especially fond of
                        cherries, but the robins are such invaluable insect exterminators that the
                        thing to do is to plant a few Russian mulberries somewhere on your premises,
                        and you will never again be troubled to any noticeable extent by these birds
                        among your cherries.</p>

                        insect eggs, and eating wild berries. Here, orioles work industriously,
                        taking moth eggs, worms, the softer bugs, and a very little fruit. The
                        cardinal grosbeak feeds on seeds, berries, wild fruit; and when feeding
                        young, many worms and insects. His cousin, the rose-breasted grosbeak, has
                        the finest record of any bird in the world as an exterminator of the potato
                        bug in its soft form, before it attains to its stiff beetle wingshields.
                        This alone should insure him a crown in addition to the red badge on his
                        breast. He also eats other beetles and worms, a small amount of fruit, and a
                        few wild berries.</p>
                    <p>In the orchards, the robins are as busy as in door-yard or garden. The
                        orchard oriole is a veritable blessing, not in disguise, for all day long he
                        works faithfully collecting the click beetle that few other birds will take,
                        and destroying the tent caterpillars by the thousands. The cuckoo is so
                        active that one pair will clean the tent caterpillars from a small orchard,
                        taking them whole when young, dressing the spines off as the caterpillars
                        grow older, and sucking the insides of the largest, heaviest spined ones.
                        This is a trick not confined to birds alone. I once saw a blue wasp fly to a
                        caterpillar crossing the steps on which I was sitting, and take a bite in
                        the side of the caterpillar. Then, flirting his <pb id="VAA2374-367" n="354"
                        /> wings and giving every evidence of satisfaction, he drank from the blotch
                        of green juice that ran from the collapsed worm. Then he flew away and told
                        his friends; for inside of the following ten minutes, a dozen blue wasps
                        came to take a drink of caterpillar blood. To return to the subject of
                        cuckoos, there is a record of nine larvae destructive to black walnut found
                        in the crop of one cuckoo; although, if he was doing such invaluable work,
                        it surely was a pity to kill him. He should have had the freedom of the
                        earth and a monument reciting his virtues instead. The dreaded canker worms
                        are in his dietary list and also in that of the bluebird. Jays eat bugs,
                        worms, berries, and alas! the eggs and young of more beneficial small birds
                        such as warblers and vireos.</p>
                    <p>Up and down the tree trunks all day the industrious nuthatches and brown
                        creepers, assisted by the woodpeckers of several families, search for eggs,
                        lice, larvae, borers, and cocoons.</p>
                    <p>In hollow trees live chickadees, titmice, and crested fly-catchers, among
                        small birds, all busy eliminating insect pests. The flicker takes beetles on
                        trees, many ants and grasshoppers on earth.</p>
                    <p>High in the branches homes the crow. There is a strong sentiment against him
                        because he has a bad record, based on a love of green corn, little chickens,
                        and the eggs and young of other birds. Yet many farmers have killed crows
                        for pulling up their newly sprouted seed corn, when the birds <pb
                            id="VAA2374-368" n="355"/> really were eating grub worms that were
                        busily cutting the corn. Among poultry, a crow seldom secures a chick other
                        than a weakling unable to escape him, and so better removed from the flock.
                        On the other hand, a record of the field mice, small snakes, beetles,
                        grasshoppers, and spiders that a crow takes in a week shows that he pays ten
                        times over for all corn and young chickens he secures in a season. The worst
                        grudge there is in my heart against the crow is his depredations among the
                        eggs and young of invaluable small birds, birds that we can not afford to
                        lose, either on account of their beauty, their song, or their priceless work
                        as insect exterminators.</p>
                    <p>The gulls are the scavengers of the lake shore, the vultures and turkey
                        buzzards of the fields and woods. Crows also assist in this work, all of
                        which is extremely useful and beneficial in ridding the earth of a source of
                        sickness and contagion for man.</p>
                    <p>Above both field and forest float the eagles and all the hawks. The eagles
                        and the largest hawks feed on small wild animals, opossums, skunks,
                        groundhogs, rabbits, moles, field mice, and snakes; also, I regret to
                        enumerate, very small lambs, pigs, and poultry. Studying their habits
                        closely we conclude that birds are better left alone, since their work
                        proves of ultimate benefit to man. One pheasant farmer of one of our
                        southeastern states hired men to help him shoot every hawk in his vicinity,
                        only <pb id="VAA2374-369" n="356"/> to learn a season or two later that the
                        hawks had been instrumental in making his work a success by keeping his
                        flocks healthful through preying upon and carrying away all the weaklings
                        that were not sufficiently active to escape. After the elimination of the
                        hawks, the weaklings interbred and mingled with the flock, starting disease
                        which killed hundreds. Acting on this same theory, a certain chicken grower
                        I know makes daily abrupt dashes among his flock and kills every chicken he
                        can catch by hand, on the principle that if those taken were as healthful as
                        they should be, they could escape him. It is his belief that hawks should be
                        left alone. Either in summer or winter, a familiar figure on the telegraph
                        wires is the little dusky falcon, commonly called the sparrow hawk, although
                        it is my fervent belief, judging from the manner in which my song sparrows
                        escape him, that his diet is almost altogether confined to mice,
                        grasshoppers, and English sparrows.</p>
                    <p>During the night, my woods are full of owls, from tiny screechers as big as
                        my doubled fist to the great horned marauders, which prey upon genuine
                        pests, from mice, rats, water rats, and other small animals to alas! my
                        neighbours&apos; hens. I am sure that our hawks and owls really prefer
                        to hunt and feed in the wild, for in five years of life where big hawks are
                        preying on the red-wings across the lake and dipping low over our orchard
                        and horse pasture, they never once have entered a large <pb id="VAA2374-370"

                        for us many a summer night, hunting through the woods and thickets around
                        the Cabin. They sometimes alight on the roof to tear up screaming groundhogs
                        and other prey that look the size of an average cat, but they never yet have
                        disturbed our chickens.</p>
                    <p>The martins and swallows have the air for their province. On tireless wings,
                        with open mouths, they sieve the air, taking millions of tiny gnats,
                        mosquitoes, and flies, that would make life altogether unbearable for us
                        were we compelled to <pb id="VAA2374-372" n="359"/> live and breathe among
                        them in their unchecked development. Smaller in size but tireless on wing
                        and taking larger prey, I should class with the air police the gnatcatchers
                        and fly-catchers.</p>
                    <p>Invaluable around any premises I count the work of the common house wren,
                        which will raise three broods, averaging from six to eight young to the
                        nest. This keeps wrens food-hunting from dawn until dark, taking every
                        insect they see from a mosquito to a spider. The largest insect I ever
                        pictured a wren carrying into his house was a dragonfly stripped of its
                        wings.</p>
                    <p>It is one of the mysterious, inscrutable workings of evolution that our real
                        safety depends upon the warbler family, its members so tiny that they are
                        not much bigger than wrens, most of them of protective colour of green and
                        gold like the leaves of the trees, of steel and slate grey and white like
                        the bark of tree trunks, painted, splashed, and mottled colours like the
                        flowers, blue like the sky, or dark blue like the shadowed waters, the
                        gayest, gaudiest, little feathered throng on earth, the almost invisible
                        host that hunts among the leaves. They have featherlight bodies,
                        indistinguishable among the leaves, bright eyes, tiny, pointed beaks, with
                        which they search under and over the foliage of vines, bushes, orchards, and
                        giant forest trees, hunting out millions and billions of insect eggs,
                        larvae, aphis, plant lice, and tiny, newly hatched caterpillars that, if
                        allowed to mature, would develop <pb id="VAA2374-373" n="360"/>

                            <p>Were it not for the work of the birds, each egg of clusters like
                                these, numbering about six hundred to the moth, would develop at
                                maturity a six inch caterpillar, which would consume near its own
                                weight in leaves in a day.</p>
                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2374-374" n="361"/> six inches in length. The warbler young must
                        have insect diet. Their crops are large for the size of the birds, and the
                        old birds keep them packed all day long. A young warbler can eat over half
                        its own weight in insects each day and handle them conveniently.</p>
                    <p>One ornithologist kept record while a palm warbler collected from forty to
                        sixty insects a minute to carry to its young. He estimated that the bird he
                        was watching from his veranda took over nine thousand insects in four hours.
                        Of course these insects were very small, but so are the wheat midge and
                        Hessian fly; yet they do millions of dollars worth of damage to the wheat
                        crops of one season. Scientists who have made an especial study of the work
                        of warblers while insect collecting have kept record as a yellow-throat took
                        eighty-four birch aphis to the minute. A chestnut-sided warbler made a
                        record of twenty-two gypsy caterpillars to the minute, and the more agile
                        Nashville warbler almost doubled this record by taking forty-two. Another
                        chestnut-sided warbler took twenty-eight caterpillars in twelve minutes, and
                        a black-and-white gathered up his twenty-eight in ten minutes. A Maryland
                        yellow-throat collected fifty-two caterpillars in a short time. All warblers
                        eat tent caterpillars, apple tree tent, brown tail, and gypsy caterpillars,
                        all pests of the worst description on fruit trees and other vegetation.</p>

                        caterpillars as they emerge from the eggs of moths and butterflies. How many
                        they take in a season, there is no way to estimate. They also eat bark lice,
                        scale insects, bark and boring beetles. They help the orchard orioles with
                        the click beetles, while they are fond of weevils, ants, cadis flies, May
                        flies, spiders and snails.</p>
                    <p>There can be no question concerning the value of the work of warblers in tree
                        and vegetable conservation. While working with dozens of the big night moths
                        of June, securing data for a book, &quot;Moths of the
                        Limberlost,&quot; I have had the females of some of the commonest
                        species, Cecropia and Polyphemus, lay by actual count from three to seven
                        hundred eggs each, while Luna and Regalis would average from three to five
                        hundred. Placed in freedom, these eggs would have covered the undersides of
                        leaves of orchard and ornamental trees and of hickory and walnut, among the
                        most valuable forest trees, with millions of caterpillars, which, unchecked
                        by the birds, at maturity would be worms measuring from four to six inches
                        in length, each consuming his weight in leaves in a day. Were it not for the
                        work of warblers, in spite of any form of burning or spraying, so many of
                        these eggs would escape on the undersides of leaves that in a few
                        years&apos; time our orchard, field, and forest trees would be denuded
                        of leaves by midsummer. Then the hot sun shining on the bare branches <pb
                            id="VAA2374-377" n="364"/> would bake them to such a bark-bound state
                        that in two seasons the strongest of them would be dead. I have seen many
                        single trees killed in this manner in northern Indiana and southern
                        Michigan; and in several places I have seen whole orchards wiped out in two
                        seasons. The warblers prove themselves our salvation above all other birds,
                        merely by living their lives according to their evolution. It seems an
                        alarming situation when we realize that we are so dependent upon such frail,
                        tiny creatures with the odds so against them.</p>
                    <p>Many warblers choose extremely high nesting sites so that they will not have
                        long trips to make in feeding their young. Others nest lower, while some
                        select bushes only a few feet from the ground. These variable nesting
                        locations make these birds prey to all outdoors from the crows and jays of
                        the high treetops to the red squirrels of the middle locations and the
                        snakes, weasels, and skunks of the ground. They suffer peculiarly from the
                        impositions of the cowbirds, as warbler nests are so tiny that two cowbird
                        eggs to a nest practically assure death by starvation and trampling to the
                        warbler&apos;s entire brood. One young cowbird can crowd out, trample,
                        and starve half of a warbler&apos;s brood. The birds are so small and
                        delicate that they make their migration north later than most birds and in
                        lower flight. As a result, they are particularly susceptible to cold during
                        periods of changeable weather, while their low flight often results in their
                            <pb id="VAA2374-378" n="365"/> becoming baffled by the lights of cities.
                        They are especial sufferers through becoming confused and beating themselves
                        against light-houses. A few years ago the bodies of five hundred and
                        ninety-five warblers were picked up one morning around the Fire Island
                        light-house off Long Island. Storms such as I previously described on Lake
                        Michigan are especially disastrous to them in either their northern or
                        southern migration.</p>
                    <p>I hope I have gone into sufficient detail to prove to anyone reading this
                        book the sum of our indebtedness to the birds. The question now becomes: how
                        can we pay our obligation? How can we so protect and increase the birds as
                        to raise their numbers again to such flocks as I knew in childhood, when the
                        insect pests, which we fight each year through an expenditure of millions
                        and much valuable time, were unknown, the work of the birds being sufficient
                        to insure magnificent crops of large and small fruits regularly every
                        season? So the question arises as to the manner in which we can best help
                        ourselves by helping the birds to feed and flock with us as they did
                        formerly.</p>
                    <p>It appeals to me that the biggest stroke which could be accomplished in their
                        favour at one blow would be to decree and sternly carry out the complete
                        extermination of the English sparrow. It is absurd sentiment, based on
                        ignorance of the habits and characteristics of this little villain, which
                        allows it to go unmolested anywhere. A flock of <pb id="VAA2374-379" n="366"
                        /> English sparrows in a location where warblers and finches are homing
                        means worse destruction to the birds than a plague of influenza, typhoid,
                        and smallpox combined would mean to human beings, since a healthful human
                        being rightly cared for has a chance of escaping the ravages of disease.
                        Other and smaller birds have no chance whatever to escape the sparrow, which
                        is a pugnacious little bulldog in a fight. It unhesitatingly attacks birds
                        from the size of a robin down, breaking eggs, tearing up nests, throwing
                        young birds from nests, eating them if they are small enough. In my personal
                        experience, I have seen English sparrows throw the young from the nest of a
                        robin, built where the logs cross under the roof of a veranda, the fall
                        killing them on the floor below. I have seen them enter high bird boxes and
                        drag out young martins and bluebirds, throwing them to their death if the
                        young were too big to carry to their own nests for food. I have seen them
                        enter robin nests, break the egg shells, eat all they could hold, and when
                        they could hold no more, break the remainder of the eggs for pure mischief.
                        Earlier in this book, I described the exquisite spectacle made by the
                        courtship of a pair of cardinals that had selected a nesting site in the
                        wild rose bushes over the music-room window of the Cabin, south; but I left
                        the dnouement of that story until the present time, because I wished to use
                        it in the strongest summing up I know how to make against <pb
                            id="VAA2374-380" n="367"/> the one worst menace of the birds which are
                        working out our salvation to-day. As fast as these cardinals carried nesting
                        material to the rose bush, and left to gather more, the English sparrows
                        flew in, took the material, and carried it high in an elm tree in the corner
                        of the lot, where they were nesting. In helpless rage I was compelled to
                        stand back and see my best loved birds, these particular and peculiar
                        friends of mine, driven from a nesting location I should have given any
                        reasonable sum to protect. I could do nothing, since any scheme I could
                        devise to frighten away the sparrows would cause the cardinals to desert the
                        location. After two days of struggle, that is exactly what they did. The
                        story is the same from every keen observer of bird life who is capable of
                        testifying intelligently on the subject. Unless the other birds succeeded in
                        outwitting the sparrows by some particular cleverness, nothing escaped the
                        ravages of the sparrows at the Cabin, south, except the wren, whose house
                        they could not enter. Aside from their incalculable destruction of other
                        small birds in a season, it may be recorded that English sparrows are birds
                        of disgusting habits. They do not care to exercise themselves enough to take
                        food in a legitimate manner, preferring to feed from garbage cans, to eat
                        the food provided for the chickens, and to steal from seed bins and
                        granaries. They have no song; they are the lousiest birds with which I ever
                        came in contact; they are polygamists, four or five <pb id="VAA2374-381"
                            n="368"/> females building a communal nest from the size of a peck
                        measure to a bushel. They breed from February through to November, resting
                        but two months in the year. Mr. Barrows, in his report <figure

                        any person to be found harbouring English sparrows on their premises. Of all
                        the foolish sentiment that <figure entity="VAA2374-76">

                    <p>After sparrows, I should count the cowbird as the next worst menace to other

                        of the most foolish and disastrous kind, which will protect a bird of no
                        value in any way on earth, a songless bird of disgusting habits, with

                        recall that in my own experience in photographically reproducing the life
                        history of one of these birds, I offered incontrovertible <figure

                        If each female of <pb id="VAA2374-384" n="371"/> a flock of over two
                        hundred, to which this bird belonged, had an equal record, which is only
                        fair to suppose, then on one half-mile stretch of the Wabash river bank, <hi
                            rend="i">six hundred birds of beautiful plumage and exquisite song,
                            invaluable to us as insect exterminators were wiped out by the cowbirds
                            of this small flock; while, if these cowbirds averaged four eggs each,
                            there were four hundred of these pests to take the places of the finches
                            and warblers.</hi> This estimate is conservative, because my cowbird
                        laid <hi rend="i">five</hi> eggs, the first of which was walled in the
                        bottom of the nest of the song sparrow, as previously described. If I have
                        any influence whatever, I shall most earnestly use it in advocating the
                        complete extermination of cow-birds and English sparrows. As a matter of
                        justice to exquisite little creatures, upon whom all of us are dependent,
                        and as a matter of self-preservation, I urge that this matter be gone into
                        strenuously and immediately.</p>
                    <p>The next most serious menace to our insectiverous birds, I should say is the
                        depredations of other birds, such as crows, hawks, jays, and owls. Here we
                        are helpless; nature must preserve her own balance. We can not interfere to
                        any great extent. These creatures evolved together, and if left to
                        themselves, they will keep the equation. I do make it a rule, which I advise
                        everyone to follow wherever it is possible: give the insectiverous songbird
                        the benefit of the doubt, protect it wherever <pb id="VAA2374-385" n="372"/>
                        and however possible; at the same time, my strongest displeasure is waiting
                        for the head of anyone who touches my great horned owls, my chicken hawksI
                        can not even allow the killing of the jays.</p>
                    <p>Because I love the birds more, it necessarily follows that I love cats less.
                        From my point of view, I prefer to dispense with the work of a cat and solve
                        the mouse problem with a trap rather than to have cats around; since they
                        would spend much of the day and all of the night feeding upon beneficial
                        birds, the song and beauty of which I adore.</p>
                    <p>I should strongly recommend a fair-sized, pliant switch for the back of the
                        small boy or girl who deliberately destroys a bird&apos;s nest after
                        having been carefully taught the reason for the protection of all beneficial
                        birds. When it comes to the gunner who takes deliberate aim at an exquisite
                        songbird, merely to test his skill, I consider him one of the most selfish,
                        ignorant, and disgusting creatures that come within my knowledge. Sentiment
                        on this subject is now so strong and law so stringent that these outrages
                        are seldom perpetrated any more, but it was the body of a cardinal grosbeak,
                        used as a target by a conscienceless hunter, which drove me to the outburst
                        of indignation that resulted in my first book, &quot;The Song of the
                        Cardinal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And I have a complaint against scientific ornithological workers that I feel
                        it is only fair and just to the birds that I should bring forward. I realize
                            <pb id="VAA2374-386" n="373"/> that Audubon did a great work when he
                        classified the birds of a continent and brought from the forests specimens
                        of practically every bird of the United States; but at the same time, it
                        seems to me that his records are unnecessarily bloody, that he might have
                        accomplished equal results and killed far fewer birds. When we come to the
                        records of scientists making up reports for the Government or for any cause
                        whatever, I think the butchery in which they indulge is absolutely
                        inexcusable. I can see a reason for killing ten rose-breasted grosbeaks to
                        find if each of them has potato bugs in its crop; I can see positively no
                        excuse for killing fifty-two for the same reason; and when the record runs
                        from fifty-two to one hundred and fifty-two among our rarest and most
                        beautiful birds of song on the excuse that the contents of their crops must
                        be examined or their skins mounted for collections, I protest vigorously.
                        Here too, the law, which is so watchful over matters of infinitely less
                        importance to our welfare, should take a hand and specify that hereafter
                        only the very smallest number consistent with proving a point essential to
                        our welfare should be killed.</p>
                    <p>These things, the Government should immediately take in hand, in the matter
                        of at least partial payment of our debt to the birds. To go further than
                        that, each man, woman, or child who loves music, beauty, and grace, who
                        loves fruit and flowers, gardens and forests, may do some small <pb
                            id="VAA2374-387" n="374"/> share consistent with his means and location.
                        It is always possible to give a high degree of protection to the birds that
                        seek your good graces when they locate their nests on your premises. Shield
                        them from cats, squirrels, other birds, and wilful children to the best of
                        your ability. Put up all the boxes, old gourds, cans, dippers, any
                        protective nesting shelter you can furnish for them. A prothonotary warbler,
                        a thing of gold and bubbling song, passed close by a ten-dollar bird box,
                        when it nested in my bait can on our dock last summer. The birds do not in
                        the least object to tin cans and the crudest boxes or hollow limbs placed
                        for their use. If you have a small waste place, where a handful of hemp seed
                        can be sowed in spring and seed raised to add to suet and meat bones for the
                        birds of winter, that will be a great help, since the seed is very rich in
                        oil and a warming food for birds.</p>
                    <p>Neltje Blanchan especially requested me to urge in the writing of this book
                        that every bird lover plant a few, low growing, thickly leaved evergreens
                        for winter sleeping quarters for the birds, among the larger trees, junipers
                        and red cedars, among the smaller, the cypresses and arbor vitae, these to
                        be put in the places deemed most sheltered and convenient for winter
                        quarters. To this, I add the plea that in every convenient corner you set a
                        Russian mulberry as old as possible to begin with, and in a short time your
                        complaints against the <pb id="VAA2374-388" n="375"/>

                    <p>A recently published estimate of the average lifetime of birds allots to a
                        wren three years, a thrush ten, a robin twelve, a lark thirteen, a blackbird
                        twelve, a goldfinch fifteen, a canary fifteen, a pigeon twenty, a crane
                        twenty-four, a sparrow hawk forty, a crow fifty, a heron fifty-nine. This
                        gives to the birds in which we are most interested a very short span of
                        life. It is in our power to make this life longer and safer for those of our
                        birds, upon which we are most dependent, those to which <pb id="VAA2374-389"
                            n="376"/> we owe the things of life we prize most highly. While all of
                        us are in softened mood and of a will to rectify many of the existing evils
                        which we have endured for years, this question comes up among many other
                        questions of not nearly so much spiritual and economic importance. In the
                        writing of this book I have done my best. Now is the time for concerted
                        action on the part of everyone who reads it. Shall we pay our debt to the
                        birds?</p>
