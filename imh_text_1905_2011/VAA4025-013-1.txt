            Universalism In Indiana
            By REV. ELMO ARNOLD
                        ROBINSON, 
                        Anderson
                    
            
            PIONEER UNIVERSALISM
            
            The scope of this paper does not permit a detailed discussion of the pioneer
                    Universalist immigration into Indiana. Only a few of the points of contact with
                    the denominations in the Eastern States can be indicated.
            Somewhat out of the main line of Indiana Universalism are the Rappites, who came
                    to this State in 1813. Their teaching concerning the future life came through
                    the channel of German Mysticism, and apparently had no contact with organized
                    Universalism.
            The early history of the Universalist church in Indiana is closely connected with
                    the development of the denomination in 
                        Ohio
                    . Gen. James 
                        Mitchell
                     Varnum, the president of the 
                        Ohio
                     Company, which was organized in 
                  Boston, Massachusetts
               , in 1786, was a factor in the story of
                    New 
                        England
                     Universalism. Capt. Winthrop Sargent, the secretary of the company,
                    and adjutant to the first governor of the territory, was one of the Sargent
                    family of Gloucester, 
                        Massachusetts
                    , whose loyalty to the Rev. John Murray contributed largely to the
                    establishment of this division of the liberal church in America. A number of
                    early settlers in the Northwest Territory were Universalists. The list includes
                    such names as Col. Joseph Barker, Aaron Waldo 
                        Putnam
                    , Ludlow, Armstrong, Perin, Durham, Buckingham, Snider, Baldwin,
                    Cary, Laboy-teau, Capt. W. H. 
                        Harrison
                    , Maj. I. S. Gano, T. Goudy, George  Gorden, T. 
                        Gibson
                    , Charlotte Ludlow, Maj. J. M. Lovell, C. Smith, Capt. B. Shamburgh,
                    Eliza Sellman, Eliza Symmes.
            The earliest recorded preaching by a Universalist minister in what is now 
                        Ohio
                     was in Rome township, 
                        Athens
                     county, in 1807, by Rev. Abel 
                        Morgan
                     Sargent, from 
                        Maryland
                     or 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . He did not become a resident until several years later, when he
                    moved, first, to Gallia county, then to various other 
                        Ohio
                     points, including 
                        Cincinnati
                    , and finally to some point in Indiana—said to be either
                    Rising Sun, New 
                        Albany
                     or 
                        Evansville
                    —where he died in August, 1839. During a part of his work
                    in 
                        Ohio
                     he organized Halcyon churches, which held to the doctrine of
                    annihilation.
            The first resident Universalist preacher in this region was Rev. Timothy Bigelow,
                    who came into northern 
                        Ohio
                     from Winchester, 
                        New Hampshire
                    , in 1814 or earlier. In 1815, in 
                        Cincinnati
                    , John Jenkinson published an English edition of a widely circulated
                    book on universal salvation, entitled The Everlasting Gospel,
                    by Paul Seigvolck (George K. Nicolai).
            By 1821 there were sufficient Universalists in northeastern 
                        Ohio
                     to call a meeting at Palmyra and to organize the Northern 
                        Ohio
                     Universalist Association. They mention "a large body of
                    brethren still further to the west" who are about to organize. Rev.
                    Timothy Bigelow, who was chosen clerk at the Palmyra meeting, wrote a few months
                    later to an eastern paper that there were ten Universalist ministers in his part
                    of the State.
            Rev. Sebastian Streeter and Rev. Thomas Whittemore visited 
                        Cincinnati
                     about 1825 and preached there, probably in the old courthouse. A
                    group of people calling themselves Universalians existed there at that time, and
                    were supposedly the pioneers of the church organized in May, 1827. Rev. J. C.
                    Waldo came as their first pastor in 1828 and remained three years. 
                        Cincinnati
                     soon became the headquarters for traveling clergymen and for
                    resident printers, whose missionary journeys and journals penetrated the wilder
                    regions of Indiana.
            There was a meeting at Jacksonburg, 
                        Ohio
                    , in 1826. (This may be the present Jacksonboro in Butler county.)
                    Here was organized the Convention of Universalists of the Western  States. The second session was held in October,
                    1827, near 
                  Franklin, Warren county
               . Samuel Tizzard was the
                    first president and P. J. Laboyteaux the first secretary. A conference was
                    arranged for the month of May at Mt. Pleasant. The session of 1828 met at Eaton,
                    with Rev. Jonathan Kidwell, president, and Rev. A. H. Longly, secretary. A
                    hymnal was proposed in 1829. The next year at 
                        Oxford
                     a constitution was adopted and the name changed to the Western
                    Convention of Universalists. Delegates were to be chosen by the various
                    associations. Professors McGuffy and 
                        Scott
                    , Presbyterians, of 
                        Miami
                     University, are mentioned for friendly hospitality. A committee
                    reported having received books from the 
                        London
                     (
                        England
                    ) Unitarian Society. Mr. Samuel Jenks, living near
                            
                  Somerset, Franklin
                county, Indiana, was
                    appointed a subscription committee for the support of an itinerant preacher. 
                        Dayton
                     was chosen as the place of meeting for 1830.
            The session of 1833 was held at Philomath, Indiana.1
                    Delegates were present from the Richland, Central 
                        Ohio
                    , and Western Union Associations. John Winn served as moderator and
                    Samuel Tizzard as clerk. Educational matters were discussed and the
                    republication of Bellamy's Translation of the Five Books
                        of Moses was proposed. In 1834 the constitution was revised and the
                    name again changed to the General Convention of the Western States. 
                        Kentucky
                    , Indiana, 
                  Michigan, Illinois
               , and 
                        Tennessee
                     were especially urged to send delegates. A resolution favoring
                    temperance was adopted. In 1835 at Ashland, 
                        Richmond
                     county, 
                        Ohio
                    , no church could be obtained for the convention. A Mr. Whitney
                    "erected, enclosed, and prepared a house for the reception of 500
                    worshippers, and in the short space of three weeks." In 1837, in
                    response to a growing demand in 
                        Ohio
                    , the scope of the organization was limited and the name became the 
                        Ohio
                     State Convention of Universalists.
            The year 1826 also witnessed the removal of Rev. Jonathan Kidwell, a native of 
                        Kentucky
                    , to Sulphur 
                        Spring
                    , near Abing-ton, 
                        Wayne
                     county, Indiana. At the age of 18 he had begun 
                  
                     1 This town was laid out in the northwest corner
                            of Union county in 1833 by Jonathan Kidwell and J. 
                                Adams
                             where they founded a Univcrsalist college and press.
               
                     the work of a Methodist minister, but seven
                    years later sought greater liberty among the Disciples. In two years more he had
                    discarded orthodoxy, and for a time even religion itself. But upon rereading his
                    Bible, he became a Universalist, and from 1815 to 1849 he labored in behalf of
                    that interpretation of Christianity, meeting with much opposition and even
                    personal violence. He traveled in a circuit comprising seven counties in eastern
                    Indiana and nine in western 
                        Ohio
                    . When he first moved to Indiana he estimated the number of
                    Univer-salists in this region to be about 200; three years later he stated that
                    there were about 2,000, and that in one season five church buildings were being
                    erected.
            In July, 1827, the above-mentioned Abel Sargent, now living in 
                        Cincinnati
                    , began the publication of a magazine, The Lamp of
                        Liberty, which continued, however, for only about two years. Another
                    more permanent publication made its initial appearance at Eaton, 
                        Ohio
                    , a few weeks later than Sargent's. This was The Star in the West. The editors were Jonathan Kidwell and D. D.
                    Hall, and the printer Samuel Tizzard. At first the numbers appeared monthly in a
                    little pamphlet form of eight pages, measuring nine by six inches each. But two
                    years later the office was moved to 
                        Cincinnati
                    , the paper changed to a weekly of increased size, and the name to
                        The Sentinel and Star in the West. Rev. J. C. Waldo
                    replaced Mr. Hall as an editor. In 1833 the place of publication was changed to
                    Philomath, Indiana. This venture was unsuccessful and Mr. Tizzard soon returned
                    to 
                        Cincinnati
                     with his paper, securing Rev. George Rogers as editor. This
                    partnership continued until 1837, when The Star passed into
                    the control of Rev. John A. Gurley.
            In 1829 Indiana agents for The Star were to be found in
                            
                  Milton, Richmond, Connersville, Indianapolis
               , Danville, Green-castle, Eugene,
                    Attica, 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    , Covington, 
                        Harrison
                    , and Patriot. In addition to these the following places are
                    mentioned in the list for 1831: Montezuma, 
                        Terre Haute
                    , Leavenworth, LaFayette, Versailles, 
                        Bloomington
                    , Rome, 
                  Brookville,
                            Somerset
               , and 
                        Logansport
                    .
            The following paragraph is quoted from J. A. Stoner's essay on Before and After Winchester:
            
            For a number of years Jonathan Kidwell continued to serve as field agent for the
                        Sentinel (and Star), as it was called.
                    He visited the remotest parts of the country, and frequently preached where
                    Universalism was but little known. While on a business trip to Indianapoils, in
                    the winter of 1829, Mr. Kidwell, by request, preached a number of times in the
                    State House. At the close of his last lecture, Rev. Edwin Kay, a young Methodist
                    minister of the capitol city, arose and announced that he would reply to the
                    arguments that Mr. Kidwell had advanced. He was promptly invited to do so then
                    and there, but firmly refused. A challenge for a joint public debate quickly
                    followed. The discussion took place in the Methodist meeting-house, January 21,
                    1S30, and drew an immense crowd of interested people. The legislature voted to
                    adjourn in order that the members might attend the debate. The clergy of the
                    city were solidly arrayed against the champion of Universalism, and the local
                    papers manifested a bias in favor of Mr. Kay. As usual orthodoxy claimed the
                    victory, but it was evident that they were surprised at the capable defense made
                    by Mr. Kidwell, for Mr. Ray's friends would not consent to the
                    publication of an official report. Mr. Kidwell on his own account prepared A Series of Strictures, or notes, on the debate, filling about
                    one hundred pages: and these, with some additional matter, were printed in book
                    form and widely circulated.
            In 1830 there appears a notice in the Star, calling a
                    conference at 
                  Milton,
                            Wayne
                county, to meet
                    on August 14 and 15 "for the purpose of taking into consideration the
                    propriety of our brethren organizing themselves into societies." This
                    seems to imply that hitherto Indiana Universalists had not organized churches to
                    any extent. In the same issue there appears a letter from an ex-Presbyterian
                    minister living near what is now the Fincastle church, asking that a
                    Universalist minister be sent there. He mentions the names of Messrs. Purley,
                    Jennison, Gleason, and John Foster as being Universalists. Rev. A. H. Longley
                    was preaching during this year at Liberty.
            In the next few years there was a rapid increase in the number of clergymen,
                    especially of itinerants. A list of preachers in the western States in 1836 and
                    1837 includes the names of E. Beals, A. Bond, J. Bradley, A. A. Davis, S. W. H.
                    Jolly, Sweet, Truman Strong, Daniel R. Biddlecome, T. H. 
                        Johnson
                    , J. J. Hollister, D. 
                        Tenny
                    , N. Wadsworth, E. Richardson, L. L. Sidler, W. Y. Emmet, C. Rogers,
                    George Rogers, Leidy. The homes of most of these men were in 
                        Ohio
                    , but many of them traveled in Indiana. George Rogers and Sidler
                    were in 
                        Cincinnati
                    . Erasmus Manford took his  first
                    missionary journey through southern Indiana on his way to 
                        New Orleans
                    .
            It is difficult to estimate the strength of Universalism at this time.
                    Kidwell's rather glowing statement of conditions should be compared
                    with one by A. C. Barry, D.D., to the effect that at this time it had only a
                    scant and weak foothold in 
                        Ohio
                     and Indiana. According to the denominational publications, E. B.
                    Mann and Jonathan Kidwell were the only resident ministers, but Col. R. P. De
                    Hart's Past and Present of 
                            Tippecanoe County
                        
                on page 253 refers to Rev. Hiram Curry as a preacher of
                    Universalism in 
                        Dayton
                     as early as 1828. Little is known concerning E. B. Mann, but he
                    appears to have been an early and sturdy pioneer preacher in 
                        Floyd
                     and other Ohio Valley counties. For a number
                    of years he made his home at Leavenworth.
            The theology of pioneer Universalism is indicated by an echo of the
                    "Restorationist" controversy which temporarily split the
                    denomination in New 
                        England
                    . There is a reference in the Star to Reverend
                    Robert Smith, who about 1840 was living at New Trenton and who was the author of
                    a book entitled Both Sides of Religious Ceremonies. This book
                    argued against public prayer; excessive opposition to his views led Mr. Smith to
                    transfer his fellowship to the Disciples. The Star says that
                    Mr. Smith was the "only Universalist minister to our knowledge that
                    does not advocate and practice public prayer. However, Rev. Mr. Parker, a
                    Restorationist, as he calls himself, agrees with him." The
                    Restorationists were Universalists who believed in punishment after death,
                    whereas, the word Universalist, at that time, implied the "death and
                    glory" theology. In response to an inquiry made probably a few years
                    earlier, Rev. J. C. Waldo, of 
                        Cincinnati
                    , said, "Mr. R. is thoroughly acquainted with the
                    Universalists in every section of this country. The Restorationists, he says,
                    are comparatively nothing." Similarly, Jonathan Kidwell replied that
                    "There is but one preacher within my acquaintance, calling himself a
                    Universalist, who believes in future punishment, and there are but few private
                    individuals." These statements would be far from true in 1917.
            These early Universalists were believers in religious freedom and unity. To
                    emphasize this some of their predecessors  in 
                        Ohio
                     had for a time taken the name of the Free Church. In Indiana they
                    contributed frequently to the building of Union churches, and of churches of
                    other denominations which were to be open to any religious society. When they
                    built churches of their own they frequently provided that the buildings were to
                    be open for all meetings of a religious, moral or educational character.
                    Sometimes these situations led to misunderstandings. For example, the Otto
                    United Brethren Church of 
                        Franklin County
                     built a church which was to be free to all denominations who
                    believed the essential doctrines of Christianity. The 
                        Johnson
                     Fork Universalist Church was refused permission to use the
                    building. A little later the latter were provoked by an attack upon the
                    character of one of their deceased members. Reverend Robert Smith, after holding
                    a service outside the door of the church upon a cold day in February, made
                    application to the court for, and obtained, an injunction permitting them to use
                    the building. But even then almost a riot took place on the day appointed for
                    the meeting.
            A case of a slightly different character is that of the Uni-versalists of the 
                        White
                     Water Society, who attempted to maintain a Sunday school, which
                    they had organized on June 3, 1838, on a non-sectarian basis. Failing to get the
                    support of the community in this, they relate that they were obliged to
                    "go for the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the
                    Bible." Their school thereupon became prosperous, and two years later
                    was in a vigorous condition.
            The progress of pioneer Universalism may be summed up by the following statement
                    from the Indiana Gazetteer, published in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1849 (page 75).
            Universalism has been preached in this State, more or less, for 20 years, but not
                    until within six or seven has there been much attention paid to organization;
                    and at this time it is supposed there are more believers out of the churches of
                    this denomination than in them. Within a few years, there has been a rapid
                    increase of the adherents to that form of Christianity, and it now has
                    unyielding advocates in all parts of the State. There are 29 preachers, 15
                    meeting houses, 55 societies, 10 associations, and 1 convention of that
                    denomination in the State, and they publish two periodicals, The
                        Western Olive Branch, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , E. Mann, editor and proprietor, and the Independent
                        Universalist, 
                        Terre Haute
                    , E. M. Knapp, editor.
            
            ORGANIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT
                    OF CHURCHES
            
            Inheriting the custom from Congregationalism, New 
                        England
                     Universalists were organized upon the dual basis of parishes and
                    churches. In Indiana there were few if any instances of such a separation
                    between the business and religious phases of church work. The word parish was
                    not used. The term society, however, was common, but apparently was synonymous
                    with church. The officers were frequently moderator, clerk, treasurer, three
                    trustees and two or more deacons.
            The following list is a partial summary of places where Universalist churches
                    have existed in this State. The first date indicates the date of organization;
                    dd indicates building built or dedicated; D stands for dormant or dead; c for
                    about, b for before, and R for reorganized. ∗
                    shows that the church is still in existence. The location of a few of the places
                    mentioned is uncertain.

            ORGANIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT
                    OF ASSOCIATIONS
            
            Like many other denominations of Indiana, and in conformity to the custom of
                    eastern Universalists, the early churches of the middle west were grouped into
                    Associations. The plan of organization usually called for Quarterly, Semi-Annual
                    or Annual meetings. All matters of fellowship, ordination and discipline were
                    originally in the control of these Associations, but later such responsibilities
                    were transferred to the State Convention.
            The minutes of Association meetings have not been preserved, except in case of
                    the Rogers Association, which is the only one having a continuous existence from
                    its beginning to the present time. The decline of Associations and the growth of
                    State Conventions is a common tendency throughout the denomination.
            The organization of the "First Association of Universalists in the State
                    of Indiana" took place in a three-day meeting beginning September 30,
                    1831, at Leavenworth. The counties of 
                  Crawford, Harrison, Perry
                and 
                        Pike
                     were represented. The temporary officers were Moses Boon, moderator
                    (resigned, and succeeded by Levi Kinman), and William Course, clerk. Committees
                    on Constitution and Resolutions were appointed, and $200 appropriated
                    for the purchase of Universalist books. It was voted to correspond with a number
                    of prominent clergymen of the eastern States—Hosea Ballou, Hosea
                    Ballou, 2nd, William Balfour, Thomas Whitte-more and Sebastian and Russell
                    Streeter—for information and suggestions. This apparently led to the
                    purchase of a shipment of books from 
                        Boston
                     and their subsequent sale to 
                    Indiana Universalists. A pretentious corps of officers for the coming year was
                    chosen. President, Rev. E. B. Mann; vice-president, William Course; secretary,
                    David Greggs; treasurer, John Popham; elders, Levi Kinman, Jesse Chappie, George
                    Ewing; committee on discipline, Samuel Harding, John Cooper, Thomas Copehart;
                    trustees, Horatio Sharp, Philip Pearce, William Vaughn.
            Subsequent meetings are recorded at Rome, 1832; Laconia, 1833; Tobin's
                    Bottom, 
                        Perry
                     county, 1840, and the Association is known to have been in
                    existence as late as 1879.
            The 
                        Cambridge
                     Association was organized soon after 1831. It was possibly
                    identical with the Western Union Association. The latter met at 
                        Anderson
                     and at 
                        Richmond
                     as late as 1843.
            The Laughery Association was first convened at Versailles in 1840. It included
                    the counties of 
                  Jefferson, Switzerland, Dearborn, Ripley
                and 
                        Franklin
                    . Reverend Thomas Hewson was elected moderator; M. L. Edwards,
                    clerk, and E. Rudd, treasurer. During the meetings a church was organized at the
                    home of Armit Robinson, four miles south of Versailles. In 1843 Hewson was
                    employed as an itinerant missionary. He was succeeded by S. P. Oyler.
            In 1847 the Laughery Association met at Stringtown. The Kidwell-Manford
                    controversy (see section 5) was causing disruption here and the friends of
                    Manford and Foster were invited to the home of S. H. Knapp, where they formed a
                    new organization, called the Rogers Association, in honor of the Reverend George
                    Rogers. Since then meetings have been held annually or oftener. The association
                    has really been a kind of subordinate Convention for the southeastern corner of
                    the State.

            THE OLD STATE CONVENTION
            
            The next step in the organization of the church was the grouping of Associations
                    into a State Convention, composed of delegates from the various Associations and
                    from those churches which were not included in any Association. As already
                    stated, a Western Convention had been organized in 1826, but in 1837 its scope
                    was limited to 
                        Ohio
                    . This same year saw the organization of State Conventions in
                    Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                    . The former convened at Sheets Mills, 
                        Jefferson
                     county, on July 28, 1837. Delegates were present from the First and
                    Western Union Associations and from the Patriot society. Among those in
                    attendance were E. B. Mann (moderator) , Em Gird (clerk), Reverends Blalock,
                    Kidwell, Wads-worth, Messrs. D. G. Wilson, E. Milligan, J. Hicks, Sr., J. A. N.
                    Gooch, A. Gazeley, and Dr. J. Hubbard. A constitution was adopted, after which
                    Kidwell was elected president, Mann, vice-president, and Gird, clerk.
            The session of 1840 was at Patriot, where, in the previous year, a church
                    building had been dedicated. The delegates represented the First Association,
                    the First Society on the Whitewater, the Patriot Society, and the First Society
                    in 
                        Shelby
                     county. In addition, visitors from the counties of
                            
                  Ripley, Dearborn, Hancock
               
                    and 
                        Jennings
                     were invited to seats in the council. By-laws were added to a
                    previously adopted constitution. Thomas Hewson of 
                        Jefferson
                     county and W. W. Dean of 
                        Louisville
                     were given letters of fellowship and license to preach. E. B. Mann
                    was chosen president; Jonathan Kidwell, vice-president, and E. Gird, clerk. The
                    committee of last year "to inquire into the propriety of getting up a
                    book printing establishment" was continued.
            The Convention met in 1841 at Flat Rock, 
                        Shelby
                     county, at the home of Hallick Vanpelt, five miles southwest of St.
                    Omer. Delegates appeared from the First, Laughery and Western Union Associations
                    and from the societies at Patriot, Knightstown, Perrysville, 
                        Marion
                     township in 
                        Decatur
                     county, Flat Rock, and other parts of 
                        Shelby
                     county, and from Indiana and 
                        Kentucky
                    . Mann, Kidwell and G. C. McCune of Knightstown were the clergymen
                    present. Reverend Jacob  M. B. Kaler was
                    granted ordination. Support was pledged to Kidwell's Encyclopedia.
            The Convention of 1842 met at Knightstown. It drew a larger attendance than any
                    previous session. There were twelve ministers present, including Biddlecome and
                    Rogers from 
                        Ohio
                    , and Mann, Manford and Babcock from Indiana. Rev. B. F. Foster was
                    ordained during the meetings. He was said to be "a young man of
                    promising talent." Subsequent years showed this talent unfolding in the
                    service of the Universahst church, the Odd Fellows and the State of Indiana.
            Subsequent sessions are recorded at 
                        Terre Haute
                     in 1843 and 1845, 
                        Madison
                    , 1844, Dublin, 1846, and Laconia in 1847. Meetings were doubtless
                    held yearly from the date of organization to about 1854, but the records are
                    frequently missing. The energy of the convention was largely expended in
                    controversy, the story of which is related in the following section.
            THE KIDWELL-MANFORD CONTROVERSY
            
            The decade of 1840 was marked by a bitter controversy between two factions of
                    Indiana Universalists. Although the issues came to be largely personal ones,
                    they grew out of fundamental differences of opinion in regard to Biblical
                    criticism and ecclesiastical policy. On the one side were the earlier pioneer
                    preachers, led by Rev. Jonathan Kidwell; on the other, the more recent comers,
                    headed by Rev. Erasmus Manford.
            The work of the former leader has been already referred to. With no apparent
                    educational opportunities, he became a thinker, preacher and writer of merit.
                    For this his opponents never forgave him. Their mean and petty references to his
                    occasional grammatical errors are phrased in abusive language that would not be
                    permitted today. It must be confessed, however, that he did not hesitate to
                    reply in kind. But in the little town of Philomath he edited his monthly Philomath Encyclopedia and Circle of the Sciences, and
                    actually succeeded in what his opponents were many years in doing, that is, he
                    opened a Universalist school. In addition to his magazine, he published several
                    books on the Bible. The preface to The Alpha (1843) says:
            
            
                    The object of the Alpha is to show that the Jewish Pentateuch was not written
                        by Moses, the Hebrew legislator; that it never existed in its present form
                        until nearly one thousand years after Moses; that in all probability it was
                        the work of Ezra; that the work is a heterogeneous mass of vague traditions
                        combined with Jewish history; that it is not a work of divine authority, nor
                        does the truth of the Christian religion depend on the truth or falsehood of
                        the Pentateuch.
                
            This last clause gives the real clue to Kidwell's
                    position—that Christianity was not dependent upon certain portions of
                    the Old Testament nor upon the miracles of the New. In this he was violently
                    opposed by nearly all of his contemporaries, although today his propositions
                    would be accepted.
            A second point of controversy grew out of the first,. The opponents of Kidwell
                    wished to disfellowship him for his heretical opinions. This fact, and doubtless
                    his convictions as well, led him to oppose the efforts they were making to place
                    the Indiana Convention under the authority of the 
                        United States
                     Convention.
            The opening notes of disagreement were sounded as early as 1836, the year in
                    which Rev. George Rogers came west. He and Kidwell were not congenial. It is
                    asserted by Kid-well's friends that Rogers opened the attack, and that
                    he was assisted by Manford. The peacemakers, however, succeeded in preventing
                    any open breach.
            But criticisms of Kidwell's heretical views continued to find spoken and
                    printed expression, and he replied by accusing Rogers, Pingree, Manford and
                    others of trying to establish a kind of priesthood, ironically calling them
                    "little bishops." The sentiment of a unified form of church
                    government was growing rapidly among Universalists through all parts of the
                    country, and to this tendency Kidwell was violently opposed. In the convention
                    of 1841 he and his friends were able to vote down the approval of such a
                    proposition originating in the 
                        Miami
                     (
                        Ohio
                    ) Association, and to secure the adoption of the following
                    resolution: 
                        
                     Resolved, That the Universalists of Indiana are of age
                            and consider themselves capable of self-government, and therefore can
                            not submit to any dictation or control, either on the part of our
                            brothers in the east or elsewhere, and that our delegates to the 
                                United States
                             Convention be so instructed.
                    
            
            
            Kidwell's extreme individualism led him to certain ecclesiastical acts
                    that would not be permitted by the fellowship rules of the denomination today.
                    But it must be remembered that there were no uniform rules in those days, and
                    indeed hardly any rules at all. The first case was of G. C. McCune, who was
                    disfellowshipped by the 
                        Montgomery
                     (
                        Ohio
                    ) Association. It is related that Kidwell restored him to
                    fellowship. This probably means that some Association in Indiana restored him
                    through Kidwell's influence. A second case was that of Judah Babcock,
                    who had befriended McCune. In 1842 he was notified of charges against him in the
                    Allegheny (
                        New York
                    ) Association. He went east and returned the next year with papers
                    of recommendation from a large number of friends, which Kidwell published. There
                    was no mention in these, however, concerning the disposition of the charges,
                    which may possibly have been decided against him. A motion in the Indiana
                    Convention of 1844 to disfellowship him was lost, by a vote of thirty in favor
                    to thirty-one opposed, and the matter referred to the Blue
                    River Association. Kidwell's friendship for McCune and
                    Babcock drew this sentence from Manford, "It is well known that
                    Philomath has been for a long time the city of refuge for outcasts of the
                    Universalist Ministry."
            A partial cause of the rivalry between Kidwell and the group of men connected
                    with the Star in the West, Rogers, Pingree and Gurley, may
                    have resulted from the competition of their papers. Their enmity continued for
                    several years, with charges and counter-charges between the respective camps.
            Technical details began to prove a matter of contention in the Convention
                    sessions. It had been the custom to have delegates chosen by the churches,
                    whereas the constitution declared that they must be chosen by Associations. This
                    was pointed out by Kidwell in 1842, who claimed that many supposed delegates
                    were not eligible to vote. His point was sustained by the president, E. B. Mann,
                    whereupon 
                        Jordan
                    , one of Manford's supporters, severely criticised Kidwell.
                    This controversy was continued the following year.
            In the 
                        United States
                     Convention of 1844 a committee was appointed to draw up conditions
                    of fellowship and a uniform  system of church
                    government for all Universalists in the 
                        United States
                    . Kidwell was immediately up in arms. In the Indiana Convention of
                    that year his opponents offered a resolution that "this Convention
                    represent itself in the councils of the 
                        United States
                     Convention of Universalists this year, and annually, and ask for
                    its fellowship." Kidwell then offered as an amendment "that in
                    becoming a member of the 
                        United States
                     Convention we do not surrender the right of legislating for
                    ourselves, but reserve to ourselves the right of making our own laws and
                    regulations." The amendment was adopted, 32 to 30, whereupon the main
                    question was "thrown under the table." The Associations and
                    churches were asked to express themselves on the whole question before the next
                    convention.
            In response to this request a few resolutions were adopted in various parts of
                    the State. The special committee of the 
                        United States
                     Convention reported its plan of uniform church government, and
                    this, the "Sawyer report," was adopted. The First Association
                    went on record as opposing this report; the Upper 
                        Wabash
                     as favoring it. Action by the State Convention was deferred, at
                    first one year, and eventually until the secession of 1848.
            In 1846 resolutions were introduced into the Convention questioning
                    Manford's fellowship. These were tabled. The following year at the
                        White River Association, with which Manford held his
                    fellowship, he exhibited documentary evidence from 
                        New Hampshire
                     proving his ordination. He invited Kidwell to bring charges against
                    him before the Association.
            According to the custom, if not the rules of that time, the Convention had no
                    jurisdiction over questions of fellowship, except in cases of appeal from an
                    Association. Kidwell claimed that the above action of the White
                    River Association constituted a trial and acquittal of Manford, and
                    he accordingly appealed to the Convention. Manford, on the other hand, denied
                    Kidwell's right to bring this appeal, asserting that there had been no
                    formal charges and trial. The president, E. M. Knapp, sustained Kidwell and was
                    in turn sustained by the Convention, 21 to 5. The White
                    River delegates were then excluded and the minutes of their
                    Association in  regard to Manford were
                    "set aside." Kidwell, Babcock, Mc-Cune and Mann then preferred
                    five charges of libel against Manford, who was allowed to reply, but given no
                    opportunity to introduce evidence. He was voted guilty and suspended from
                    fellowship pending confession or proof of innocence.
            Manford paid no attention to this decree, but treated it as a piece of
                    persecution. He and his friends made an "appeal to the State"
                    by urging the organization of a new Convention. This proposition was approved by
                    the White River, Upper and Lower 
                        Wabash
                    , Laughery, and other Associations, and supported by several
                    ministers. The delegates met in 1848 and accomplished the organization of the
                    present State Convention. The old Convention continued to meet in the southern
                    part of the State. But within a few years both Kid-well and Knapp died, and with
                    them the strength of their organization.
            Thus ended the controversy. It has been related with a detail somewhat out of
                    proportion to the remainder of this essay for several reasons. It is probably
                    the only instance of rival Universalist Conventions; it reflects the spirit of
                    the day; it perhaps explains the inefficiency of later generations; and, most
                    important, it opens up, for further investigation on the part of some other
                    student, the interesting career of a true pioneer, Jonathan Kidwell.

            Old Corydon
            By CHARLES MOORES, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Member of the State Historical Commission
            The sentimentalist is wont to personify a commonwealth as a broad-shouldered,
                    underclad young woman lifting a torch or flourishing a sword or emptying a
                    cornucopia. She commands deference because in her Amasonian
                    presence—like that of our latter-day Golduh—no mere man
                    would dare cross her purposes. Her monster physique offers no suggestion of a
                    possible maternity, the normal function of a state, nor any hint of a useful
                    occupation—although a state really ought to have something to do.
            In the effort to set before you the picture of Indiana's birthplace I
                    would personify our State, not as torchbearer, sword swinger or
                    cornucopia-emptier, but as the mother of us all, who, at the close of her first
                    century, is still young and strong and wise and fit to bear and rear and train
                    her children for a place among America's idealists.
            This year Indiana is struggling after a memory of her infancy. Like one who is
                    world-weary she finds it hard to command. a clear vision of the place where she
                    was born. Many a loyal Hoosier shamefacedly confesses his ignorance of the
                    capital of a hundred years ago and wonders where Corydon is and what it is like.
                    Even the cultivated non-classicist pronounces it Corydon and the railway
                    conductor calls it Croydon.
            Where William Henry Harrison and John Tipton and Isaac Blackford and many a
                    comrade and friend of 
                        Washington
                     used to gather and James 
                        Monroe
                     and Andrew 
                        Jackson
                     received a royal hospitality, and while men were still talking of.
                    Napoleon, Indiana's tiny capital rested in village simplicity among
                    sheltering elms and nestling hills.
            To be great it is not necessary to be big. Richard Harding Davis was bigger than
                    Robert Louia Stevenson, and  Shafter
                    outweighed Napoleon. In the days when American civilization was in the making,
                    more leaders gravitated toward 
                        Springfield
                     and 
                        Richmond
                     than ever enjoyed the hospitality of 
                        Kansas City
                     or 
                        Chicago
                    . In Corydon the capital there were only a score who had reached the
                    age of forty-five.
            In the decade of its primacy—from 1813 to 1824—the group
                    who came there year after year to lay the foundations for a commonwealth were
                    pioneers of a distinctive type. They were not unlettered men to whom learning
                    had been denied, nor brawlers escaping the restraints of civilization, nor as in
                    the 
                        Kentucky
                     of 1800 or the 
                        Arizona
                     of 1900, were they rebels against stable government who believed in
                    a liquid and dilute constitution. On the contrary, many of them were
                    missionaries of education and of political idealism who had come to Indiana to
                    create a commonwealth with all the stability which the years of revolution and
                    of constitutional reaction had made them covet so earnestly. At the same time
                    they hoped to realize more completely than in the elder east the democracy of
                    which 
                        Jefferson
                     was the forerunner and 
                        Jackson
                     the apostle. To them equality under a stable government was a
                    passion and the exclusion of human slavery a religion.
            The Corydon of a hundred years ago was a protest against commercialism. It had no
                    metropolitan ambitions like 
                        Madison
                    . It was not cosmopolitan like 
                        Vincennes
                    . It had no river trade, no Indian trade, no land speculators. It
                    was an easy-going, old-fashioned 
                        Virginia
                     village, with an ambition to be decent and to cultivate the social
                    spirit. Its older houses were log cabins, but it had some generous brick
                    colonial residences, which still stand. Democracy had become a social ideal
                    everywhere. The man in the big colonial house and the man in the log cabin
                    neither patronized nor toadied. Labor was not self-assertive as it is today, for
                    everybody labored. Wealth signified little, for the only commodity it could buy
                    was land, and the more land a man had the more labor he had to provide. Where
                    slavery was forbidden and labor scarce, men coveted large land-holdings about as
                    much as a tired housewife longs for a big house with many rooms and no servants.
            
            One way to judge the character of a town is by its representative men. Old
                    Corydon as a social study calls for a broader view, for the student must
                    consider the things done there and the men who did them; those whose labor drew
                    them there from time to time as well as those to whom Corydon was home. Of the
                    men who lived in Corydon while it was Indiana's capital, Dennis
                    Pennington, John 
                        Tipton
                    , Spier 
                        Spencer
                    , and Isaac 
                        Blackford
                     were probably the leaders, and of those whose duties brought them
                    there often and kept them there, mention may be made of Governors William Henry
                    Harrison, Jonathan Jennings, and William 
                        Hendricks
                    , Treasurer Samuel Merrill, Secretary of State Robert A. New, and
                    Judges Benjamin 
                        Parke
                    , James 
                        Scott
                    , and John 
                        Johnson
                    .
            Some of these were men of state-wide fame, but the one who is always identified
                    in history and tradition with the fate and fortune of 
                        Harrison
                     county is Dennis Pennington; from the time he came with the family
                    of Daniel 
                        Boone
                     and other adventure hunters at the dawn of the nineteenth century
                    to open the wilderness and wrest it from the treacherous Indian, until long
                    after his heroic fight to prevent the removal of the capital to 
                        Indianapolis
                     he was 
                        Harrison
                     county's trusted and devoted champion. His portrait done
                    in oil hangs in the Representatives' Hall in the old capitol to show
                    how far character can surpass human beauty.
            Dennis Pennington's spelling was even more unconventional than 
                        Washington
                    's. He gained his culture by the slow process of social
                    attrition. He was too busy with the affairs of men to read books. He held
                    closely and consciously to his heart the ideals of the community and from the
                    earliest days threw the weight of no inconsiderable influence into the
                    anti-slavery fight, warning a friend in 1815: "Let us be on our guard
                    when our convention men are chosen that they be men opposed to
                    slavery."
            Dennis Pennington is remembered because he built the cutest little State house
                    that was not hatched from an easter egg or set up to play
                    dolls in; so ugly that men love to look at it. For nearly a generation he was a
                    legislative leader, representing Corydon and serving as speaker in the
                    Territorial legislature of 1810, and serving again in the Constitutional
                    Convention of 1816, in thirteen sessions of the State  Senate and in five sessions of the House. Such
                    scant records as are preserved of the early legislatures show that
                    "Uncle Dennis" as he was called gave to the lawmaking in which
                    he bore so conspicuous a part an unusual degree of horse sense and old-fashioned
                    honesty. As representative of a river county he can not be blamed for trying to
                    put off the inevitable eclipse of Corydon, and the removal of the capital, for
                    it took longer then to travel from the river civilization to the semi-barbarism
                    of 
                        Indianapolis
                     than it requires now to go from 
                        Indianapolis
                     to Constantinople, and the journey was fraught with graver dangers
                    than those of floating mines or treacherous submarines. A brave fight he waged
                    each winter, when the General Assembly took up its regular program of trying to
                    lower the cost of boarding the legislators by threatening to adjourn to some
                    cheaper town. No Hansard has preserved for us Uncle Dennis' blunt
                    eloquence when he made his brave defense of the Corydon cuisine as against the
                    cheap labor of Charleston's cooks. The danger was so real that even the
                    Corydon Indiana Gazette of December 14, 1820, whose motto was
                    "Willing to praise but not afraid to blame," and which
                    discussed only questions of great import, came out December 14, 1820, boldly
                    with this editorial utterance: 
                        The old famous resolution to remove the legislature to Charleston or some
                            other place where it is imagined members can get boarding lower than
                            Corydon is going the formal rounds of legislation, when it is understood
                            that no more is intended by it than to beat down the prices of
                        boarding.
                    
            
            This nefarious measure was opposed by Simon Yandes of 
                        Marion
                     and supported by the jurist Joseph Holman, the bloodthirsty fighter
                    John 
                        Tipton
                    , and the financier Samuel Merrill of 
                        Switzerland
                     county. The price of board was fixed by law of the county
                    commissioners at 37 1/2 cents for breakfast or dinner, 25 cents for supper, and
                    lodging 12 1/2 cents, with whiskey at 37 1/2 cents a quart.
                    Whether legislative agitation brought it down, we shall never know, but the vote
                    of 11 ayes to 16 noes shows that Corydon's cohorts won the skirmish
                    under Dennis Pennington's leadership.
            Samuel Merrill's account of the village in the Indiana
                        Gazateer for 1849 mentions the stone courthouse built by  the Speaker of the House of
                    Representatives—and a better man the State never had—who
                    it was said was often called from the hammer and trowel to the chair: 
                        The other buildings there, not exceeding one hundred in number, were
                            either cabins or of hewn logs. As the town was but little visited except
                            during the sessions of the legislature, there was then often a large
                            crowd, while the means of accommodation were not in proportion. The
                            supplies came from 
                                Louisville
                            , twenty-five miles distant; but the state of the roads and
                            streams was such that no regularity could be relied on. Whenever
                            anything was wanting the arrival of the wagon from 
                                Louisville
                             was to supply the deficiency. As this explanation was often
                            given, much merriment was excited one morning by a modest
                            boarder's being asked, when he had no plate, knife or fork,
                            whether he too was waiting for the wagon.

            Captain Spier 
                        Spencer
                    , more than 
                        Tipton
                     or 
                        Harrison
                    , was Corydon's military hero. His company of Indian
                    fighters adopted a uniform that justified their warlike name—
                        Spencer
                    's Yellow Jackets—and made life at the frontier
                    capital safe, while it brought a certain military glory to the little town. When
                    real warfare broke out in 1811 and Tecumseh and the Prophet had to be
                    suppressed, Corydon was proud of its fighting company as they marched out in
                    their yellow finery to join the regulars and 
                        Kentucky
                     militia under William Henry Harrison's command.
            
               
                        Spencer
                     was territorial sheriff of the county from 1809 to 1811, and at the
                    same time kept the village tavern, which his wife continued for many years after
                    his heroic death at 
                        Tippecanoe
                    .
            On that fatal November morning in 1811 
                        Spencer
                    's Yellow Jackets held the place of greatest danger through
                    the  darkness in which the Prophet's
                    braves had hoped to surprise them. A survivor of the fight reported that firing
                    was so constant that the bark was flying from the trees. He could see the
                    Indians in the half darkness running from point to point with tomahawk and
                    scalping knife and bow and arrow, trying to finish their work of destruction
                    before the whites could organize to resist, while 
                        Spencer
                     kept calling incessantly, "Hold the line, men; hold the
                    line." They did hold the line till daybreak. "As the fight
                    continued," this pioneer's story goes on, "we got the
                    welcome order to fix bayonets and charge. We moved on while as the men fell I
                    could hear Captain 
                        Spencer
                    's voice—‘Close up, men! Steady!
                    Steady!’ " The captain of the line was wounded in the head,
                    but fought on. He was shot through both thighs and fell. The men raised him up
                    so he could see to give his commands and a ball through the body brought his
                    brave life to an end. 
                        Spencer
                    's boy, twelve years old, was brought back from this tragic
                    scene to civilization by General 
                        Harrison
                     and educated by 
                        Harrison
                     for West Point.
            General John 
                        Tipton
                     was more than a local figure in Indiana's pioneer life. So
                    long as history was being made at Corydon he belonged there, and there his
                    descendants still live. He was first sheriff of the county, having already laid
                    the foundation of his greatness by serving as justice of the peace.
            In 1818 the county board made him custodian of the courthouse and
                    "accountable for any damage that may be sustained by reason of any
                    societies of people either religious or otherwise occupying said
                    courthouse."
            Governor 
                        Jennings
                     in 1820 appointed him one of the commissioners to locate the
                    "scite" for the permanent seat of government, and the Corydon
                    paper records on May 18 that Gen. John 
                        Tipton
                     left that place yesterday for 
                        White
                     river, accompanied by his excellency the governor, to fix the
                    location for the new capital, and notes his return in the issue of June 25th.
                    Next year he was serving again in the legislature and was chosen as a
                    commissioner to lay off the town of 
                        Indianapolis
                     on the site he had helped to choose.
            In 1820 he announced his candidacy for the legislature in a thoroughly frank way:
            
            
                    As my term of sheriff is expiring and I will not be eligible for reelection,
                        I am a candidate for the legislature. As actions speak louder than words,
                        having resided twelve years among you, nine of which I have been in office,
                        it is unnecessary to say more than that I have become a candidate
                        unsolicited.
                
            No Machiavellian pretense about that! In 1823 he was vice-president with Governor
                    William 
                        Hendricks
                     presiding, at the grandest Fourth of July celebration the world
                    ever witnessed. In 1831 he became 
                        United States
                     Senator by appointment, and in 1832 by election. Besides locating
                    and directing the survey of 
                        Indianapolis
                     he surveyed the disputed 
                        Illinois
                     boundary, and tried his best to locate 
                        Chicago
                     in the Hoosier State. He donated part of the site of 
                        Columbus
                     and became a prominent citizen of Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , and 
                        Logansport
                    , where he died in 1839. His fame was won at the Battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    , and because his comrades were buried there he bought the
                    Battleground and gave it to the State. For all his civic activities it was as an
                    Indian fighter that he was longest remembered.
            
               
                        Tipton
                    's father had been killed by the Indians, and the boy as he
                    grew up needed no encouragement to become an Indian fighter. He understood the
                    ways of the savage and met their stealth and treachery and merciless cruelty
                    with equal stealth and cruelty, but with high courage. As frontier sheriff he
                    had no trouble in dealing with lawless characters. He was a scrapper and a rough
                    rider, and he carried a big stick and used it, though he did not talk about it
                    before and after as other fighting characters in American history have been
                    known to do. At the battle of 
                        Tipton
                    's Island, a little Indian skirmish near Seymour, one of
                    his command, a stalwart Hoosier, persisted in talking, despite 
                        Tipton
                    's order of silence. When a reminder of the order proved
                    ineffective, 
                        Tipton
                     took the ranger's gun from him, tied him to a tree in the
                    tall weeds and left him there an ignominious captive until the battle was over.
            Two years earlier 
                        Tipton
                     was with Indiana Territory's first governor at 
                        Tippecanoe
                    . It was one of the last important Indian engagements east of the
                        Mississippi river, and although there were less than
                    two thousand engaged, the consequences were vastly significant.
            
            General John Charles Black, whom many of this club have heard and admired, said:
                        
                        Had 
                                Harrison
                             failed here … there would have been no mourning
                            along the St. 
                                Lawrence
                             and no bitter withdrawal to the lUo Grande, but instead,
                            pushing forward to the very feet of the Alleghenies the uprising power
                            of Great Britain would have helped to choke and destroy the infant
                            republic that she hated.
                    
            
            William Henry Harrison was victorious, and by his gallant conduct captured the
                    imagination of the American people and won and held through all too short a life
                    the passionate affection of the people of the West. Eleven heroes of 
                        Tippecanoe
                     who won immortality on that bloody field gave their names to
                    Indiana counties. Of these, Harrison, 
                  Parke, Floyd, Spencer
               , and 
                        Tipton
                     were well known at the little capital that was to be.
            John 
                        Tipton
                     was twenty-five years old when the slaughter began, Captain Spier 
                        Spencer
                     of the Yellow Jackets fell, and immediately after, his first
                    lieutenant, and Ensign 
                        Tipton
                     took charge of the company. General 
                        Harrison
                     rode up to the young ensign and asked, "Where is your
                    captain?" "Dead, sir," was the reply. "Where
                    is your lieutenant?" "He is dead, too, sir."
                    "Who is in command of this company?" "I am,
                    sir," was young 
                        Tipton
                    's answer. "Hold your own, my brave boy," 
                        Harrison
                     replied, "and I will send you reinforcements."
                    The young ensign was elected captain, so his comrade, Isaac Naylor, tells us,
                    "as a reward for his cool and deliberate heroism displayed during the
                    action."
            It was largely 
                        Tipton
                    's influence that led to the naming of so many of
                    Indiana's counties after the heroes of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    .
            In the federal Senate 
                        Tipton
                     was a conservative opponent of the extension of slavery. As long
                    ago as 1836 he was an earnest advocate of preparedness and a greatly
                    strengthened army, and when he differed with the president he declared: 
                        I do not stand here to register the executive will, but look for my
                            instruction to the boys of the West, those with hard hands, warm hearts,
                            and strong arms, who fell the forest, hold the plough and repel foreign
                            invasion.
                    
            
            
            Oliver H. Smith, who served with 
                        Tipton
                     in the Senate of the 
                        United States
                    , describes him as having a round head, a low, wrinkled forehead,
                    sunken gray eyes, stern countenance and stiff, reddish hair, grown pompadour; a
                    man of great energy, frank and confiding. "He saw the question
                    clearly," his colleagues tells us, "and marched directly at it
                    without any rhetorical flourishes… . When his term ended we parted
                    warm friends; with the last grasp of my hands as he bade me farewell, his voice
                    choked and the tears ran down his cheeks."
            An advertisement in the Corydon newspaper of October 28, 1819, shows much of the
                    advertiser's personality:

                        JOHN TIPTON.
                    
            
            It proves that the pioneer sheriff was not lacking in literary and military
                    taste.
            Corydon's best known citizen, at least until her much loved Walter Q.
                    Gresham became judge and cabinet minister, was Isaac 
                        Blackford
                    . In 1786, the same year that John 
                        Tipton
                     was born in the backwoods of Sevier county, 
                        Tennessee
                    , Isaac 
                        Blackford
                     was born at Bound Brook, 
                        New Jersey
                    . He entered 
                        Princeton
                    , where he made a brilliant record in Latin and Greek, excelled in
                    mathematics, and graduated in 1806. He studied law and began the practice in
                    Morristown, 
                        New Jersey
                    , but responded to the call of the wild and in 1811 floated down the
                    Allegheny and the 
                        Ohio
                     on a flatboat to 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    . In 1812 he was at 
                        Brookville
                    , (qualifying there for greatness as all early Hoosiers did). In
                    1813 he was clerk and recorder at 
                        Salem
                    , and in 1816 he was at Vin-cennes, where next year he was elected
                    to the legislature. and sent to Corydon, to receive almost immediately from
                    Governor 
                        Jennings
                     his appointment as judge of the supreme court. His judicial duties
                    identified him with the life of Corydon until 1825, when the removal to 
                        Indianapolis
                     took place. He held his place on the supreme bench by repeated  appointments from 1817 until 1851, when the
                    new constitution, to Indiana's shame, made the supreme bench elective
                    and made it possible to turn the control of that court over to the politicians.
            
               
                        Blackford
                     was defeated for governor in 1825, and the same year he failed by a
                    single vote of an election to the 
                        United States
                     Senate. It was as a judge and a reporter of supreme court decisions
                    that he became famous, and as an interpreter of the Common Law 
                        Blackford
                    's Reports of what were largely Isaac 
                        Blackford
                    's decisions introduced him to the courts of America and 
                        England
                     and won for him a position of the highest authority. In his Corydon
                    days his recognized scholarship, his courtesy and his high character, won for
                    him the respect of a community that had free and friendly ways and yet for a
                    frontier settlement had more than its share of dignity and self-respect. The
                    loneliness of Judge 
                        Blackford
                    's widowed life found its compensation in the companionship
                    of books and the contact his scholarship brought him with the scholarly men of
                    an exceptionally intelligent frontier community.
            The early settlement of Indiana owed much to Daniel 
                        Boone
                    , the woodsman and trapper and Indian fighter who in his frequent
                    journeys over the Wilderness Trail had led the caravans of emigrants out of 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and over the Cumberland mountains into the heart of 
                        Kentucky
                    . But his explorations and long hunting journeys were not confined
                    to 
                        Kentucky
                    , for the wild life north of the 
                        Ohio
                     river soon called him into Indiana, and before 1800 he was pitching
                    his hunting camp among the hills of 
                        Harrison
                     county. The earliest of those who came to live in that picturesque
                    county were Dennis Pennington and Squire 
                        Boone
                    , brother of Daniel 
                        Boone
                    . Squire 
                        Boone
                     was a famous hunter, the tales of whose strange adventures with
                    bears and with Indians are still told about the old county seat at Corydon.
            This region is historic ground, on the edge of the battleground which divided the
                    half-civilized Indians of the south from the savages of the north. It was
                    subject to incursions from these irreconcilable enemies. It was a land of game;
                    bear, deer, and turkeys were abundant. Notwithstanding the danger of the
                    situation, this hunting ground soon attracted  the attention of the Boones and other 
                        Kentucky
                     pioneers. Every excusion was a scouting expedition, every trail a
                    war path. On one of their hunting expeditions Squire 
                        Boone
                    , in passing along the eastern bluff of Buck creek, noticed a small
                    opening in the rocks, partially hidden by bushes. It appeared to be a good
                    hiding place for large game. A few miles further on he was attacked by Indians.
                    His only chance was to hide. He remembered the cave he had just discovered, and
                    reached it when his pursuers were at his very heels. Throwing himself into the
                    cave he heard the Indians pass over his head. The little cavern had saved his
                    life. To him it was a sanctuary. He chose it as his place of burial, a natural
                    sepulchre.
            A rough stone in the hillside closes the entrance to 
                        Boone
                    's grave. About seven feet within is a little room where a
                    recent search disclosed the broken coffin and the exposed bones of Squire 
                        Boone
                    , a man of stalwart frame and of great strength.
            Squire 
                        Boone
                     spent his latter days near this cave. A great spring poured its
                    torrent from the cave down the hillside, having a fall of eighteen feet. Here he
                    built a mill of stone almost wholly with his own hands. On many of the blocks he
                    carved quaint figures and emblems. A trailing vine in full leaf and laden with
                    fruit was cut upon the lintels, and figures of deer, fishes, a horse, a cow, a
                    lion, a human face, and stars, and many texts from the Bible, were sketched upon
                    the stone in different parts of the building. Over the doorway was this
                    inscription, "The traveler's rest. Consecrated by Squire 
                        Boone
                    , 1809." Over another door is the following: "I
                    sit and sing my soul's salvation, and pledge the God of my
                    creation."
            The settlement of 
                        Harrison
                     county proceeded rapidly. Among the first to enter land in the
                    county was Governor 
                        Harrison
                     himself, who in 1804 bought from the government the land where
                    Corydon stands and held it for a short time. Three years later he took up other
                    land in the same region and built a water mill and set out a large orchard, some
                    of whose trees were still standing a century later.
            There were 640 acres of this 
                        Harrison
                     farm, and the place was so much esteemed that in 1818 when the
                    Governor had  to sell it and go back to 
                        Ohio
                     it brought him $10,000. Every part of 
                        Harrison
                    's Valley recalls its first owner, one plot being known as
                    the Governor's Field, another the General's Meadow. The valley
                    is almost an amphitheater, walled by limestone hills. In the middle is the 
                        Harrison
                     spring, in a basin rimmed with a natural stone wall two feet high,
                    filled with pure, clear water hundreds of feet deep and flowing in a strong
                    stream that widens in time of flood to a torrent at the spring and flows out in
                    a stream one hundred feet wide and ten feet deep. From the spring to Blue river,
                    a few hundred yards distant, there is a fall of eight feet, and the power is
                    used to run a mill. And so the Governor erected a mill here and employed himself
                    between campaigns as a farmer and miller. General 
                        Harrison
                     is said to have received the grain with his own hands and carried
                    it to the hopper. Only a few shrubs and a part of the orchard he planted so
                    carefully survive to mark the 
                        Harrison
                     home.
            William Henry Harrison was twenty-seven years old when he began his
                    administration at 
                        Vincennes
                    . His duties and his personal interest brought him often to 
                        Harrison
                     county. On one of these journeys as he passed through the new
                    settlement that was to be the seat of government he was asked to give a name to
                    the village. It was at Edward Smith's cabin, where the county fair
                    grounds now are. The young governor, whose taste for music and verse was of the
                    somber-sentimental sort which Abraham 
                        Lincoln
                     so greatly admired, had asked, as usual, that Jennie Smith, his
                    host's pretty daughter, might sing his favorite song, "The
                    Pastoral Elegy."
            Modern experts have tried in vain to wring music out of the song. The singer must
                    have been singularly attractive or the young governor would not have stood for
                    it. It seems that one Corydon had recently deceased and his fiancee, Caroline,
                    with the gracious co-operation of a nightingale, was inflicting her grief on a
                    melancholy world: 
                        "O, Corydon! hear the sad cries Of Caroline plaintive and slow;
                            O Spirit look down from the skies And pity the mourner
                        below."
                    
            
            
            Caroline was plaintive, all right, and she may have been slow, but
                    Corydon's name is linked forever with that of our first State capital.
                    And the attractive name the village received may be credited to Governor Henry
                    Harrison's bad taste in music.
            The chief function of the village newspaper a hundred years ago was to print the
                    news from abroad, necessarily from a month to three months after the fact, and
                    to keep the readers of Indiana informed as to the doings at 
                        Washington
                    . In a village of 300 inhabitants, more than two-thirds of whom were
                    under 26 years old, local news such as we search the daily press for would have
                    been absurd. Everybody of course knew everybody else's doings. So one
                    finds few such items in the Corydon files of that early day. And yet the columns
                    of the Corydon Indiana Gazette reveal the social life of the
                    village in a way its editor and its readers a century ago did not dream of. Even
                    the advertisements give us glimpses of the way society lived.

            Here was an innocent fur trader, perhaps, the sort we read about in histories and
                    dime novels. And yet there were strange doings at Mr.

                    especially during the legislative sessions, for we find this savage
                    communication in the issue for New Year's Day 1823:

                            otherwise he will be complained of at the next Circuit Court for the
                            County of

            There is a modern touch about this:

                        Oct. 9, 1819.

            Here is an advertisement inserted in the leading newspaper west of 
                        Ohio
                    , between whose lines may be read a story of separation and possible
                    unhappiness growing out of the impending failure of the Rappite experiment at
                    Harmonie: 
                        INFORMATION WANTED
                  
                        Stephen Bach, who lately came from 
                                Germany
                            , wishes to know where his brother-in-law, John Jonas, now
                            resides. They (Bnch and Jonas) came to America about the same time,
                            since which Bach has received one letter from said Jonas, directed to
                            Harmonie, Indiana. Any person who may be able to give any information
                            respecting Mr. Jonas at this time will confer a particular favor by
                            communicating it to the Rev. George Pfrimmer. near Corydon, Indiana.

                            twice and the favor will be reciprocated when occasion requires.
                    
            
            And this is an advertisement to show that domestic science and vocational
                    training were a part of our educational system almost a hundred years before our
                    progressive educators of the twentieth century discovered "the new
                    education."
            
                    EDUCATION
               
                    HARRIKT TARLTON, Milliner, (from 
                            Baltimore
                        ) Intends opening a schooi in Corydon on the 1st day of April
                        next for the
                    EDUCATION OF YOUNG LADIES
               
                    and pledges a careful attendance to the instruction and moral conduct of such
                        as may be committed to her charge.
                    PRICE:
                    For Heading, Writing and plain sewing, $2 per quarter; Embroidery,
                        $4 per quarter; Boarding, $1.20 per week, exclusive of
                        washing; Country produce will be taken in payment for boarding at the market
                        prices.
                
            And here is another: 
                        LADIES SCHOOL
                  
                        Mrs. MITCHELL and Mrs. BAKER will
                            teach young ladies committed to their care the following branches of
                            education, viz: Reading, Writing. Arithmetic, Grnmmer, Logic, Rhetoric.
                            Geography, Composition. Also Plain sewing, sampler and cotton work.
                    
            
            The social instinct in Corydon while not exhausted in entertaining the
                    legislative multitudes every winter found its outlet in the main in simple
                    things. Thus the Gazette announces:
            
            
                    Singing is appointed in the Senate Room on next Friday the 11th of June
                        (1819) at 6 o'clock p. m. and singers are invited and requested to
                        attend.
                
            The following November the spirit of music was revived by this notice: 
                        (Nov. 27, 1819.) The young ladies and gentlemen of Oorydon are requested
                            to meet in the Senate Chamber on Thursday evening next at early candle
                            light for the purpose of singing and forming a singing school.
                    
            
            Next to the singing school as a means of uplift was the debating society, whose
                    transactions are reported all too seldom in the public press. Two of these
                    accounts were all I was able to discover. These meetings were in June, 1820, and
                    were published as paid advertisements: 
                        CORYDON DEBATING SOCIETY (June 15, 1820)
                        The following question will be discussed by this society on tomorrow
                            evening commencing at half past 6 in the Representatives' Hall:
                        
                            Which is most admired, Virtue or Beauty?
                        
                        The ladies and gentlemen of the place are respectfully invited to attend.
                        MR. McCULLOUGH, Sec'y.
                  
                        CORYDON DEBATING SOCIETY (June 22, 1820)
                        The following question will be discussed by this society on tomorrow
                            evening commencing at half past 6 in the Representatives' Hall:
                        
                            In which does Virtue shine most brilliant, the Male or
                                Female ?
                        
                        
                     R. MCCULLOUGH, Sec'y.
                  
                    
            
            How the "Females" came out is impossible to tell, for they
                    could not afford to pay to advertise the result and the press was mercenary. But
                    the sex was enormously self-conscious in those days. They did not try to force
                    their propaganda upon any historical pageants as they are doing nowadays, but
                    they were bent on treating women as a distinct order of creation. Witness this
                    advertisement of the proposed 
                        Connersville
                     publication: 
                        (9-10-23) Prospectus of a New Periodical Work to be published at 
                                Connersville
                            , Indiana, entitled Western Ladies'
                                Casket, and Edited by a Female. "Improve, excel,
                            surmount, subdue your fate."
                        The entire tendency of this publication will be to desseminate useful
                            knowledge and to excite a taste for mental improvement, particularly
                            among  the female part of the
                            community. ... As this perhaps, is the first publication attempted to be
                            published by n female in the western country a hope Is entertained that
                            it will not be deficient in merit or short in duration for want of a
                            liberal support. $1.00 a year.
                    
            
            A later issue contained a poem on "Female Literature."
            Brains were not the only feminine equipment that came in for improvement, for a
                    dispatch from Liverpool is published in the issue of August 21, 1819, announcing
                    the invention of a velocipede for females.
            Those of us who have provided funds for foreign missions are but paying back for
                    the gifts our seaboard patrons made to convert the heathen in Indiana a hundred
                    years ago. Religious services in old Corydon were in the main a community
                    affair, unimpaired in their efficiency by any sectarian influences. The Corydon
                    paper during the ten years when the seat of government was located there
                    mentions no local sectarian services.
            In January, 1819, this announcement appears as the leader on the editorial page:
                        
                        The Reverend Mr. Rogers, missionary to the State of Indiana, will preach
                            tonight at candle-light and tomorrow at 12 m. at the courthouse.
                    
            
            And this (March 10, 1824): 
                        Adam Payne, a traveling preacher from 
                                Kentucky
                            , will preach in the courthouse tonight at candle light.
                    
            
            The news columns contained the story of religious revivals in 
                        New York
                     and New 
                        England
                     and in time Corydon came in for its share of the spiritual
                    interest. I quote: 
                        It will be peculiarly grateful to the lovers of Christianity to hear of
                            the revival of religion which has taken place in this town. A few weeks
                            ago our streets exhibited little else than intemperance and profanity;
                            but now so far has the scene changed that morality seems to predominate
                            in every quarter through the day and at night the sound of prayer,
                            praise and the shouts of new-born souls cheer the evening shades.

                     P. Coburn was clerk of the supreme court. His name is a familiar
                    one in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . He was the superintendent of the community Sunday school which
                    kept up the atmosphere of righteousness in the Senate Chamber when the General
                    Assembly was not in session.
            
            
                    SUNDAY SCHOOL (June 21,
                        1821)
                    The advantages of this institution are clearly manifest by the progress the
                        scholars make in learning. Two boys of Mr. James Kirkpatrick distinguished
                        themselves on last Sunday by the number of verses they rehearsed by memory,
                        which they committed the week previous. James, who is eight years old,
                        rehearsed 118 verses; and Moses, who is seven years old, rehearsed 101
                        verses.

            J. 
                        Jennings
                     was governor of Indiana and Benjamin 
                        Adams
                     was a local statesman whose descendants are among the best people
                    of Corydon to this day.
            Intemperance was not as disreputable then as it has come to be. At election
                    time—and they held general elections every summer while the
                    legislature elected State officers every winter—there was some
                    drinking as we note from this editorial of August 16, 1821: 
                        We congratulate the citizens of 
                                Harrison
                             county that the late election has been conducted more
                            decently than the election of last year. Nevertheless there is much room
                            yet to mend. We were mortified to hear some severe censure on the
                            immoderate use of whiskey coming from the mouths of some respectable
                            strangers who were visitants to our town and attentive observers of the
                            passing scenes of the day. Surely candidates for office would not wish
                            to have it understood that their popularity rests upon the strength of
                            whiskey, nor would the voters succumb to the pitiful idea that they
                            would barter their liberty for a dram. Then there can
                            be no good reason that the day of election should exhibit scenes of
                            intoxication grating to the feelings of every good man. The laws of the
                            state as well as those of morality are against the practice and if
                            nothing else will effect a reformation the civil authority ought to take
                            cognizance thereof.
                    
            
            The Fourth of July was observed as a community affair; sometimes fittingly and
                    sometimes not, but always by the entire populace. J. Tarlton, who kept one of
                    the taverns and was an unsuccessful candidate for office, advertised (June 29,
                    1821):
            
            
                    I will prepare a Dinner and furnish plenty of Domestic Liquors at my house in
                        Corydon on the 4th of July, where gentlemen are invited to attend. Price

            A representative Independence Day program is preserved in full: 
                        Fourth of July. At daylight in the morning the day was announced by a
                            discharge of the 6 pounder. Governor 
                                Hendricks
                             was selected President and John 
                                Tipton
                             Vice-President of the day. At 11 o'clock notice of
                            the meeting was announced by a second gun at the Court House, when the
                            Declaration of Independence was read by H. H. Moore, which was followed
                            by an address appropriate to the occasion by Benjamin Hurst in presence
                            of a large concourse of citizens. From thence the procession, formed
                            agreeably to the previous arrangements, proceeded to Littell's 
                                Spring
                            , where the company partook of a dinner prepared by Thomas
                            High-fill under a bower erected for the purpose. After the cloth was
                            removed a number of patriotic toasts were drank, accompanied with
                            platoons of musketry and loud huzzaa From the spring the company
                            returned in the same order of procession to town, where they were
                            dismissed in good order and harmony about 5 o'clock p. m.
                        TOASTS

                            oppressed—may their fraternal affection be entwined by the

                            of the Loom, and the gingling Cash are far more musical than the

                            grace and ornament virtue the sons of America will not be the votaries

            They were eloquent in those days as the following brief paragraph from an oration
                    by John N. Dunbar delivered in the old capitol will prove:
            
            
                    The sad and helpless orphan left unfriended and alone in the wild and
                        merciless ocean of life, without one friend to guide, one smile to cheer
                        him, struggling against the threatening wave that rises to engulph him,
                        looks with an aching eye and desolate heart upon the benighted course his
                        hard untoward destiny points out. There is no glimmering of joy for him.
                        Futurity holds out to him no loved, no cherished expectation; and
                        retrospection but serves to show him the withered fragments of the bliss his
                        youthful nature painted. He has no wish but death.
                
            The biggest day in all the village history was the one that brought to little
                    Corydon James 
                        Monroe
                    , President of the 
                        United States
                    , and Major General Andrew 
                        Jackson
                    , America's popular idol. They were met by the citizens,
                    escorted into town, where they were welcomed by the most cordial feelings. At
                    four o'clock the President, General 
                        Jackson
                     and suit, dined with the governor. The invitation to a public
                    dinner to be given by the citizens was declined.
            Enjoyable as the Fourth of July and presidential parties must have been, another
                    function took place at Corydon that would have interested me more. Here is the
                    announcement: 
                        Natural Curiosities will be exhibited at Corydon on the 3rd and 4th of
                            December; the
                        AFRICAN LION, PULL GROWN,
                        THE AFRICAN LEOPARD,

            Sensational events sometimes occurred. I read from the issue of March 27, 1819:
                        
                        LAMENTABLE ACCIDENT
                  
                        On Saturday last in the vicinity of this place a woman of colour was
                            killed by a yearling calf. The animal became impatient for its
                            accustomed food and thrust his horn into her body. She expired in ten
                            minutes. Let this be a caution to the unwary. She has left a husband and
                            numerous family of children, to whose evident distress and unfeigned
                            sorrow should cause to blush the proud intcUificnce
                            who boasts of his exclusive possession of those
                            refined feelings which distinguish and add dignity to
                            man.
                    
            
            
            A strong sense of duty to a bound boy is proved by the following display
                    advertisement. I should say its publisher must have been a 
                        Puritan
                     if it were not for his sense of humor:

                        Ran away from the subscriber September 1819, John Napper, who was bound
                            to me to learn the tanning business. He is about 16 years of age,
                            5′ 8 or 9″ high, black hair, blue eyes. The above
                            reward will be given if delivered to me in 
                                Spencer
                             county, Indiana, but no thanks.

            There was actual slavery in Corydon despite the intense anti-slavery feeling of
                    Governor 
                        Jennings
                     and Dennis Pennington and the other social and political leaders of
                    the community. Thus in 1812 the county records show that Amy, a woman of color,
                    of full age, indentured herself to the services of Isaiah 
                        Boone
                     and his family and heirs for seventy-five years in return for his
                    agreement to furnish her with clothing and "suitable diet."
                    Isaac 
                        Blackford
                     and his associates on the supreme court early declared slavery in
                    Indiana to be unconstitutional. (See volume 1 of 
                        Blackford
                    's Reports.) But long after negro
                    apprenticeships ceased to be, there were negro-hunts in 
                        Harrison
                     county, and the greed of slave owners was stimulating and
                    strengthening the abolition spirit north of the 
                        Ohio
                    .
            We can imagine the subtle effect of this little paragraph published January 23,
                    1819: 
                        We are informed that Susan, a woman of color, who was kidnapped some
                            months ago, has returned into the neighborhood of this place. She made
                            her escape from the boat descending the 
                                Ohio
                             somewhere about the mouth of the 
                                Tennessee
                             river. It is expected she will have her trial forher
                            freedom at the next term of the court if she is not again kidnapped
                            before that time.
                    
            
            I have told nothing of Corydon's political history—of her
                    constitutional convention that met beneath her splendid elm a hundred years ago
                    next month, or of her part in the Civil War, when John 
                        Morgan
                    's raiders fought a bloody skirmish in her streets, for
                    that would be history, and this paper is meant only as a brief social study.
                    Despite the temptation to gossip and expand, I have had to omit most of the
                    fascinating detail of 
                    
                  EXPENSE ACCOUNT FOR MOVING THE CAPITAL. BY
                                SAMUEL MEBBILL
                  
               
                     her social life, retaining only enough to
                    help us project our imagination into the capital of Indiana as it was a hundred
                    years ago and realize for ourselves how men lived then.
            It was but a village. Its biggest men would be counted young to cope with such
                    responsibilities in our modern day. They were young, but they possessed
                    scholarship and character. Harrison, Jennings, Blackford, New, Merrill, and
                    Benjamin 
                        Parke
                     were classical students—several of them teachers by
                    profession and by choice, readers and gatherers of the best books. And
                    Pennington and 
                        Spencer
                     and 
                        Tipton
                     were men of valor and character. These pioneer patriots gave of
                    their own character to the State whose foundation they laid. They were young for
                    such genuine achievement. In 1816 
                        Jennings
                     was 32, 
                        Hendricks
                     33, 
                        Tipton
                     30, 
                        Blackford
                     30, Ratliff Boon 35, Samuel Merrill 24.
            It will be recalled of the largest and wickedest city of all time that ten
                    righteous men were deemed enough for its salvation. The character of a community
                    for righteousness and for lesser things, scholarship and self-respect and
                    ability to achieve is determined by a few men whose leadership it recognizes.
                    Corydon was righteous, for its men were of the saving sort. And so of Indiana.
                    To the purity and strength of its pioneers as well as that of the pioneers of
                    its later capital, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , is due the fact that Indiana has been able to prove that
                    righteousness exalteth a people.
         
         
         
            Reminiscences of the Civil War; Escape From Fort Tyler Prison∗
            
            BY HORACE B. LITTLE, Danville, Ind.
            If I remember correctly, it was on the second day of April, 1864. We (43rd Ind.)
                    with the 77th 
                        Ohio
                     and 36th 
                        Iowa
                     were detailed to escort a wagon train back to 
                        Little Rock
                     after supplies. This train consisted of 350 to 400 wagons, which
                    reached out over two miles. Each wagon was pulled by from four to six mules. Our
                    regiment was greatly scattered out in acting as a guard for the train. The first
                    thing we knew the rebels were upon us. General Bank's army had been
                    defeated by them and then their main force came back on us. We were not a very
                    large army and it was scattered out over two miles. But we held them from early
                    morning until about noon, when we were surrounded by very superior forces and a
                    great many of us were made prisoners. A large part of our regiment were wounded
                    or killed.
            Our captors marched us from Camden, near Mark's Hill, to Camp Ft. Tyler, 
                        Texas
                    —Smith county.
            We were young, and had no maps. We did not know just where we were. You heard me
                    say Smith county, 
                        Texas
                    , but that does not give you any idea of what portion of the state
                    it is in. That was the condition we were in.
            The prison was a stockade with high walls, built of long timbers, with stations
                    where guards with guns could look over and keep an eye on us. We found some five
                    or six thousand prisoners already confined there when we arrived. There was no
                    shelter and only two trees within the enclosure. 
                  
                     ∗ Mr. Little enlisted from 
                                Rockville
                             in Co. K, of the 43 Ind. Vol. for the three-year service.
                            His regiment was part of the command of General Steele, who was seeking
                            to make a junction with Gen. Banks, who had set out on an expedition
                            from 
                                New Orleans
                            . Shreveport was the objective of both wings. Mr. Little was
                            with the so-called 
                                Arkansas
                             wing, which was mpving south from 
                                Little Rock
                             to join with Banks. The army had reached Camden, when the
                            events began that are the basis of Mr. Little's story. This
                            story appeared substantially as here given in the Danville Gazette, Dec. 7, 1916.
               
                     We were permitted to roam around in the
                    enclosure during the day, but at night each man had a certain
                    spot—just enough to lie on—where he was expected to stay
                    and sleep at night. During the day, after roll call, we mingled with the other
                    prisoners and got acquainted and talked over the situation. There were boys
                    there from all over the 
                        United States
                    . For food we had corn meal, issued to us dry. Once or twice a week
                    we were given a little meat. When we got tired of eating our corn meal dry we
                    would mix it with a little water, place the cake on a board and prop it up
                    before a fire to bake. There were but few camp kettles and we had to take turns
                    in using them. These were the only things we had to eat while we were there. We
                    had nothing to do except look for a way to escape, if inclined that way. There
                    seemed no way to get out; yet some did, and I never gave up hope of getting
                    away. The ground was so level that digging under the stockade did not offer a
                    good chance, as the distance necessary to dig would have been too great. Besides
                    the soldiers were camped all about the stockade. The stockade had two
                    gates—one on the south and one on the west. These were used by the
                    guards and by the prisoners who went after fire-wood under guard. They went in
                    bodies of from 50 to 100 after fire-wood, and once in a while some of the boys
                    succeeded in concealing themselves and making their escape that way.
            A few days after I arrived at the stockade I began to plan some way of escape. I
                    devised a number of plans, but could never form one which-would seem to lead to
                    success. When run down to the extreme, in my mind, nearly every one would fail.
                    One had to consider the guards watching us and the pickets and the camp
                    surrounding us.
            Frequently wagons would be brought within the stockade to haul out the trash. One
                    of my thoughts was to get a man to cover me over with trash and haul me out that
                    way. If I could bribe him to keep still long enough I felt I might get safely
                    away. But others were also watching that means of escape and I never had the
                    opportunity. Some actually got out of the stockade that way, but every one of
                    them but one was captured and returned during the three months I was confined
                    there. Finally I asked some of the recaptured  men how it was that they did not succeed after getting outside the stockade.
                    They all said it was on account of having to go to farm houses to get something
                    to eat. They became victims of their appetites. There were no surplus provisions
                    within the stockade and a man could not provide himself with food. When hunger
                    drove him to a farm house he was reported and the bloodhounds were put on his
                    trail.
            I resolved that if ever I succeeded in getting outside I would not be caught that
                    way. It was three or four hundred miles to our lines, but I believed I could
                    manage without going to a house for food. The lesson learned by questioning the
                    returned prisoners saved me when I did escape.
            On the west side of the stockade was a clapboard shed which was used for a
                    hospital. It was not much of a hospital as they were known in the north, but it
                    served that purpose. Prisoners who became so ill that there was no danger of
                    them trying to escape were removed from the stockade to this hospital. Union
                    soldiers, also prisoners, were detailed to nurse them. They were made trusties
                    and were allowed to come and go in the stockade to examine the sick. These were
                    reported to the surgeon in charge and by his permission and that of the post
                    commander they were placed on a stretcher and removed to the hospital.
            A friend of mine by the name of Jake Thomas, who enlisted from 
                        Parke
                     county, was one of the nurses. He had a pass and could come into
                    the enclosure to look after the sick. He had two assistants who always came in
                    with him. These two men carried the stretchers. Mr. Thomas frequently came
                    around and talked to me. One day I asked him how he got in and out. He told me
                    he had a pass. I had thought it likely that he did have one. I asked him if he
                    would let me see it and he finally consented. After I had read it I asked if he
                    would let me use it for a little while. He thought it was too risky, but I urged
                    so strongly, and promised to return it safely, that he finally gave in. I had
                    previously learned that a man from a 
                        New York
                     regiment had pen and ink and I intended to have him make me an
                    exact copy of the pass. He was a  good scribe
                    and he succeeded in making an almost exact copy. I then returned the pass to Mr.
                    Thomas and jokingly told him I was coming out to take dinner with him soon. He
                    warned me never to attempt it.
            Now the question was how to use my pass. The deadline prevented me from going
                    closer than ten feet to the gate. The guard had orders to shoot every one who
                    came within ten feet of the stockade walls. The guards had plank walks up near
                    the top of the stockade where they could walk around and watch us inside. It was
                    impossible for me to use the pass without crossing this dead-line. Mr. Thomas
                    repeatedly warned me never to attempt that, but I told him that winter was
                    coming on and that I would about as soon run the risk of getting shot in that
                    way as to remain in the stockade without food or shelter.
            Then I set about developing my plans. Mr. Thomas had two assistants, and it was
                    up to me to get two men to go with me on the venture. I went to a comrade and
                    told him what I had in mind, and showed him my forged pass. He would not join me
                    and warned me against attempting it. Then I went to the meanest oneriest man in
                    our company—James Steele. He immediately said he would tackle it. I
                    knew he would because he was no coward. He was not a genial companion, however,
                    and if there was anything around to drink there was no putting up with him. But
                    I knew he could not get anything to drink around there. I next went to a young
                    fellow by the name of Neavins, who lived southeast of Rock-ville. (I have since
                    learned that he was a relative of Harvey Neavins of Danville.) He was also a
                    member of my company. He was not educated—could not read nor
                    write—nor swim. He also consented to go, as I had anticipated,
                    because he was daring.
            Up to that time I had no definite plan in view, and had fixed no date for the
                    attempt. There was one thing I did want, though, in carrying out my plans. There
                    was one guard whom I wanted at the gate when I presented my pass. I
                    don't know why I wanted him to be there, because I had never said a
                    word to him and could only see him from a long distance off.
            Mr. Thomas came in one Saturday afternoon and we talked about other things. Just
                    before he went away I told  him I was coming
                    out to take dinner with him the next day—told him this in a joking
                    way. He again warned me not to attempt it, but my mind was made up.
            The next day came and I told some of the comrades what was in the wind and what I
                    wanted them to do to hide the escape until I could be out long enough to escape
                    the bloodhounds. We had to answer roll call every morning. If I did not respond
                    to my name the bloodhounds would soon be on my trail. It was customary every
                    morning to line the prisoners up in companies and call the roll. It happened
                    there were many sick and if one failed to respond to his name it furnished an
                    excuse. I arranged that I was the one to be missing at roll call the next
                    morning and was to be reported sick. The second day some one was to respond to
                    my name and one of the other boys would be missing. It was so arranged that
                    neither of the three was to be reported missing two days handrunning. This
                    deception was kept up for eight days, and we by that time had got beyond danger
                    from the bloodhounds—but that is getting ahead of the story. In
                    explanation, however, once every month all the prisoners were lined up for
                    general muster and roll call. Every man had to be in place, or if sick,
                    accounted for. This came on the eighth day after we made our departure. The
                    guards asked the boys where the missing men were. They said:
            "When we got up this morning they were gone."
            They got out the bloodhounds and tried to trail us, but the hounds came back.
            About one or two o'clock—we had no
                    time-piece—Sunday afternoon I decided to start for the gate. Some of
                    the boys knew we were going. They watched us, but kept back in the crowd so they
                    would not be noticed. The guards were always watching for anything of that kind
                    which might indicate movements to escape.
            We started in single file for the gate, I holding the pass in my hand. The guard
                    I wanted to be on the job was there. Without question he took the pass and read
                    it.
            The pass, which was on a piece of paper about the size of my four fingers, read:
                    "Please permit Mr. Thomas and two assistants in and out as
                    nurses." The writing covered  about
                    all of the paper and the surgeon barely had room to sign at the bottom and the
                    post commander had countersigned it on the back.
            When the guard had read the pass he said: "You will have to have that
                    countersigned by the post commander before you can get in and out of
                    here."
            Then I knew he had never seen Mr. Thomas' pass. My heart was right up in
                    my throat and I could hear it pound. How to speak was more than I could tell. I
                    did not want him to suspicion anything was wrong and was afraid my voice would
                    betray me, but I had to answer. I blurted out: "It is countersigned on
                    the back, if you will just turn it over and read."
            That threw him off his guard and he folded it up, returned it and allowed us to
                    pass out.
            We found ourselves in a worse shape than ever. Soldiers were all around us; those
                    who were on guard and those who were not. In addition there were many citizens.
                    Why they did not catch on has always been a mystery to me. We were ragged and
                    dirty and were not carrying a stretcher. But the guard let us out and we
                    resolved to put on a bold front.
            We had to pass right by the post commanders' headquarters. He was
                    sitting by a log cabin surrounded by soldiers. It was the only way we could get
                    out. We had to be bold to avoid suspicion. We made a polite bow to the
                    commander, which he answered, and we went on. We always supposed that everyone
                    took it for granted we would not have been there unless permission had been
                    granted.
            We went up to the hospital where Mr. Thomas was and he was very much surprised to
                    see us. He did not know what to do with us at first, as he was not willing to
                    expose himself to the danger that would come to him and us if detected. In the
                    meantime I had put the pass in my mouth and chewed it up. I did not want to have
                    it about me if recaptured.
            As soon as he had recovered from his surprise, Mr. Thomas called attention to
                    some old haversacks hanging near the shed hospital, and to disarm suspicion he
                    told us to get those haversacks and go with him to gather some  grapes. It was then the 14th day of August and
                    grapes were just beginning to get ripe.
            He led us down into the woods until we came to a hollow. Stopping by a brushpile
                    he told us to stay there until dark and he would return with food if he could.
                    He would not promise for sure. He said he would give a certain whistle. We
                    crawled under the brushpile and after dark we heard his whistle. We crawled out
                    and he gave us some cornbread. We relished it very much.
            He then bade us farewell. It was dangerous for him to go with us for he would
                    have been shot if recaptured. He was very much afraid for us. He never thought
                    we could get through the pickets, which were all about the woods. After bidding
                    him farewell we started north, crawling on our hands and knees. We had some
                    trouble deciding which way to go when we got out. Mr. Steele wanted to go south,
                    but for some reason I wanted to go northeast. I did not know why, but something
                    seemed to tell me that safety lay halfway between east and the north star. We
                    decided to leave it to Mr. Thomas and he said to go towards the north star.
            I do not know how many miles we crawled on our hands and knees. It was very
                    tiresome. Finally we decided we were beyond the picket lines and had not been
                    discovered. Then we arose to our feet and made fast tracks to get as far away
                    from the stockade as possible and find a hiding place before daylight. We went
                    through brush and wood. When it began to get daylight we began to hunt a hiding
                    place. Fortunately we happened to find a tree overgrown with green vines which
                    hung down and spread out over the ground. The vine had thorns on it. The tree
                    resembled our umbrella tree, only it was larger. The vine was very thick. We
                    parted these vines and crawled in around the trunk of the tree to rest after our
                    first night's march towards home. We could see out but no one could see
                    inside and we felt pretty safe if the dogs did not come. The bloodhounds were
                    thick down there, everybody having some, but we resolved to keep out of their
                    way if possible. We lay there during the day with nothing to eat.
            While we were marching the first night out we came to  a road which was going our direction. It was a
                    great temptation to take it, as we could make double the speed on it that we
                    could across the country. We finally concluded we would follow the road so long
                    as it went our direction. We had not gone far until we heard some one in front
                    of us. We could not tell whether or not we had been discovered, but knew it was
                    useless to run from the road because the motion would be heard and then the dogs
                    would come. We held a hurried consultation and decided to drop down at the side
                    of the road and take our chances. The approaching men were a party of soldiers
                    returning to camp. They walked past us without discovering our presence. We then
                    got up and went on but resolved to avoid roads after that. The next night we
                    stayed entirely in the woods.
            Before we had left the stockade we had vowed to each other that we would starve
                    before we went to a house to get anything to eat. This forced us to live on
                    corn. Corn was then just a little past the roasting ear stage. We could break
                    off the grains and eat as we walked along. That was fifty years ago, however,
                    and corn fields were not as plentiful as they are now, and there were days at a
                    time when we could find no corn. The next thing we did was to dig up the moist
                    roots of certain trees and get the juicy bark. That was our food for days.
            Later in our travels we saw a squirrel run up a tree while we were hiding out one
                    day. The squirrel ran into a hole but left his tail hanging out. One of the boys
                    was a good climber and after trying to club the squirrel out he clambered up and
                    killed it. The next thing was to decide what to do with it. We had no fire and
                    no way to cook. I happened to have an old knife—I have it yet at home
                    in a trunk—which was spared to me in this manner: When first captured
                    we had good oil-cloth haversacks, while the rebels had only cheap cloth ones.
                    They forced us to trade with them. The man who made me change with him had an
                    old piece of dirty fat meat in his haversack. It was so dirty no one would touch
                    it to take it out. I had taken this piece of meat and made a hole in it, in
                    which I had placed my knife, a little money and some trinkets. I then put dirt
                    over the hole and put the meat back in my haversack. Whenever I was  searched the chunk of fat meat was left alone
                    because it was so dirty, but it was the same as a bank to me.
            I whittled some sticks with this knife and we took turns about rubbing them
                    together to make a fire. We worked for a considerable time but never succeeded
                    in getting a blaze. The sticks would smoke but not blaze. We had to give this
                    up. We thought maybe we could run across a bed of coals where some one had
                    camped and we carried the squirrel along with us. We did not find a place where
                    we could cook it, so we decided to eat it raw. It was very good and we wished we
                    had another one.
            We found a few grapes, but after we got into 
                        Arkansas
                     they were not ripe enough to eat and we had to live on corn and
                    roots.
            To add to our troubles our clothes began to come to pieces. We tore them more
                    every night. Now we had to fix that, so we peeled bark from trees and darned the
                    torn places. At the end of 21 days of our journey our clothes were mostly bark.
            We had a great many streams to cross, including 
                        Wichita
                     and Red River. When we came to Red River it was up very high and in
                    places was out of its banks. Mr. Neavins could not swim and we had to make a
                    raft. The water was so high we were afraid to attempt crossing at night. In
                    making our raft we used cypress rails. That wood is very light and the rails
                    were made very large. We struck the bank of the river near an old cotton
                    ware-house and we cut the rope off cotton bales to use in lashing the rails
                    together. We tied each rail separately and then fastened another layer
                    cross-wise. We first tried the raft with three rail depth, but it would not hold
                    up our weight. We added a fourth layer. We got three boards and used two for
                    oars and the third for a rudder. The water was very high and we were carried
                    quite a distance down stream, and when we got to the opposite side we could not
                    find a place to land, having struck a canebrake and slough filled with
                    underbrush. We spent the night on the water and as it began to grow light we
                    heard a chicken crowing. We decided that if there was a place for a chicken
                    around there, there was also a place for a man.
            Drawing the raft up into the mouth of a small stream  we abandoned it and set out across the marshy
                    country. Hiding by day and traveling by night the journey was continued. While
                    trying to get across some backwater we saw some men wading toward us. Hastily
                    drawing to one side we stooped in the water until it all but covered our heads.
                    The men passed without discovering us. They brought us good news. If they could
                    come in that way we could get out that way. It was a cypress knee swamp and the
                    traveling was hard. Frequently we came to deep places and we would have to put
                    Mr. Neavins on a log and push him across. We came to many lagoons which forced
                    us to go out of our way to get around them. Some of them looked like small
                    lakes.
            When we got out of this backwater we found ourselves in a big corn field. We sat
                    down and had a feast. I remember I ate three ears of corn without stopping.
                    Before this we had eaten a few grains at a time as we walked along.
            About this time Mr. Neavins began to fare badly. To begin with, he had no shoes,
                    having thrown his away before he had been put in the stockade. When I first
                    proposed to attempt to escape he hesitated because he had no shoes. I had an
                    extra pair of shoes, having purchased an extra pair in anticipation of winter,
                    with a little money and some buttons. The Confederates wanted buttons more than
                    anything else. I offered Neavins this pair of shoes. He wore No. 6 shoes and I
                    wore No. 7. The shoes had lain out in the rain and sun and had become very hard.
                    He took the shoes but after we had marched several days they began to rub his
                    feet and made them sore. He decided he would go barefooted. It was the worst
                    thing he could have done, as his feet became poisoned and began to swell up. He
                    said he did not believe he could continue with us.
            We had made an agreement before we left the stockade that if any one found
                    himself unable to travel the others were to go on, and the abandoned one was not
                    to go near a farm house until the remainder of the party had been gone long
                    enough that the hounds could not pick up the trail.
            "You go on," he said. "I will try to travel by day and
                    get my feet well." It was very sad to leave him sitting there with his
                    feet sore, and sick; and he had nothing to eat, but we pushed on. I have never
                    heard of him again from that  day to this.
                    His grandparents over in 
                        Parke
                     county were dependent upon him. They afterwards made application
                    for a pension on his supposed death, and the government has sent examiners to me
                    and Mr. Steele to tell them the story of how it happened. This is the only story
                    to substantiate his death. The government in after years granted the old people
                    a pension—$8.00 per month, I think.
            But we pressed on. Many times in crossing a stream we found we had landed in a
                    canebrake which had been there for years and years. The cane was thick and very
                    hard and brittle. It broke easily and made a splinter which was dangerous to
                    travel over. The cane fell over and new cane would grow up through it. One could
                    not walk on the fallen cane. The only way to go through a cane brake was to get
                    down and crawl under it. We tried that several times, but invariably we came out
                    to the stream near where we had started in. We could not see the north star for
                    guidance and crawled in a circle. It was impossible to keep a straight road. We
                    were always lost. We had to go a long ways out of our path on account of these
                    obstacles.
            One day as we were walking along through some wood, something looked strangely
                    familiar to me and I said to Mr. Steele: "I've seen this
                    before." I could not give a description of any one thing, but knew
                    there was something familiar about it. Steele did not believe me, and we went
                    on.
            Soon we struck a river, but we could both swim. This was on the 5th of September,
                    as we afterwards learned, and the 20th day of our march. As we swam across the
                    river darkness had just fallen. On the opposite bank we encountered a high fence
                    and soon discovered that we were in a stable lot. We were tired, wet and hungry,
                    and decided if we could find anything in that lot to ride we would spend the
                    night riding and would turn our mounts loose the next day to return home.
            We went into the stable, but could not find a bridle or even a strap. We then
                    decided we would make a bridle out of bark, but in the darkness we could not
                    find the bark, so we gave up the project.
            We supposed there was a house near and we were watching out for it. In glancing
                    to one side we discovered what  appeared to
                    be an open door through which came a flickering light. We could hardly see the
                    outline of a house, but only a flicker of light. We were wet, and hungry, and
                    the temptation to investigate was strong. We crept closer. Listening closely, we
                    heard voices. A rail fence ran close to the door through which the voices came
                    and we decided to creep up to it. From the voices we determined the occupants
                    were old people and only two in number.
            We decided to cry "hello," and keeping in the dark, see what
                    would happen. The old man answered. He asked us in and the temptation to accept
                    was strong. The old man was lying on the floor with his feet poked through the
                    doorway. The old woman was sitting before a fireplace knitting by the light of a
                    pine knot. That was all the light they had.
            As the couple were very old we decided to take a chance and walked up to the
                    door. Looking across the room I saw an old-fashioned gun and a powder-horn above
                    another door I walked across the room and took the gun. I explained that I was
                    doing it for our protection and that he was in no danger so long as he told us
                    the truth. We then had quite a conversation, and finally he asked us if we were
                    hungry. We were glad he asked the question.
            Up to this time the old woman had said nothing, but had continued her knitting
                    before the fire-place. The old man told her to get something to eat. She replied
                    she was willing to divide with us, only she did not like to be fooled. The
                    bushwhackers and others had preyed on them.
            The old lady got up and went to the kitchen and I told Steele to go with her, so
                    she would not have the opportunity to betray us. I stayed to entertain the old
                    man. I asked how far we were from the closest Confederate camp, and the old man
                    said he did not know of any. "But," he said, "at Pine
                    Bluff—21 miles away—the Union troops are there."
            My heart bounded at the words, but I had to be cautious. But we were in safe
                    hands. We became very well acquainted and I found there was no truer Union man
                    in the north than he was. Soon supper was ready. We had corn coffee, some very
                    fat meat swimming in a bowl of grease and some corn cakes made from unsifted
                    meal. But never before had I sat down to such a feast!
            
            They insisted that we stay until morning and have the same kind of breakfast. It
                    had been twenty days since we had tasted food, so we stayed.
            They conducted us to the kitchen again, where there was an old-fashioned high bed
                    with straw tick and feather bed. It was a great treat to climb up on that bed
                    with a full stomach and rest!
            Next morning the old man told us where we were. He said he knew every section of
                    land between his home and Pine Bluff, and it was just six miles across the
                    country where we had been captured. Then I knew why it was that the place had
                    seemed familiar to me. The old man said it would be safe for us to make the rest
                    of the trip during the day time if we kept to the woods.
            MI had four dollars in greenbacks still stowed away in the chunk of fat meat. I
                    took them out and gave the old couple two dollars.
            "This is of no value to you now, but when the war is over you can use
                    them," I said.
            The old couple seemed greatly pleased with the greasy old greenbacks and said
                    they would retain them as keep-sakes.
            We then struck into the woods and traveled all that day. About sundown we came to
                    a stream, but the banks were so steep we could not get down to the water and it
                    was necessary to go up or down stream to find a place to cross. We found a road
                    which went the way we wanted to go and we followed it. Presently it led to a
                    bridge over the river, but we were afraid to risk crossing until after dark. We
                    started to turn off to one side to wait for night, when we saw some soldiers
                    come out in the road ahead of us. They were a long ways off but we knew we had
                    been discovered. We could not tell whether they were Union or Confederate
                    soldiers, but all we could do was to wait for them to come up. Before they got
                    to us, however, we could see they wore the blue. They proved to be our own men
                    on picket duty. We were 40 miles below 
                        Little Rock
                    .
            When they escorted us back to the picket line they would not consent for us to go
                    on until we had told our story. We did not want to stay out there with the
                    outposts. We had been through too many dangerous experiences to risk capture  when that near to our camp. We insisted that
                    we be sent in. They sent two men to conduct us to the inside picket lines. We
                    did not feel safe out there.
            It was very near sundown on Sunday evening. We escaped on Sunday and had arrived
                    at our lines on Sunday. They had had a dress parade and the companies were
                    drilling before the citizens. Our two guards marched us along. The citizens
                    wanted to know why they had brought us there. They thought we were rebels and
                    yelled for the men to string us up to the first tree. The troops had had a
                    skirmish that morning with some roving bands and a Union soldier had been
                    killed. The citizens and some of the soldiers followed us with cries of
                    "string them up."
            But the guards knew their business and marched us to headquarters. They called
                    the commander. He asked us the necessary questions to determine who we were and
                    to what command we belonged. He knew our officers and knew of the incidents we
                    related of our fight and capture. He turned to the growing mob and made a short
                    speech, relating the true situation briefly.
            I never before saw such a change in a body of people. Before they were wanting to
                    hang us and now they wanted us—dirty and ragged as we
                    were—to stay with them, and they wanted to give us things to eat and
                    wear. But we preferred to stay with the soldiers. There was no government supply
                    of clothing there, but the boys fitted us out: one gave a shirt and another a
                    pair of pants, etc.
            Mr. Little concluded his story at this point. To those who are curious about how
                    he got back to his command it might be said that at the time of his capture his
                    three-year enlistment had expired and he had signed up for another enlistment.
                    The members of the regiment who had escaped wounds or capture, and who had
                    signed up for another enlistment, had been transferred to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where the regiment was being recruited up to its normal strength.
                    Mr. Little was accordingly given the customary 30-day furlough and went to 
                        Indianapolis
                     and rejoined the regiment.
         
         
         
            The Wilderness Road
            By FRANCES HIGGINS, 
                        Washington
                     County
            AMONG the choice of automobile routes from Hoosierdom to 
                        Florida
                     is the Dixie Highway which makes its way across the States from 
                        Chicago
                     to 
                        Miami
                    . The scenic stretch between these points is the "Old
                    Wilderness Road" or "
                        Boone
                     Way" of 
                        Kentucky
                    . It is also the most interesting from a historical viewpoint. It is
                    now being improved in the various counties through which it passes, and another
                    year will bring its transformation from a typical mountain road to a modern
                    automobile highway—a link in the Dixie route.
            James Lane 
                        Allen
                     says: "It is impossible to come upon this road without
                    pausing, or to write of it without a tribute." Those motorists, who
                    have already braved the mule-roads of the Cumberlands, are enthusiastic about
                    the region. It is without a doubt one of the picturesque spots of America. The
                    mountains afford a "wild, romantic, prospect" as they did to
                    the pioneers, and "the aspect of those cliffs is so wild and horrid
                    that it is impossible to behold them without terror" (
                        Boone
                    ). The rugged beauty of the Pineville region has been compared to
                    the old world: its forests are still as dense as in the early days. The
                    Cumberland river is a mountain stream of rare beauty, that adds many a
                    picturesque feature to the landscape.
            But to many a Hoosier motorist the old Wilderness Road will be more than a scenic
                    mountain highway—it will be a pilgrim way. For it was by this route
                    that so many of our ancestors came over the great divide to Indiana Territory.
                    The automobiles will traverse the very steps of the pioneers. From Mt. Vernon, 
                        Kentucky
                    , to Cumberland Gap the route is exactly the same as was marked out
                    by Daniel 
                        Boone
                     himself. No more fitting monument could be erected to this hero and
                    idol of the West than the present improvement of his road.
            No ancient road has done so much for society as this  one; the West owes much to "
                        Boone
                     Way." It contributed not only to the development of 
                        Kentucky
                    , but of 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, 
                        Illinois
                    , and 
                        Missouri
                    . The great emigration by way of the Wilderness Road has no parallel
                    in history. For more than twenty years they came, an almost endless throng. It
                    is almost impossible to estimate their number. In one year alone thirty thousand
                    came from 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        North Carolina
                     to 
                        Kentucky
                    . That Indiana's growth was affected by this great
                    emigration is shown by many old records. The story of our ancestors who came
                    from 
                        Virginia
                     and the Car-olinas has been repeated frequently this centennial
                    year.
            The name Wilderness Road arose from the nature of the country through which the
                    pioneers first blazed the trail. It was a wilderness, indeed, with primeval
                    forests on every hand. George 
                        Washington
                     as a surveyor in eastern 
                        Kentucky
                    , discovered trees of almost fabulous size, as did Dr. Thomas
                    Walker, who came after him. Between these giant oaks, elms, and sycamores was an
                    almost impenetrable thicket of vines, laurel, hazel and brush through which the
                    pioneers were obliged to cut their way. Along the water courses were numerous
                    canebrakes; the streams themselves were deep, and at times most difficult and
                    dangerous to ford. This has been called the "longest, blackest,
                    hardest, road of pioneer days." Only experienced teamsters could bring
                    a wagon safely over the mountains. For brakes down the steep western slope,
                    forest trees were felled and dragged behind the wagons to be cast aside at the
                    foot, where they became so numerous as to impede the way.
            The great terror of the road was the savage Indian, whose hunting grounds
                    extended to the border settlements of 
                        Virginia
                    . Rarely a day passed but some of the emigrants were attacked,
                    murdered or scalped. There were other dangers also. "On their way
                    through the wilderness they encountered bear, buffalo, wolves, wild-cats and
                    sometimes herds of deer. Thus they moved cautiously onward in a long line
                    through a narrow bridle-path, so encumbered with brush as to impede their
                    progress, and render it necessary that they should sometimes encamp for days in
                    order to rest their weary pack-horses, and forage for themselves."
            Many families joined together for mutual safety and protection  from the Indians. Ten and twenty often united for
                    the journey and a great caravan of two hundred families is recorded in an old
                    account of the trail. Whole churches moved in a body into the West. During the
                    great emigration the Society of Friends vanished entirely from 
                        South Carolina
                    . The State of 
                        Kentucky
                     finally provided an armed guard for the protection of the emigrants
                    in the Cumberland region—at one time fifty, at another time one
                    hundred men. The hero-martyr of those days was Captain James Estell.
            Other historic characters who traversed the "
                        Boone
                     Way" were General George Rogers 
                        Clark
                    , Benjamin Logan, and Col. Richard Henderson. As this was our best
                    connection with the east, no doubt our earliest congressmen, political and
                    military leaders used it in passing between the capitals. From the
                    "high swung gate way" of Cumberland Mountain Gap the road
                    extended to Crab Orchard, 
                        Kentucky
                    , and from Crab Orchard to the Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                    . A western extension ran from the Falls to 
                        Vincennes
                    , Indiana, and thence to 
                        St. Louis
                     on the 
                        Mississippi
                    .
            The story of the great emigration is told today by the gray-haired children of
                    the pioneers. In southern Indiana the story of the pioneer mother who walked
                    from the older land is common. You will be told tof Abigail Coffin, who as a
                    young girl walked beside the ox-cart that contained all the possessions of the
                    family, and carried in her hands the 500-sleigh for the loom. Or you may hear
                    the pathetic story of Mary Hollowell, the orphan girl, who brought her small
                    brother to Indiana Territory with a company of 
                        North Carolina
                     families. The two walked the entire distance and even helped push
                    the wagon up the steep mountain roads. For this privilege the sister paid by
                    dropping corn at the rate of ten cents a week. It is with much pride that the
                    stories are repeated by the descendants today. There are some who can remember
                    the wagons in which their parents made the long journey. These, unfortunately,
                    have long ago gone to decay in some forgotten corner of our Indiana farm-yards.
            There are, however, many relics of the days of the Wilderness Road which have
                    been brought to light this centennial year. They make those times seem very near
                    to us. The old compass which was used to guide the way over the mountains  and on across the 
                        Ohio
                    , served also as a clock by day. Among other relics that have
                    survived the years and the ravages of time are chests and trunks and an
                    occasional bit of willow ware. There are also letters, diaries, wills and
                    marriage certificates in the hand-writing of the pioneers. Some of the handiwork
                    of these ancestors of ours is greatly treasured. You may find a neatly made
                    herchief, or a skein of thread, or a sampler that was made in the "Old
                    North State." And in some sections of the southern hills are splendid
                    specimens of the southern cypress, now more than a century old, which were
                    brought by the pioneers from the old home across the mountains.
            Surely the Hoosier motorist enroute to 
                        Florida
                     over the Dixie Highway will see much more than the scenic beauty of
                    the Cumberland region. The way is well marked—there is a monument to 
                        Boone
                     at the Gap, another at Flat Lick in 
                        Knox
                     county. The mountain folk will point out to you where the
                    Warriors' Path branched from the Wilderness Road and made its way to
                    the north. A tributary of Fighting Creek bears the name of Trace Branch from its
                    location near the 
                        Boone
                     trace. On the hills above Fighting Creek is a lonely grave which is
                    said to be that of a child, a member of 
                        Boone
                    's party. In the vicinity of the Gap there are stones that
                    mark the various engagements of the Civil War, which took place there.
            The Cumberlands occupy a peculiar place in the literature of our country, and are
                    better known in popular novels than elsewhere. But with the advent of the
                    railroad and the opening of rich mines, the mountains are coming to. The days of
                    feuds and feudists are rapidly passing. No one is more interested in the
                    improvement of the road than the mountaineers themselves. There are, however,
                    old world ways and primitive customs that make side trips in the region well
                    worthwhile, and add greatly to the charms of the historic "
                        Boone
                     Way."
         
         
         
            Memories of the National Road∗
            
            By HARRIET MCINTYRE FOSTER, 
                        Indianapolis
                    
            
            The trails of the world have been made by primitive man and wild beasts since
                    primeval days. They have left their foot prints on the mountain tops, in
                    jungles, on the prairies and in forests. In our Western world the Indians and
                    the wild beasts found the direct trail to lake, river, pasture and hunting
                    ground. "The Path of Nemacolin" was a famous Indian trail that
                    was "blazed" by Nemacolin the great 
                        Delaware
                     chief through the forest from Wills Creek (later called Cumberland)
                    to the 
                        Ohio
                     River. This trail was used by General 
                        Washington
                     in 1754 and later was followed by General Braddock and his army
                    and, in consequence, was called Brad-dock's Road. Many years afterwards
                    this path of Nemacolin was included in the old Cumberland Road or National Road
                    as we now know it.
            The cow paths of the village of 
                        Boston
                     became the streets of that now famous city. Our ancestors found
                    many well defined trails, followed them through the forests, until they became
                    well trodden paths. Our country is now crossed and re-crossed by countless
                    roads. In this great labyrinth of highways there is one that is of great
                    historic interest—the old Cumberland Road as it is named in all the
                    government documents or the National Road as we call it.
            This thoroughfare so full of life and business, was once Indiana's only
                    commercial artery. Her "pioneer citizens once deemed it a matter of
                    great importance to be located upon this highway. The National Road is the only
                    one ever planned and constructed by the 
                        United States
                     government.
            It was not until 1806 when 
                        Jefferson
                     was President that the idea of a National Road originated. It is
                    commonly said that Henry Clay proposed the idea. It was, however, really

                                Michigan
                             Roads in 
                                Indianapolis
                            .
               
                     suggested by the great financier, Mr. Albert
                    Gallatin, secretary of the treasury. The construction of the National road began
                    at Cumberland, 
                        Maryland
                     and it was called the Cumberland Road but, as it was built by the
                    government of the 
                        United States
                    , the people persisted in naming it the National Road. If not the
                    originator Henry Clay was certainly the great champion of the road in Congress.
                    In his life it is related that he had "to beg, entreat and supplicate
                    Congress" to make the appropriations necessary for the completion of
                    the road. He also said in one of his speeches to Congress—"I
                    have myself toiled to prevail upon you to make the necessary
                    appropriations." He passionately devoted his great eloquence to
                    securing favorable legislation from Congress.
            Commencing under Mr. 
                        Jefferson
                     its construction was sanctioned and prosecuted by every President
                    and every Congress for more than twenty-five years. It passed through
                            
                  Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio
               , Indiana and into 
                        Illinois
                    . Finally each of these States accepted the responsibility of
                    keeping up the road within its bounds. From the time the road was begun in 1806
                    until 1818, when it was opened, and until 1852, the date of the coming of the
                    railroad west of the mountains, the National Road was the one great highway over
                    which passed the trade, travel and mails between the East and the West.
            Its many stately stone bridges, its iron mile posts and iron toll gates some of
                    them still remaining are enduring monuments of its grandeur and stability. Many
                    of the most illustrious statesmen and heroes of that period passed over the
                    National Road on their way to and from Congress, and the
                            capital—
                  Jackson,
                            Harrison, Clay
               , Sam 
                        Houston
                    , Polk, Taylor, 
                        Shelby
                    , Butler, Davy Crocket and many others. The long line of stage
                    coaches that succeeded the wagons that were first used to carry passengers, then
                    the private coaches and finally the "prairie schooner," made
                    an almost continuous procession of vehicles and horsemen. Many really excellent
                    taverns came into existence. For some years the ruins of one of these taverns
                    stood on the western limit of Ir-vington.
            The traveler on this road passed through a great variety of scenery diversified
                    by mountain views, grand and historic 
                    rivers, flourishing towns and villages and interesting homes of distinguished
                    people. A few miles east of Wheeling, on the National Road, is a very beautiful
                    stone bridge over Wheeling Creek. Near this bridge stands a time-stained
                    monument erected in 1820 in honor of 
                        Henry
                        Clay
                     by Col. Moses Shepherd, the son of my Revolutionary ancestor, Col.
                    David Shepherd. The inscription upon this monument bears testimony to the
                    grateful appreciation of 
                        Henry
                        Clay
                    's great efforts for the National Road.
            The monument is surmounted by the statue of liberty. Near by on a picturesque
                    eminence stands the historic Shepherd mansion now known as the Monument House, a
                    stone building erected in 1798 near the place where old Fort Shepherd stood,
                    built by my great-great-grandfather, Col. David Shepherd, the hero of the
                    defense of Fort 
                        Henry
                     at Wheeling. In the old cemetery surrounding the Old Stone Church
                    is another handsome monument bearing the following inscription in memory of Col.
                    Moses Shepherd, son of Col. David Shepherd: 
                        To him (be country owes a large debt of gratitude as well for his defense
                            of it when a frontier settlement as for his recent public services in
                            aiding the extension and construction of the Cumberland Koad through 
                                Virginia
                            .
                    
            
            Mrs. Jessie Benton Fremont gives an interesting account of her visit to the
                    Monument House and delights of bowling along this fine road over the Blue
                    mountains in early spring in a large reserved coach and four, and of the great
                    inns where they stopped at night. But this road led mainly among stern pine
                    forests and upland wastes of stony lands. Mrs. Fremont wrote that this fine road
                    and the public men connected with it made great reputations and also great
                    fortunes. One of these men was my great uncle, Colonel Shepherd and he and his
                    wife used to drive to 
                        Washington
                     in their coach and four every winter, in order to make to Congress
                    his reports of the progress of the building of the National Road.
            It was opened to 
                  Columbus,
                            Ohio
               , in 1827 and to 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1830. The length through Indiana beginning in 
                        Wayne
                     county and ending in 
                        Vigo
                     county is 1491/4 miles, and the cost through this State was
                    $513,099, paid by the United 
                    States government. The work began at 
                        Indianapolis
                     and extended east and west. From 1827 to 1847 the National Road was
                    Indiana's chief commercial highway. It ended in 
                        Terre Haute
                    . With the coming of the railroad in 1847 before the National Road
                    was completed beyond the western boundary of Indiana, the railroad had become
                    the chief agency of travel and commerce, and our grand old National Road was
                    practically lost in the prairies of 
                        Illinois
                    .
            My personal interest in the National Road is very great, as for nearly thirty
                    years my life was passed beside it. I was born in my grandfather's
                    house on the National Road near 
                  Columbus, Ohio
               . A few years later my father, Reverend Dr. Thomas
                    Mclntire, with his wife and three children, drove in a carriage from
                            
                  Columbus, Ohio
               , to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , over this road. One trunk was carried on the trunk rack behind.
                    The remainder of the baggage was sent to 
                        Cincinnati
                    , then down the 
                        Ohio
                     river to 
                        Madison
                    , thence to 
                        Indianapolis
                     by way of the old 
                        Madison
                     railroad, then the only railway in the State. Several of the trunks
                    did not arrive for six weeks. We then came to our new home, the Deaf and Dumb
                    Institution, on this road. At that date the National Road passed through the
                    grounds of this institution which extended on the north to 
                        Michigan
                     street and to one-half a mile south of the michi-gan Road. On the
                    north side and by the road was a fine orchard, garden and gardener's
                    house. A small stream ran through the garden. On the south side of the road
                    stood the institution with school buildings and shops, all surrounded by
                    beautiful grounds laid out in the formal English style with fountains and
                    green-houses, with drives and walks interspersed with every variety of evergreen
                    and shrubbery. It was a perfect copy in every detail of an English formal garden
                    and for twenty-seven years my father had charge of this school. Here I was
                    married and lived in a cottage on the National Road where two of our children
                    were born. During these years almost every distinguished person that came to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , including all the governors of Indiana, frequently passed over
                    this road to visit the school for the deaf. 
                        Rutherford
                     B. Hayes, afterward President, was a guest in the institution for a
                    day and night when he came to meet and escort Mr. 
                        Lincoln
                     to 
                        Ohio
                     on his first and fateful journey  to 
                        Washington
                     City. President Benjamin 
                        Harrison
                     was a frequent guest as well as friend and counselor of my father.
                    One of Queen Victoria's maids of honor, Miss Murray, while a visitor in
                    this country, was a deeply interested tourist of the West and was entertained by
                    my parents. An entertainment in the institution was always given to the members
                    of the legislature during the sessions and a dinner for the special committee in
                    charge of the benevolent institution. Once much to the delight and entertainment
                    of the children, General Tom Thumb drove out on the National Road to the
                    institution in his gilded coach and four ponies and took one of my little
                    sisters a drive in his coach.
            Memory also recalls the environment of this spot as it was in those long ago
                    days. Across the 
                        Michigan
                     Road was a small and beautiful woods, Bates' Woods, where
                    as children we went for the first violets and spring beauties. Just beyond was
                    the home of Mrs. 
                        Lawrence
                     Vance. Across- the road on the north, by historic Pogues Run, was
                    Bates' mill, across from this spot was the farm of Governor 
                        Noble
                    , then dead, but his son Winston 
                        Noble
                     lived on the northern part of it and his sister, Mrs. Davidson,
                    lived on the eastern part. On the National Road further east Dr. William Latham
                    resided, also Col. John Ray and beyond the institution Dr. Nof-singer lived, now
                    the residence of Mr. Wm. M. Taylor. On the 
                        Michigan
                     Road lived Dr. Bobbs, beyond lived the Misses Canby, relatives of
                    General Canby and relatives of the late Gen. Hawkins; Mr. J. K. Sherpe, Senior,
                    lived at the corner of what is now State street and 
                        Michigan
                     Road and beyond was the birthplace of William Chase, the famous
                    artist. This picturesque point is unchanged for thirty years, and is occupied by
                    Miss Heim, the daughter of Mr. Heim, who built the house. These are a few of the
                    homes that memory recalls on this eventful occasion.
            During these early years there was a great exodus of people from the East to the
                    West who were constantly passing over the National Road to the far West. It was
                    a constant source of interest for all the children to stand by the entrance gate
                    and watch the almost endless stream of "Movers" in their
                    canvas covered wagons, "prairie schooners" as they were
                    called, followed by droves of weary cattle. It was a  passing scene of great interest and often of
                    tragedy. Once the leader of a party died by the way. He was brought into the
                    institution and Father Bessonies was sent for. He was a great friend of my
                    father and they were co-laborers in charity work. That night a wake was held in
                    one of the shops and the next morning the man was taken to St. Johns and then
                    buried. Another time a poor little baby was very ill. My mother brought the
                    mother and child into the house but it was too late, the baby died and my father
                    held a funeral service in the chapel and the baby was buried in Green Lawn. In
                    my childhood the National Road was a shifting and endless panorama of the human
                    comedy.
            The placing of this milestone not only marks the crossing of two important roads,
                    the National Road and the 
                        Michigan
                     but also marks the beginning of the construction of the National
                    Road in Indiana as, contrary to the usual procedure, the building of the road
                    was begun in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and worked east and west. With the coming of the railroads began
                    the decline of our famous old highway. In many places it was greatly neglected
                    and in some counties it resembled a country lane. After years of neglect and
                    almost abandonment, the magical influence of the motor cycle and the automobile
                    has instilled new life into the old road. Once more it is restored to its old
                    fame as the first and only government road.
            The great awakening of interest in good wagon roads has caused the construction
                    of the Dixie Highway which crosses the National Road in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and extends from the limits of the north and south; and also of the 
                        Lincoln
                     Highway which extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans,
                    passing through the northern part of our State.
            Allusions have been made to the trails of the vanishing Indian days. The word is
                    no longer limited to the blazed paths of the Indian. It has become a common
                    appellation much in use by cycle riders and automobile tourists.
            The great adventurers of these days are the automobile tourist and the
                    motorcyclist. For them the new trail has evolved with its bands of red, blue,
                    yellow, white or black, with various designs of black arrows or red and blue
                    balls or diamonds.
            These painted signs mark the highways from city to city,  from State to State, from region to region. Many of
                    the older trails are being restored such as the old Natchez Trace, 
                        Boone
                    's Route through this State to the French settlements on
                    the Great Lakes, the Sante Fe Trail and many others of the Indians and the
                    original white explorers.
            So once more our grand old pioneer National Road is coming into its own and is
                    being restored to its former greatness as the first highway from the East to the
                    West.

                     and Tecumseh, it may not be uninteresting to recur to a point of
                    time just before the Treaty of Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , when the two Indian leaders removed from the neighborhood of the
                    white settlements at Greenville, 
                        Ohio
                    , and established the Prophet's Town on the 
                        Wabash
                     river in the month of June, 1808. This was to be the spot from
                    whence should emanate all those brilliant schemes of the brothers to merge the
                    broken tribes into a confederacy; to oppose the further advance of the white
                    settlers, and with the aid of the British power in 
                        Canada
                    , to drive them back beyond the waters of the 
                        Ohio
                    . It was, as General DeHart has aptly remarked, "the seat
                    of Indian diplomacy and strategy for many years."1
            
            In leading their followers to this new field, the brothers were guided by certain
                    lines of policy which were both remarkable in their conception, and signal for
                    their far-sightedness. The rendezvous at Greenville had been marked by intense
                    enthusiasm, hundreds of red men flocking thither to imbibe the new faith and to
                    commune with the Prophet; so many in fact, that Governor 
                        Harrison
                     had ordered them to be supplied from the public stores at Fort 
                        Wayne
                     in order to avert trouble. But it was evident to the new leaders
                    that all this congregating did not turn aside starvation; that warriors could
                    not be held together who were hungry and who lacked corn; that the proximity of
                    white traders was conducive to drunkenness; that if back of outward appearances
                    any warlike exercises were to be indulged, or the emissaries and arms of the
                    British were to be received, that these things would require 
                  
                     1
                            Report 
                                    Tippecanoe

                     secrecy and seclusion until the plot was
                    ripe; that some strategic position must be secured on one of the great waterways
                    of the interior, within quick striking distance of the settlements and easily
                    accessible to the British posts.
            Such a spot was the site of the Old French and Indian trading post on the right
                    bank of the 
                        Wabash
                     and about ten miles above the present city of 
                        Lafayette
                    . To the west about one and one-quarter miles is the marble shaft of
                    the Battleground, and going from thence east across the fields and open
                    woodlands you come to the fringe of woods that still lines the river. You have
                    walked over the old Indian cornfields and are now standing on the exact location
                    of the old Prophet's Town. The scene is one of great beauty even at
                    this day, when the forest has been despoiled and Nature ravished of her choicest
                    charms. Here, the river extends in an almost unbroken line for three or four
                    miles, bordered by sycamores and maples, and with a wealth of clinging vines,
                    crab-apple blossoms and blooming flowers on either bank. The old trading post
                    was located on one of a series of high cliffs, crowned with huge forest trees,
                    and commanding the river through vistas of foliage. The face of these cliffs is
                    frequently broken by sharp ravines, that extend on back among the hills with
                    many devious windings. At the foot of the steep slopes, extends a long narrow
                    tableland of forest bordering directly upon the river; this is interspersed with
                    springs of fresh water that burst from the hillsides. On the cliffs stood the
                    camps and cabins of the warriors and their followers; below, and on the
                    tableland next to the water, the horses were tethered, and canoes were drawn up
                    out of the river.
            Thither the Prophet and his brother now turned their eyes. The whole upper
                    valley, including the basins of the 
                        Tippecanoe
                     and the Wild Cat, was the rightful possession of the Miamis and
                    Weas, but the brothers now secured a pretended right or license from the
                    Kickapoos and Pottawattamies to establish a camp. The Miamis of the north and
                    the Dela-wares of the south, were alike alarmed. The Delawares in particular had
                    been the friends of the white people and adherents of the governor. They
                    divined, and divined truly, that the Prophet's plans ultimately
                    involved mischief. To  avoid a possible war
                    they sent a deputation of chiefs to the Prophet, who refused to see them, but
                    deputed Tecumseh to answer their remonstrances. On this mission he was entirely
                    successful. By threats and persuasion he turned them back, although they had
                    received strict instructions from their tribe to oppose a new settlement. On a
                    visit shortly afterwards by John Conner, interpreter for the Delawares, on a
                    search for stolen horses, he found the Prophet safely en-sconsed in his chosen
                    position, with a following of thirty or forty Shawnees, and about ninety others,
                    consisting of Potta-wattamies, Chippewas, Ottowas and Winnebagoes.2
            
            The location selected was certainly ideal. "By a short portage the
                    Indians could go by canoe to 
                        Lake
                     Erie or Lake Michigan, or by the 
                        Wabash
                     reach all the vast system of watercourses to the north and west. It
                    was only twenty-four hours journey by canoe, at a favorable stage of water, down
                    stream to 
                        Vincennes
                    , the capital of the white man's territory;"3 the British post at Maiden was only a few days distant. As
                    to the Indian tribes, the Prophet's Town was almost centrally located
                    in the 
                        Miami
                     Confederacy; to the north as far as the post of 
                        Chicago
                     and Lake Michigan extended the realm of the
                    Pottawattamies; on the Vermilion below, and to the west of the main stream, lay
                    the villages of the Kicka-poos, whose hardy warriors, second only to the
                    Wyandots, had accepted the new faith; the Sacs and Foxes, the Winnebagoes,
                    Ottowas, Chippewas and Wyandots were all within easy reach, and secret embassies
                    and negotiations might be carried on without much fear of detection.
            The brothers now resolved to pursue the following course —to wean
                    their followers entirely away from the use of whiskey, which was fast destroying
                    their military efficiency; to teach them, if possible, the ways of labor, so
                    that they might raise corn and other products of the earth and thus supply their
                    magazines against a time of war; to dupe the governor into the belief that their
                    mission was one of peace, and undertaken solely for the moral uplift and
                    betterment of the tribes—in the meantime, by the constant practice of
                    religious ceremonies and rites, to work on the superstition of

                     the warriors; win them, if need be, from the
                    chieftains who might counsel peace, and by a series of war-like sports and
                    exercises, hold together the young bucks and train them for the inevitable
                    conflict between the races.
            What strange mysticism did the Prophet practice to make the Indians of the 
                        Wabash
                     "abandon whiskey, discard textile clothing, return to
                    skins, throw away their witch-bags, kill their dogs, and abandon the white
                    man's ways, even to giving up flint and steel for making
                        fires?"4 That he had gained fame and ascendency
                    among the neighboring tribes since the episode of the eclipse in 1806, is
                    testified to by the fact that when Richard McNemar, the Shaker, visited him in
                    1807 at Greenville, 
                        Ohio
                    , he found a temple of worship one hundred fifty feet in length
                    surrounded by wigwams and cottages, and the Indians then told McNemar that they
                    all believed implicitly in the Prophet and that he could "dream to
                        God."5 The Prophet had at that time also gone
                    so far as to institute the confessional, and all sinful disclosures were made to
                    himself and four accompanying chiefs. The question was asked: "Do they
                    confess all the bad things they ever did?" Answer: "All from
                    seven years old. And cry and tremble when they come to confess."6 A sort of nature or sun-worship had already been
                    introduced. McNemar thus describes a salutation to the lord of the day: 
                        Next morning, as soon as it was day, one of their speakers mounted a log,
                            near the southeast corner of the village, and began the morning service
                            with a loud voice, in thanksgiving to the Great Spirit. He continued his
                            address for near an hour. The people were all in their tents, some at
                            the distance of fifteen or twenty rods; yet they could all distinctly
                            hear, and gave a solemn and loud assent, which sounded from tent to
                            tent, at every pause. While we stood in his view, at the end of the
                            meeting house, on rising ground, from which we had a prospect of the
                            surrounding wigwams, and the vast open plain or prairie, to the south
                            and east, and which looks over the big fort, toward the north, for the
                            distance of two miles, we felt as if we were among the tribes of 
                                Israel
                            , on their march to Canaan.7
                  
                    
            
            By weird incantations, symbolic ceremonies, and practice of the black art, the
                    Prophet had gone far. He was now regarded

                     as invulnerable, and his person sacred.8 But that which gave point to his oracles, and authority to
                    his imposture, was his Shawnee hatred of the pale face. To incite their growing
                    jealousy and malice, he told his dupes, that the white man had poisoned all
                    their land, and prevented it from producing such things as they found necessary
                    to their subsistence.9 The growing scarcity of game, the
                    disappearance of the deer and buffalo before the white settlements, was
                    indisputable proof of his assertions. To drive back these invaders who polluted
                    the soil and desecrated the graves of their fathers—what more was
                    needed to incite the savage warriors to a crusade of blood and extermination?
                    About this time it was noticed that the Poittawattamies of the prairie, who were
                    under the influence of the Prophet, were frequently holding religious exercises,
                    but that these exercises were always concluded with, "war-like sports,
                    shooting with bows, throwing the tomahawk, and wielding the
                        war-club."10
            
            In the meantime, the relation of these religious ceremonies at the
                    Prophet's Town, and their seemingly good effect upon the red men,
                    completely disarmed the governor for the time being. He now entertained the idea
                    that the great Indian leader might be "made a useful instrument in
                    effecting a radical and salutary change in the manners and habits of the
                        Indians."11 To stop the use of ardent spirits
                    and to encourage the cultivation of corn, were two important steps, as the
                    governor thought. Events which succeeded but added to 
                        Harrison
                    's deception. In June or July, 1808, messengers appeared at 
                        Vincennes
                    , and one of them stated that he had listened to the Prophet for
                    upwards of three years, and had never heard anything but good advice.
            
                    He tells us we must pray to the Great Spirit who made the world and
                        everything in it for our use. He tells us that no man could make the plants,
                        the trees, and the animals, but they must be made by the Great Spirit, to
                        whom we ought to pray, and obey in all things. He tells us not to lie, to
                        steal, nor to drink whiskey; not to go to war, but to live in peace with all
                        mankind. He tells us also to work and to make corn.12

            In August of the same year, the crafty Prophet himself appeared and stayed at 
                        Vincennes
                     for more than two weeks. The governor was surprised at the great
                    address and ease with which he handled his followers, and had the pleasure of
                    listening to a speech, in which the Prophet professed the most pacific
                    intentions, constantly haranguing his retinue upon the evils of war and liquor,
                    and holding out to them the advantages of temperance and peace. It seems that
                    the governor even made a few personal experiments to determine whether the
                    Indians were in earnest about their pretensions, but could induce none of them
                    to touch fire-water. The interview closed to the entire satisfaction of the
                    governor, the Prophet promising to keep him fully informed as to anything that
                    might be inimical to the settlements, and receiving in return many presents from
                    the governor in the way of implements of husbandry, arms, powder and other
                    things which the Indians claimed that they were in sore need of.
            How vain this trust! Scarcely had the Prophet returned to his town, before he was
                    entertaining an emissary and spy of the British government, who urged war on the 
                        United States
                    . In the following spring of 1809, the Chippewas, Ot-tawas and
                    Pottawattamies were being urged by the Prophet to take up arms against the
                    inhabitants of 
                        Vincennes
                    , and to destroy the settlers along the 
                        Ohio
                    , as far up as 
                        Cincinnati
                    . Reports of these proceedings were confirmed by Michel
                    Brou-illette, an Indian trader, and by Toussaint 
                        Dubois
                    , a confidential agent of the governor. 
                        Harrison
                     probably averted an Indian attack, by promptly organizing two
                    additional companies of militia and throwing them into Fort 
                        Knox
                    , to guard the approaches to the capital by land and water. The
                    Indians, seeing this prompt action, deserted the Prophet and returned to their
                    homes. The governor was not fooled a second time. The Prophet again visited him
                    in the summer or 1809, and made the same old pretensions of peace. But the
                    governor forced him to admit that he had entertained the British the fall
                    before, and that he had been invited, as he said, to join a league of the Sacs
                    and Foxes against the whites in the early spring, and he could make no
                    satisfactory explanation as to why he had not imparted these facts to the
                    government,  when he had been solemnly
                    enjoined so to do. From this time on, the Prophet was regarded with a just
                    suspicion, and 
                        Harrison
                     diligently regarded every movement of the new faith.
            HARRISON'S VIGILANCE
            
            The spring of 1810 opened with peril to 
                        Vincennes
                    . The eternal vigilance of 
                        Harrison
                     alone saved the day. The fall before had witnessed the making of
                    the Treaty of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     and the acquisition of the new purchase; this had strengthened the
                    claims of the Prophet and Tecumseh for a closer union of the tribes, and had
                    given added force to their argument in favor of a communistic ownership of all
                    the land. What right had the old village chiefs to dispose of the common domain
                    without the consent of the warriors who had fought to maintain it? The Great
                    Spirit gave the soil in common to all the tribes; what single tribe could
                    alienate any particular portion of it?
            Reliable word came to the governor in April that the Prophet had assembled one
                    thousand souls at the Prophet's Town, with probably three hundred fifty
                    or four hundred men among them; that the French traders along the 
                        Wabash
                     had been warned by the Prophet's followers to separate
                    themselves from the Americans at 
                        Vincennes
                     for trouble was brewing; that the Indians at 
                        Tippecanoe
                     had refused to buy ammunition of the traders, saying that they had
                    a plenty and could get plenty more without paying for it; that Matthew Elliott,
                    the British agent at Maiden, was busy with plot and intrigue against the 
                        United States
                    . But 
                        Harrison
                     was surrounded by some of the best scouts and confidential agents
                    that a frontier official ever commanded—among them Tous-saint 
                        Dubois
                    , Joseph Barron and Michel Brouillette. He kept awake and on the
                        alert.13
            
            Tecumseh now assumed a more active leadership. The day had arrived for the
                    statesman and warrior to sound the alarm, form an active league and confederacy
                    of all the tribes, and with tomahawk in hand, resist any further advancement on
                    the part of the whites. As 
                        Harrison
                     has remarked, he appeared today on the 
                        Wabash
                    , a short time later on the shores 
                  
                     13 Dawson, 
                                
                                    Harrison
                                
                            , 138.
               
                     of 
                        Lake
                     Erie or Lake Michigan, and then upon the 
                        Mississippi
                    .14 Everywhere he was masterful, eloquent,
                    convincing, and "made an impression favorable to his purpose."
                    At one time during the early summer it is known that he was at 
                        Detroit
                    , and he was probably in close communication with his British
                    allies, although he professed to hate them.
            About May, 1810, a council of all the tribes of the 
                        Wabash
                     and those to the north was called at the River 
                        St. Joseph
                     of Lake Michigan. The whole situation was
                    fraught with danger, for 
                        Harrison
                     had reason to believe that many of the tribes had already received
                    the tomahawk and were meditating a combined attack on the settlements.
                    Subsequently events proved that his fears were well founded. He immediately
                    despatched John Conner to the Delawares and 
                        Pointed out to tbem the unavoidable destruction which awaited all the
                            tribes which should dare to take up the hatchet against their fathers,
                            and the great danger that the friendly tribes would incur, if war should
                            be kindled, from the difficulty of discriminating friends from foes.15
                  
                    
            
            A messenger was despatched in haste after the deputies of the tribe deputed to
                    the council, with full instructions dictated by the governor, to urge these
                    facts upon the assembled tribes. In addition, the governor in response to the
                    demands of a company of officers, merchants and others at 
                        Vincennes
                    , at once called two companies of militia into active service,
                    established alarm posts upon the frontier, and used all available means at hand
                    to put himself in readiness for war. Fortunately, the Delawares remained
                    faithful. If Winamac is to be believed, the Prophet in person urged upon the
                    council an immediate surprise of 
                        Detroit
                    , Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , the Post at 
                  Chicago, St.
                    Louis
                and 
                        Vincennes
                    , and a junction with the tribes of the 
                        Mississippi
                    , but the "forcible representations" of the 
                        Delaware
                     deputies, who were looked upon as "grandfathers,"
                    prevented the adoption of his plans. It seems that the younger men and some of
                    the war lords of the smaller bands were ready to go to war, but the sachems and
                    older village chieftains who had participated in the treaty of the year before
                    held aloof. The Chippewas, Ottawas and Pottawattamies refused 
                  
                     14 Eggleston, Tecumseh, 207.
                  
                     15 Dawson, 
                                
                                    Harrison
                                
                            , 139.
               
                     to take up arms, the council broke up
                    without any concerted action, and Winamac and the Pottawattamies were sent to
                    the governor to make report of the proceedings. When he arrived at 
                        Vincennes
                     in the latter part of June, he reported that as he passed through
                    the Prophet's Town an attempt was made to assassinate him—so
                    enraged was the Prophet at his failure on the 
                        St. Joseph
                    . Winamac further told the governor that about the time of the
                    council the Prophet had proposed to the younger warriors that the principal
                    chiefs of all the tribes should be murdered; that they were the ones who had
                    brought about a sale of the Indian lands, and that their, the warrior's
                    hands, would never be untied until they were rid of them.16
                    The brothers were baffled in another mission. Te-cumseh urged the Shawnees at
                    Wapakoneta, 
                        Ohio
                    , to join the league. A letter of John Johnston, Indian agent at
                    Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , informed the governor that the Shawnees refused even to enter into
                    council with him.
            The ugly temper into which the Indians had now worked themselves is well
                    illustrated by the episode of the salt. On the 15th of June a boat came up the 
                        Wabash
                     to the Prophet's Town laden with salt for the use of the
                    tribes, according to the terms of a former agreement. The man in charge of the
                    boat reported that the Prophet and some Kickapoos with him at the time, refused
                    to receive it and he was directed to leave the salt on the bank of the river
                    until Tecumseh should return; Tecumseh being reported as at 
                        Detroit
                    . On his return trip home the master of the boat was directed to
                    re-load the salt; that the Indians would have nothing to do with it.
            
                    Whilst the hands were rolling in the barrels, the brother of the Prophet
                        seized the master and several others by the hair, and, shaking them
                        violently, asked them if they were Americans. They, however, were all young
                        Frenchmen. They also insulted Mr. Brouillette, and called him an American
                        dog, and a young Pottawattamie chief directed his men to plunder his house,
                        which was immediately done, depriving him of all hi provisions, tobacco,
                            etc.17
               
                
            Brouillette was the French trader heretofore referred to, and probably had a
                    cabin for his trading supplies on the bank of the river.

            On one of their embassies, however, the brothers were successful. One of the most
                    influential of the tribes in council was the Wyandots or Hurons, now greatly
                    reduced in numbers, but still of great prestige and power among the red men. 
                        Harrison
                     always ranked their warriors among the best, and General 
                        Wayne
                     at Greenville had delivered to them the original duplicate of the
                    treaty. In a speech by Massas, a Chippewa chief, to General 
                        Wayne
                    , he referred to this tribe as "our uncles, the
                    Wyandots," and this was the designation generally employed by all the
                        tribes.18 It was plain that if the Wyandots could be won
                    over to the new cause, a great diplomatic victory would be gained and the
                    influence of the new movement greatly augmented. The Prophet accordingly sent a
                    deputation to the Wyandots, "expressing his surprise that the Wyandots,
                    who had directed the councils of the other tribes, as well as the treaty with
                    the white people should sit still, and see the property of the Indians usurped
                    by a part," and he expressed a desire to see the treaties and know what
                    they contained. The Wyandots were greatly flattered by these attentions, and
                    answered "that they had nothing nearer their hearts, than to see all
                    the various tribes united again as one man—that they looked upon
                    every thing that had been done since the Treaty of Greenville as good for
                    nothing—and that they would unite their exertions with those of the
                    Prophet, to bring together all the tribes, and get them to unite to put a stop
                    to the encroachments of the white people."19 It
                    seems that the Wyandots were also the keepers of a certain great belt, which had
                    formerly been a symbol of the union of the tribes at the time of the war with
                    Anthony 
                        Wayne
                    . They now came in deputation to the Prophet's Town,
                    carrying this great belt with them, and producing it among the clans of the
                    Miamis at the villages of the Mississinewa, accusing them of deserting their
                    Indian friends and allies. The tribes at Mississinewa sent for the Weas and
                    accompanied the deputation to 
                        Tippecanoe
                    .
            Though thwarted on the 
                        St. Joseph
                     and among the Shawnees, it was plain that a strict espionage would
                    have to be

                     maintained over the proceedings at the
                    Prophet's Town, and especially over the Prophet himself. The heart of
                    this priest was filled with plots of assassination and murder. Grosble, an old
                    Indian friend of the governor, informed him that the Prophet had at one time
                    planned a wholesale slaughter at 
                        Vincennes
                    , and that it had been arranged that the Prophet should enter the
                    governor's house with twelve or fifteen of his followers and slay him.
                    To the Prophet may be attributed all the horse stealing expeditions, the insults
                    to messengers and agents, and the plans for the murder of the older Indian
                    chiefs. While Tecumseh either countenanced these transactions, or else was
                    unable to control them, he seems, with strange sagacity for a savage, to have at
                    all times realized that the assassination of 
                        Harrison
                    , the stealing of a few horses, or the slaughter of a few white men
                    on the border, would really never accomplish anything save to intensify the
                    feeling between the races. While never comprehending the great forces of
                    civilization and of the government which he was resisting, he steadily kept in
                    mind that a handful of naked savages at the Prophet's Town would avail
                    him nothing; that in order to effectively strike he must have back of him a
                    substantial body of warriors recruited from all the confederated tribes, well
                    victualled, armed and equipped, and equal in number to the armies of his
                    adversary. He knew the Indian character well enough to know that they would
                    never long resist a superior force. If he could keep his rash and impulsive
                    brother in leash long enough to form a permanent and powerful league, then he
                    had hopes of ultimate success. But there was the great danger, in fact, the very
                    peril that finally engulfed him. The Prophet, with that fatal egotism of the
                    fanatic, vainly imagined he was more than a match for the governor, and in the
                    absence of his brother, let his vindictive hate and malice destroy the last
                    dream of empire.
            In the latter part of the month of June, 
                        Harrison
                     sent 
                        Dubois
                     and Brouillette to the Prophet's Town to take note of what
                    was going on. They reported that while the tribes of the Mississinewa, the Weas
                    and Kickapoos were living in expectation of trouble, that there was no immediate
                    danger,  for the defection of the tribes at
                    the 
                        St. Joseph
                     had upset the plans of the brothers. On the 4th of July, however,
                    four canoes, filled with the Prophet's followers, passed the Wea
                    village at 
                        Terre Haute
                    , and 
                        Harrison
                     sent out the militia to discover what had become of them.20 One of these canoes came down the river to a Shaker
                    settlement sixteen miles above 
                        Vincennes
                    . The Indians there attended meeting on Sunday, the Prophet
                    professing to believe in the Shaker creed, and then finished the day's
                    proceedings by stealing five horses. They made no attempts to conceal their
                    tracks, but the governor stopped any pursuit, as he "had been informed
                    some time before, that one of their plans to bring on the war, was to send out
                    parties to steal horses, and, if they were pursued, to kill their
                    pursuers." This was plainly the work of the Prophet. More alarming
                    stories came in. It was said that the Sacs and Foxes were awaiting the signal
                    from the Prophet to take up arms; that a party of them had visited the British
                    superintendent, and that Elliott had said to a 
                        Miami
                     at Maiden: "My son, keep your eyes fixed on me
                    —my tomahawk is now up—be you ready, but do not strike
                    till I give the signal."21
                    
                        Harrison
                     in the light of all these events, determined to send Barron, his
                    trusted interpreter, to the Prophet's Town. The reception of Barron is
                    thus dramatically related: 
                        He was first conducted ceremoniously to the place where the Prophet,
                            surrounded by a number of Indians, was seated. Here he was left standing
                            at a distance of about ten feet from the Indian prophet. "He
                            looked at me," said Mr. Barron, "for several minutes,
                            without speaking or making any sign of recognition, although he knew me
                            well. At last he spoke, apparently in anger. "For what purpose
                            do you come here?" said he, "Brouillette was here; he
                            was a spy. 
                                Dubois
                             was here; he was a spy. There is your grave; look on
                            it!" The Prophet then pointed to the ground near the spot where
                            I stood.22
                  
                    
            
            No harm was done him, however. Tecumseh interceded and the governor's
                    messenger was finally received with respect. Barron delivered a speech of 
                        Harrison
                    's to the Prophet in the presence of Tecumseh. The purport
                    of this address

                     was that while the governor said he believed
                    that there had been an attempt to raise the tomahawk, that the old chain of
                    friendship between the Indians and whites might still be renewed; that there
                    were two roads open, one leading to peace and the other to misery and ruin; that
                    it was useless to make war against the Seventeen Fires as their blue-coats were
                    more numerous than the sands on the 
                        Wabash
                    ; that if complaint were made as to the purchase of the Indian
                    lands, that the governor was willing to send the principal chiefs to 
                        Washington
                     to make these complaints to the President in person; that
                    everything necessary for the journey should be prepared and a safe return
                        guaranteed.23
            
            On this visit Barron held much personal converse with Tecumseh and lodged with
                    him in a cabin. He professed to be much pleased with 
                        Harrison
                    's speech, observing that he had not seen him since he was
                    a young man seated at the side of General 
                        Wayne
                    . He disclaimed any intention of trying to make war, but said that
                    it would be impossible to remain on friendly terms with the 
                        United States
                     unless they abandoned the idea of trying to make settlements
                    further to the north and west, and unless they acknowledged the principle that
                    all the lands were held by the tribes in common. Said he: 
                        The Great Spirit gave this great island to his red children; he placed
                            the whites on the other side of the water; they were not contented with
                            their own. but came to take ours from us. They have driven us from the
                            sea to the lakes, we can go no further. They have taken upon them to say
                            this tract belongs to the Miamis, this the Delawares, and so on, but the
                            Great Spirit intended it as the common property of all. Our father tells
                            us, that we have no business upon the 
                                Wabash
                            ; but the Great Spirit ord-dered us to come here and here we
                            will stay.24
                  
                    
            
            Tecumseh now resolved on that famous meeting with the governor at 
                        Vincennes
                    . 
                        Harrison
                     had long known that there were those in his midst who were inimical
                    to his purpose and who had opposed the purchase of the fall before, but he did
                    not learn until afterward the full extent of their treachery. It seems that
                    Tecumseh had been given to understand that about half of the population of 
                        Vincennes
                     was friendly to his cause. 
                  
                     23

                     24 Dawson, 
                                
                                    Harrison
                                
                            , 158.
               
                     An American had visited him during the
                    winter of 1809-10 who informed him that 
                        Harrison
                     had no authority whatever form the government to make the purchase;
                    that the governor had only two years more to remain in office, and that if
                    Te-cumseh could prevail upon the Indians to refuse their annuities under the
                    treaty until the governor "was displaced, as he would be, and a good
                    man appointed as his successor, he would restore to the Indians all the lands
                    purchased from them."25 How far these
                    representations may have deceived Tecumseh into the belief that he was dealing
                    with a man who was tottering to the fall, is not certainly known. He determined
                    at any rate to make a show of force. If the governor was a weakling who sat
                    insecurely in his seat, and was fearful of public clamor, here was an
                    opportunity to display that fact. As he remarked to Barron he had not seen the
                    governor since he was "a very young man" sitting at the side
                    of General 
                        Wayne
                    . The governor was younger in years than Tecumseh and no doubt the
                    Shawnee was disposed to regard him with contempt. To appear suddenly at the
                    capital of the white man with a band of armed warriors; to openly and haughtily
                    declare his purpose of resisting the pretensions of the governor to pour out his
                    insolence upon the heads of the chieftains who had dared to sell the
                    lands—what a grand culmination of all his plans this would be, if it
                    had the desired effect! There was nothing to lose, everything to gain. He
                    resolved to try it. Accordingly, on the 12th of August, there swept the river to
                    Fort 
                        Knox
                    , eighty canoes, filled with naked savages painted in the most
                    terrific manner. All of them were armed and ready for attack. At their head was
                    the great war-chief, described by Major George R. 
                        Floyd
                    , commandant at the fort, as "about six feet high,
                    straight, with large, fine features, and altogether a daring, bold looking
                        fellow."26 The conference with the governor was
                    appointed for the morrow.
            THE COUNCIL AT VINCENNES
            
            The great house of the governor at 
                        Vincennes
                     is situate inland from the 
                        Wabash
                     river about six hundred feet and 
                  
                     25 John Law, The History of 
                                    Vincennes
                                
                     , 90.
                  
                     26 Eggleston, Tecumseh,
                        181.
               
                     there formerly stood in front of this house
                    and next to the river a grove of walnut trees which afforded a gracious shade.
                    It was here, that on a bright sun-shiny day in August, the dramatic meeting
                    occurred between the Shawnee chief and Governor 
                        Harrison
                    . Local tradition has preserved a tale that the governor had
                    secreted in the great parlor of his house a company of one hundred well-armed
                    soldiers to provide against any treachery on the part of the red men, and
                    computations have been made to show that the room would accommodate that number
                    of infantry, but this story must be regarded with suspicion.27
            
            Tecumseh and his party seem to have arrived at the rendezvous in canoes and by
                    way of the river; he appeared on the scene with a retinue of forty warriors
                    accoutered in the elaborate costume of the ceremonial, with painted bodies and
                    feathered head-dress, and fully armed with war clubs and tomahawks. The chief
                    himself, invariably wore a simple dress of Indian tanned buckskin, with a mantle
                    of the same material thrown over the left shoulder. In his belt he carried an
                    elegant silver mounted tomahawk and a hunting knife in a leathern case.
                    "Tall, athletic and manly, dignified, but graceful," he stood
                    as the chosen exponent of his people's wrongs, ready to voice their
                    plaints in the "musical and euphonious" accents of the Shawnee
                        tongue.28
            
            A close observer of the savages of that day has stated that, "those who
                    have been familiar with the Indians of the northwest, when they were Indians,
                    and took sufficient interest in them as a race to study with care their customs,
                    laws and usages, are aware that when attending councils with other nations or
                    tribes, or with our agents, that they were always acting a part, a kind of
                    diplomatic drama."29 To Tecumseh the moment
                    appeared propitious. The time had arrived to put the youthful governor of
                    thirty-seven years to the test. 
                        Harrison
                     was attended by the judges of the supreme court; Gen. 
                        Gibson
                    , the secretary; Major G. R. 
                        Floyd

                        Jennings
                    ; there was also a large assemblage of citizens present, who had
                    been invited thither to hear what Tecumseh had to present. The stage was well
                    set, and the bold and insolent heart of the savage rose high.
            
                    As be came in front of the dais, an elevated portion of the place upon which
                        the governor and the oflicers of the territory were seated, the governor
                        invited him, through his interpreter, to come forward and take a seat with
                        him and his counsellors, premising the invitation by saying: "That
                        it was the wish of the Great Father, the President of the 
                            United States
                        , that he should do so." The chief paused for a moment,
                        as the words were uttered and the sentence finished, and raising his tall
                        form to its greatest height, surveyed the troops and the crowd around bim.
                        Then with his keen eyes fixed on the governor for a single moment, and
                        turning them to the sky above, with his sinewy arm pointed towards the
                        heavens, and with a tone and manner indicative of supreme contempt, for the
                        paternity assigned him, said in a voice whose clarion tones were heard
                        throughout the whole assembly: "My Father?—The sun is my
                        father—the earth is my mother—and on her bosom I will
                            recline"!30
               
                
            Thus the council opened. The governor, with a short sword at his side, seated on
                    the platform with his officers and advisers; the Indians in front of him seated
                    on the grass; to the left, the Pottawattamie chief, Winamac, with one of his
                    young men, extended on the green, and all about the eager and curious faces of
                    the crowd, now wrought up to a high state of tension by the sarcastic retort of
                    the Indian chieftain. The speech that followed, "was full of hostility
                    from beginning to end."31 Tecumseh began in a low
                    voice and spoke for about an hour. "As he warmed with his subject his
                    clear tones might be heard, as if ‘trumpet-tongued’ to the
                    utmost limits of the assembled crowd who gathered around him."32 He denounced with passion and bitterness the cruel murder
                    of the Moravian Indians during the Revolutionary War, the assassination of the
                    friendly chief Cornstalk, and other outrages, and said that he did not know how
                    he could ever be friends with the white man again; that the tribes had been
                    driven by the Americans ‘toward the setting sun, like a galloping
                    horse,’ and that they would shortly push them into the lakes where
                    they could neither stand nor walk; that the

                     white people had allotted each separate
                    tribe a certain tract of land so as to create strife between them, and so that
                    they might be destroyed; that he and his brother had purposed from the beginning
                    to form a confederation of all the tribes to resist any further encroachment of
                    the whites; that the Great Spirit had given all the lands in common to the
                    Indians, and that no single tribe had a right to alienate any particular portion
                    of it. He declared that the Treaty of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     had been made with the consent of only a few; that it was largely
                    brought about by threats of Winamac, and that a reluctant consent had been wrung
                    from the Weas because they were few in number. So fierce and vitriolic became
                    his abuse of Winamac that that chieftain primed his pistols and seemed ready at
                    any moment to take Tecumseh's life. The speaker went on to declare:
                    "that if the government would not give up the lands that were purchased
                    from the Miamis, Delawares, Pottawattamies, etc., that those who were united
                    with him, were determined to fall upon those tribes and destroy them. That they
                    were determined to have no more chiefs, but in the future to have everything
                    under the direction of the warriors;"33 that the
                    governor would see what would be done to the village chiefs who had sold the
                    land, and unless he restored it he would be a party to the killing of them.
            The bold and defiant attitude of the speaker, and the tone of insolence that
                    pervaded all his words, astonished even the governor. A weak or corrupt man
                    would have trembled in his place and been at a loss how to answer. Not so with 
                        Harrison
                    . All who knew him, says John Law, were willing to acknowledge his
                    courage, both moral and physical. He know that the Treaty of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     had been concluded under the instructions of government; that his
                    dealings with the tribes had been open-handed and fair, even with the
                    insignificant Weas of the lower waters; that the "unwarranted and
                    unwarrantable" pretensions of Tecumseh were made largely for their
                    effect upon the audience, and after Tecumseh's remarks had been openly
                    interpreted by Barron, he arose without tremor or hesitation to deny the
                    chief's assertions. He 
                  
                     33

                            ), August 25, 1810.
               
                     spoke no doubt with some degree of force,
                    for he undoubtedly understood by now that Tecumseh would never have given
                    utterance to many of his charges without entertaining a belief that they would
                    meet the approval of some traitorous faction of the assembly. He answered:
                        
                        That the charges of had faith made against our government, and the
                            assertion that injustice had been done the Indians in any treaty ever
                            made, or any council ever held with them by the 
                                United States
                            , had no foundation in fact. That in all their dealings with
                            the red men, they had ever been governed by the strictest rules of right
                            and justice. That while other civilized nations had treated them with
                            contumely and contempt, ours had always acted in good faith with them.
                            That so far as he individually was concerned, he could say in the
                            presence of the "Great Spirit," who was watching over
                            their deliberations, that his conduct, even with the most insignificant
                            tribe, had been marked with kindness, and all his acts governed by
                            honor, integrity and fair dealing. That he had uniformly been the friend
                            of the red men, and that it was the first time in his life that his
                            motives had been Questioned, or his actions impeached. It was the first
                            time in his life that he had ever heard such unfounded claims put forth,
                            as Tecumseh set up. by any chief, or any Indian, having the least regard
                            for truth, or the slightest knowledge of the intercourse between the
                            Indians and the white men. from the time this continent was first
                            discovered. That as to the claim of Tecumseh that all the Indians were
                            but one nation and owned the lands in common, that this could not be
                            maintained; that at the time the white men arrived on the continent they
                            had found the Mi-amis in possession of the 
                                Wabash
                             that the Shawnees were then residents of 
                                Georgia
                            , from which they had been driven by the Creeks; that the
                            lands in question had been purchased from the Miamis who were the
                            original owners of it; that if the Great Spirit had intended that the
                            tribes should constitute but one nation, he would not have put different
                            tongues in their heads, but taught them all to speak a language that all
                            could understand, that the Miamis had been benefited by the annuities of
                            the government and that the Seventeen Fires had always been punctual in
                            the payment of them; that the Shawnees had no right to come from a
                            distant country and control the Miamis in the disposal of their own
                                property.34
                  
                    
            
            An event now took place, that but for the quick presence of mind and decisive
                    action of the governor, might have terminated in bloodshed. 
                        Harrison
                     had taken his seat and Barron had interpreted his reply to the
                    Shawnees, and was turning to the Miamis and Pottawattamies, when Tecumseh
                    excitedly sprang to his feet and told Barron to tell the governor that he lied.
                    Barron, who as a subordinate in the

                     Indian department, had great respect for his
                    superiors, was seeking to mollify the harshness of this language, when he was
                    again interrupted by Tecumseh, who said "No! No! Tell him he
                        lies!"35 The governor noticed
                    Tecumseh's angry manner, but thought he was seeking to make some
                    explanation, when his attention was directed to Winamac who was cocking his
                    pistol, and a moment later, General 
                        Gibson
                    , who understood the Shawnee language, said to Lieutenant 
                        Jennings
                    : "Those fellows intend mischief; you had better bring up
                    the guard." In an instant all was confusion. The warriors on the grass
                    sprang to their feet brandishing their war-clubs and tomahawks; 
                        Harrison
                     extricated himself from his chair and drew his sword to defend
                    himself; Major 
                        Floyd
                     drew a dirk, and the Methodist minister Winans ran to the
                    governor's house, got a gun, and stood by the door to protect the
                    family. Such of the Citizens as could armed themselves with brickbats. In the
                    midst of this turmoil the guard came running up and were about to fire on the
                    Indians, when 
                        Harrison
                     quickly interposed and commanded them not to do so. He now demanded
                    a full explanation, and when the intemperate words of Tecumseh were explained,
                    told him he was a bad man and that he would hold no further communication with
                    him; that as he had come there under the protection of the council fire, he
                    might go in safety, but that he must immediately leave the neighborhood. The
                    firm stand and commanding attitude of the governor at once quieted the storm,
                    and Tecumseh and his followers leisurely withdrew and retired to their camp.
                    That night two companies of militia were brought in from the country, but no
                    trouble occurred, and the time passed quietly until the morning.
            It was a part of the local tradition of later years, that when Tecumseh called
                    the governor a liar, that quick as a flash, he arose to his feet, drew his sword
                    and was about to resent the insult, when his friends interfered and prevented
                    the blow.36 This story seems improbable, from the fact that
                    the governor was aware that there were many unarmed citizens present, and that
                    any rash or inconsiderate

                     action on his part would precipitate a
                    conflict that could only end in blood and carnage. He knew, moreover, that
                    Tecumseh, by all the rules of civilized intercourse, even among open
                    belligerents, was entitled to protection while engaged in council, and it is not
                    probable that as brave a man as 
                        Harrison
                     would violate these rules by becoming the aggressor. Instead, by
                    quick word of command, he recalled the excited chief to his senses, dismissed
                    him at once, and averted a catastrophe.
            In the solitude of his camp that evening Tecumseh was forced to acknowledge
                    defeat. The young governor instead of quailing had remained firm—it
                    was plain that he was chosen plenipotentiary of his government in all the
                    treaties that had been effected. Moreover, in his reply, the governor had not
                    only emphatically repudiated all insinuations of unfairness towards the red men,
                    but had put the chief himself on the defensive by showing that he was an
                    interloper who sought to control the rightful possessions of others. At the
                    last. it was the stolid savage who lost his self-control, and the governor, who
                    by his respect for the laws of the council fire, had brought the flush of shame
                    to the chieftain's cheek. That night, as he afterwards admitted at Fort
                    Meigs, he felt a rising respect in his breast for the first magistrate of the
                    Territory. He was doomed in after years to associate with the cowardly and
                    contemptible Proctor, whom he called a "miserable old squaw,"
                    but from the day of this council he paid the involuntary tribute that one brave
                    man always pays to another, though ranged on a hostile side.37
            
            Thoroughly convinced that his conduct of the day previous had been highly
                    impolitic, the chieftain, at the dawn of day, sent for Barron, and said that he
                    desired a further interview, declaring that he had no intention of attacking the
                    governor on the day before, and that he had been advised to pursue the course he
                    did on the counsel of certain white men; disclosing to Barron the circumstances
                    heretofore related as to the visit of certain persons at the Prophet's
                    Town who had said that the governor had no right to make the purchase of the
                    lands on the 
                        Wabash
                    ; that he was unpopular

                     and would be removed from office, and that
                    then the lands would be restored. The governor would not receive Tecum-seh,
                    however, until due apology had been made through the interpreter; and ample
                    provision was made for the protection of the citizens by ordering the local
                    company of Captain Jones to parade morning and evening and hold themselves ready
                    for instant action. The governor also took the precaution to be well armed, as
                    did several of his friends.38
            
            At this second council, Tecumseh's whole demeanor was changed. While
                    remaining "firm and intrepid, he said nothing that was in the least
                    insolent." He now disclosed in open council what he had theretofore
                    told Barron as to the visits of the white men, and again declared that he had no
                    intention of harming the governor. 
                        Harrison
                     now informed the chief that he was about to cause a survey to be
                    made of the New Purchase, and desired to know whether this process would be
                    attended with any danger. Tecumseh at once replied that he and those affiliated
                    with him were determined "that the old boundary line should continue,
                    and that the crossing it would be attended with bad consequences." His
                    words were severally confirmed by a Wyandot, a Kickapoo, a Pottawattamie, an 
                        Ottawa
                     and a Winnebago, who each openly avowed that their tribes had
                    entered into the Shawnee confederacy, and that Tecumseh had been chosen as their
                    leader and chief.
            This second council does not seem to have been of great length. In it, Tecumseh
                    entirely abandoned any attempt at bluster, but firmly and positively stated to
                    the governor that he would not consent to the sale of the Indian lands, and that
                    any attempt to survey them would be met with resistance. This frank and open
                    statement, elicited a response equally frank from the governor. He told Tecumseh
                    that his claims would be transmitted in full to the President of the 
                        United States
                    , and the reply of the President at once communicated to him when
                    received, but that he was convinced that the President would never admit
                    "that the lands on the 
                        Wabash
                    , were the property of any other tribes, than those who had occupied
                    and lived upon them," and as these

                                    Kentucky
                                
                     , II, 483,
               
                     lands had been fairly and openly purchased
                    at Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , that the right of the 
                        United States
                     would be "supported by the sword." With these
                    words the interview terminated.
            That night the governor reflected. If the words of Te-cumseh as uttered in
                    council, were sincere and genuine, they amounted to an open declaration of
                    war—the government must either entirely recede from the ground it had
                    taken, and restore the lands, or prepare for the coming conflict. Concerning
                    this issue there must be no doubt. The governor therefore resolved to repair to
                    the headquarters of Tecumseh in person, and there, removed from the atmosphere
                    of a council, hold private intercourse with the chieftain and read his
                    intentions. He had hit upon this expedient once before in the proceedings at
                    Fort 
                        Wayne
                     and the experiment had proven successful. Accordingly, the
                    following morning, throwing aside all considerations of personal danger, he
                    suddenly appeared at the tent of Tecumseh, accompanied only by the interpreter
                    Barron. He was most politely and respectfully received. Proceeding at once to
                    the main point, he asked the chief if the declarations he had made in his two
                    public interviews were his real sentiments. Tecumseh answered that they
                    certainly were; that he had no grievance against the 
                        United States
                     except the matter as to the purchase of the Indian lands, and that
                    he would go to war with very great reluctance; that if 
                        Harrison
                     would prevail upon the President to give back the lands, and
                    promise never to consummate any more purchases without the consent of all the
                    tribes, that he would be the faithful ally of the Americans and assist them in
                    all their wars with the British. "He said he knew the latter were
                    always urging the Indians to war for their own advantage, and not to benefit his
                    countrymen; and here he clapped his hands, and imitated a person who halloos at
                    a dog, to set him to fight with another, thereby insinuating that the British
                    thus endeavored to set the Indians on the Americans." He said further
                    that he had rather be a friend of the Seventeen Fires, but if they would not
                    accede to his demands that he would be forced to join the English. The memory of 
                        Wayne
                    , the commanding figure and dauntless courage of the present
                    governor had had their  effect; compared to
                    the vile and sneaking agents of the British government, who, in the security of
                    their forts, were offering bounties for American scalps, and urging the Indians
                    to a predatory warfare, the American leaders stood out in bold relief as both
                    men and warriors. Tecumseh recognized this, but the die was cast and his
                    purposes were unchangeable. Stripped of all its savage propensities, the heart
                    of the Shawnee was really of heroic mold. Concerning that great principle of the
                    survival of the fittest he knew nothing; of the onrushing forces of civilization
                    and progress he had no just comprehension; but as the rising sun of the new
                    republic appeared, he saw the light of his race fading into obscurity, and
                    patriotically resolved to stand on his lands and resist to the last.
                    Misinformed, misguided, he sought an alliance with the British, to stem the
                    tide; instead of delaying, this but accelerated the decline of the tribes.
                    Tecumseh, when it was too late, discovered that the promises of the British
                    agents were false, and soon after his death the feeling engendered against the
                    tribes, on account of their alliance with the English and the many atrocities
                    they had committed, drove them beyond the 
                        Mississippi
                    . But he who fights for his native land and from devotion to a
                    principle, however wrong, must always be entitled to the respect of the brave.
            If coolness and courage had had its effect on the one hand, the candor and
                    honesty of his adversary, when met face to face, had also moved the governor. In
                    after years, in an address before the Historical Society of 
                        Ohio
                    , Harrison said: "I think it probable that Tecumseh
                    possessed more integrity than any other of the chiefs who attained to much
                        distinction."39 He now repeated again that he
                    would forward to the government all the propositions of the chief, but that
                    there was little probability that they would be accepted.
                    "Well," said Tecumseh, "as the great chief is to
                    determine the matter, I hope the Great Spirit will put sense enough into his
                    head, to induce him to direct you to give up this land. It is true, he is so far
                    off, he will not be injured by the war; he may still sit in his town and drink

                                    Harrison

                     his wine, whilst you and I will have to
                    fight it out." The conference ended with an appeal by 
                        Harrison
                    , that in the event of war, no outrages should be committed on women
                    and children and those who were unable to resist. This, the chief manfully
                    acceded to, and said he would adhere to his promise.
            Thus ended this remarkable conference participated in by the two greatest figures
                    then in the western world. The one representing the advancing tide of
                    immigration that was to build the cities and plow the fields of a new empire;
                    the other representing the forlorn hope of a fast decaying race that was soon to
                    be removed from the pathways of civilization.
            Those who have vainly sought to make it appear that 
                        Harrison
                     afterwards wrongfully passed over the northern boundary line of the
                    new purchase to provoke a fight and bring on a conflict, have certainly scanned
                    the records of this council at 
                        Vincennes
                     with but little care. The truth is, that the two principal figures
                    in that affair, parted each other's company fully realizing that
                    hostilities were at hand. To say that 
                        Harrison
                     was bound to sit helplessly in his capital while his enemies
                    gathered a force sufficient to overwhelm him, and all without a move on his part
                    to avert a calamity, but illustrates the foolishness of the whole contention.
                    Immediately on the breaking up of the council, Tecum-seh departed with a portion
                    of his braves to organize and cement a federation of the tribes; 
                        Harrison
                    , in the meantime, ordering an additional body of troops under
                    Captain Percy Cross at 
                  Newport,
                            Kentucky
               , to come to
                    the relief of the settlements, and redoubling his vigilance to avoid the
                    surprise of a sudden attack. Without hesitation, however, he wrote the surveyor
                    general to make a survey; the lines to be run under the protection of the
                    military.
            The governor was informed by the Weas, that during the progress of the
                    proceedings, they had been urged by four persons at 
                        Vincennes
                    , whose names they furnished, to join the Prophet and insist upon a
                    return of the lands. False representations were also made to the chiefs of this
                    tribe that the purchase at Fort 
                        Wayne
                     was made without the consent  or
                    knowledge of the President, and that a council of the Miamis had been called on
                    the Mississinewa, to make a full inquiry. The treasonable designs of this
                    coterie came to naught. Whether British agencies were actually at work within
                    the town, or whether the actions of this clique were prompted by the jealousy of
                    the governor's political enemies, will probably never be fully known.
                    Be that as it may, like all cravens of their kind, when the danger became
                    imminent, they slunk out of view, and 
                        Harrison
                     found himself surrounded by the brave and valorous of every
                    settlement, both in the vicinity of 
                        Vincennes
                     and on the borders of 
                        Kentucky
                    .
            Much conjecture has been indulged in, as to whether Te-cumseh actually meditated
                    an attack at the time of the first council. That his impulsive action might well
                    have led to disastrous consequences, but for the cool, quick command of the
                    governor may well be conceded, but that he formed any premeditated design before
                    coming to the council, must admit of some doubt. The reasoning of Drake
                    possesses cogency. He states that Tecumseh's probable purpose in
                    attending the meeting with a considerable force was to 
                        Make a strong impression upon the whites as to the extent of his
                            influence among the Indians, and the strength of his party. His movement
                            in the council may have been concerted for the purpose of intimidating
                            the governor; but the more probable suggestion is, that in the
                            excitement of the moment, produced by the speech of the governor, he
                            lost his self-possession, and involuntarily placed his hand upon his
                            war-club, in which movement he was followed by the warriors around him,
                            without any previous intention of proceeding to extremities. Whatever
                            may have been the fact, the bold chieftain found in Governor 
                                Harrison
                             a firmness of purpose and an intrepidity of maimer which
                            must have convinced him that nothing was to be gained by an effort at
                            intimidation, however daring.40

            THE M'CORMICK FAMILY AS PIONEERS
            (From a letter by M. C. Martz, of Arcadia, Ind., to Chauncey
                    Langdon, dated May 26, 1916.)
            THE history of the McCormick family can be traced back to an
                    early period in 
                        Scotland
                    . When the trouble arose between the Established Church and the
                    Presbyterian Church in 
                        Scotland
                     the McCormicks on account of persecution emigrated to the northern
                    part of 
                        Ireland
                    . They remained there for a while and later emigrated to America and
                    settled in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and 
                        Virginia
                    . John McCormick, Sr., a member of this family, was born near
                    Winchester, 
                        Virginia
                    , August 30, 1754. The records of the War Department show that he
                    enlisted three times during the Revolutionary struggle for independence, his
                    service continuing during the greater portion of the war. After the close of the
                    war he moved his family to 
                        Ohio
                    , but later to Indiana while it was yet a part of the Northwest
                    Territory, settling where the city of 
                        Connersville
                     now stands. His death occurred April 18, 1837. Catherine McCormick,
                    his wife, died February 22, 1862, at the age of ninety-three years. After the
                    death of her husband she was pensioned as the widow of a Revolutionary soldier.
            John McCormick, Jr., the founder of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , was the fourth child; his birth occurred September 15, 1791. In
                    the year 1811 he was married to Bethiah Case, of near 
                  Hamilton, Ohio
               . Soon after their marriage the second war with
                    Great Britain broke out and, like his father of Revolutionary fame, he also took
                    up arms in defense of his country. After the close of this struggle he and his
                    wife moved to the home of his father near 
                        Connersville
                    , Indiana. He remained there until the year 1820, when, with the
                    assistance of his brothers, James and Samuel McCormick, and nine men to cut the
                    trail, he moved his family to the present site of 
                        Indianapolis
                     and  built his cabin on the
                    banks of 
                        White
                     river. Before the stream could be crossed it was necessary to make
                    a canoe or dugout, which was "hastily constructed from a tree near the
                    river. In a few weeks after settling here, Mr. McCormick built a ferry which
                    afforded other settlers coming in an easier way of crossing. After operating the
                    ferry for a few years he moved up the river and built a mill on the river, just
                    opposite Crown Hill cemetery, operating the same until his
                    death. While the men who accompanied Mr. McCormick were assisting in building a
                    cabin the family lived in the wagons. They were kept warm by keeping huge piles
                    of logs burning. After the cabin was completed James and Samuel McCormick with
                    the men who accompanied them returned to 
                        Connersville
                    , and the family remaining did not see the face of a white person
                    until some time in March, when James McCormick returned with his family.
         
         
         
            Reviews and Notes
            
               The First Century of the Public Schools of 
                            Tippecanoe County
                        . By BRAINARD HOOKER, County Superintendent, 
                        Lafayette
                    , 1916.
            THIS is a historic and pictorial review of school work of 
                        Tippecanoe
                     county. The most attractive feature of the book to an outsider is
                    the illustrations. First are pictures representing the past—a
                    grist-mill, a saw-mill, 
                        Harrison
                     Monument, Fort Ouiatenon, Soldiers' Home,
                    Prophet's Rock, the Last Wooden Bridge, etc. Then comes a series of
                    school-houses, first a log house, then a box house with the boards on end
                    (French fashion), then the weatherboarded cottage style, then the red brick, and
                    last are the pictures of eighteen modern buildings built since 1907. Sketches of
                    the principal educators are given, as well as short accounts of the evolution of
                    the various schools of the county. A set of maps shows the organization of the
                    townships of the county. Altogether, it is a very appropriate little centennial
                    volume—just about enough reading to explain the illustrations and
                    just about enough pictures to illustrate the reading.
         
         
            
               History of 
                            Hancock
                         County, Indiana. By GEORGE J. RICH-MAN, B.L. William 
                        Mitchell
                     Printing Co,, 
                        Greenfield
                    , Ind., 1916. $5.00.
            THE author in this book has achieved what he states in his
                    preface was his aim—`to trace the growth of the county from a
                    wilderness to what it is today." Throughout the book the past is set
                    over against and compared with the present. In the illustrations the old
                    courthouse is pictured with the new; the old county seminary with a modern
                    school; the old church with the new; the old Masonic temple with the new; the
                    old pioneer with the modern descendant. The 815 large pages constitute an
                    endcyclopedia of information concerning  the
                    county, arranged in readable order. The general history of the county is
                    followed by that of the townships. The social phases of the history, education,
                    military annals, politics, temperance, literature, the legal and medical
                    professions follow, and most interesting are the many biographical details woven
                    in. There are no paid biographies. List of county and townships officers are
                    given. Fraternal and benevolent societies, commercial companies, the
                    newspapers—in short, there is so much that one is surprised at the
                    activity of modern society. As a history of a typical Indiana county, 
                        Hancock
                     offers a fine field for sociological and historical study. Mr.
                    Richman has done a favor for his county which will be appreciated as long as the
                    descendants of its present inhabitants live there.
         
         
            
               Bulletin No. 8 of the Indiana Historical Commission, December,
                    1916, contains the record of the celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of
                    Indiana's admission into the Union. The celebration took place in the
                    state house at 
                        Indianapolis
                     December 11, 1916. The centennial address was delivered by Prof.
                    James A. Woodburn. His theme was "The Foundations of the
                    Commonwealth." The theme was a favorite one and the address was
                    entirely worthy of the occasion. Hon. William Dudley Foulke of 
                        Richmond
                     read a centennial ode full not only of patriotic fervor but of
                    poetic qualities.

            THE
                    German-American Annals for December, 1916, contains a valuable
                    article for Indiana history by Dr. Preston A. Barba, of the German faculty of
                    Indiana University. The article is entitled "The General Swiss
                    Colonization Society." This society was organized in 
                        Cincinnati
                     in 1857. In this same year, through the agency of Judge Elisha M. 
                        Huntington
                    , 4,000 acres were purchased and the city of Tell City laid out. The
                    article is a contribution to American history as well as to Indiana history. Dr.
                    Barba had access to many of the company's records, loaned him by the
                    city of Tell City.

            THE
                    Catholic Historical Review for January has a general review of
                    the last century of the Catholic church, under the title of "Loss and
                    Gain Problem 1800-1916," by Rt. Rev. J. F. Regis Canevin, D.D., and an
                    article by Joseph Magri, M.A., D.D., on "Catholicity in 
                        Virginia

            THE
                    Smith College Studies for January, 1917, is taken up entirely
                    with the correspondence between George Bancroft and Jared Sparks. The latter was
                    editor of the North American Review and the former was the
                    reviewer for historical literature. Many letters are given showing the relation
                    between editor and reviewer in that day. It may be observed that that day has
                    passed with most reviewers and magazines.
            MR. FRANK N. DUNCAN of 
                        Bloomington
                     presented to the survey a unique volume of political literature. It
                    consists of all the campaign documents used by the Republican State Central
                    Committee in the campaign of 1888. The documents, sixty-eight in number, were
                    bound for I. N. Huston.
            ONE of the most interesting books that have come to the survey
                    is a History of Lewis Township, 
                            Clay
                         County, Indiana, written by the teachers and pupils of the
                    township schools, arranged and edited by Miss Eunice Asbury, also one of the
                    teachers. The volume consists of 109 pages printed double  column. The material was first published in the 
                        Brazil
                    
                    News∗ Democrat. There are
                    thirteen chapters, the first two being given to the history of the township and
                    its geology, and the others to the fourteen school districts. Lists of teachers,
                    trustees, squires and preachers are given; accounts of churches, stores, creeks
                    and other neighborhood places of interest. The style, English and general
                    arrangement of the book are excellent. It is not necessary to be told that thiB
                    formed a very pleasant diversion for the teachers and pupils, There is evidence
                    that at least some composition work in the schools has been enjoyed. The News-Democrat is to be congratulated in cooperating with the
                    children. Nor must mention be omitted of Mr. Woodrow's poem,
                    "Fishin' on Briley Crick." It has the Hoosier
                    sentiment.

                    an article on "Commercial Aspects of the

                     Santa Fe Trade," by Thomas M.

            IN the January Indiana Alumni Quarterly Dr.
                    James A. Woodburn continues his historical sketches of Indiana University. The
                    article deals with the gloomy period after the fire of 1854. A page picture of
                    the new (1855) building is given. Frederic Truedley (1878) also writes
                    reminiscently of his college days.
            THE
                    
                  
                            Indianapolis
                         Star, December 3, 1916, contained a two-column account of
                    the Shaker foundation on Shaker 
                  Prairie, Sullivan
               
                    county, Indiana. The settlement was established in 1805 and lasted till the
                    Civil war period. The community  resembled
                    the Rappites of 
                        New Harmony
                     in many ways. On account of their friendship with the Prophet they
                    were regarded with some suspicion during the War of 1812 when the American
                    soldiers destroyed or carried away a great deal of their property.
            THE Indiana Historical Commission announces the publication of
                    five volumes of Indiana historical material. These will be welcomed by the
                    people of Indiana not only for the books themselves, but as the beginning of a
                    movement that will make the material of Indiana history more available. The
                    commission ought to insist on better binding and better paper in the next
                    volumes. The State of Indiana cannot afford to advertise its poverty so widely.
                    Reviews of these volumes will appear later.
