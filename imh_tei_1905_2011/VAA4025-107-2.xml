                    <p>During the opening decade of the nineteenth century, two towns on the
                         Northwest frontier stood in apparent opposition to one another. Native
                         Americans established Prophetstown as a haven against the cultural assault
                         of European Americans. European Americans, in the meantime, colonized

                         in what they saw as a bountiful wilderness surrounded by savages. This
                         simple dichotomy, however, fails even to scratch the surface of the complex
                         story of the divisions and factions that beset both communities. As the two
                         communities divided internally, they also moved toward overt conflict with
                         each other. The violence that eventually erupted between the Americans and
                         nativist Indians at the Battle of Tippecanoe in November 1811 was as much a
                         product of intra-community factionalism as it was of the increasingly
                         violent relationships between Indians and non-Natives on the frontier.

                              >Vincennes</settlement></placeName> gains particular importance in
                         contrast with other recent scholarship. Patrick Griffin argues that ideas
                         of innate racial difference crystallized in the northern Ohio River Valley
                         in the three decades after the end of the Seven Years War, largely as the
                         result of the polarizing effects of constant violence and warfare.
                         According to Griffin, white frontier settlers grudgingly recognized their
                         common racial heritage with the revolutionaries in the East and sacrificed
                         some of their autonomy in exchange for protection from the new government.
                         Peter Silver, in his study of residents of the middle colonies, finds that
                         they also developed a common racial identity because of shared
                         victimization from Indian attacks. Both historians highlight the
                         construction of late eighteenth-century Indian and European American racial
                         identities based upon frontier violence between the two groups. In
                         contrast, I argue that the concept of shared victimization was also
                         constructed by European Americans in order to marginalize other European
                         Americans. In <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808"
                              reg="Vincennes">Vincennes</settlement></placeName>, American frontiersmen used issues surrounding
                         Native Americans and Prophetstown as the basis for attacks against their
                         political and social rivals; they showed equal or even greater concern with
                         defending their individual honor and their conflicting national visions
                         than with protecting their town or their shared racial identity.<hi

                         Prophetstown were as important to the development of racial ideologies, as
                         was the frontier violence that developed between American Indian and
                         European American communities.</p>
                    <p>Intra-community factionalism was nowhere more apparent on the Northwest
                         frontier than at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808"
                              reg="Vincennes">Vincennes</settlement></placeName> during the early 1800s. Located on the Wabash
                         River about 180 miles southwest of Prophetstown, Vincennes was not merely
                         an outpost of European American civilization. It was a community riven by
                         divisions, and as the factions contested with one another, they seized upon
                         the image of Prophetstown for their own political and economic purposes.
                         Such behavior was most apparent in their contest over the legal and moral
                         justifications for allowing slavery in the territory. Unable to compromise
                         over the role of slavery in the development of the territory, the Americans
                         began fighting each other for control of territorial politics in order to
                         institute their policies. Much of this debate focused on William Henry
                         Harrison&apos;s governance and policies-in particular, his handling of
                         Indian affairs. Eventually, Harrison and his supporters would attack his
                         political opponents by identifying them with Prophetstown, continually
                         connecting them with Tenskwatawa, his brother Tecumseh, and their militant
                         designs on Vincennes. The Harrisonians&apos; attempts to silence their
                         adversaries failed; instead the rhetoric amplified perceptions of a
                         militant Prophetstown and intensified native-white antagonisms that were
                         ultimately unleashed in the Battle of Tippecanoe.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                         While historians have analyzed the violent relationship that developed
                         between Vincennes and Prophetstown during the early 1800s, this article
                         examines the extent to which the resulting bloodshed between Indians and
                         Euro-Americans was a product of the factionalism that prevailed within
                         Vincennes.</p>
                    <p>Although the territorial dialogue treated slavery as a national issue, the
                         dispute was local in substance. The territorial government established in

                         than 5,000 Anglos in 200,000 square miles. Most of the twenty territorial

                         connections to the outlying settlements. Settlers&apos; security rested
                         fundamentally on their ability to maintain peaceful relationships with
                         nearby Indian communities and to <list type="footnotes">

                         sway.</p>
                    <p>Slavery, legally prohibited by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, persisted in
                         the region after 1800: in part, because the French and Indian residents had
                         a long-standing practice of owning slaves, but also because territorial
                         governors like Arthur St. Clair and Harrison did not enforce its
                         prohibition. The federal government during the early republic lacked the
                         necessary machinery to regulate and check territorial governments.
                         Territorial governors enjoyed great power and expected to benefit from
                         their posts. Andrew Cayton argues that they were &quot;frontier potentates,
                         legally responsible only to the president of the <placeName><country
                              key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country></placeName>, who
                         appointed them to office in the first place.&quot;<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                         Such power meant that governors had no real impetus to do away with the
                         institution of forced labor—an institution that benefited them as major
                         landholders. Harrison&apos;s failure to enforce Article Six of the
                         ordinance risked no political repercussions because Thomas Jefferson was
                         not about to fire a fellow Virginian with whom he shared similar political
                         and racial ideals. Harrison also enjoyed an absolute veto over all
                         territorial legislation; he appointed the territorial judges and secretary
                         and thus controlled the opposition to slavery in the courts.<hi rend="sup"

                              reg="District of Columbia">Washington, D.C.</settlement></placeName>, which they used to defend their
                         territorial vision. Benjamin Parke, Thomas Randolph, Elihu Stout, and
                         William Henry Harrison were proslavery men who hoped to overturn Article
                         Six of the Northwest Ordinance or at least pass a law restricting its
                         application in the territory. From 1804 to 1808, Parke served as the
                         territory&apos;s attorney general, a position held thereafter by Thomas
                         Randolph, a first cousin to Thomas Jefferson. Stout, originally from
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007565" reg="New Jersey">New
                         Jersey</region></placeName>, had migrated to the territory from

                         territorial printer in 1803. These four men represented Harrison&apos;s
                         core group of supporters and defended the governor&apos;s stance on slavery
                         as well as his policies toward the local Indians. They hoped to force the
                         Indians out of the territory by purchasing their lands, and then to open up
                         the area to slaveholders in order to spur settlement.</p>
                    <p>The anti-Harrisonians, while from divergent backgrounds, shared the belief
                         that slavery would undermine American labor and prevent the settlement of
                         the territory, and they disagreed with Harrison&apos;s Indian policy
                         because it seemed to punish the Indians for defending their property. One
                         of the influential leaders in this anti-Harrison faction was Swiss
                         immigrant John Badollet, who in 1804 had been appointed as register for the
                         new territorial land office. Besides Badollet, the most influential of
                         these men were Nathaniel Ewing, Dr. Elias McNamee, Judge John Johnson,
                         William McIntosh, and Jonathan Jennings. Ewing was the receiver of public
                         monies, McNamee a doctor in town, Johnson a territorial judge, and Jennings
                         worked with Stout before he became the territorial representative in
                         Congress. McIntosh had moved to the territory after fighting with the
                         British during the Revolutionary War, and had served as the territorial
                         treasurer until 1804.</p>

                         developing economic structure in the territory. Most of the Americans owned

                         environment gave independent laborers better opportunities because it was
                         conducive to small-scale manufacturing and farming, which dominated the
                         economic landscape in the region. Most American residents opposed the
                         legalization of slavery in the territory because it would provide incentive
                         for individuals to buy vast tracts of land while also undercutting the need
                         for hired help, thereby replacing free labor with slaves. Those who
                         supported slavery tended to own more land and stood to benefit from the
                         increased use of slave labor. They hoped that slaves and large-scale

                         this, the public rhetoric regarding slavery does not. Many European
                         Americans circumvented the Northwest Ordinance&apos;s ban on slavery by

                         indentures. Other residents found slavery in any form to be directly

                         responsive to their views. Congress ignored their petitions, which left the

                         when they began mobilizing for territorial elections. The rhetoric of the

                         refashioned larger political ideologies and leaders in local terms.
                         Associations with Jefferson played well among the voters of the territory,
                         who increasingly feared the aristocratic tendencies of the Federalists. As
                         the 1809 election neared, the anti-Harrisonians focused on differentiating
                         pro-Harrison candidate Thomas Randolph from his cousin Thomas Jefferson.
                         McNamee and Badollet saw Randolph&apos;s political principles as
                         &quot;diametrically opposite to those of Jefferson.&quot; McNamee even
                         called Harrison a Federalist, recalling his role as a delegate to Congress
                         from the Northwest Territory and relating how Harrison spoke in favor of
                         Federalist principles like the need for a standing army and advocated
                         &quot;most of the extravigant measures of John Adams&apos;s
                         administration.&quot; McNamee also reminded people that it was Adams who
                         had &quot;made [Harrison] governor of <placeName><region type="state"

                         Badollet, like other anti-Harrisonians, spoke of maintaining &quot;free and
                         independent men&quot; in the territory; another of his fellows argued that
                         &quot;in the stocking of our country with herds of negroes the now poor
                         would become indigent, because in proportion as the negroes increase in our
                         territory, the price of labor will assuredly decrease,&quot; causing the
                         &quot;hard working poor white man who now earns 50 cents per day to support
                         himself and family&quot; to be displaced by the slave earning no more than
                         25 cents. Slavery, he continued, would &quot;tarnish the fame of our
                         growing country, hitherto held up as the asylum of freedom!!&quot; In
                         opposition, loyal Harrisonian Parke claimed that slavery was necessary in
                         the territory because a class of laboring poor did not exist in the area.
                         Residents were &quot;too proud and independent to be day
                         labourers.&quot;&apos; Slaves were like spinning machines and printing
                         presses—they were tools necessary for the advancement of industry and the
                         creation of a competitive and open market. If one restricted invention and
                         progress, one courted aristocratic autocracy. Legalizing slavery allowed
                         Americans to shape their own futures by creating the tools through which
                         they could succeed. Parke argued that God had ordained slavery by favoring
                         slave owners Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and he vowed to &quot;unmask [the]
                         gentlemen&quot; who opposed the institution so that the public could

                         slavery, but the results left the issue unsettled. The election was
                         extremely close—Jonathan Jennings, an antislavery advocate and friend to

                         refused to recognize the results, exacerbating the factionalism already

                         called for a six-part investigation of the governor in an attempt to negate
                         his reappointment. At the same time, John Johnson authored an article in
                         <hi rend="i">The Western Sun</hi> claiming that Harrison had dissolved the territorial
                         assembly when it failed to meet his expectations. Johnson&apos;s article
                         echoed similar accusations offered by McNamee in a letter to the president
                         of the Senate. The anti-Harrisonians recognized the governor&apos;s right,
                         under the Ordinance of 1787, to dissolve the assembly, but felt that he had
                         abused his power. In response, the Harrisonians sent Johnson&apos;s article

                    <p>Following the election, Harrison approached Badollet after discovering that
                         he had circulated an antislavery petition throughout the territorial
                         counties. Their heated discussion dampened what had been a sociable
                         relationship. Harrison took personal offense to the petition and
                         remonstrated against Badollet in a letter to Albert Gallatin, who was not
                         only Badollet&apos;s longtime friend, but also an influential diplomat
                         during his service as secretary of the treasury for Thomas Jefferson and
                         James Madison. The governor related his demand that Badollet explain his
                         actions, also writing that such an explanation was &quot;Not given &amp; a
                         distant &amp; Cold politeness Succeeded to our former intimacy.&quot;
                         Claiming a desire to protect Badollet, Harrison wrote that he had
                         &quot;prevented a petition being Sent from this County Signed as I am Sure

                         Randolph was an influential Virginian congressman and a supporter of
                         slavery. Harrison hoped that his claim to such a connection might
                         intimidate Gallatin. Moreover, the governor claimed that Ewing had
                         &quot;said some time since at a tavern that [Gallatin] had informed him
                         that Mr. J. Randolph [second cousin to Jefferson] was known to be entirely
                         under British influence... &amp; may probably have communicated it to his

                         Randolph. To Harrison, Badollet was now an enemy. To Badollet, Harrison was
                         a &quot;Moral cameleon&quot; with a &quot;nefarious and impolitic project
                         of introducing slavery into this Territory ... whereby he has greatly

                    <p>Badollet&apos;s petition was just one element of a broader anti-Harrisonian
                         campaign. Before the election, the antislavery men had allied with the

                         would win division from Indiana Territory and construct a government more

                         The governor&apos;s opponents, including Badollet and Ewing, saw this as a

                    <p>The motives of the local Indian communities were increasingly at issue.
                         Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh adamantly opposed the continued westward
                         settlement of whites, but this opposition did not necessarily translate
                         into a predisposition for war and violence. Mounting a war against the
                         Americans or even attacking <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808"
                              reg="Vincennes">Vincennes</settlement></placeName> was unlikely simply because the
                         settlers at Prophetstown lacked the unity, resources, and numbers to
                         maintain a prolonged conflict. Still, while Prophetstown may not have been
                         gearing toward war during this period, violence between Indians and whites
                         was relatively common. Fearing that a new Indian community would only
                         exacerbate frontier violence was a logical conclusion given past incidents
                         in the region. However, the polarized political atmosphere in
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808" reg="Vincennes">Vincennes</settlement></placeName>, in
                         particular the debate over how Harrison handled Indian affairs, made the
                         growth of Prophetstown after 1808 a flashpoint.</p>
                    <p>Harrison had already demonstrated that he could deftly use his powers as
                         governor to expand American interests while marginalizing his political
                         rivals. Now he used the threat of an Indian war to challenge those
                         residents of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808"
                                   reg="Vincennes">Vincennes</settlement></placeName> who had
                         undermined his authority and, he charged, exacerbated an already tense
                         situation with local Indian communities. Blaming his enemies for Indian
                         depredations was an easy way for the governor to undermine any support they
                         may have had in the territory. After several Wabash Indian communities
                         declined to meet the governor during the fall of 1809, Harrison addressed
                         the General Assembly at <placeName><settlement type="city"
                              key="tgn_7018808" reg="Vincennes">Vincennes</settlement></placeName>, spreading the impression that, in
                         Badollet&apos;s words, &quot;[he] had met with difficulties in his

                         his political foes had failed to stop his policies in the assembly and had
                         then, in order to destabilize the governor&apos;s leadership, convinced the
                         local Indians to reject his attempts to negotiate treaties.<hi rend="sup"

                    <p>As the factional strife became associated with differences over Indian
                         policy, the participants became more agitated, sometimes turning to

                         McIntosh suffered superficial cuts to his face, but Randolph was not so
                         fortunate. McIntosh stabbed him in the back, leaving him close to death for
                         several days. The vulgar rhetoric that had characterized the newspaper
                         debate spilled out into the streets, reflecting the extent to which
                         violence had replaced a balanced discussion of the issues.</p>
                    <p>The physical confrontation between the factions coincided with more rumors
                         that the anti-Harrisonians had attempted to undermine treaty negotiations
                         with the local Indian communities. Colonel John Small reported that
                         &quot;some abandoned profligate, in the garb of an American, attempted to
                         frustrate, entirely, the treaty.&quot;<hi rend="sup">31</hi> This report,
                         which reinforced the fear propagated by Harrison in his speech to the
                         territorial assembly, may have been a ploy to discredit the governor&apos;s
                         political enemies. According to Small, someone had informed the
                         discontented Indians that the President of the <placeName><country
                              key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country></placeName> did not agree
                         to the 1809 Treaty of Fort Wayne, the signing of which Tecumseh and
                         Tenskwatawa had refused to attend. Some residents of the territory believed
                         that Harrison had negotiated it only to &quot;retrieve his declining
                         popularity,&quot; while others hoped to interrogate the men involved to
                         learn the truth of what had transpired. When questioned about his sources,
                         Small named Elias McNamee. When confronted, McNamee &quot;said, that he had
                         never told colonel Small any such thing!!!&quot;<hi rend="sup">32</hi> The
                         Harrisonians attributed McNamee&apos;s denial to yet another opposition
                         trick. Rather than arrive at any sort of conclusion on the issue, the
                         factions began using the information against each other.</p>

                         re-appointment to his office. People throughout the Ohio Valley and the

                         was still widely popular throughout the region. Stout owed his job to the
                         governor, but he also shared Harrison&apos;s political ideals and feared

                              rend="sup">36</hi> McNamee characterized Harrison as a man motivated
                         by profit, not by a desire to protect the citizens of the territory.
                         Although the anti-Harrisonians lacked proof to substantiate their claims,
                         they continued to brand the governor&apos;s Indian policy as corrupt.
                         Harrison was aware of McNamee&apos;s attempts to undermine him and his
                         supporters. In November 1809, he wrote to Gallatin—a letter that departed
                         from his typical professional and diplomatic tone. He attacked Badollet,
                         Ewing, McIntosh, and others, in fear that their letters and complaints had
                         helped to delay his reappointment, already several months late.<hi

                              rend="sup">38</hi> The territorial election committee had declared
                         unanimously that Governor Harrison lacked the authority to hold the
                         territorial election from which Jennings had emerged victorious. After
                         making his case, Randolph left the federal capitol confident that Congress
                         would overturn the election and give him the advantage over Jennings for
                         the next election; however, the House of Representatives refused to do
                              so.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Jennings was astonished by the efforts of
                         his &quot;great enemy the Govenor&quot; to overturn the election, but
                         Randolph&apos;s protest made sense in the context of the changing political
                         atmosphere ushered in by the election of 1809.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> By

                              secretary of the treasury under both Thomas Jefferson and James
                              Madison. Because of his influence, he received correspondence from

                    <p>Political changes in the territory greatly curtailed the powers of the
                         governor while extending the franchise to more white men. By 1812,
                         according to Andrew Cayton, &quot;a centralized, vertical system of
                         politics&quot; had transformed &quot;into a decentralized, local
                              system.&quot;<hi rend="i">42</hi> Control of the territory now rested
                         more with its inhabitants than with the governor and the officials in
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7015717"

                         Cayton refers to these democratic openings as the &quot;revolution of
                         1808-1810,&quot; which culminated in Harrison&apos;s wartime resignation in
                         1812. Although federal policymakers may have wanted to replace Harrison for
                         his politics, they could not ignore his success in actively aiding
                         territorial expansion and especially in making <list type="footnotes">

                         Harrison, despite the changing political climate, because the governor
                         still had many influential supporters in the region, including several
                         French traders who helped him maintain his influence with the various
                         nearby Indian communities.</p>
                    <p>By the spring of 1810, fears surrounding events at Prophetstown began to
                         trump the slavery debate in <hi rend="i">The Western Sun</hi>. That spring,
                         tales of western tribes—including the Sac, Fox, and Kickapoo—visiting
                         Prophetstown spread throughout the countryside, alarming countless
                              settlers.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Harrison called Badollet to a meeting
                         and told him that the Prophet intended to attack <placeName><settlement
                                   type="city" key="tgn_7018808" reg="Vincennes"
                                   >Vincennes</settlement></placeName>, kill the governor, and then
                         attack the other residents. The governor, Badollet later wrote,
                         &quot;painted his fears in lively colours and said that if it was not for
                         fear of spreading too great an allarm, he would immediately send his family
                         to <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky"
                                   >Kentucky</region></placeName> and convert his house unto a
                         fort.&quot; Although Badollet respected the intelligence concerning the
                         Indians, he noticed that most of the men present at the meeting were
                         Harrison&apos;s supporters, and he &quot;suspected a trap.&quot;<hi
                              rend="sup">45</hi> It appeared to Badollet that Harrison had
                         manipulated his followers into asking him to order out the militia so that
                         his actions would not appear heavy-handed.</p>
                    <p>Many residents of Vincennes favored sending a diplomatic mission to
                         Prophetstown, but Harrison asserted his right as territorial governor to
                         control diplomacy. Hearing rumors of a Native militancy, Toussaint Dubois,
                         one of the French traders trusted by both Harrison and Badollet, offered to
                         visit Prophetstown and inquire about Tenskwatawa&apos;s intentions. Despite
                         the fact that several public officials supported Dubois, Harrison decided
                         to send his own speech to the Prophet. In an impromptu meeting, Badollet
                         discussed the situation with Ewing and Judge Johnson. They all believed
                         &quot;that the alarm was unfounded,&quot; like the governor&apos;s previous
                         warnings, but they agreed to respect Harrison&apos;s authority on the
                         issue. Dubois said that he would go only &quot;if the Governor would send
                         him&quot; and Badollet accepted that answer.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Shortly <list>

                         from Ewing that the governor had ordered Judge Johnson to meet him at the
                         secretary&apos;s office. In front of several witnesses, Harrison &quot;in
                         an angry magisterial and insulting manner had called him to account&quot;
                         for his involvement with Badollet&apos;s faction. He accused the men of
                         treason and demanded that they abide by his decisions. Ewing said Harrison
                         &quot;exults in the idea that he will make us smart severely for our daring
                         perseverance in opposing his darling and never abandoned plan of
                              slavery.&quot;<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Harrison&apos;s opponents on the
                         issue of slavery had again provoked his anger, this time by questioning his
                         policies regarding Native Americans. The governor proceeded to use his
                         authority in Indian affairs to marginalize his political enemies. If the
                         majority of people believed that the Prophet was a militant threat, then
                         the governor could legally condemn those who opposed his policies.</p>
                    <p>In a letter to Gallatin, Ewing detailed the extent to which Harrison had
                         manipulated the Dubois affair. On the night of the meetings described
                         above, Ewing and Judge Johnson had been on their way to complete some
                         business at Colonel Francis Vigo&apos;s residence. They stopped at
                         Badollet&apos;s office for a few minutes, where the judge noticed McIntosh,
                         Antoine Marechal, P. Rieue, John Caldwell, Elias McNamee, John Johnson (the
                         judge&apos;s son), and a few others, all of whom had opposed slavery or the
                         governor&apos;s policies. Judge Johnson, in his own version of the events,
                         stated: &quot;The conversation turned on the common report of the Indians
                         being hostile it appeared to be the general opinion of those present that
                         there was no truth in the report which coincided with my own.&quot;<hi

                         intensify the charges and to marginalize opposition leaders, Harrison
                         convened a grand jury of twelve men to consider whether the secret meeting
                         had constituted treason. Three of the &quot;conspirators,&quot; including
                         Dubois (whom Harrison had referred to as &quot;one of the most respectable
                         Indian traders in this country&quot;), were grilled about the meeting and

                         not agree on an indictment, and thus, according to Badollet,
                         Harrison&apos;s &quot;diabolical plan&quot; was &quot;at last
                              disappointed.&quot;<hi rend="sup">53</hi> The Harrisonians, he noted,

                         private meetings for the purpose of adopting measures relating to the

                         Governor, than motives of public benefit.&quot;<hi rend="i">54</hi> The
                         governor&apos;s opponents were well within their rights to question
                         Harrison&apos;s policies toward the Indians of Prophetstown; even if the
                         caucus had gone too far, their actions in no way had earned accusations of
                         treason.</p>
                    <p>After witnessing the governor&apos;s tirade, Ewing found himself increasingly
                         fearful of the Harrisonians, even writing Gallatin for &quot;protection
                         against the persecutions of Governor Harrison.&quot; Ewing also worried
                         that Harrison had done little to protect the town if indeed the Indians
                         attacked. Although the governor &quot;raised a dreadful alarm of Indians
                         [and] drafted two companies of militia,&quot; he stationed them at the

                         wonder if Harrison&apos;s real intent was to protect his own home. Ewing

                         considered that the Prophet &quot;had effected more toward civilizing them

                         tried to isolate and attack his enemies rather than to negotiate. This
                         attitude was evident in his response to the territorial assembly&apos;s

                         brought into the territory. Badollet wrote to Jennings &quot;with a

                         however, produced a concomitant reaction from Harrison—a speech to the

                         treasonable correspondence between persons of this place and the indians,

                         finally by restating his previous conclusions. He offered no proof and
                         actually &quot;gave in writing an errata or correction of his

                         traitorous activity and warning &quot;that much mischief has been done by
                         others, who, actuated by no views that were inimical to their country, have

                         astray, and to do that which their cooler judgments must condemn. Whilst a
                         penal law would perhaps deter the former,&quot; he continued, &quot;it
                         would be the means, as an expression of the public sentiment, of reclaiming

                         fear that Madison might &quot;censure&quot; him.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> With
                         Harrison&apos;s support, Presbyterian Rev. Samuel T. Scott and Baptist
                         minister Alexander Devin formed a committee to draft a letter advocating an
                         attack on Prophetstown. Three members of the group were ministers or were
                         associated with missionary work, and Francis Vigo had acquired great
                         standing in the town after aiding George Rogers Clark in his campaign
                         against the British. Vigo and Luke Decker (a slave trader) were both
                         adamantly proslavery; Scott and Devin, accompanied by McClure, may have
                         hoped to court Harrison&apos;s favor in order to access federal funds for
                         their missionary work.<hi rend="sup">74</hi> Most of these men had a stake
                         in seeing Harrison and his policies succeed. The committee&apos;s completed
                         letter to President Madison claimed that the governor&apos;s measures
                         against the Prophet had stopped the &quot;destruction of this place, and
                         the massacre of the inhabitants.&quot;<hi rend="sup">75</hi> The
                         anti-Harrisonians viewed the committee as &quot;too ignorant to be
                         consulted on public measures&quot; because the men had not played any role
                         in policy decisions or diplomatic negotiations. Badollet described it as
                         &quot;one of the trics of our immaculate Governor,&quot; whom he accused of
                         using the committee members like puppets.<hi rend="sup">76</hi></p>
                    <p>Having spent several years negotiating treaties with Indian tribes in the
                         territory, Harrison recognized the extent to which his policies had upset
                         and in some cases polarized relationships between Indians and settlers. He
                         was worried especially by Tecumseh&apos;s trip to the southern states in an
                         effort to win support for the Prophet&apos;s efforts at Prophetstown.
                         Believing that Prophetstown was the logical result of this growing
                         polarization and that it represented an immediate threat to the region, the
                         governor moved to destroy the nativist settlement. However, he encountered
                         problems mobilizing an effective fighting force. By late October 1811, his
                         troops numbered less than 800 men—Indiana <list type="footnotes">

                         Harrison attributed this problem to his personal enemies, who had
                         &quot;united with the British agents in representing that the expedition

                         While laying the foundation for the fort, the regulars and militia argued

                    <p>Badollet was able to use his son Albert, a member of the militia, to spy on
                         their activities. Albert wrote his father a few times during the march
                         toward Prophetstown, expressing his own anxieties about the mission.
                         Reminding him that he was serving &quot;involuntarily&quot; and that he
                         possessed pure morals and &quot;conduct unlike that of many of [his]
                         age,&quot; John asked his son to keep a journal. &quot;I beseech you to do
                         it,&quot; he wrote, because &quot;it will be an useful exercise for you,
                         and will afford me a great satisfaction in reading your unsophisticated
                         reflections on the passing events.&quot;<hi rend="sup">82</hi> More
                         importantly, the elder Badollet requested that Albert &quot;note down <hi

                         [would] have the advantage of making time hang less heavily upon
                              [him].&quot;<hi rend="sup">83</hi> Given his actions during the
                         previous months, Badollet&apos;s insis- tence on his son&apos;s journaling
                         may have been part of a larger effort in his campaign to undermine the
                         governor.</p>
                    <p>Badollet and his supporters saw their fears realized in the attack on
                         Prophetstown and in the aftermath of the Battle of Tippecanoe. The battle
                         of November 1811 was only a minor disruption in a region divided by
                         discord. What appeared to be solely a racial struggle was in fact a far
                         more complicated event built upon factional relationships. As
                         Harrison&apos;s force marched back to <placeName><settlement type="city"

                              >Vincennes</settlement></placeName> with nearly 130 wounded, they
                         feared an attack from the many Indians who roamed the area. Soldiers had
                         burned Prophetstown to the ground, but they had also desecrated an Indian
                         burial ground, possibly inciting many neutral Indians. They returned to

                         sixty-two soldiers who had died on the field of battle. The death count
                         included Thomas Randolph. It was ironic that the violence at
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2033903" reg="Tippecanoe">Tippecanoe</settlement></placeName>
                         had resulted in the death of Randolph, who had been Jennings&apos;s main
                         challenger for territorial representative to Congress. Many
                         anti-Harrisonians believed that the governor&apos;s rhetoric about
                         Prophetstown had been the result of his frustration in not getting Randolph
                         elected, so that, in a way, Harrison&apos;s decisions had led to the death
                         of his ally.</p>

                         would die when the Indians counter-attacked, but such an attack never came.
                         Many of the neutral Miami had fled the area around Prophetstown, while
                         Indians from other tribes withdrew after watching their harvest and homes

                         together to mourn their dead, they spent the months following the battle
                         confronting each other. There was a funeral every day, sometimes two, as
                         injured soldiers died from their wounds. Each day reminded the residents
                         that they had paid a heavier price than the Indians, even though the
                         Americans had burned Prophetstown to the ground. Coffin processions were

                         passed, people began questioning the governor&apos;s leadership during the
                         late action, and some even wondered if their loved ones had died in vain.
                         Rumors spread throughout the territory that the militia had tried to
                         retreat during battle because of Harrison&apos;s ineffective leadership.
                         Almost two months later, reports surfaced that the Indians were resettling
                         Prophetstown. Residents of <placeName><settlement type="city"

                         wondered just who had benefited from the battle.</p>
                    <p>Within weeks, the factions began using the battle as a way to attack each
                         other. They had a well-established tradition of using territorial affairs
                         against each other, and the Battle of Tippecanoe proved no exception.
                         Badollet wrote that the &quot;little band of the Prophet and his brother,
                         were not a banditti&quot; but &quot;a set of orderly sober and industrious
                         men ... whom we have driven to despair, in spite of their repeated cries

                         Indians in an effort to end Harrison&apos;s governorship; now the regular
                         army had assaulted the governor. Harrison responded by trying to control
                         people&apos;s perceptions of the battle.</p>
                    <p>As the governor and his supporters worked to rally public opinion, John
                         Johnston, the Fort Wayne Indian agent, concluded that Native forces at
                         Prophetstown had been far fewer in number than Harrison&apos;s command.
                         Such a low estimate looked very bad, considering the much higher number of
                         Americans who had died. The imbalance demonstrated to the governor&apos;s
                         enemies that Harrison was indeed poorly equipped to lead a militia force
                         against the Indians and reinforced calls for his resignation. The governor
                         claimed that &quot;it is impossible to believe that there were less than
                         seven hundred Indians in the late action,&quot; an estimate that would have
                         made the American and Indian forces relatively equal. He questioned

                    <p>Similarly, some residents of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808"
                         reg="Vincennes">Vincennes</settlement></placeName> continued to invoke the Prophet as a

                         battle in Stout&apos;s newspaper. Convinced that he must defend Harrison,
                         Stout continued the fracas with an editorial of his own. After learning
                         that Colonel Boyd planned to travel east on a furlough (an undeserved trip
                         in Stout&apos;s eyes), Stout published an article that mocked Boyd&apos;s
                         leadership and commitment. The article closed with a highly inflammatory
                         and sarcastic paragraph: <quote rend="blockquote">We cannot withhold from
                              the Colonel our sense of his <hi rend="i">merit</hi> and the great

                    <p>Incensed at the articles and demanding vengeance, Boyd&apos;s party (which
                         consisted of several anti-Harrisonians) insisted that Stout reveal the
                         author of the article. When Stout refused, Boyd marched into his office
                         demanding to know the author&apos;s identity. Stout, with self-proclaimed
                         &quot;mildness and a smile&quot; answered: &quot;You may consider me as the
                              author!&quot;<hi rend="sup">94</hi> Boyd swung at Stout with his cane,
                         but the nimble printer grabbed Boyd and his stick and then beat him in
                         self-defense. Boyd&apos;s orderly, Josiah Bacon, seized Stout and tried to
                         restrain him, but militia Lt. Robert Buntin yanked Bacon away from the

                         central to their political identities. The people of <placeName><settlement

                         fear that the Indians at Prophetstown would strike. Few could have imagined
                         that the only substantive attack in <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_7018808" reg="Vincennes"

                         upon another. Understood in context, the violence at Stout&apos;s office
                         makes sense. Its underlying causes stemmed less from Prophetstown and more
                         from disputes surrounding <placeName><settlement type="city"

                         to the future of a republican nation. Would slavery be tolerated? Would
                         territories be governed by an autocratic governor and his council, or by
                         the larger white community? These were questions central to the political
                         and economic life at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808"
                                   reg="Vincennes">Vincennes</settlement></placeName> during the
                         early 1800s, and while territorial residents rightly questioned and even
                         feared Prophetstown, their understanding of the Prophet devolved within the
                         polarized political atmosphere of the town. While fear of an Indian attack
                         was certainly real, fear over the decline of the republican ideal was just
                         as present. Both fears co-existed at <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_7018808" reg="Vincennes"

                         understood the Indians at Prophetstown. As a result, Prophetstown came to

                         governance—issues that the Battle of Tippecanoe failed to settle.</p>

                         political factions further polarized regional relationships to such an
                         extent that room for any diplomatic measures quickly dissipated by 1810. As
                         a result, violence erupted at the Battle of Tippecanoe and with it came
                         strained and bloody relationships between white settlers and Native
                         Americans on the frontier. At a time when racial theory was gaining greater
                         acceptance, Americans were more likely to see that violence as a product of
                         their encounters with inherently inferior and violent American Indians,
                         rather than to recognize the complicated political factionalism that had
                         led to war in Indiana Territory.</p>

                    <p>Since the formalization of the National Collegiate Athletic
                         Association&apos;s enforcement powers in the early 1950s, Indiana
                         University has shown a general history of compliance with that
                         organization&apos;s rules. However, two discrete periods—the Phil Dickens
                         football era in the late 1950s and the Kelvin Sampson basketball era of

                         institutional control over the university&apos;s athletic department. The

                         citations for five major infractions, leading to NCAA-imposed penalties,
                         significant personnel changes in the athletic department, and the loss of

                         scandal of the late 1950s and its impact on the athletic department between

                    <p>The 1950s saw rapid change and growth in the organizational structure of
                         intercollegiate athletics. The NCAA&apos;s Sanity Code, implemented in
                         1948, set strict standards for adhering to amateurism, academic standards,
                         and recruiting. The most controversial and divisive of the new regulations
                         prohibited athletes from receiving financial aid on the basis of their
                         athletic ability. Scholarships could be given only on the basis of need and
                         could not exceed tuition costs. Athletes could also be paid for working
                         jobs. The code included an enforcement mechanism, but the only punishment
                         that could be rendered was expulsion from the NCAA.<hi rend="sup"
                         >2</hi></p>
                    <p>Southern schools refused to comply with the new regulations. In the East and
                         the Midwest, where jobs were readily available, the requirement that
                         athletes be paid through work was successful. But with fewer employment
                         opportunities available in southern states, colleges in that region viewed
                         the code as an attempt by powerful northern schools to decrease their power
                         and to control college athletics.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The Sanity Code was
                         short-lived. In 1950, seven schools were brought before the NCAA convention
                         for noncompliance. The membership did not produce the required two-thirds
                         majority vote to expel the schools, effectively rendering the code
                              useless.<hi rend="sup">4</hi></p>
                    <p>The failure of the Sanity Code and the rise of booster organizations working
                         closely with athletic departments to subsidize athletes created the need to
                         develop a financial aid system without implementing an <list

                         of that conference, but also demonstrated the need for establishing
                         standardized rules for recruiting student-athletes and distributing
                              grants-in-aid.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The NCAA levied significant
                         penalties against each institution, including an all-sports postseason ban
                         against three of the four PCC institutions. After the scandal was revealed
                         in 1956, the NCAA subsequently implemented full-ride scholarships for
                         student-athletes. Not only did the PCC scandal provide the impetus to
                         standardize financial aid policies, but it also showed the ability of the
                         NCAA to overcome regional politics and harshly penalize institutions in
                         violation of the rules.<hi rend="sup">7</hi></p>
                    <p>Aiding the NCAA in its efforts was the organization&apos;s success in
                         negotiating football telecasts and controlling postseason competition.
                         Possessing the ability to withhold television revenue and to prevent teams
                         or entire athletic departments from competing in NCAA championships, the
                         association, with an expanded staff, created a more effective enforcement
                              mechanism.<hi rend="sup">8</hi></p>
                    <p>The NCAA now faced the task of determining how to institute a fair system of
                         financial aid for athletes. In 1956, in the aftermath of the PCC slush fund
                         scandal, the association implemented full-ride athletic scholarships, which
                         allowed schools to pay for tuition, fees, and room and board, and provided
                         $15 per month for nine months of every school year. Executive director
                         Walter Byers reasoned that such scholarships would clean up college sports
                         by establishing a true standard of amateurism: athletes were receiving
                         money only for expenses; they were not being paid to perform on the
                         athletic field; and the institution was the sole entity providing funds.
                         Prior to the 1948 code, players had received payments directly from
                         boosters and alumni for their performance on the field. The association

                    <p>By the late 1950s, the NCAA had emerged as the primary investigative and
                         enforcement agency in collegiate sports. While regional differences and the
                         power of individual conferences had undermined previous efforts to
                         establish national rules and reforms, and while some conference
                         commissioners still attempted to thwart NCAA investigations or conducted
                         separate investigations, the association was able to transcend regional and
                         conference politics and apply a relatively standard enforcement program on
                         all members of the association. Ultimately, the NCAA won the power struggle

                    <p>From its new position of power, the NCAA permitted conferences some leeway in
                         implementing its new financial aid policies. The Big Eight Conference, for
                         example, granted one-year full-ride scholarships; the Southwest Conference
                         granted four-year full-ride scholarships; the Ivy League offered no
                         athletic scholarships; and the Big Ten Conference initially implemented
                         one-year need-based aid to replace the previous job-based program.<hi
                              rend="sup">11</hi> At a special conference meeting in August 1956,
                         faculty athletics representatives and athletic directors discussed whether
                         to adopt full-ride or need-based scholarships, or to continue the job-based
                         program. The Big Ten decided to base its financial aid on the expected
                         ability of a student-athlete&apos;s parents to pay for college expenses.<hi

                         increased the conference&apos;s administrative workload, but also because
                         it hindered the ability of conference schools to recruit the best athletes
                         within the rules. Because other major football conferences had implemented

                         package at schools in other conferences, including some conferences that
                         offered four-year scholarships instead of one-year renewable
                              scholarships.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Recognizing the Big Ten&apos;s
                         noble yet naive attempt to implement a unilateral need-based aid system,
                         former NCAA head Walter Byers noted that, &quot;competing schools laughed
                         at the Big Ten as they mined the lode of athletic talent in the Big Ten

                         the option of cheating and staying competitive or following the new rules
                         and losing. In 1956, a Big Ten committee recognized that &quot;the most
                         profitable football programs, such as Michigan&apos;s, would have the money
                         to obtain blue-chip talent, and the want-to-be&apos;s would have to resort
                         to underhanded methods.&quot;<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Duffy Daugherty, head
                         football coach at Michigan State University from 1954 to 1972, later
                         reflected with humor on the years of need-based aid by honestly admitting,
                         &quot;We had need once, as you know, and we don&apos;t want to have to
                         cheat again.&quot;<hi rend="sup">16</hi> A Big Ten recruiter at the time
                         admitted, &quot;Let&apos;s face it. We all do a little bit for the kids on

                    <p>Big Ten schools may have believed that they were forced to break the
                         conference financial aid policy. Doubtless, some institutions offered
                         illegal payments in order to win games. The success of the Big Ten in
                         interconference football during the years of need-based aid can be
                         attributed partially to illegal payments, but it is also important to

                         institutions, IU relied on its alumni and boosters to identify, contact,
                         and recruit prospective student-athletes. These and other representatives
                         of an institution&apos;s athletic interests were expected to serve two
                         critical functions. First, NCAA rules required that the representative make
                         the initial home contact with a prospect; athletic department staff could
                         not make a home visit until the scholarship was signed. Second,
                         representatives were needed to finance each prospect&apos;s recruiting
                         visit to campus. NCAA rules, prior to 1959, prohibited schools from paying
                         for visits to campus. Big Ten athletic departments needed boosters even
                         after a tender had been signed, because the prospect could still sign with
                         another institution outside of the conference. Indiana athletic director
                         Frank Allen, in a letter to alumni and fans, urged his recruiters to
                         &quot;sell the boy on the overall, worldwide prestige which Indiana
                         University and her alumni have attained in the education, professional, and
                         business world.&quot;<hi rend="sup">20</hi></p>
                    <p>A final element in the problems that unfolded at IU was the rapid rate at
                         which NCAA and conference rules were changing at the time. Coaches
                         sometimes intentionally violated the rules, believing that current rules
                         would soon change and therefore they did not need to comply with them.<hi

                         system would soon be adopted.</p>

                    <p>Indiana&apos;s recruiting philosophy was shaped by its football fortunes.
                         From 1900 through the 1956 football season, IU had experienced a history of
                         losing. With only seven winning seasons in conference play and one
                         conference championship over the fifty-seven-year period, Indiana football
                         was clearly the doormat in the conference. The school&apos;s only
                         conference championship had come in 1945, when the playing field had been
                         leveled due to the number of players serving in World War II.
                         Indiana&apos;s last winning season had come in Bo McMillin&apos;s final
                         season as coach in 1947. Coach Clyde Smith compiled an 8-27-1 record
                         between 1948 and 1951, and Coach Bernie Crimmins compiled a 13-32 record
                         between 1952 and 1956. Alumni and boosters had long lamented Indiana&apos;s
                         lack of success in football, and they perceived recruiting as a major
                         problem. The heavy emphasis on basketball within state high schools and the
                         IU athletic department; the small number (less than 200) of state high
                         schools that fielded football programs, especially in southern
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>; and
                         the fact that there were three major college football programs within the
                         state—all these factors handicapped IU&apos;s ability to recruit talented
                         football players.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> In 1952, Big Ten commissioner
                         Kenneth &quot;Tug&quot; Wilson told IU athletic director Paul J. Harrell
                         that he was &quot;firmly convinced Indiana University is slowly digging its
                         own grave athletically in the state&quot; due to an emphasis on recruiting
                         players outside the state. Harrell&apos;s reply emphasized that there was
                         not enough football talent in the state to permit three major teams to
                         compete; that the best football programs took the best <placeName><region
                              type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> athletes;
                         and that, while it was not difficult to recruit 15 basketball players from
                         800 high schools, it was much harder to find enough football players from
                         the 157 Indiana high schools that had football programs.<hi rend="sup"
                              >23</hi> Clearly, a change in recruiting philosophy was essential for
                         Indiana to be successful in football.</p>
                    <p>Phil Dickens, hired in February 1957 after completing an undefeated season at
                         the University of Wyoming, brought his entire coaching staff with him to

                         Dickens&apos;s hiring was heralded as a major step forward for the IU
                         football program for two reasons. First, Dickens had been a highly
                         successful coach at Wofford College and Wyoming, with a career record of
                         69-27 and no losing seasons, and he was seen as <list type="footnotes">

                         department had proposed the construction of a new athletics plant north of
                         campus to replace the existing centrally located complex, which meant that
                         the football program needed to make money in order to finance the
                         construction of new facilities. The planned expansion also gave Dickens
                         additional incentives with which to recruit top players. The hire
                         complimented President Herman B Wells&apos;s 1956 four-step proposal for
                         improving athletics: hiring the best coaches, engendering new interest
                         among faculty and alumni, creating a student athletics committee, and
                         building new facilities.<hi rend="sup">24</hi></p>
                    <p>Coach Dickens&apos;s hiring coincided with implementation of the Big
                         Ten&apos;s need-based aid policy. Conference commissioner Wilson had the
                         difficult task of explaining the new rules to returning and newly hired
                         coaches. Wilson later claimed that he made a special effort to inform the

                         Dickens, however, knowing that Indiana was a difficult place to win and
                         that the entire conference faced a competitive disadvantage in recruitment,
                         blatantly disregarded the rules. In the first three months of
                         Dickens&apos;s coaching tenure, Wilson received reports of seventeen
                         violations by the IU football program. The reports typically stated that
                         the school was offering $50 per month or expense-paid travel between the
                         prospect&apos;s hometown and <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437"
                              reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement></placeName>. In other cases, athletes who had
                         been brought to IU and then visited another school reportedly asked why
                         they could not receive as good a deal as had been offered by the Dickens
                         staff. Wilson also received calls from high school coaches who reported
                         what their athletes had been offered on recruiting trips to Indiana. Even
                         though none of the offers was actually consummated, Wilson decided to make
                         a strong statement that the new financial aid policies must be followed.<hi
                              rend="sup">26</hi> As a result, he gave Indiana the option of
                         withdrawing from the conference or suspending Dickens for one year.<hi
                              rend="sup">27</hi> Wishing to retain its membership in the conference,
                         Indiana chose to forbid Dickens from performing any coaching-related
                         activities during the 1957 football season. Using the research conducted by
                         the Big Ten conference staff, the NCAA subsequently placed Indiana on
                         probation for one year.</p>
                    <p>In response to the conference penalties, university administrators admitted
                         that they had not adequately communicated the new financial aid rules to
                         their new football coaching staff. According to a statement released by
                         President Wells after the penalties were imposed, &quot;Indiana voted for
                         adoption of the new rules of the Conference. These rules became effective
                         almost coincident with the change by the University in its football
                         coaching staff. The new rules and a new staff which arrived late resulted
                         in much confusion and misunderstanding.&quot;<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Coach
                         Dickens echoed this sentiment, stating that &quot;I can say in good
                         conscience that if I was in violation of the rules in statements attributed
                         to me I was not aware of it, nor did I intend to violate the
                              rules.&quot;<hi rend="sup">29</hi></p>

                    <p>In order to avoid future problems with conference and national enforcement,
                         Indiana needed to fix the problems prevalent in the football program.
                         However, both athletic director Frank Allen and President Wells
                         underestimated the severity of the problem and the extent to which coaches
                         and boosters were willing to go to recruit the best players. Even though
                         Allen responded to the conference&apos;s punitive action by making several
                         administrative and structural changes to the department, the changes did
                         not go far enough to stop the culture of cheating that had infected the
                         football program.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> In an effort to eliminate
                         recruiting problems, the athletic department adopted a policy forbidding
                         coaches from discussing financial aid with recruits. That responsibility
                         would fall to newly hired administrative assistant Chris Dal Sasso, a
                         former IU football player who was designated as the only person in the
                         athletic department to discuss financial aid with recruits. The department
                         also hired Bob Dro, a member of the 1940 championship basketball team, to
                         serve as assistant athletic director in charge of rules compliance and
                         alumni groups.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, there was a major flaw in Allen&apos;s restructuring decision:
                         he had hired two administrators with deep ties to the university. What
                         Allen needed was an objective administrator willing to enforce the new
                         conference policies and to tell boosters and coaches when they stepped out
                         of line. Another missed opportunity to correct the problem can be traced to
                         the Board of Trustees. Following the 1957 season, rather than criticizing
                         the football program&apos;s recruiting violations, the trustees instead
                         declared that &quot;football must be raised to the competitive level which
                         the university has achieved with notable success,&quot; only heightening
                         the pressure to field a winning team.<hi rend="sup">31</hi></p>
                    <p>In 1957, IU struggled amidst the turmoil of Dickens&apos;s suspension. Under
                         the leadership of coach-in-charge Bob Hicks, the team finished its season
                         with one win and eight losses. After the disappointment of 1957, Coach
                         Dickens was reinstated; the subsequent football seasons were, by IU
                         standards, very successful. The team finished its 1958 season 5-3-1 overall
                         and 3-2-1 in the conference. After a surprising 8-6 victory at Michigan
                         late in the season, Dickens placed third in Coach of the Year <list

                         what would have been the game-winning touchdown in a 0-0 contest.<hi

                    <p>Indiana&apos;s success on the field in 1958 and 1959 brought further
                         investigation by the NCAA and Big Ten. The investigation and the resulting
                         penalties in 1960 are consistent with what some scholars have described as
                         the NCAA&apos;s &quot;cartel behavior,&quot; based on the
                         organization&apos;s use of probabilistic evidence—such as rapid changes
                         from losing to winning seasons—as a method to detect rules violations.<hi
                              rend="sup">34</hi> &quot;One would expect,&quot; write Arthur
                         Fleisher, Brian Goff, and Robert Tollison, &quot;to see enforcement and
                         punishment actions brought against members performing extraordinarily well
                         given their historical performance.&quot;<hi rend="sup">35</hi> This theory
                         partially explains the NCAA&apos;s interest in Indiana. Not only was IU
                         likely to be re-investigated based upon the one-year probation handed down
                         in 1957, but the football program also enjoyed too much success and
                         defeated the wrong schools in the following two years. The team&apos;s 1958
                         record was its best in eleven years; IU notched its first four-game win
                         streak in twelve years; it defeated West Virginia, a team that had averaged
                         over seven wins the past six seasons, 13-12 in <placeName><settlement

                         defeated perennial power Michigan on their home field.<hi rend="sup"
                              >36</hi> Just seven months after that victory, the NCAA officially
                         opened its investigation against the athletic department, which included
                         testimony from a West Virginia football player alleging that IU had made
                         illegal financial aid offers.<hi rend="sup">37</hi></p>

                         concerned that the NCAA would impose a blanket postseason ban—already
                         imposed on fifteen occasions over the previous five years. IU officials
                         trusted Wilson and appreciated his support. On July 31, 1959, Frank Allen
                         had written to faculty representative John Mee: &quot;Tug Wilson is
                         definitely a friend, cohort, and ally of ours in this instance. As a matter
                         of fact, Tug stated that he has investigated each one of the instances
                         under question by the NCAA and that he has cleared us of any suspicion or
                         improper actions.&quot;<hi rend="sup">41</hi></p>
                    <p>Third, IU officials emphasized that none of the recruits who allegedly
                         received offers of illegal financial assistance had actually attended the
                         university—two attended Purdue, one attended Clemson, and one attended West
                         Virginia. Additionally, they pointed out that their two most bitter
                         recruiting rivals, Purdue and Kentucky, were in the center of three of the
                         cited cases. The two recruits who had allegedly stayed at an alumnus&apos;s
                         home were attempting to escape the aggressive recruiting tactics employed
                         by Kentucky.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, IU emphasized that all of the alleged inducements were made by a
                         representative of athletics interests and not an athletic department staff
                         member. Indiana knew this was a weak defense that had not been accepted in
                         prior NCAA and conference decisions. Wilson had already written to Mee:
                         &quot;I am inclined to think that Bob Dro and Phil Dickens both feel it is
                         impossible to control alumni, but you will remember that in the Michigan
                         State case this was held a direct responsibility of the university, that
                         alumni are responsible to the institution, and where alumni are asked to
                         help recruit, they become in fact representatives of the
                              university.&quot;<hi rend="sup">42</hi></p>
                    <p>Fifth, IU pointed out that it had terminated the employment of the assistant
                         coach who used an alias and had dissociated itself from the alumnus who had
                         admitted to offering a suit of clothes to a recruit. Sixth, officials
                         questioned the methods employed by NCAA investigators, finding particular
                         fault with the interview of a student-athlete at West Virginia who had been
                         flanked by two of that school&apos;s assistant coaches during the interview
                         and maintaining that the young athlete <list type="footnotes">

                         contrary to what his coaches wanted him to say. Finally, President Wells
                         pleaded for penalties that would not devastate the university: <quote
                              rend="blockquote">I think it must be borne in mind that reputations of
                              educational dignity and purpose are inevitably affected adversely by
                              actions which certain of these processes contemplate... As an
                              institutional head who feels deeply his total responsibilities to and
                              on behalf of his University and higher education generally, my earnest
                              conviction that the vast powers of this body must be exercise[d] with
                              utmost discretion, a conviction which I am certain you share with
                                   me.<hi rend="sup">43</hi></quote></p>


                    <p>Despite the university&apos;s earnest attempt to defend itself against all
                         charges, the NCAA placed IU on a four-year probation, which included an
                         all-sports ban on television appearances and NCAA championship competition.
                         Further, the school was not permitted representation on any NCAA
                         legislative decision-making committees. The association justified its
                         penalties on several grounds.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Most importantly, five
                         of the six violations had occurred while Indiana was still on probation for
                         the 1957 violations.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Second, the NCAA concluded that
                         there was a close similarity between the offers made in 1958 and 1959 and
                         those made by the football staff in 1957. Third, the association determined
                         that the illegal offers were not the actions of outsiders acting
                         independently or of one assistant coach acting irresponsibly, but rather
                         were the result of a system of illegal aid orchestrated by the head coach.
                         Even if Dickens had not orchestrated the aid, the NCAA argued, as head
                         coach he was still responsible for the entire program. Fourth, the NCAA
                         concluded that the assistant coach cited in the violations could not have
                         set up the necessary alumni contacts without the help of the head coach,
                         because the assistant was on his first recruiting trip when the violations
                         occurred in 1958.</p>

                    <p>The Big Ten, based on its own investigation, presented its summary of
                         violations on June 6, 1960.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> The conference, which
                         examined a larger number of reported irregularities than the NCAA,
                         concluded that four recruits were offered and received illegal aid and then
                         withdrew from the university; that three recruits received illegal aid,
                         although no offer was established, then withdrew from the university; that
                         another five recruits were offered illegal aid but did not enroll; and that
                         three cases could not be resolved. Additionally, Big Ten investigators
                         reported that a considerable number of student-athletes interviewed during
                         the investigation believed that football players were receiving illegal
                         aid, and that six former student-athletes had referred to the existence of
                         sponsors, sugar daddies, and big daddies for athletes at IU.<hi rend="sup"
                              >47</hi></p>
                    <p>Indiana&apos;s response to the Big Ten&apos;s summary of violations was
                         similar to the one presented before the NCAA in April.<hi rend="sup"
                              >48</hi> President Wells emphasized that the Big Ten should take into
                         consideration Indiana&apos;s sixty-year membership in the conference, its
                         record of compliance with the rules, and its longstanding healthy attitude
                         toward athletics. Second, the university invoked the concept of double
                         jeopardy, reminding Commissioner Wilson of the severe punishment already
                         doled out by the NCAA. Third, administrators attacked the character and
                         credibility of the players who had brought charges, pointing out instances
                         in which these particular students had been in trouble with the law,
                         received poor grades, or had proven themselves to be dishonest during the
                         course of their enrollment. Wells noted in reference to one student who had
                         made especially fantastic claims, &quot;If a maladjusted, vindictive,
                         sadistic, and wholly unreliable individual ever tried to cause trouble for
                         a public institution, this character seems to be it.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                         illegally posed as FBI agents. Conference investigators had also claimed
                         that other schools were being investigated and had violated the rules, both
                         of which were untrue. On one occasion a student-athlete was interviewed
                         while under the influence of alcohol; the university also noted a pattern
                         of students simply agreeing with the line of questioning employed by the
                         investigator-a practice that led to both Big Ten and IU investigations
                         producing a large amount of conflicting evidence.</p>
                    <p>University officials also restated their opposition to disgruntled
                         student-athletes lodging allegations against the athletic department; Wells
                         argued that such students found it easy to accuse the school of making
                         illegal offers and payments because they held no loyalty to the
                         institution. Wells also urged the Big Ten to interview dissatisfied
                         student-athletes at other conference schools to see if they would turn
                         against their own athletic programs. Finally, Indiana argued that the
                         conference had violated basic principles of American justice by refusing to
                         allow the accused to face their accusers.</p>
                    <p>Despite IU&apos;s arguments and the intercession of Indiana Governor Harold W
                         Handley, Commissioner Wilson concluded that &quot;I have grave doubts any
                         such practices on the scale suggested by the cases at hand could possibly
                         have been carried on without the knowledge of and, indeed, the approval of
                         the football coaching staff.&quot;<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Based on the
                         evidence, the Big Ten placed Indiana on one year of probation and excluded
                         the school from sharing in television revenues from the 1960 season and
                         from counting the season&apos;s football games in the conference
                         standings.</p>
                    <p>Indiana University now faced the daunting task of repairing its tarnished
                         image and the reputation of its athletic department. The penalties levied
                         against the school adversely affected team performance, took a toll on the
                         athletic department budget, and caused a major structural overhaul of the
                         athletics administration.</p>

                         athletic teams were ineligible to compete in NCAA championships for four
                         years. Coaches in every sport were impaired in their ability to recruit the
                         best athletes; the IU swimming program was probably hurt most of all,
                         losing chances at three national championships. As Thomas Clark writes in
                         his history of IU: &quot;The wound of indiscreet football recruiting was
                         indeed deep and infectious, reaching out and denying a generation of top
                         quality athletes an opportunity to share in the glories of a conference
                         which laid great store by physical excellence.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                    <p>The overall performance of athletic teams at Indiana was only moderately
                         hampered during the probation years. In the four years prior to receiving
                         the all-sports ban from the NCAA, IU&apos;s baseball, football, basketball,
                         golf, gymnastics, tennis, and wrestling teams recorded a 133-137-7 record
                         (a .493 winning percentage) against Big Ten competition. During the
                         four-year probationary period, the same teams notched a 123-143-2 record
                         against Big Ten competition-a decline of just 3 percent in winning
                              percentage.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> However, the probationary status did
                         not affect the performance of the swimming and diving program. James
                         &quot;Doc&quot; Counsilman and Hobie Billingsley led that program to
                         perfection in conference competition, posting an undefeated record and
                         winning the Big Ten championship every year during probation.</p>
                    <p>Coach Doc Counsilman&apos;s status as a leader in the sport of swimming
                         attracted the top athletes in the world to IU.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> The
                         swimming program notched an undefeated dual-meet record from 1960-1964 and

                         finished third in 1959 and 1960, so it is safe to assume that Indiana could

                         disappointed. We&apos;ve been called the No. 1 college swimming team in

                    <p>The Big Ten penalties also significantly affected the athletic department
                         budget, creating a major financial shortfall at a critical point in the
                         development of the university&apos;s competitive athletics program. The
                         penalties were handed down at the same time that the new athletics plant,
                         constructed through the issuance of bonds at no cost to taxpayers, was
                         completed at a cost of $6 million. Conference penalties hampered the
                         athletic department&apos;s ability to repay the bonds in three ways. First,
                              <list type="footnotes">

                         from the 1960 football season cost the athletic department $70,000. Second,
                         as new athletic director Bill Orwig remarked, &quot;the penalties imposed
                         on us by the NCAA and the Big Ten was [sic] a consideration of financial
                         groups bidding on our bonds&quot;-increasing the interest rate on the bonds
                         and resulting in an additional estimated cost of $350,000 to the athletic
                              department.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Third, the poor performance of the
                         football program had a negative impact on gate receipts. From 1960-1964,
                         still under the leadership of Coach Dickens, Indiana won only three
                         conference games and six home games, and recorded a 11-34 overall record.
                         Average attendance during this time was 24,047, only 49 percent of the
                         stadium&apos;s seating and revenue-generating capacity.<hi rend="sup"

                    <p>To ensure future compliance with NCAA and Big Ten regulations, the IU
                         athletic department hired new personnel and implemented new policies.<hi
                              rend="sup">57</hi> As noted above, Bill Orwig replaced athletic
                         director Allen, who had retired after the NCAA investigations concluded.
                         Former basketball coach Everett Dean was hired to travel across the country
                         to speak to alumni and friends of the university about the penalties levied
                         against IU and to explain Big Ten and NCAA recruiting rules. From a policy
                         standpoint, the athletic department created and continually updated a list
                         of representatives of athletics interests, required that all names of
                         prospective student-athletes be given to the president, charged each head
                         coach with ensuring that all rules be followed, hired a former FBI agent to
                         spot-check athletes for offers of illegal aid, placed showcause orders on
                         offending staff members not in compliance with the rules, and dissociated
                         itself from representatives of athletics interests if a rules violation
                         occurred. Finally, Coach Dickens&apos;s contract was renewed following the
                         penalties, but was conditional upon strict adherence to the rules.</p>

                         Orwig stated that all stakeholders involved with the athletic program at IU
                         had been educated regarding the rules, and he indicated that each coach was
                         responsible for all the boosters associated with his program, but he did
                         not offer a clearly delineated plan for preventing the same recruiting
                         problems. Instead, the report implied that Indiana had learned its lesson
                         and would not be careless enough to go through the punishment again. Orwig
                         also offered the university&apos;s alumni a possible explanation for how
                         the rules violations had occurred: <quote rend="blockquote">Under the work

                              circumstantial evidence sufficient enough to perhaps indicate that a

                              or perhaps had a reasonable feeling they were occurring, but possibly
                              made no effort to curb them. However, this evidence is completely

                         personnel to guide its decision-making process, instead bringing in two
                         former athletes, in addition to athletic director Allen, himself a former
                         IU football player. Thus, the top three athletics administrators at the
                         university were former IU athletes, with strong personal ambitions to
                         achieve a winning football program.<hi rend="sup">61</hi></p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the structure of conference and NCAA financial aid,
                         enforcement, and recruiting policies, combined with Indiana&apos;s
                         historically poor performance in football, set the stage for the
                         infractions and subsequent severe penalties levied against Indiana between
                         1957 and 1964. The Big Ten&apos;s need-based aid policy placed each school
                         in the conference at a competitive disadvantage in relation to schools able
                         to offer full scholarships to prospective student-athletes. Big Ten
                         institutions, including Indiana, felt pressure to break the need-based aid
                         policy in order to stay competitive with conference and national foes.
                         National recruiting rules added another factor as each institution relied
                         upon its alumni, fans, and boosters to play a significant role in
                         recruiting prospective student-athletes. Allowing boosters to make the
                         initial home visitation with a recruit opened the door for illegal
                         inducements. The enforcement powers only recently attained by the NCAA-in
                         part due to its ability to control postseason championship participation
                         and television revenue-enabled the association to punish institutions in
                         violation of its rules. Big Ten leaders, for their part, wanted to prove
                         the need-based aid policy could work and needed to demonstrate that it
                         could investigate and punish those institutions in violation of the
                         policy.</p>

                    <p>In contrast to Coach Dickens in the 1950s, Kelvin Sampson inherited an
                         Indiana University men&apos;s basketball program that had, up until the
                         previous four seasons, enjoyed a long history of success: five NCAA titles,
                         one National Invitation Tournament title, one Collegiate Commissioners
                         Association title, and twenty Big Ten Conference championships. The
                         athletic department&apos;s firing of Bob Knight, the iconic and polarizing
                         head coach of the program from 1971-2000, resulted in considerable turmoil
                         among fans and alumni. His replacement, Mike Davis, proved unable to keep
                         the team competitive at its historic levels. During his final three years
                         as head coach, the Indiana program missed the NCAA tournament twice, and
                         Davis opted to resign effective at the end of the 2005-2006 season.</p>
                    <p>Against this backdrop, Indiana University hired Sampson, the longtime head
                         coach from the University of Oklahoma. Sampson had earned a reputation as a
                         hard-nosed defensive coach who had elevated the obscure programs of Montana
                         Tech and Washington State to respectability, and the previous decade had
                         seen Sampson&apos;s Oklahoma squads experience a good deal of success on
                         the court, including a Final Four appearance in 2002. Sampson had also
                         previously served as one of the chairs of the National Association of
                         Basketball Coaches ethics summit in 2003.<hi rend="sup">62</hi></p>
                    <p>Despite his impressive coaching resume, some saw Sampson&apos;s hiring as a
                         risk, due to allegations of NCAA rules violations during his tenure at
                         Oklahoma. The unusual circumstances surrounding the hire served to
                         highlight the lack of institutional order that would come to haunt the
                         program. Following the initial news that Sampson was IU&apos;s choice to
                         replace Davis, national media sources noted that Sampson and Oklahoma were
                         currently under investigation for impermissible phone calls to recruits.<hi

                         <pb n="147" id="VAA4025-107-2-065"/> then-President Adam Herbert vouched
                         for Sampson in a March 29, 2006, news release, calling Sampson &quot;the
                         right man to maintain and build upon IU&apos;s long and storied
                         traditions.&quot; Herbert went on to state his conviction that Sampson
                         understood the importance of IU&apos;s &quot;high academic expectations and
                         the core character values of the university.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                         >65</hi></p>
                    <p>Approximately one month after his hiring at Indiana, Sampson was found to
                         have made impermissible phone contact with potential recruits at Oklahoma,
                         and both Indiana and Sampson were placed on probation.<hi rend="sup"
                              >66</hi> The terms of the NCAA probation forbade the head coach from
                         making off-campus recruiting visits, placing phone calls to recruits, or
                         receiving performance-based salary increases.<hi rend="sup">67</hi></p>
                    <p>The investigation of Sampson&apos;s Oklahoma recruiting violations took place
                         at a time when the face of collegiate recruiting was changing. Technology,
                         particularly cell phones, and new media outlets, including text messaging,
                         Facebook, and Twitter, were beginning to play dominant roles in the
                         recruiting landscape. Just one week after the aforementioned sanctions were
                         announced by the NCAA, an investigative story by ESPN&apos;s &quot;Outside
                         the Lines&quot; portrayed Sampson and his staff as searching for new
                         methods of contact that were not affected by the imposed prohibition of
                         phone calls. This story did not document any infractions by Sampson or his
                         assistants, but it noted that the lack of a text-messaging ban had created
                         a significant loophole through which the head coach and staff could
                         continue recruiting.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> The NCAA would eventually move

                         their lack of control over the new media, the NCAA developed a heightened

                    <p>At the very least, the ESPN report on Sampson&apos;s search for new ways to
                         contact recruits should have engendered caution within the IU athletic

                         activities. So too should the NCAA report itself, which noted, among other
                         things, that Sampson had fostered an environment of &quot;deliberate 
                         non-compliance&quot; in his program at Oklahoma.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> However,
                         this time period also stands as one of the least dangerous times in NCAA
                         history for large athletic departments who were engaging in rule-breaking
                         activities. As noted in several articles in the popular press at the time,
                         the NCAA had established a troubling track record of swiftly and
                         unequivocally punishing schools with small athletic departments, while
                         failing to punish large programs.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> The association was

                         NCAA was uninterested in pursuing major violations. Athletics
                         administrators at IU may also have been encouraged by the fact that

                         The department self-reported these violations to the NCAA, fired an
                         assistant coach involved in the potential violations, and placed additional
                         restrictions on Sampson and his staff.<hi rend="sup">74</hi> The situation
                         came to a head in February 2008, when the NCAA served the Indiana
                         University athletic department with a notice of allegations, highlighting
                         five major violations that had occurred during Sampson&apos;s tenure at the
                         school. These allegations included a failure on the part of Sampson and two
                         of his assistant coaches to comply with the terms of Indiana&apos;s
                         probation, a series of impermissible phone calls placed by Sampson and an
                         assistant coach after the probationary period had expired, an effort by
                         Sampson to knowingly provide false information to investigators from both
                         the IU athletic department and the NCAA, the usage of a non-authorized
                         phone line for recruiting purposes by an assistant coach, and impermissible
                         recruiting contact with a prospective student-athlete by Sampson and an
                         assistant coach.<hi rend="sup">75</hi> Approximately two weeks after the
                         notice of allegations from the NCAA, Indiana University negotiated a buyout
                         of Sampson&apos;s contract and accepted his resignation as men&apos;s
                         basketball coach.<hi rend="sup">76</hi></p>
                    <p>In May, Indiana University submitted a response to the NCAA&apos;s notice of
                         allegations, wherein the school essentially agreed with the
                         association&apos;s findings on each of the violations.<hi rend="sup"
                              >77</hi> Athletics Director Rick Greenspan, who was involved in hiring
                         Sampson, announced a restructuring of the athletic department in the wake
                         of these allegations. Following a hearing in June, the NCAA added an
                         additional charge, alleging that the IU athletic department failed to
                         properly monitor the men&apos;s basketball program.<hi rend="sup">78</hi>
                         Greenspan subsequently announced that he would resign as athletic director

                    <p>On November 25, 2008, the NCAA Committee on Infractions publicly released its
                         report on violations that had occurred under the tenure of men&apos;s
                         basketball coach Kelvin Sampson. The penalties section of the report noted
                         that, while Indiana University had &quot;an almost 50-year history free of
                         major infractions,&quot; the failure to effectively monitor Sampson and his
                         staff, despite the former&apos;s prior violations at Oklahoma, warranted
                         the imposition of penalties.<hi rend="sup">80</hi> These penalties included
                         a three-year period of probation, a one-scholarship reduction for
                         men&apos;s basketball, and limitations on recruiting activity. Furthermore,
                         the infractions committee imposed a five-year &quot;show-cause&quot;
                         penalty against Sampson, effectively barring him from meaningful employment
                         with an NCAA member institution during that time.</p>
                    <p>As it had been in the 1950s, the impact of NCAA and self-imposed sanctions on
                         Indiana University athletics was crippling. While the Sampson-era
                         violations affected only the basketball program, the resulting poor team
                         performance has been historic. In the aftermath of the NCAA sanctions, six
                         players either transferred to different schools or were dismissed for
                         disciplinary reasons, and two key veteran players left college for the NBA.
                         Senior D. J. White was selected as the twenty-ninth pick of the first round
                         of the National Basketball Association draft by the Detroit Pistons;
                         leading scorer Eric Gordon left after his freshman year and was drafted
                         seventh overall by the Los Angeles Clippers. When former Marquette coach
                         Tom Crean took over as head coach in 2008-2009, the team had only one
                         returning player with any significant playing experience at Indiana. In
                         that season, the team finished 6-25 overall and 1-17 in Big Ten
                         competition. In Crean&apos;s first three years as head coach, the team won
                         less than 30 percent of its games and twice finished last place in the
                         conference. The two-year span immediately following the sanctions contained
                         the least number, and lowest percentage, of wins in the history of
                         men&apos;s basketball at the school, and it marked the first stretch since
                         1968-1970 that the team&apos;s winning percentage had fallen below 34
                         percent. This period also represented the first time since the 1968-1970
                         stretch that the basketball program did not participate in a postseason
                         tournament for two consecutive years.</p>

                    <p>The severity of the penalties was influenced in part by the occurrence of new
                         violations during a probationary period. The prior incidents did occur at a
                         different institution, but the NCAA noted that not only was IU fully aware
                         of these violations, by virtue of having sent representatives to the
                         Infractions Committee meeting for the Oklahoma case, but that the
                         university had also created a plan-based on these prior incidents-to
                         monitor Sampson and his staff. There are obvious parallels between the
                         infractions in the Sampson and Dickens cases: IU was fully conscious of
                         each coach&apos;s initial transgressions, yet was willing to vouch for his
                         supposed desire to play by the rules, ostensibly due to the school&apos;s
                         desire to field a winning program. Both cases unfolded within a period of
                         rampant cheating—without obvious ramifications—in college sports, as the
                         NCAA failed to enforce its rules successfully.<hi rend="sup">81</hi> It
                         requires no stretch of the imagination to assume that at least some of
                         Indiana&apos;s athletics decision-makers, in each case, may have felt that
                         the initial infractions were no worse than what was taking place at
                         competitors&apos; institutions, and that Indiana&apos;s status as a Big Ten
                         member and leading athletic program would shield it from major
                         penalties.</p>
                    <p>In both cases, the NCAA&apos;s reaction to the violations initially appeared
                         justified, based upon the occurrence of repeat violations by the same
                         coaches within a short period of time. However, upon further reflection,
                         both sets of penalties appear to have exceeded the actual violations
                         committed. The penalty handed down in the football case unfairly targeted
                         the entire Indiana University athletic department, for no apparent reason
                         other than that the other programs, and their student-athletes, had the
                         misfortune of sharing an athletic department with the football program. It
                         is difficult to imagine a similar approach to enforcement passing the
                         public muster in today&apos;s collegiate sports environment.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the basketball violations, the NCAA saw fit to punish Indiana
                         heavily for the same types of actions that Sampson had committed at
                         Oklahoma, yet chose to hand out major infractions to IU because the actions
                         were now repetitive in nature. Legitimate questions can be raised as to
                         whether the NCAA&apos;s decision to pursue major violations stemmed from
                         the severity of the violations, or from the association&apos;s
                         embarrassment at having let Sampson off without major sanctions two years
                         prior. In either case, the punishment again seemed to outstrip the <list

                         especially considering the wide variety of uninvestigated and unprosecuted
                         incidents of grade fraud and illicit payments that dotted the collegiate
                         sport landscape at the time.<hi rend="sup">82</hi> As damaging as the
                         punishments were, the NCAA intimated that they could have been more severe,
                         but that the negative effects on the program had been considered when
                         constructing the sanctions. In fact, some media members seized on comments
                         made by the infractions committee that the &quot;current condition of the
                         program&quot; was a mitigating factor in the level of punishment given out,
                         noting that smaller schools that had been punished in that same time period
                         were given no such consideration.<hi rend="sup">83</hi></p>
                    <p>Indiana&apos;s punishments were still the most severe handed out to any major
                         college athletics program during that time period, and the lack of
                         enforcement involving other big-time programs calls into question whether
                         the NCAA&apos;s punishments were indeed appropriate, or were intended to
                         signify that the NCAA still &quot;meant business&quot; in its enforcement
                         aims.</p>
                    <p>Time and analysis have yielded a context for the IU athletic program&apos;s
                         violations of the late 1950s. The passage of time is creating a remarkably
                         similar context for Indiana&apos;s violations of the mid-2000s. In both
                         cases, the Indiana University athletic program&apos;s lack of institutional
                         control combined with a lack of NCAA-wide enforcement and shifting
                         recruitment policies to create a situation in which Indiana athletics
                         unexpectedly became a focal point of rules-breaking in college sports.</p>

                         which that institution enhanced its profile and moved to its current

                    <p>We spoke with Herbst in his IHS office in late August 2010. During a
                         conversation of about two hours&apos; duration, he reflected on changes in
                         the history and museum professions, on the challenges of institutional
                         leadership, and on the things that made Indiana unique. The transcript of
                         our talk, which follows, has been lightly edited for length and

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> Can you tell us about a bit about your career—in
                         particular about your professional and personal ties to other places before
                         you came here to <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> I&apos;ve been blessed in that the role of the
                         institutions I&apos;ve served has been to help define place—to identify a
                         region&apos;s characteristics and what makes it special. That part of my
                         career has been extremely rewarding, and I&apos;ve been lucky to be on the
                         scene in places at critical moments. My <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-107-2-073"
                         /> museum career started in <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_7014390" reg="Paterson"
                              >Paterson</settlement></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state"

                              Jersey</region></placeName>, in the last gasp of the textile and the
                         machine and locomotive industries that had been so important to it. I was
                         fortunate to be in a position to go in and document the last vestiges of
                         the silk industry. That was very exciting: my Dad&apos;s family were German
                         immigrants who worked in the Paterson silk mills and got involved in the
                         labor difficulties there, and who did all the things that immigrants do to
                         survive and eventually to flourish.</p>
                    <p>Then I went to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927"
                                   reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>, which
                         shares an industrial and ethnic theme with <placeName><settlement
                                   type="city" key="tgn_7014390" reg="Paterson"
                                   >Paterson</settlement></placeName>. I was there at the very point
                         that the steel industry was disappearing, and I participated in documenting
                         the Homestead steelworks and in interpreting the steel industry and other
                         emblematic businesses. During my time there, we took in corporate
                         collections from the Mellon Bank, US Steel, and H.J. Heinz—the companies
                         that, together, really influenced the <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh"
                              >Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName> area. But we also worked hard to
                         document the ethnic groups that worked in the industries, and we were there
                         at a very good time for rescuing and undergirding the sense of ethnic
                         identity that a lot of these groups had. I will always consider that to be
                         another privileged experience.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> When you go back to <placeName><region type="state"

                         see in those places? What&apos;s changed since you were there, and how has
                         history—or historical awareness—made a difference?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> In <placeName><settlement type="city"
                         key="tgn_7014390" reg="Paterson"
                         >Paterson</settlement></placeName>, the people whose parents or grandparents
                         worked in the textile industry are aging—I&apos;m not sure how much the
                         younger generation has a sense of why it&apos;s called Silk City. Almost
                         forty years of urban challenges have not strengthened or advanced the
                         institutions that care for <placeName><settlement type="city"
                              key="tgn_7014390" reg="Paterson"
                              >Paterson</settlement></placeName>&apos;s history very much, and
                         that&apos;s kind of disappointing to see.</p>
                    <p>I like to think that <placeName><settlement type="city"
                         key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh"
                         >Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName> has a very strong institution now that is
                         capable of taking care of history. When I started there, the Historical
                         Society of Western Pennsylvania—while old—could not handle the collections
                         it had, and could not be aggressive about new collecting. At the same time,
                         people were afraid of losing their history, afraid it wasn&apos;t being
                         taken care of, that it was being literally trashed and destroyed. Many
                         groups did not feel that the historical society belonged to them. In the
                         intervening years, establishing the Heinz History Center, we built up a
                         cultural institution that became a major player in the city—and that had a
                         sufficient level of staffing to be stable and to manage the components a
                         historical museum needs to do its work in the community. I would hope that
                         people now feel there is a home for <placeName><settlement type="city"
                              key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh"
                              >Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName> <pb n="156"
                              id="VAA4025-107-2-074"/> history—one that they can trust and depend
                         on, and one that depends on community ownership.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> How do you make the people of a community
                         &quot;own&quot; their historical society, when they haven&apos;t
                         previously?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> We formed advisory committees of different ethnic
                         groups, and we began to collect their materials. Then, before the History
                         Center opened, we introduced a number of groundbreaking social history
                         exhibits that allowed us to address the history of those groups for the
                         first time. One, <hi rend="i">Pittsburgh Rhythms: The Music of a Changing
                              City</hi>, allowed us to deal with all kinds of groups and their music
                         up to the advent of radio. We did another one, called <hi rend="i"
                              >Homestead: Story of a Steel Town</hi>, which also reflected the
                         history of a lot of different types of people and the emblematic steel
                         industry. Eventually, through these efforts, when we opened the History
                         Center we not only had touched on many different groups of people that
                         lived there, but we also had specific exhibits: one on the Jewish community
                         and their philanthropic efforts, and another, <hi rend="i">From Paese to
                         Pittsburgh</hi>, on Italians in western <placeName><region
                              type="state" key="tgn_7007710" reg="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</region></placeName>. In our permanent
                         exhibit we touched almost every community. I had a Slovak Lutheran woman go
                         through during the first week. She said, &quot;As small as our community
                         is, I got to see a membership card for the Slovak Lutheran Benevolent
                         Society!&quot; She was so excited, because her parents had been members of
                         that benevolent society and she got to see a little piece of herself.
                         People felt it legitimized their presence in what was a very class- and
                         ethnically stratified city.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> So, when people say they want to &quot;see
                         themselves&quot; in museums, do they still identify themselves in ethnic or
                         religious terms?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> There is a point early in the immigration and
                         naturalization process at which people are too busy to seek out that kind
                         of thing. In my own family, the newcomers were busy establishing a new life
                         for themselves. But after people have been here for a while—say, the
                         children or the grandchildren of the newcomers—they become very interested
                         in the historical context and the stories that one might tell, based on
                         kinship ties that go all the way back. Many years ago,
                         &quot;genealogy&quot; was a dirty word for historians, but it&apos;s really
                         come into its own. People have gone beyond just looking for the next set of
                         dates of marriages, births, and deaths. So you really see a resurgence of
                         people&apos;s interest in ethnicity and <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-107-2-075"
                         /> family history, and in the history of immigration, settlement, and so
                         forth. We just had our Midwestern Roots conference, and I was struck by who
                         was in the audience and the kinds of questions that they asked. Immigration
                         occurred 100 to 150 years ago, yet many of the boomer generation feel a
                         strong personal connection to their ancestors.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> Is there still something about the melting pot story
                         that makes us want to embrace both the Americans we become and these other
                         people who we once were?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> I think so. There is a quest to find yourself, wherever
                         that leads you. It&apos;s not done anymore—as it was in the late nineteenth
                         and early twentieth century—to search for noble ancestors and connections
                         so that you&apos;d gain social status. People are just as interested in the
                         murder story, or the story of why somebody left the old country, or all the
                         other dramatic stories that are not associated with class or prestige. They
                         just want to know who they are. So the idea of &quot;seeing
                         themselves&quot; in our museums and in our collections is still an enduring
                         one. We&apos;ve gotten much, much better at it, and much more inclusive,
                         but I think it&apos;s still a challenge—both programmatically and in terms
                         of collections.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> How do you get people to identify with particular
                         collections, especially given the standardization and the globalization
                         that characterize our lives today?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> Well, it&apos;s true that many of the things that people
                         use are the same things that they use everywhere. Mass production has had a
                         unifying effect on how people live, and what you find in various households
                         is not unique to one or another ethnicity. But still, I think there are
                         differences. It&apos;s not that a bowl from Kmart, itself, really speaks to
                         ethnic groups: it&apos;s what they&apos;re doing with it that we need to
                         document. And while we&apos;re very open to collecting things that document
                         events that have already occurred, we&apos;re not as good at going out
                         there and documenting things as they happen. That&apos;s a matter of
                         resources, more than anything. So much of collecting has been
                         exhibits-driven: you decide you&apos;re going to do a program on this,
                         hence you go out and collect within a community whose materials have not
                         been collected, and that&apos;s the reason you begin to collect. Hopefully,
                         you form some lasting ties with people so that a stream of documentation
                         continues in. But tying collection to exhibitions is a very expensive
                         endeavor: you have to have the <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-107-2-076"/> money
                         to do something worthwhile. To say, &quot;We have a gap in our collection
                         regarding the Mexican community,&quot; on the other hand, requires a less
                         extensive commitment of resources than an exhibition, but even mounting a
                         collection effort can still be a problem.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> We&apos;ve been talking about standardization, but of
                         course there&apos;s also a lot of variety that remains in our culture
                         today—from one region to another, for example. As you said, your own roots
                         are in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007565" reg="New Jersey"
                                   >New Jersey</region></placeName>. You found your first work close
                         to home and then you went to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927"
                              reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>, which shares some characteristics,
                         in terms of its people and its industries. So what did <placeName><region
                              type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> represent
                         for you before you came here?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> It took me a while to get over the topography, and to
                         understand how it might actually work to create more of a defined identity
                         for people. The contrast was <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh"
                              >Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>, where a very complex topography
                         retained and helped to protect ethnic communities and historic
                         neighborhoods, and tended to discourage people from moving out of the place
                         where their families had settled. I felt that this was the reason why it is
                         hard to identify ethnic neighborhoods in <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis"
                              >Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>. There were ethnic
                         neighborhoods, but retaining them has been kind of impossible for
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"
                                   reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>, because
                         of the topography. Also, homogeneity is a much stronger force in the
                         Midwest than it is in the East. You see that in ethnic identity; you see it
                         in food. Take bread for instance—bread is so different on the East Coast,
                         where it reflects ethnic groups and backgrounds. On the positive side,
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"
                                   reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> is a
                         very egalitarian city, where people are judged and accepted on merit.
                         It&apos;s not a very socially stratified place—which I mean as a
                         compliment. The city is open to accepting and embracing newcomers and the
                         best efforts on everybody&apos;s part. You don&apos;t have to be connected
                         socially, which was a big thing in <placeName><settlement type="city"
                              key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh"
                              >Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> And historically? Do you feel like the story of this
                         place is quite different from the other places where you have worked?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> Yes, I do, actually. The wide-open space has provided a
                         context for people to achieve here, and make a life for themselves.
                         That&apos;s very different from the ruggedness of the
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName> area,
                         which made it difficult for people to get along and which fostered very
                         top-down leadership. I really do think there&apos;s something about
                         midwestern values, and the egalitarian spirit of this region, that&apos;s
                         very distinct from the East Coast.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> What&apos;s your impression of the state of
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>
                         history as an industry-such as it is? Historical work goes on in all
                         ninety-two counties, as you know. Is it healthy, or is it suffering from
                         the economic downturn that&apos;s affected all cultural institutions?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> The good news is that we have very fine institutions in
                         a number of places. Here in the state capital, we partner a great deal with
                         the State Museum, because they collect the artifacts and we collect
                         archival material. Like us, because of the recent serious economic
                         downturn, they have been reduced somewhat in size, but not really yet in
                         scope. Both are still offering the same kind of services that we had, and
                         we are very fortunate in that way. The state has supported the State
                         Museum, while we&apos;ve developed primarily through philanthropy.
                         We&apos;re blessed in this state by the tradition of philanthropy,
                         especially the Lilly family, and now others—in our case the Glick family,
                         whose recent support has allowed us to expand during hard times. But I
                         think the presence of a major philanthropic force like the Lilly family in
                         a sense took up the slack that in other states had to be borne by the state
                         governments. In both <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007710"

                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007565"
                                   reg="New Jersey">New Jersey</region></placeName>, government
                         support was until recently a major force in establishing organizations. And
                         actually, a lot of money was available in the last thirty years to allow
                         museums to bootstrap themselves and become more professional. We
                         haven&apos;t had that kind of support in this state for endeavors like
                         that. Tourism is not as valued as it is, say, in the other two states where
                         I&apos;ve worked, where it is a big industry. We just haven&apos;t had very
                         much in the way of support for heritage tourism here.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> Isn&apos;t it partly a question of how Hoosiers view
                         the role of government, in comparison with residents of these other
                         states?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> Yes. There is a small-government, low-tax attitude here.

                         directed historic sites, museums, living-history centers, and now a
                         historical organization built upon a library and archive. Does each present
                         a different challenge for you?</p>

                    <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-107-2-078"/>
                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> The issue of facilities has faced me in multiple sites.
                         In <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh"
                                   >Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>, we were in a 1913,
                         15,000-square-foot building that had filled up in the 1920s and was badly
                         designed for a public history mission. We had to have a new history center
                         if we were going to take care of history in the right way. It took a
                         ten-year effort, door-to-door, to create the 160,000-square-foot Heinz
                         History Center. The Conner Prairie Museum Center was such a poorly planned
                         and dysfunctional building, and we worked hard to make it more effective.
                         The State Museum had already built a new facility that was designed for
                         visitors and for exhibition and display, although we did tinker with the
                         friendliness of it. Here at the Indiana Historical Society, our challenge
                         is to take a monumental building and better tune it to let the public use
                         more of it—and not just the library reading room.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> At a more personal level, is there something
                         fundamentally different about working in a historic site—at Conner Prairie,
                         the farm itself; in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927"
                              reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>, the icehouse; in Paterson the private house
                         that told the city&apos;s story—and working in a building meant simply to
                         contain historical materials?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> I was very fond of the building in
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>—not so
                         much because it was tied into the industrial story as because it was a big
                         ice warehouse, and you could adaptively reuse the interior in whatever way
                         you wanted. It became a dramatic, classic building that I think will really
                         hold up over the years. We had looked at newly constructed buildings, ten
                         or twenty years old—like the State Museum in <placeName><settlement
                              type="city" key="tgn_7013694" reg="Harrisburg">Harrisburg</settlement></placeName>—and just felt,
                         &quot;Gosh, those buildings don&apos;t look so good after however many
                         years.&quot; You can make a lot of mistakes with new architecture when
                         you&apos;re really trying to convey a historical agenda. In the case of the
                         Heinz History Center, I picked the building, I helped design every inch of
                         it, and I was intimately involved with all decisions made about it—so I got
                         what I wanted in the end, pretty much. Directing Conner Prairie was very
                         enjoyable apart from Earlham. I guess one thing I don&apos;t miss is how
                         the weather influenced attendance, which is something you have to
                         constantly be worried about for half of the year. Otherwise, that was a
                         unique site, staff, and product, and it really did improve tremendously
                         while I was there. But as far as different types of settings go, I think
                         the Indiana Historical Society, and what it does, offers a fantastic
                         situation for a professional doing public history. There are so many
                         wonderful things about this institution.</p>

                         different sorts of sites? Do people learn differently, according to whether
                         they are in a historic site or in a box that contains historic materials
                         and experiences? Is there something fundamentally different that goes on at
                         Conner Prairie, for example, as you look out over the fields?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> Our flagship word there was &quot;authenticity.&quot;
                         Setting it outdoors, and having the weather and the seasons become part of
                         the experience, lets people connect viscerally to what others went through.
                         But in the end, no matter what your setting is, authenticity applies for
                         all historical organizations. You have to capitalize on whatever your

                         as well as we maintain collections that we can share with researchers, it
                         was an awfully large place to have only a small part available to the
                         public for the purposes of discovering <placeName><region type="state"
                              key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history. We started with the
                         fact that the building could do more to connect the public to the past.</p>

                         hard look at the situation. I truly wasn&apos;t looking for an
                         institutional sea change at this point in my career—I thought I had already
                         climbed a lot of big mountains. But when I got here and began assessing
                         what our challenges were as an institution, we saw that our building was
                         under-used, and that people didn&apos;t know what was housed here. The
                         public didn&apos;t understand our archival collections, and the average
                         person did not get to share them in a meaningful way. Further, as an
                         organization blessed with an income from our endowment, we really
                         hadn&apos;t had to go to the public for community support—and that actually
                         was a negative, in terms of our long-term success. It&apos;s a healthy
                         thing to have your community invest in you—not just from a pure cash income
                         basis, but for the sense of involvement and value that they place on the
                         institution. We could do a lot of wonderful things before we built this
                         building, but not all of them were wise, and they seldom depended on public
                         input or involvement. So I think we were maybe a little out of touch in
                         some ways, even though we had done fantastic work with county historical
                         societies, and in publishing, and so many other important areas. That,
                         basically, summarizes my motivation: the building could do more for us, we
                         needed to find new ways to share our collections with a broader public, and
                         we needed to broaden public support of the institution.</p>
                    <p>So we got our staff and board together and we started to brainstorm: What
                         could we uniquely offer visitors that did not compete with or duplicate
                         other institutions in town—particularly our near neighbor and collaborator
                         the State Museum? What new ideas could we come up with to share our
                         collections? The components of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Experience</hi> are
                         what we came up with. When we started off I said, &quot;Let&apos;s look at
                         our absence of artifacts as not a negative but a positive. We are
                         artifact-free—let&apos;s look at that as an advantage. We don&apos;t have
                         to worry about having artifacts behind cases or ropes or not touching
                         anything.&quot; That certainly <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-107-2-081"/>

                                   currently features three exhibits allowing visitors to step into
                                   a photograph or an event from Indiana&apos;s past.</p>

                         travel that we do in &quot;Destination Indiana&quot; and &quot;You Are
                         There.&quot;</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> What are your reactions so far? What&apos;s exceeded
                         your expectations, in terms of transformations in the building?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> What&apos;s exceeded our expectations is the level of
                         engagement that we are able to obtain with visitors. The photographs that
                         you pass through as you go into &quot;You Are There&quot; have turned out
                         to be a big success—very provocative for people. They&apos;re rating it
                         very highly. Likewise, the &quot;Destination Indiana&quot; program turned
                         out so wonderfully. In the beginning, I challenged the staff:
                         &quot;Let&apos;s do a time travel program where you can travel to a place
                         or explore a topic in the past and use our collections to do that.&quot;
                         The way they actualized this has been so fantastic that it appeals to
                         people of all ages. It has unlimited potential for us to put new journeys
                         on there—there is an infinite number of possibilities. We&apos;re <pb
                              n="164" id="VAA4025-107-2-082"/> very happy with that. On the other
                         hand, I knew it was going to be a challenge to establish ourselves as a
                         destination attraction. The building was open for ten years before we
                         introduced the <hi rend="i">Indiana Experience</hi> and while we were used
                         by the public for lots of purposes, it really wasn&apos;t for history. Our
                         program attendance was relatively small. So we are having to put a lot of
                         effort and resources into advertising and PR and marketing to make sure
                         that we have an audience for this. But I see this as something that&apos;s
                         being built up by word-of-mouth and social networking as well as by
                         traditional media: we&apos;re giving people such a good experience when
                         they&apos;re here that they&apos;re telling others and making us a must-see
                         attraction. It&apos;s going to take a while for us to build up attendance
                         to a level that I think is exemplary.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> Has it had an effect upon how people view the
                         institution?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> Tremendous financial support certainly is one measure of
                         the satisfaction that people have with us. Corporate and individual support
                         are up; we started our campaign three years ago, and we&apos;ve raised over
                         $17 million so far. Secondly, our related sources of revenue—our annual
                         fund, corporate sponsorship, and other areas—have gone up significantly. So
                         I think people are excited about what we&apos;re doing. And they&apos;re
                         financially supporting the endeavor.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> How about the everyday user, the visitor?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> Our visitor evaluations show a high degree of
                         satisfaction with the <hi rend="i">Indiana Experience</hi>. We did a public
                         awareness study in January 2009, right after we had prototyped some of our
                         ideas, and we&apos;ll be doing another in January 2011. That should tell us
                         a lot about whether we really moved the needle on general public perception
                         of who we are and what we do.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> One of the striking things about your career—and public
                         history more generally—is how often it courts conflict, even at times when
                         we might not expect it. You&apos;ve been involved in sites that documented
                         the history of conflict—for example, the labor scene in cities like
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014390"
                                   reg="Paterson">Paterson</settlement></placeName> and
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927"
                                   reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>—but
                         you&apos;ve also been involved in very contemporary conflict in
                         institutions where you&apos;ve worked. What is it that generates such
                         conflict or tensions in historical organizations—does it come down to
                         competing points of view about history, or is it really about bottom-line <pb
                              n="165" id="VAA4025-107-2-083"/>  questions concerning money and
                         real estate—the day-to-day stuff that creates conflict in the business
                         world, as well?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> One of the greatest services that the IHS provides to
                         other historical organizations in the state is our local history services
                         department. It&apos;s constantly counseling boards and staff statewide
                         about institutional growth and development and conflict. All
                         not-for-profits and all museums have this, depending on where they are in
                         the evolutionary cycle. I think it has less to do with whether a historical
                         organization tells a story of class or economic conflict, and much more to
                         do with how you run organizations. One issue I ran into in my career is
                         what I like to call &quot;founderitis,&quot; which is a terrible disease
                         afflicting a non-professional who seeks to found a museum and then cannot
                         part from it, and will do whatever he or she can to control it. Founderitis
                         has severely hindered a number of organizations. Or it has provoked
                         conflict in organizations that have to grow and move on and dramatically
                         break with their founder. It&apos;s often very painful for everybody
                         involved.</p>
                    <p>The conflict whose resolution I&apos;m proudest of is what happened at Conner
                         Prairie. It was a conflict that had been brewing for thirty years between
                         Earlham College—which thought it was the owner of the museum, but it turned
                         out was the trustee of a public charitable trust—and the community-based
                         board that was running Conner Prairie. My part in resolving the conflict
                         was, first, to identify the fact that there was a glass ceiling over the
                         museum, as far as fundraising and community support (because of
                         Earlham&apos;s control of the finances); second, to point out some very
                         unfair practices that were going on with regard to the financial
                         arrangements between the college and the museum regarding the Lilly gifts;
                         and thirdly, to say to the board, &quot;I think this would be important for
                         you to resolve, and you should not make protecting me a factor in working
                         to resolve this.&quot; Prior CEOs had worried that a push to resolve this
                         might result in something happening to them and their job. My predecessor,
                         Marcia Semmel, was not there a long time, but she had a lot of interesting
                         plans, and the board had gotten excited about the potential of Conner
                         Prairie. I came in as an actualizer of that potential, and I ran smack into
                         Earlham&apos;s control of the museum and the fact that they were really
                         most interested in the income that was available to them through this
                         relationship with the museum.</p>


                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> You paid a high price for your &quot;proud
                         resolution.&quot;</p>

                    <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-107-2-084"/>
                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> Yes. I have to admit to having fallen in love with
                         different institutions that I served in my career, and Conner Prairie was
                         one place that I held in a very special regard, which is why I wanted to
                         see this get done. While it turned out really terrific for the museum, I
                         wasn&apos;t able to go back and that was a disappointment for me.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> So you&apos;ve seen a number of institutions at a point
                         of crisis or change.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> Throughout my career, I have faced the challenge of
                         either building an institution from scratch or leading it through a major
                         transformation. My work at <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh"
                              >Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName> was a product of being very young
                         and ambitious—not personally ambitious but institutionally ambitious. I was
                         convinced that the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania was the
                         organization to take the leadership in creating a history center for
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927"
                                   reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>, and that no
                         other organization&apos;s institutional mission fit that goal. But it
                         wasn&apos;t easy. After we had worked for five years to move this idea
                         along, we hired a consultant to prepare a report on the potential of a
                         capital campaign. And while I personally got high marks, the consultant
                         wrote that people were very negative about our organization&apos;s chances
                         in pulling it off. But I looked at that report, and I said, &quot;Well,
                         we&apos;ve got to use this as a blueprint of what we have to tackle to get
                         this done.&quot; And by the end of my time there, the Historical Society of
                         Western Pennsylvania was a totally different organization. To go from five
                         employees to ninety, to go from a 15,000-square-foot building to a
                         160,000-square-foot building, from an operating budget of a 
                         couple-hundred-thousand dollars to $4 million over a ten-year period was an
                         amazing transformation. We faced so many brick walls over those
                         years—we&apos;d hit one, then go around it, then hit another—it was really
                         something to be involved in. A lot of people didn&apos;t want it to happen,
                         but others came along and did a great deal to make it happen. Ten years is
                         a long time in somebody&apos;s career to see that type of process
                         through.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> Sounds like you miss it.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> Well, I do have an affinity for <placeName><settlement
                         type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>. But I got
                         such a great experience there that it has certainly helped me in the rest
                         of my career. And it brought me to <placeName><settlement type="city"
                              key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>, which I love. Conner
                         Prairie was, of course, viewed as a very difficult situation, impossible to
                         resolve as it was not in Earlham College&apos;s financial interest to
                         resolve it. Earlham had <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-107-2-085"/> to fire the
                         community board of directors and me to avoid a resolution. I think that I
                         played a major role in doing so, but I have to credit Berkley Duck, the
                         chairman of the board at the time. He was an exemplary leader, and he lent
                         so much courage, credibility, and energy to that whole messy battle.
                         Berkley reconstituted the board as a not-for-profit called &quot;Save the
                         Prairie&quot; and he made the legal arguments to the Attorney General that
                         resolved the issue. No one could have replaced him, in my view. He was one
                         of those unique individuals who appears on the scene at just the right
                         time, gets involved, and has a unique tool bag to fix the problem,
                         including the backbone to see it through.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> Let&apos;s turn to the future: What do you see as
                         breakthrough models, or exemplars, in historical practice—things that
                         either represent the way things are already going, or that in some way you
                         could imagine a future generation taking advantage of?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> Let me address that by posing another question
                         that&apos;s more direct to this institution: someone might ask, &quot;Do
                         the things that you have just implemented—at a fairly substantial price
                         tag—represent where you see the IHS in five years?&quot; What I would say
                         to that is, &quot;This happens to be what we&apos;re doing right now, using
                         technology that&apos;s available to us at the moment—the fog screen element
                         and hologram for &quot;You Are There,&quot; the technology for time travel
                         in &quot;Destination Indiana.&quot; But while I&apos;m pleased and excited
                         and proud of all we&apos;ve been doing, in seven years or ten years we may
                         be doing something very different. Twenty or thirty years ago, I
                         couldn&apos;t have imagined the technique of stepping into a photo as we do
                         in &quot;You Are There&quot; or the technology for &quot;Destination
                         Indiana.&quot; But we started &quot;You Are There&quot; with the idea that
                         many people who have looked at the historical photographs have thought,
                         &quot;Boy, I would love to step in there and be part of that—to see how it
                         really was.&quot; That was a kind of inspiration for us in working this
                         out. But I don&apos;t think we could&apos;ve imagined stepping literally
                         into the photographs, and we certainly couldn&apos;t have imagined a
                         technology that would get us to &quot;Destination Indiana.&quot; Which
                         means that right now, we probably can&apos;t imagine new things on the
                         horizon, especially given the way technology is so rapidly changing.</p>

                    <p>IMH What really got you there was not the medium itself but the 
                        long-standing desire to step into the past, right? Are there other long-standing
                         instincts that draw people to history?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> Yes. The technology is just the means to get people to
                         realize that desire. I did a presentation, using clips from books, movies
                         and television, about time travel and popular culture. It is several
                         hundred years old or more, this fascination with going back in time.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> When you look at the history of museums, you see many
                         that have made what they thought, at the time, was an unprecedented step
                         into the past. Streetscapes like they have in the Detroit Historical
                         Museum, which now seem so old and quaint, were wonders of their day.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> As a child, I remember being romanced by the diorama of
                         New Amsterdam at the Museum of the City of New York. I just thought that
                         was the coolest thing to see the city in that way. When I first started
                         teaching, I had a photograph of that view that you could put together in
                         overlapping pieces, and I displayed it around the perimeter of the
                         classroom.</p>



                    <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-107-2-087"/>
                    <p>I also remember a school book called <hi rend="i">America, My Home</hi>,
                         about one family in upstate New York, from colonial times to World War II.
                         I grew up in a blue-collar family, and we didn&apos;t have a lot of books
                         in our house, but my uncle had left his school books, including this one,
                         in the attic. Each period began with a view of the same place—first, a
                         cabin on the river overlooking the falls, then a community around a mill,
                         and then around factories and businesses. The family house remained there—
                         until it was made into a museum at the very end. That book mesmerized me. I
                         read it a million times, and later realized I was attracted to any book
                         that showed the same place over a period of time or the story of the family
                         over time.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH</hi> When you were a child, and when you subsequently
                         started studying history, did you imagine yourself on a career path like
                         the one that has brought you to Indiana?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JH</hi> When I was an undergrad majoring in history, I was
                         focused on being a high school teacher; I intended to teach social studies
                         for grades eight through twelve. I had no idea about museum work. I had
                         visited tons of historic sites and knew people who worked there, but I
                         really was focused on teaching. Then after three years of teaching, a job
                         opportunity came along at the city museum in <placeName><settlement
                              type="city" key="tgn_7014390" reg="Paterson">Paterson</settlement></placeName>, and because I&apos;d
                         worked on local history projects with my students, I was able to enter the
                         field without museum training. I then did some training in curatorial work
                         and I got my masters degree later on. So really, it was very much by
                         accident. The only deliberate part was the time spent with my junior
                         historians&apos; club, which I started as a branch of the New Jersey
                         Historical Society. I very deliberately thought, &quot;This is how I&apos;m
                         going to spend unpaid time and summers: working on history projects with
                         the kids.&quot; None of it was compensated; it was just something I wanted
                         to do. Once when my wife complained about the time I was spending, my
                         father-in-law—who was a teacher—said to her, &quot;Let him do this, you
                         never know where this might lead.&quot; She&apos;s a dedicated teacher
                         herself, but here I was spending my summers hauling kids around to do
                         research all over Paterson in a derelict &apos;67 Dodge with some doors
                         that wouldn&apos;t open and some windows that wouldn&apos;t roll down. He
                         was a visionary who said, &quot;You never know where this could lead.&quot;
                         It led me here. </p>

                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> cookbooks have to say
                         about Indiana history? What can contemporary regional cookbooks tell
                         historians about state and local history? When studying historic community
                         (fundraiser) cookbooks, I look for the history of the organization, what
                         the recipes and the organization suggest about the foodways of the
                         book&apos;s place and time, the intention behind the publication (in
                         addition to raising funds), how the recipe contributors present the
                         recipes, and what elements are included in addition to the recipes. Each
                         book reviewed here contributes to Hoosier history in a different way by
                         documenting three kinds of restaurants and chefs on the
                         twenty-first-century <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> landscape. Two books compile recipes and other
                         information from restaurants that are new on the scene, historically
                         speaking, and one documents small-town cafes that have a longer history to
                         consider. Histories of restaurants and other aspects of food history are
                         not always easy to find, though some midwestern states have published
                         worthwhile titles like <hi rend="i">Food in Missouri: A Cultural Stew</hi>
                         (1994) and <hi rend="i">Minnesota Eats Out: An <pb n="171"
                                   id="VAA4025-107-2-089"/> Illustrated History</hi> (2003).
                         Eateries that survive to a big anniversary year may produce or commission a
                         history, but that too is rare. They are more likely to publish a cookbook
                         than a history. Hence this review.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="i">FARMfood: Green Living with Chef Daniel Orr</hi> is a big square
                         book, full of recipes and photographs created by the chef, that lives up to
                         its subtitle with sections on gardening season by season, composting,
                         butterfly- and hummingbird-friendly planting, and edible flowers (beginning
                         with dandelion greens). The book organizes its recipes in an unusual way,
                         beginning with spice blends and continuing with breakfast, soups,
                         sandwiches, drinks, snacks, pies, starters (mostly salads), suppers,
                         vegetables, desserts, and sauces. Orr writes about food and gardening, food
                         and his travels, and food and friends made along the way. He weaves his
                         delicious-sounding and often unusual recipes into a story that tells
                         readers about who he is and the often exotic paths he has traveled to
                         arrive at his <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437"
                              reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement></placeName> restaurant. Orr&apos;s recipes, to this upper
                         midwesterner, reflect a bit more of the southern roots of
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> cooking
                         than its Great Lakes aspect, though the nods to fried smelt, walleye, and
                         lake perch point north.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="i">Cafe Indiana Cookbook</hi> is a labor of love of another kind, a
                         collaboration between a folklorist and a food writer who had written an
                         earlier book on the state&apos;s small-town cafes. It describes a different
                         kind of eating, one in which breakfast is the biggest meal of the day and
                         local men are the primary diners, followed by vacationers, with local women
                         the smallest group of customers. The recipes are the kind cafe customers
                         order and eat week after week, year after year, even when the chefs may
                         wish they would be willing to try something new. The word &quot;local&quot;
                         may mean something different here than in the other two books. Many
                         activities for local benefit are planned over coffee and food in these
                         community gathering places.</p>
                    <p>The book highlights cafes from towns around the state that draw on a number
                         of ethnic traditions, as the preface helpfully (though briefly) describes.
                         People who study community cookbooks frequently argue about whether we can
                         know if families really ate the dishes for which they contributed recipes.
                         In the case of the <hi rend="i">Cafe Indiana</hi> cookbook, readers know
                         that those who frequent the cafes within really do eat the dishes whose
                         recipes are given. These recipes do not tell us what the diners eat at
                         home, but they get close. Consider a continuum that extends from home
                         cooking, dishes taken to potlucks (or church pitch-ins), small-town cafes
                         and modest city eateries, cafeterias, taverns, and roadhouses, to more
                         expensive restaurants and big fancy restaurants. (Fast food is not on this
                         continuum.) Cafe cooking is often pretty close to what customers eat at
                         home.</p>
                    <p>The preface nods at ways <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                         reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s geography affects which foods <pb
                              n="172" id="VAA4025-107-2-090"/> are grown where in the state—this
                         would have been interesting to read more about. (For a handsome and
                         informative map that gives a more detailed idea of what is grown where,

                         the state&apos;s history because it describes the audience for these dishes
                         as well as the ingredients and the chefs. This cookbook was also the only
                         one of the three to discuss foods I had never heard of, like the German
                         sausage called goetta, and topics like the multiple origins of a common
                         poor-people&apos;s food like cornmeal mush. Here it is traced to
                         Appalachian and Pennsylvania Dutch migrants to <placeName><region

                         Slavic and Italian roots, and regionally is associated with the

                         pancakes served with apple butter and maple syrup) but I&apos;ve not found
                         any—yet. I am familiar with apple butter primarily as a homemade product
                         that may be judged annually at county and state fairs, but in

                         delicious family recipe to share with her friends, so it is home food for
                         me.</p>
                    <p>The question of noodles versus dumplings is one of several indications of a
                         culinary divide between northern and southern <placeName><region
                                   type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                              >Indiana</region></placeName>. The differences were enlightening to
                         read about, as were choices about pinto or Great Northern beans and
                         southern-style cornbread or northern-style. Encountering a rolled dumpling
                         for the first time, I would probably think it was a noodle. Dropped
                         dumplings, on the other hand, I am familiar with, having grown up with
                         German dumplings on chicken soup and beef stew. Czech ones I have
                         encountered during <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007521"

                                   >Minnesota</region></placeName>&apos;s Norwegian dumplings might
                         take Indianans some getting used to. Made of potatoes and called <hi
                              rend="i">klub</hi> or <hi rend="i">kumle</hi>, they might or might not
                         have a piece of sausage or salty ham in the middle. They might be cooked in
                         pig&apos;s blood. However they are made, they usually <hi rend="i">are</hi>
                         the meal, not an accompaniment. In some small-town cafes in western
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007521" reg="Minnesota"
                                   >Minnesota</region></placeName>, <hi rend="i">klub</hi> is served
                         once a week, the same day each week. No one would mistake <hi rend="i"
                              >klub</hi> for a noodle.</p>
                    <p>Another difference between the cafes and the local-ingredient-driven eateries
                         is the willingness of those who feed many people all day every day to use
                         shortcuts like brown gravy mix and frozen mixed vegetables. Unlike the <hi
                              rend="i">Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives</hi> celebrated on the Food
                         Network, the book&apos;s recipes reveal that not every <pb n="173"
                              id="VAA4025-107-2-091"/> small-town cafe chef insists on making every
                         part of every dish from scratch.</p>
                    <p>Though there is an element of nostalgia present when reading and writing
                         about small-town cafes, the <hi rend="i">Cafe Indiana Cookbook</hi> does
                         not just celebrate timeless charm. Some things stay the same, others
                         evolve. An example is the Ethiopian food served Friday evenings only at
                         Daniel&apos;s Ligonier Cafe, where the rest of the time most of the food
                         served is &quot;traditional Hoosier food made from scratch.&quot; Different
                         customers show up on Friday evenings than come to eat the rest of the
                         week.</p>
                    <p>Fried bologna sandwiches are not a dish often seen on <placeName><region
                                   type="state" key="tgn_7007521" reg="Minnesota"

                         involving fried bologna do show up in community cookbooks from the 1950s
                         and earlier. I would speculate that like apple butter, fried bologna in the
                         Upper Midwest may be home food more than public food. Breaded pork
                         tenderloin sandwiches, on the other hand, are deliciously available in

                         state, supplementing but not supplanting the more traditional cafe
                         eateries. This reader would have appreciated more about the towns or
                         neighborhood locales of the restaurants, although the book does provide a
                         welcome list of some of the local farms and food producers whose products
                         the chefs use.</p>
                    <p>The cookbooks helped me remember some of the good meals I have enjoyed during

                    <p>When MGM founder Marcus Loew observed, &quot;We sell tickets to theaters, not
                         movies,&quot; he was speaking of buildings like the Embassy Theatre in

                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. With opulence and luxury unknown to most of the audience
                         members who visit even today, the Embassy is a revitalized gem from a brief
                         but important part of American history, and Dyne L. Pfeffenberger&apos;s
                              <hi rend="i">The Historic Fort Wayne Embassy Theatre</hi> will deepen
                         even the casual patron&apos;s appreciation for the place of the theater in
                         the region&apos;s history.</p>
                    <p>Pfeffenberger begins with a description of the building, greeting the reader
                         as would a friendly tour guide, pointing out the logistics, technology,
                         surfaces, and structure of a space which originally seated 3,100. The book
                         reveals the building&apos;s painstaking workmanship: how tile layers would
                         &quot;occasionally break the tile mold as a signature of their individual
                         work,&quot; and how &quot;craftsmen transferred thousands of plaster
                         castings, still wet, to a mesh laid in the walls&quot; (pp. 5-6) to create
                         the lions, jesters, gargoyles, flowers, and birds that adorn the lobby. The
                         theater&apos;s specifications are amazing: a five-story-tall marquee,
                         Lavagno marble tile floors, ornate plasterwork throughout the lobby and
                         auditorium, chandeliers, and the Grande Page pipe organ. Beautiful color
                         photographs of the modern building interspersed with pictures from the
                         early years testify to the grandeur. The author also offers operational
                         details: for example, the theater was the first air-cooled public building
                         in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933" reg="Fort Wayne"
                                   >Fort Wayne</settlement></placeName>, utilizing a water cooling
                         system run from a well beneath the building. A renovation in 1994 resulted
                         in current stage dimensions of eighty feet by sixty-seven feet, a sprung
                         floor, fifty-eight rigging lines, and ten dressing rooms, allowing for the
                         most elaborate of touring productions.</p>
                    <p>Pfeffenberger devotes an entire chapter to the dedicated efforts of the
                         Theatre Foundation to restore the Grande Page pipe organ, one of the very
                         few organs in the country still intact in its original building. Here the
                         book begins to shine, as readers share in the stories and personalities
                         that made up the theater&apos;s life. Percy Robbins, the first organist, is
                         described as &quot;a dapper gentleman who dressed in impeccably tailored
                              <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-107-2-093"/> suits, wore an ascot, and carried
                         an elaborate walking stick&quot; (p. 22). Later organist Buddy Nolan,
                         pictured with shiny, slicked-back hair, relocated to <placeName><settlement

                    <p>It was once the case that all Native American history was &quot;policy
                         history,&quot; or the &quot;history of Indian-white relations.&quot; Since
                         1950, scholars have increasingly moved away from such models to explore
                         more Native-centered approaches that attended to indigenous peoples&apos;
                         agency in the past. With a mighty heave, historian Timothy Willig&apos;s
                         monograph casts the pendulum of scholarly trends in the writing of Native
                         history back toward the older mode of inquiry: this is policy history with
                         a vengeance. The author adopts wholesale the perspective of his eighteenth-
                         and nineteenth-century British sources in considering Native peoples as
                         &quot;defeated wartime allies&quot; (p. 6). Throughout the book, Native
                         Americans appear as mere ciphers, praised when they exhibited proper
                         deference and loyalty to their British masters, and criticized as dupes or
                         villains (Mohawk leader Joseph Brant is singled out for the latter role)
                              <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-107-2-094"/> when they asserted sovereign
                         rights that the author assures us did not exist.</p>
                    <p>Rarely does one find in contemporary professional historical writing a
                         scholar willing to accept as valid the doctrine of discovery, a fifteenth-
                         century legal fiction invented to legitimize Europe&apos;s intrusion into
                         North America by denigrating the nature of indigenous land tenure. Yet
                         Willig considers the Genoese navigator Giovanni Caboto&apos;s 1497
                         reconnaissance of Atlantic waters off Newfoundland (while in the employ of
                         England) to be of decisive import in his study. From that moment onward,
                         all Native people in North America supposedly lost &quot;full title&quot;
                         (p. 128) to their lands, enjoying thereafter only the right of usufruct
                         (i.e., the right to dwell upon and use the land) at the sufferance of the
                         English Crown. The author then proceeds to resurrect the shopworn claim
                         that British policymakers &quot;did not consider indigenous groups as
                         political entities, but rather as separate racial classes, or groups, that
                         were to receive special treatment&quot; (p. 128). However convenient these
                         opinions were to post-Revolutionary British policymakers, or to
                         Willig&apos;s argument, neither is true. The author manifests an almost
                         willful ignorance of the implications of the past several decades of
                         scholarship on colonial-era Native American history (references in his
                         bibliography notwithstanding) regarding treaty-making in particular. Had
                         the author chosen to document the undeniable transition from a time when
                         Native people were recognized as nations (this was certainly the case east
                         of the <geogName key="tgn_7022231" reg="Mississippi River">Mississippi
                              River</geogName> until 1783) to a time when they were not, he might
                         have produced a &quot;policy history&quot; of interest and value. Instead,
                         he has opted to swallow uncritically the paper trail of interested
                         individuals who constructed far-reaching erasures of Native nationhood and
                         to represent those constructions in factual terms.</p>
                    <p>The author&apos;s attempt to provide a rationale for this book (pp. 7-8)
                         fails to yield a convincing argument for this particular study&apos;s
                         existence vis-a-vis prior and better works by Colin Calloway, Robert S.
                         Allen, and Alan Taylor. The author&apos;s true rationale might be found in
                         the book&apos;s epilogue, where Willig&apos;s self-proclaimed status as a
                         &quot;Loyalist&quot; (p. x) appears to have motivated a quixotic rear-guard
                         historiographical battle against long dead early national American writers
                         named &quot;Henry&quot; (William Henry Harrison, Henry Clay, and Henry Rowe
                         Schoolcraft, with Lewis Cass thrown in for good measure) (pp. 244-46).
                         These American writers did not &quot;properly understand British-Indian
                         relations&quot; (p. 251) circa 1783-1815, and thus Willig contends that we
                         need to learn of the &quot;complexities&quot; inherent in those relations
                         (p. 260). Willig is able to mock early national Americans&apos;
                         &quot;bellowing&quot; (p. 246) about a &quot;myth of conquest&quot; (p.
                         266) over indigenous peoples <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-107-2-095"/> stemming
                         from the British surrender of the North American interior in the post-
                         Revolutionary Treaty of Paris, but is unable, or unwilling, to recognize
                         similar and no less damaging rhetorical manipulations by British officials
                         after 1783.</p>
                    <p>Beyond establishing a most basic claim for geographic diversity in the
                         conduct of British-Indian relations from 1783 to 1815, the book offers very
                         little that is new or noteworthy in terms of its content or the sources
                         consulted in its writing. Willig&apos;s interpretation of British-Indian
                         relations is actively hostile to the concerns of those interested in
                         recovering the story of Native peoples&apos; engagements with settler
                         colonialism in North America.</p>

                         During most of the 1830s, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
                         had two headquarters, in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706"

                         differences led to a series of violent clashes, as Missourians drove the
                         Latter-day Saints from a series of counties, and finally, under threat of
                         an &quot;extermination&quot; order signed by Governor Lilburn Boggs, from
                         the state during the winter of 1838-1839.</p>
                    <p>While this expulsion became a central part of Mormon memory, identity, and

                         conflicts. This volume of collected essays, which grew out of the Missouri

                         contributes to both Mormon and midwestern history.</p>
                    <p>In their essays, Thomas Spencer and Kenneth Winn argue that cultural and
                         economic chasms—Yankee Mormons vs. Upper South Missourians, Latter-day
                         Saint communalism and landholdings vs. Missouri individualism and land

                         institution—led to the violence. Spencer extends this analysis through a

                         Romig and Michael Riggs examine unsuccessful attempts by Mormons in the
                         mid-1830s to return to their initial landholdings. Grant Underwood argues
                         that the Saints, who hoped to establish a refuge in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007523"
                              reg="Missouri">Missouri</region></placeName> from the
                         calamities preceding Christ&apos;s Second Coming, viewed the conflicts
                         through the lens of apocalyptic millenarianism. Intriguingly, not all
                         Missourians were hostile to Mormons, as Jean Pry and Dale Whitman
                         demonstrate in their study of the city of Columbia, where several Mormon
                         prisoners were incarcerated in 1839.</p>
                    <p>Finally, several essays examine Mormon interactions with <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007523"
                         reg="Missouri">Missouri</region></placeName> following
                         their expulsion from the state. Alexander Baugh, for instance, examines the
                         history of a planned Mormon temple in Far West, dedicated in 1838 but never
                         built. During a renewed interest in Missouri historic sites among Mormons
                         in the 1960s and 1970s, the Far West temple site was established as a
                         church historic site. However, the lack of a more extensive investigation
                         of how the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007523"
                              reg="Missouri">Missouri</region></placeName> experience shaped Mormon memory and identity, including
                         the twentieth-century establishment of a series of historic sites
                         well-visited by Mormon tourists, stands out as a significant omission.</p>
                    <p>Judging by their length, many of the chapters seem not to have advanced much
                         past the stage of their initial conference paper format. Nevertheless, this
                         volume contains sound scholarship and contributes much to the understanding
                         of both <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007523"

                    <p>Historian Rod Janzen and anthropologist Max Stanton collaborated to produce
                         this empathic and even apologetic account of the Hutterites, a small
                         Christian denomination that traces its origins to the early decades of the
                         Protestant Reformation (1520s and 1530s). In Europe, the Hutterites were
                         sometimes persecuted and pressured to give up aspects of their faith that
                         did not conform to the expectations of the nation states in which they
                         lived. In the 1870s, the Hutterites started migrating to the

                         where they received some assistance from other communal groups such as the
                         Harmony Society and the Amana Colony. Hutterites settled primarily in the

                    <p>Hutterites are distinct from most other Christian sects in that they believe
                         that all Christians should live in communities where property and other
                         assets are jointly owned. They trace this communitarian model to biblical
                         texts such as Acts 4:32: &quot;[N]o one claimed private ownership of any
                         possession, but everything they owned was held in common&quot;. Hutterites
                         are also pacifists following the example and teachings of Jesus. Hutterite
                         colonies are usually located in rural areas, and most depend primarily upon
                         agriculture for sustenance. Unlike the Old Order Amish, they use modern
                         appliances, machinery, vans, trucks, and in some cases even cell phones and

                    <p>The book provides a very readable brief description of just about every
                         aspect of Hutterite life: history, the four Hutterite branches, worship
                         practices, work, education, housing, spirituality, health (both physical
                         and mental), marriage and family, childhood, youth, old age, dress styles,
                         food, folk beliefs, personalities, governance, patriarchy, discipline,
                         recreational activities, defections from the colonies, relationships with
                         outsiders, and the economic structures of the communities. The on-again and
                         off-again relationship between the Hutterites and the Bruderhof (another
                         communal group that formed in the twentieth century) is mentioned in the
                         book, but not discussed in detail.</p>
                    <p>A real strength of this study is that it grows out of twenty-five years of
                         interactions with Hutterites on the part of the authors. They have been
                         able to observe how the colonies have changed as they interact with new
                         technologies, the outside world, and each other. They also know individuals
                         well enough to realize that although adherents are expected to follow a
                         strict code of conduct, they also are allowed leeway for individual
                         expression and exploration, especially during youth. When individuals <pb
                              n="180" id="VAA4025-107-2-098"/> deviate from expected behavior, the
                         community strives to restore them to fellowship, not drive them away.</p>
                    <p>The authors devote a considerable amount of space to describing the origins
                         of certain Hutterite core beliefs, such as living in community. More
                         attention might have been directed to their pacifism and how the doctrine
                         and practice separates them from the mainstream of Christianity and of
                         secular society. The book contains an extensive bibliography, a much-needed
                         glossary of Hutterisch (a German dialect) terms, and a listing of Hutterite
                         communities.</p>

                    <p>This volume collects previously published essays by J. Matthew Gallman, a
                         leading authority on the Civil War&apos;s Northern homefront, drawing
                         extensively on the work that resulted in his books <hi rend="i">Mastering
                              Wartime: A Social History of Philadelphia during the Civil War</hi>
                         (1990) and <hi rend="i">America&apos;s Joan of Arc: The Life of Anna
                              Elizabeth Dickinson</hi> (2006). Gallman intends this collection to
                         reveal trends in the profession as well as his scholarly career, although
                         he is more successful at the latter. There is, however, a telling moment
                         Gallman relates from Gettysburg College&apos;s Civil War Institute. His
                         presentation provoked an audience member to ask, &quot;Could you explain
                         why you were talking about women?&quot; This says as much about the
                         development of the new social history Gallman practices as it does about
                         the gulf that has emerged between historians and a Civil War public wedded
                         to the traditional military and historical narrative.</p>
                    <p>About one-third of the essays focus on <placeName><settlement type="city"
                         key="tgn_7014406" reg="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</settlement></placeName>&apos;s wartime
                         experience, another third on Dickinson, and the remainder on diverse topics
                         such as the war&apos;s impact on the Northern economy and on cities, the
                         Battle of Gettysburg&apos;s impact on the town, and black troops at the
                         battle of Olustee. There is some repetition of information, particularly in
                         the essays about Dickinson.</p>
                    <p>Gallman&apos;s work advances certain themes. He does not see the Civil War as
                         having brought great change, but rather views Northerners as having built
                         on pre-war institutions and roles to fulfill wartime needs. In one of his
                         case studies, Gallman looks at <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-107-2-099"/>
                         Philadelphia&apos;s Great Central Fair, a fundraising effort on behalf of
                         the Sanitary Commission. Historians have seen its scale—it lasted three
                         weeks and had a quarter-million visitors, including President and Mrs.
                         Lincoln—as signs of the increased public role of women and power of the
                         state. Gallman cautions that size does not mean change. Women served in the
                         same types of roles they had in pre-war organizations. Local benevolent
                         societies which had been the mainstay of <placeName><settlement type="city"
                              key="tgn_7014406" reg="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</settlement></placeName> philanthropy expanded
                         to carry out the fair. This theme of continuity with the pre-war period
                         continues in other essays. Gallman argues that policing in
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014406" reg="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</settlement></placeName>
                         during the war relied on the force built after the 1844 anti-immigrant
                         riot, that traditional gender roles shaped <placeName><settlement
                              type="city" key="tgn_7014060" reg="Gettysburg">Gettysburg</settlement></placeName> townspeople&apos;s
                         reaction to the battle, and that wartime demands and the government
                         contracting system failed to totally modernize the Northern economy.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, Dickinson&apos;s extraordinary oratorical talents allowed her to
                         expand but never fully escape woman&apos;s sphere. Gallman explores how
                         Dickinson, an abolitionist orator and chief support of her family, shaped a
                         career that went beyond rousing the Northern populace to patriotic support
                         of the war. She played a political role, reluctantly choosing to support
                         Lincoln&apos;s reelection in 1864 and controversially throwing her
                         influence to the liberal Republicans in 1872. Neither her supporters nor
                         her detractors, however, viewed her as a typical woman, indicating that her
                         prominence did not reflect an expanded definition of women&apos;s
                         roles.</p>

                         Hoosier state in this volume. They will find, however, a wealth of
                         interesting insights into the Civil War North presented in a well-written,
                         engaging volume by a master of the new social history.</p>

                    <p>Robin E. Jensen&apos;s <hi rend="i">Dirty Words</hi> adds to the growing
                         literature on the history of sex education in the <placeName><country
                              key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country></placeName>. Jensen,
                         who writes from a communication studies perspective, argues that
                         understanding the different rhetorical strategies of Gilded Age and
                         Progressive Era sex education promoters shows how sex instruction became
                         integrated—in however controversial and fragmented a fashion—into public
                         education in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. She is
                         particularly interested in the ways that ambiguous language alternately
                         advanced and impeded the causes of both pro- and anti-sex education
                         speakers. Jensen states explicitly that she is delineating those rhetorical
                         strategies in order to understand their deployment in present-day political
                         arguments concerning the scope and funding of sex education.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="i">Dirty Words</hi> examines five episodes in struggles over sex
                         education. Jensen begins with Anthony Comstock&apos;s work through the
                         Comstock Law to curtail distribution of sex-related language in print, and
                         Margaret Sanger&apos;s attempts to evade that law. Jensen then turns to the
                         efforts of Dr. Ella Flagg Young, the first female superintendent of the
                         Chicago Public Schools, to incorporate scientific sexual hygiene lessons
                         into the curriculum to promote the sexual health of low-income immigrant
                         children in the 1913-1914 school year. Jensen follows that discussion with
                         an examination of federal propaganda directed at World War I soldiers,
                         which openly and explicitly promoted sexual health and hygiene for military
                         fitness. She then looks at the efforts of another individual educator, Dr.
                         Rachelle Slobodinsky Yarros, a member of the American Social Hygiene
                         Association (ASHA) who advocated for sex education that particularly
                         targeted urban, low-income, immigrant women in order to slow rates of
                         venereal disease, prostitution, and pregnancy in <placeName><settlement
                              type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>. Jensen returns to
                         the federal level in her analysis of poster campaigns created by the U. S.
                         Health Service that specifically targeted women and African American men.
                         She concludes with an analysis of the different ways that the rhetoric of
                         Progressive Era sex educators foreshadowed the speech of modern-day sex
                         educators, concluding that &quot;discourse about public sex education in
                         the contemporary United States is driven by ambiguous language and produces
                         programs that fail to foster sexually healthy individuals&quot; (p.
                         159).</p>
                    <p>Jensen clearly demonstrates that political and social context shapes
                         speakers&apos; and writers&apos; decisions about <pb n="183"
                              id="VAA4025-107-2-101"/> whether to use clear or ambiguous language.
                         She also shows that speakers and writers decide on what language to use
                         based on their perceptions of their audiences, perceptions which are
                         informed by contemporary gender, class, and racial tropes. For example, the
                         wartime propaganda that the ASHA and Committee on Training Camp Activities
                         created for white soldiers was forthright regarding the possible effects of
                         syphilis and gonorrhea, but depended on portraying white women in only two
                         ways: either as prostitutes waiting to infect soldiers or as chaste
                         innocents waiting for them back home, needing education only their future
                         husbands could provide.</p>
                    <p>Many of the individuals and agencies Jensen discusses have been examined
                         previously in histories of these eras. The relatively unknown and most
                         intriguing voice in her study is that of Yarros, who as a Russian immigrant
                         female doctor used complicated rhetorical techniques to speak to women of
                         similar ethnic backgrounds, and to speak for them to the mostly white,
                         native-born, and middle-class ASHA. Whether or not contemporary sex
                         education promoters will find <hi rend="i">Dirty Words</hi> useful for
                         their own work is open to question, as deliberately ambiguous speech
                         promoting abstinence continues to be the most effective means of securing
                         federal funding. Nonetheless, Jensen&apos;s work complements existing
                         scholarship on sex education, adding nuance to understandings of
                         speakers&apos; and writers&apos; choices of words.</p>

                         Pierce makes clear, the heart of insurgency there rested on quite a
                         different basis than it did west of the <geogName key="tgn_7022231"

                         took to the new party, and <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706"
                             reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> lawmakers realized, as had Republicans
                         elsewhere, that timely concessions would blight any potential crop of angry
                         voters from their own ranks. A more promising ground lay among the urban
                         working class; unions, particularly in coal country, had strong reasons for
                         testing the alternatives. The industrial warfare that broke out in 1894
                         propelled the United Mine Workers into the Populist camp and led to Samuel
                         Gompers&apos;s one-year overthrow as head of the American Federation of
                         Labor. Workers knew what the Money Power could do when friendly judges
                         armed with strikebreaking injunctions meted out jail sentences for
                         cooperation in the Pullman strike. No Jute Trust, shoving the price of
                         cotton-bagging sky-high, could match the day-to-day impositions of the gas
                         and streetcar monopolies in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013608"

                         state campaigns, the Populists did a little better in <placeName><region
                              type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName>&apos;s three
                         largest cities. However, the party&apos;s decline did not drive labor
                         organizations out of politics again; instead, it only induced unions to
                         find new vehicles for making the major parties reckon with them. By 1901,
                         labor had become a force that politicians dared not ignore. For Boss
                         Cox&apos;s Cincinnati machine, the working class alliance became
                         indispensable; without the union insurgents&apos; support, Tom
                         Johnson&apos;s <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013608"
                              reg="Cleveland">Cleveland</settlement></placeName> revolution could not have happened. The real
                         harvest of the Populist-labor agitation from the 1890s, Pierce suggests,
                         came a dozen years into the new century with a fresh state constitution,
                         strong on direct democracy and government protections for <placeName><region
                              type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName>&apos;s
                         workers.</p>
                    <p>Heavily researched and insightful, <hi rend="i">Striking With the Ballot</hi>
                         oversells the Populist angle. Pierce&apos;s own numbers show that with or
                         without labor&apos;s help, the People&apos;s Party did embarrassingly badly
                         almost every time it ran a state ticket. Its labor adjuncts may have been
                         in the coalition, but never really of it-certainly not where the national
                         Populist program, free silver and all, was concerned. But so what? What
                         Pierce reminds us matters far more: that Progressivism did not just come
                         out of the &quot;ministers of reform&quot; and middle class do-gooders, but
                         out of an urban working class concerned about immediate injustices. Had he
                         looked nationally, he would have found that his pattern held true in many
                         other places. For New Yorkers, the Steel Trust may have been a theoretical
                         evil, but the Ice Trust, the Gas Trust, and Thomas P. Ryan&apos;s Traction
                         Trust brought the evil home every day—and in Ryan&apos;s case, carried it
                         to and from work. Scholars of Populism could hardly do better than to
                         stretch the track that Pierce <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-107-2-103"/> has laid
                         into those states where, like <placeName><region

                         came.</p>

                         capital. Ganz&apos;s book explores themes of gender, as well as ethnicity
                         and social class, and places the fair in historical perspective.</p>
                    <p>The city&apos;s business elite saw the Century of Progress International
                         Exposition of 1933 as a way to distance <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596"
                              reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> from its reputation as Al
                         Capone&apos;s city. The leaders of the fair shared a common experience
                         during World War I and saw technology as a guiding principle for progress.
                         Approaching the fair like a military campaign, Rufus C. Dawes and his
                         brother, U.S. Vice President Charles C. Dawes, shepherded the exposition
                         through the storm of the Great Depression, privately funding it and
                         actually making a profit after a two- year run. In turn, Lenox R. Lohr, who
                         had risen to the rank of Major during the war, brought his considerable
                         organizational skills to the role of the fair&apos;s general manager (and
                         went on to head <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596"
                              reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>&apos;s famous Museum of Science and Industry).
                         These men and others like them embodied the belief that engineering,
                         technological advances, and good organization could solve any problem and
                         bring about progress. The fair itself brought optimism to an anxious
                         Depression-era populace that flocked to the second of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596"

                         world&apos;s fairs.</p>
                    <p>Not surprisingly, ethnicity played an important role at the fair. The
                         author&apos;s discussion of the part played by African American clubwomen
                         is most interesting. Despite the racism of the times, they were able to
                         have an impact on the fair and its representation of Jean Baptiste DuSable
                         as <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago"

                         ethnic diversity and an emerging Democratic political machine. Ganz also
                         throws light on the role of both Nazi <placeName><country key="tgn_7000084"

                         depict itself as a modern industrial society by tying itself to the

                         social, political, economic, and historical context. This beautifully
                         illustrated book tells the story of the fair not simply from the
                         perspective of its architecture or the formidable economic obstacles
                         presented by the Great Depression, but from the perspective of women&apos;s
                         history, ethnic history, and the social and political background of
                         organizers. It is a significant contribution to both the study of

                         <lb/>By Benjamin C. Pykles <lb/>(<placeName><settlement type="city"

                    <p>Benjamin C. Pykles sets out to tell two related stories in his fascinating
                         book. The broad strokes of the book tell the story of the emergence of
                         historical archaeology as an organized, professional, academic discipline
                         in the middle of the twentieth century. The second story deals with the
                         rise of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints-sponsored Nauvoo
                         Restoration, Inc. (NRI), and the move of that organization away from
                         historical archaeology toward a religiously driven proselytizing
                         enterprise. While Pykles uses the latter as a case study to explain the
                         former, the story of NRI turns out to be much more than that.</p>
                    <p>Pykles does a fine job of summarizing the basic contours of historical
                         archaeology in the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                                   >United States</country></placeName> from the origins of the
                         nascent discipline in the late nineteenth century to its fully developed
                         professional expression in the mid-twentieth century. He also deftly
                         handles a precis of Mormon history that gives non-specialists a firm
                         enough grip on the <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-107-2-105"/> church&apos;s
                         complex history to be able to follow the story that he wants to tell. And
                         what a story it is. The drama centers on the tiny town of
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014193"
                              reg="Nauvoo">Nauvoo</settlement></placeName>, <placeName><region
                                   type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois">Illinois</region></placeName>,
                         where the Mormons settled in 1839 and from which they were forcibly driven
                         in 1846. It is also the town in which Joseph Smith lived from 1839 until
                         his murder in 1844. Given the significance of the city in Mormon history,
                         it is no surprise that the LDS Church began to take an interest in
                         restoring the sites in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014193"
                              reg="Nauvoo">Nauvoo</settlement></placeName> once the church had grown sufficiently
                         prosperous and accepted by American culture.</p>
                    <p>The heart of this book, and its greatest contribution, lies in the narrative
                         of the conflict between Mormon archaeologists and Mormon religious leaders
                         over the ultimate purpose of the restoration work at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014193"
                              reg="Nauvoo">Nauvoo</settlement></placeName>. Pykles&apos;s
                         book makes room for itself in a growing body of scholarly literature
                         dealing with the creation and manipulation of public memory, through the
                         use of historical documents and historic sites, by LDS Church leaders. The
                         story of NRI provides a particularly clear case study of this phenomenon.
                         In the early phases of the work at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014193"
                              reg="Nauvoo">Nauvoo</settlement></placeName>, archaeologists focused on how to
                         accurately recreate the 1840s-era buildings. In 1971, however, the church
                         restructured NRI, which had been driven by a &quot;secular approach...
                         since its inception&quot; (p. 149). From that point on, the church
                         instructed NRI to focus on only those things that would aid in
                         proselytizing. As a result of this move, organizations such as the National
                         Park Service and Colonial Williamsburg withdrew what had previously been
                         eager hands of fellowship. The result of this process is evident today to

                         restoration at odds with most projects undertaken by historical
                         archaeologists that seek to provide an anthropological and cultural context
                         for the restored sites (p. 304). Despite the wonderful contribution the
                         book makes to Mormon studies, this reviewer is led to wonder on behalf of
                         historical archaeologists why Pykles chose such an unusual and atypical
                         site as <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014193"
                              reg="Nauvoo">Nauvoo</settlement></placeName> for his case study. However, readers interested in the

                         history, or in religious groups&apos; struggles to control public
                         perceptions of their past will find this book rewarding.</p>

                         entry points for analyses of several thematic aspects of Lincoln&apos;s
                         historical and remembered identity: youthful visionary and rough-hewn
                         frontiersman, statesman and war-weary commander-in-chief, Great
                         Emancipator, man of sorrows, and democratic icon. Along the way, Percoco
                         shares tales of his own quest to learn about both the monuments and the
                         sixteenth president, a quest that led him through archival collections,
                         published literature, and conversations with scholars. Finally, the book
                         explicates his efforts to convey his findings and his passion to students,
                         young and old.</p>
                    <p>For the most part, the histories of the monuments and the unfolding
                         interpretations of Lincoln have been documented more thoroughly and
                         scrutinized more minutely elsewhere. The author joins a long line of
                         pilgrims—with Lincoln&apos;s law partner William Herndon being probably the
                         most provocative and journalist Ida Tarbell possibly the most
                         persuasive—who have chased Lincoln across the landscape almost since the
                         moment of his death. Percoco&apos;s real strength—and the book&apos;s
                         unique contribution—lies in his ability to narrate in moving detail the
                         powerful transformation that occurs when a teacher ignites the fire of
                         learning in his students. Chapter One, his account of Ball&apos;s <hi
                              rend="i">Freedmen&apos;s Monument</hi>, stands out as a singularly
                         rich description of a conversation between smart, twenty-first-century
                         teens and a master teacher who leads them from an analysis of monumental
                         design and symbolism into a deeper understanding of both the meaning of
                         slavery in American history and its enduring legacy of racism.</p>

                         Lincoln will no doubt be saddened by Percoco&apos;s appendix, which shows
                         that Hoosiers have erected only six statues to Lincoln—a far cry from
                         Illinois&apos;s nation-leading forty-two, and a smaller number than twelve
                         of the thirty-four states in which one can find statues of Lincoln.

                    <p>Jennifer Pustz&apos;s <hi rend="i">Voices from the Back Stairs</hi> offers a
                         guide to museum professionals seeking to address a longstanding concern:
                         how to interpret the lives of domestic servants who lived and labored in
                         historic homes. Pustz, who works as the museum historian for Historic New
                         England, brings firsthand experience to this issue. Her objective in
                         writing the book was to research and share &quot;new ways to authentically
                         interpret the lives of people whose presence at historic houses is often
                         ephemeral but are as significant as those who employed them&quot; (p.
                         5).</p>
                    <p>The author&apos;s approach is directly informed by recent scholarship on the
                         public history of slavery and the silenced or romanticized histories of
                         slavery presented in tours of southern plantation homes. Based on the
                         results of a national survey she conducted, Pustz observes that historic
                         homes have been equally reluctant to interpret domestic service critically,
                         even as many sites have embraced the more inclusive mission of the new
                         social history. Many sites believe that there is an insufficient body of
                         evidence to tell domestics&apos; stories and that they lack the financial
                         resources to conduct substantial new research. As a result, historic homes
                         that have interpreted servants as part of their programming have done so in
                         a manner that either depicts relations between servants and employers as
                         implacably harmonious or relegates servants to the background as part of
                         a separate history.</p>
                    <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-107-2-108"/>
                    <p>Pustz highlights the &quot;servant problem&quot;-the voluble and persistent
                         claims of middle-class Americans that they were unable to find capable
                         domestic laborers—as an accessible point of entry for interpreting domestic
                         service in historic homes. In the years 1865 to 1920, employers and social
                         reformers viewed the servant problem both as a class issue, in that the
                                   <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United
                                   States</country></placeName> purportedly lacked an ample supply
                         of native-born white working-class women willing to enter into such a
                         stigmatized occupation, and as one of race and ethnicity. Employers, for
                         example, routinely commented on the insufficiencies of the Irish
                         &quot;Biddy&quot; while celebrating the stereotype of the African American
                         &quot;Mammy.&quot; The servant problem allows interpreters to make
                         connections to broader themes in American history while also demonstrating
                         to visitors how servants and employers held sharply differing opinions on
                         the roots of the alleged problem. Pustz finds other ways to creatively
                         interpret domestic service, even when documents and material objects are
                         lacking. She notes that the architecture of historic homes can provide
                         insight into servants&apos; lives by posing such questions as &quot;Do
                         servants&apos; bedrooms have access to heat?&quot; and &quot;Where did
                         servants enter the house?&quot; (p. 129). Pustz also includes two
                         photographic essays with images ranging from family photographs of servants
                         to advertisements depicting servants using household goods; she accompanies
                         the photographs with advice on how museum professionals might use the
                         materials to provoke discussion.</p>
                    <p>While Pustz&apos;s practical suggestions are helpful, her argument that
                         visitors will be drawn to more &quot;authentic&quot; interpretations of
                         historic homes is not fully developed. Today, domestic work in the
                         <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United
                         States</country></placeName> is done primarily by immigrant women of color, displaced from their
                         own homes by the globalization of capital and labor. Many
                         Americans—including those likely to visit historic homes—readily exploit
                         these inequalities. Pustz, however, wavers over how forceful interpreters
                         and curators of historic homes should be when making connections to the
                         present, since such connections can be viewed as &quot;political
                         statements&quot; (p. 137). Her focus on authenticity belies the fact that
                         the incorporation of servants&apos; histories and lives, whether in the
                         past or present, is a political act in its own right. Nonetheless, <hi
                              rend="i">Voices from the Back Stairs</hi> will function as a useful
                         resource for historic house museums wishing to advance a more comprehensive
                         interpretation of the lives of the servants who worked there.</p>

                    <p>Marsha Williamson Mohr&apos;s thoughtful photographs of <placeName><region
                         type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s barns
                         elevate these fixtures of the Hoosier countryside to an art form, and
                         Duncan Campbell&apos;s opening words help to contextualize barns in the
                         nation&apos;s agricultural history. Readers will find vivid color
                         photographs of round barns, English barns, tobacco barns, and others taken
                         across the state, in every season of the year, between the covers of this
                         volume. They will also discover something more: a new appreciation for
                         barns not just as utilitarian structures, but as steadfast sentinels of the
                         landscape, grounded and purposeful, offering both shelter and a chance for
                         reflection.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="i">The Genius</hi>
                         <lb/>By Theodore Dreiser; edited by Clare Virginia Eby

                    <p>Theodore Dreiser&apos;s 1915 novel, <hi rend="i">The Genius</hi>, was heavily
                         edited in order to make it acceptable to censors. Nevertheless, the work
                         was considered so shocking that the New York Society for the Suppression of
                         Vice banned its publication until 1923. Eby presents readers with the
                         original version of Dreiser&apos;s most autobiographical, soul-searching
                         piece as it was written in 1911. In that earlier manuscript, both the
                         characters and the plot develop along a different trajectory than they do
                         in the later work. <hi rend="i">The Genius</hi> is set against a backdrop
                         of seismic changes in American culture, particularly in the worlds of art
                         and literature; the characters in this story must wrestle with what it
                         means to be &quot;modern&quot; in both their personal lives and their
                         creative output. Dreiser&apos;s novel is not an easy read, but Eby&apos;s
                         notes help to place the work in its social and cultural context.</p>

                    <p>As a boy growing up on Ashland Street in <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis"
                              >Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>, all Walter Bedell Smith ever
                         wanted was to be a soldier. At 16, he enlisted as a private in the Indiana
                         National Guard. Smith&apos;s journey from those rather ordinary beginnings
                         to the pinnacle of military achievement (highly decorated four-star general
                         and Eisenhower&apos;s chief of staff in Europe) is the subject of
                         Crosswell&apos;s biography. This lengthy work detailing Smith&apos;s
                         professional life is part of the Association of the United States
                         Army&apos;s &quot;American Warriors&quot; series, which may help explain
                         its heavy focus on Smith&apos;s Army years. While Crosswell devotes the
                         first part of this book to Smith&apos;s later careers in the diplomatic and
                         intelligence arenas during the early years of the Cold War, those postings
                         seem almost bitterly anticlimactic; the lion&apos;s share of this volume
                         concentrates on Smith&apos;s service in two world wars and in the interwar
                         years. It is here that the book hits its stride, and Crosswell spares no
                         detail, from Smith&apos;s first assignment providing aid during
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"

                         devastating flood of 1913 to the book&apos;s climax, which has Smith
                         presiding over Germany&apos;s surrender on May 7, 1945.</p>

                         $19.95.)</p>

                    <p>Although today he is largely remembered as one of the leaders of a legendary
                         expedition, William Clark enjoyed a lengthy and influential career after
                         his exploits with Meriwether Lewis. Jay H. Buckley concentrates on
                         Clark&apos;s life from 1807 to 1838, when he worked as an Indian agent,
                         territorial governor, and superintendent of Indian affairs, facilitating
                         the federal program of Indian removal. Buckley relies heavily on
                         Clark&apos;s own papers, affording the reader an authentic picture of the
                         mentality of &quot;a Jeffersonian man in a Jacksonian world.&quot; In the
                         end, Clark emerges from this portrait as an appropriately complex figure in
                         American history, neither all hero nor all villain.</p>

                    <p>Mark Reinhardt sets out to explore the facts complementing the <pb n="193"
                              id="VAA4025-107-2-111"/> prize-winning fiction of Toni Morrison&apos;s
                         acclaimed 1987 novel, <hi rend="i">Beloved</hi>. Rather than trying to
                         debunk what Morrison herself has proclaimed a work of imagination,
                         Reinhardt offers readers excerpts from primary sources related to one of
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio"

                         notorious fugitive slave cases of the 1850s, including news reports, court
                         proceedings, interviews, letters, legislative debates, sermons, and
                         editorials. Thanks to Reinhardt, readers can determine the meaning of the
                         Garner case for themselves after sifting through the various documents,
                         which are rife with the biases and competing agendas of those involved in
                         their production. The records Reinhardt presents may enable readers to
                         arrive at new, more complex understandings of slavery, race, gender, and
                         politics, and to recognize, with Morrison herself, that there is more than
                         one way to interpret this often contradictory and ambiguous narrative.</p>

                    <p>At first glance, a book about eight moribund rail lines may seem a bad idea
                         for a recessionary time. Who wants to read about failed business ventures
                         from a hundred years ago? But H. Roger Grant makes a convincing case that
                         success is not always defined by the amount of red ink on one&apos;s
                         balance sheet. Although Grant&apos;s small-town rail lines were ultimately
                         rendered obsolete by the highway system, their construction generated real
                         economic development—along with excitement at becoming
                         &quot;connected&quot; with the outside world—in the communities they
                         served. Farmers accessed broader markets, land values rose, and local
                         businesses expanded. Hoosier rail fans will be especially interested in
                         Grant&apos;s discussion of the St. Joseph Valley Railway. The Valley Line
                         was actually a hybrid system combining electric, gasoline, and
                         steam-powered engines that aspired to connect <placeName><settlement

                         tells us, the Valley Line&apos;s trackage filled a niche for both farmers
                         and summer vacationers and left a commercial network as its legacy.</p>

                    <p>Claude Clegg, a professor of history at Indiana University, was examining
                         photographs of American lynching when he came upon one grisly depiction of
                         a 1906 episode in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2076487"

                                   >North Carolina</region></placeName>. Clegg had never heard of
                         the event, but he knew the place well: it was his hometown. Determined to
                         find out the details of the incident, as well as of its seeming erasure
                         from history, the author has produced a probing examination of the roles
                         played by memory, power, and identity in shaping our attitudes toward the
                         demons of the past. Whereas James Madison&apos;s account of the 1930

                         black mayor in 1998), Clegg&apos;s chronicle of the lynching—and its
                         aftermath—proves complicated and more troubling. True enough, the state of
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007709"

                         convicted one of the mob, George Hall, and sentenced him to fifteen years
                         in prison. It is true, as well, that Salisbury elected its own black mayor
                         in 1981. Yet these developments, Clegg contends, are small consolation for
                         this unsettling story of the New South-they do not bring closure, only more
                         questions.</p>
