            <p>By the millions they came to see the greatest of all world's fairs. By train and by
                    steamship, from every state and territory and from over a hundred nations and colonies, the great
                    crowd traveled to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    </placeName> Park. Between May 1 and the end of October, 1893, over twenty-eight million people
                    visited the splendid white palaces of the World's Columbian Exposition. They saw buildings
                    of unprecedented size and beauty, and they walked among gardens, lawns, and lagoons representing the
                    highest achievement of the landscape architect. The exhibits—more than one hundred sixty
                    thousand in number—summarized the material achievements of western civilization at the
                    end of the nineteenth century. Huge engines and powerful dynamos reflected the main emphasis of this
                    age of energy, but some of the greatest art the world had produced was also on display together with
                    evidences of educational progress.</p>

                    </placeName>'s world's fair surpassed all of its predecessors in size, cost, and
                    impact. It was a stunning triumph for the metropolis that a scant twenty years earlier lay in ashes. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s brashness and wealth made the Columbian Exposition possible, but it took the
                    active involvement of people throughout America and the world to create a fair so impressive that it
                    still awes those who study it. Much has been written about Daniel Burnham, John Wellborn Root,
                    Augustus Saint Gaudens, Frederick Law Olmsted, and the other architects, artists, and sculptors who
                    created that <list type="footnotes">

                    however, has been said about the involvement of the various American states and territories with the
                        fair.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a group, the forty-four states and territories represented at the fair spent over four million
                    dollars. Virtually every state and territory established a world's fair commission to plan,
                    collect, arrange, install, and manage its exhibits. Many erected buildings at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> Park which served as clubhouses for their citizens and as display areas for art,
                    educational, historical, and natural resource exhibits.</p>
            <p>Political leaders and citizens in the states and territories supported world's fair
                    activities for a variety of reasons. Some felt it was the patriotic thing to do; others sought to
                    avoid the embarrassment of a poor showing at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> by their state in comparison with others. Nearly everyone hoped that handsome and
                    expensive displays of their states' products and resources would stimulate business,
                    attract capital, and encourage immigration. In different combinations, profit, patriotism, and local
                    pride spurred vigorous competition among the states and territories. For two years before the
                    exposition gates opened, local world's fair boards worked hard to interest their fellow
                    citizens in the enterprise and to encourage businessmen to exhibit their products. In addition, the
                    boards arranged for state-sponsored exhibits in agriculture, forestry, mines and mining, and other
                    departments of the fair.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without the work of those state and territorial boards, the exposition could not have succeeded.
                    Their activity accounted for a substantial portion of the exhibits gracing the display halls at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> Park. Of equal importance, the local world's fair boards helped encourage
                    attendance at the fair. The publicity they generated kept the fair before the public. Moreover, the
                    thousands who contributed money or exhibits for the exposition had a personal motive for attending
                    the event. Their patronage proved essential to the fair, which constantly teetered on the edge of
                    financial disaster.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Indiana offers a useful example of how individual states and territories participated in the
                    world's fair. Among the larger states in 1893, Indiana had developed a strong manufacturing
                    capability to match its agricultural strength. The state was important in national politics and also
                    boasted a remarkable array of writers, thinkers, and social activists. It was the age of Eugene V.
                    Debs, Benjamin Harrison, May Wright Sewall, Booth Tarkington, Lew Wallace, and James Whitcomb Riley.
                    Boisterous and booming, proud of its progress, and eager to be recognized as a center of American
                    civilization, Indiana typified many states of the era in its desire to achieve recognition at the
                    world's fair.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agitation for a great world's fair to celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of the
                    discovery of America began in earnest in 1889. Four cities—<placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>, <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>—vied for the honor of hosting such an exposition. After a spirited contest,
                    Congress awarded the prize to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which had pledged ten million dollars for the event. In this political struggle <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> enjoyed the support of every Indiana representative and senator save one. President
                    Harrison of Indiana signed the world's fair bill in April, 1890. The bill mandated the
                    creation of a national commission to oversee the planning and other aspects of the exposition. The
                    law also required the commission to name a Board of Lady Managers to supervise women's
                    participation in the fair.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In June, 1890, Governor Alvin Hovey nominated Elijah B. Martindale of <placeName>

            <p>Several of Indiana's national representatives emerged as leading figures in the
                    world's fair. Martindale, a former judge who had also been involved in the state's
                    efforts at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, served on the executive committee of the national commission and chaired the buildings
                    and grounds committee. Meredith, who ran a large cattle-breeding farm in eastern Indiana and had
                    administered an agricultural program at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, was closely associated with Chicagoan Bertha Palmer, president of the Board of Lady
                    Managers. She also served as parliamentarian of the board. Kraut worked as a reporter for the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">InterOcean</hi> and established a room in the fair's Woman's Building
                    for women correspondents. The Indiana appointments to the commission and to the Board of Lady
                    Managers were generally well regarded by the press.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>Martindale took the lead in seeking the support of the governor and legislature for a statewide
                    effort on behalf of the world's fair. In September, 1890, he told reporters that Indiana
                    could not afford to ignore the fair. Geographic proximity as well as the unparalleled opportunities
                    for advertising state products and resources forced Indiana to make a "creditable
                    exhibit." This could only happen, he argued, with the establishment of a statewide
                    organization and the appropriation of ample funds by the legislature. He called for the erection of
                    a state building at the fair and warned that other states were ahead of Indiana in planning their
                    exhibits. A few months later Martindale joined Indiana's other national fair
                    representatives in calling upon Governor Hovey to propose to the legislature the appointment of a
                    state world's fair board. They also asked the governor for "an appropriation as
                    will secure a liberal and creditable display of the resources of the State of Indiana at the
                    World's Columbian Exposition."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>In March, 1891, the General Assembly passed a world's fair bill, noting that "it is
                    of great importance that the natural resources, industrial development, and general progress of the
                    State of Indiana should be fully and creditably displayed to the world at such Exposition."
                    The bill established the Indiana Board of World's Fair Managers. The governor was to

                    geologist, and the chief of the Indiana Bureau of Statistics. Altogether, there were thirty-eight
                    members of the board. The managers were permitted by law to name an executive committee that could
                    act on behalf of the larger body. The legislature, which originally entertained a proposal for a
                    three-hundred-thousand-dollar appropriation, eventually determined on a figure of seventy-five
                    thousand dollars. With this the managers were to gather, transport, arrange, and exhibit all Indiana
                    displays. The managers could spend part of the money to pay the salaries of a secretary and of an
                    executive commissioner whom they were authorized to hire. Language in the bill specifically called
                    upon the managers to mount a state exhibit in <placeName>

            <p>In implementing the world's fair legislation, Hovey chose to appoint a Republican and a

                    organizations at the state, national, and international levels. Perhaps most importantly, she was

            </p>
            <p>Partisan politics bedeviled the board of managers from the beginning. Almost all of the members were
                    active participants in the state's volatile politics and were determined not to permit
                    their adversaries to benefit politically from the world's fair effort. Even before the
                    initial meeting in Hovey's office, the Republican and Democratic managers caucused to
                    discuss the selection of board officers and the executive commissioner. Negotiations between the two
                    partisan groups led to an agreement. The Republicans were to name the president and secretary.
                    Democrats, on the other hand, received the right to select the executive commissioner. As a result,
                    the meeting with the governor went smoothly. Studebaker accepted the presidency after the governor
                    declined a courtesy offer. Several candidates, including the governor's private secretary,
                    lobbied board members for the appointment as secretary; William T. Noble of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> won the election. Other officers included Charles B. Stuart of <placeName>

                    initial organization when Studebaker appointed committees, including the executive committee. The
                    committee structure closely followed the departmental structure of the Columbian Exposition. Thus,
                    the Indiana managers had committees to organize exhibits for agriculture, livestock, machinery and
                    manufacturing, building materials, mines and mining, education, and women's work. In
                    addition, a committee was assigned to supervise the construction of a state building at the fair.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

                    Committee on Women's Work. The active involvement of women in Indiana's
                    world's fair activities proved a wise move as they soon demonstrated a tireless commitment

            <p>Before adjourning their first meeting, the managers made several significant decisions relating to
                    the proposed state building at the fair, which everyone agreed would be Indiana's most
                    important exhibit. The executive committee was ordered to obtain a building site and to conduct a
                    competition among architects to secure the most attractive design for the structure. Prizes were to
                    be awarded for the best proposals with the first-place winner receiving three hundred dollars.
                    Architects were to limit building costs to twenty-five thousand dollars and to plan construction

                    respective areas. On May 18 the board reassembled and approved the committee reports which together
                    constituted a statement of the plan and scope of the Indiana exhibits. In sum, the board pledged
                    itself to a massive and comprehensive exhibit encompassing agriculture, manufacturing, mining,
                    forestry, education, charity, art, literature, and women's work in the state. It was an

            <p>While the various committees labored to interest their constituencies in supporting a display at the
                    fair, the board's executive committee launched plans for a state building. In August they

                    not have imagined the ultimate beauty that would emerge eighteen months later. Perhaps because of
                    Martindale's influence as chair of the national commission's buildings and grounds
                    committee, the executive committee obtained one of the choice sites for their structure: a <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In September, 1891, the state board of managers reassembled in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They confronted two major controversial issues: selecting a design for the state
                    building and choosing an executive commissioner. Both problems dragged the board into political
                    difficulties. The design contest had attracted six competitors, all from Indiana. On September 10
                    the executive committee met and discussed the several designs and narrowed the choice to two plans,
                    one from D.A. Bohlen &amp; Son of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the other from Wing &amp; Mahurin of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. But at the afternoon session Studebaker and Martindale presented a design by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> architect Henry Ives Cobb. Despite the protests of the Indiana architects that the Cobb
                    plan had arrived after the deadline and that an Indiana architect should receive the commission, the
                    executive committee voted to recommend the Cobb design to the full board. The reasons behind the
                    submission and acceptance of Cobb's plan are not entirely clear. Significantly, though,
                    Cobb had designed Studebaker's home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Also, Martindale undoubtedly knew Cobb's work since the Chicagoan was the
                    architect of the Fish and Fisheries Building at the exposition, which Martindale's
                    buildings and grounds committee had reviewed along with the other fair buildings.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By recommending Cobb, the executive committee aroused the ire of the press and the legislature. When
                    the full board met on September 11, journalists, legislators, and the offended Indiana architects
                    were present. One state senator, who had supported the world's fair bill, angrily told the
                    board that the bill would never have passed had the state assembly known that a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> architect would be paid with Indiana tax dollars to design the Indiana Building.
                    Despite such angry denunciations, the board confirmed the choice of the Cobb plan. Many of the
                    managers expressed reservations, but nearly everyone acknowledged the superiority of the
                    Chicagoan's scheme. A majority accepted Martindale's argument that state honor was
                    better served by adopting the best design, even if it was not submitted by a local architect. If
                    aesthetically defensible, the decision harmed the board's public image as well as its
                    relationship with the legislature.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>The board of managers proceeded to complicate its political situation further by choosing Benjamin F.
                    Havens, a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> Republican, as executive commissioner. In spite of earlier pledges to permit the
                    Democratic managers to select the executive commissioner, the Republican members worked hard for
                    Havens's election and exploited the fact that the Democrats split their votes among several
                    candidates. A former state legislator and mayor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Havens proved to be an effective administrator. His appointment, however, aroused
                    concerns about whether the board of managers would be bipartisan. With Republicans holding the three
                    major fair offices, relations with Democratic public officials would be predictably difficult.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the time being, at least, Indiana's world's fair effort progressed smoothly
                    under Havens's leadership. By March, 1892, bids had been received for constructing the
                    state building and a contract issued to the Ohm &amp; Collins Company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. A special committee of the board, with Havens's assistance, solicited the
                    state's limestone, forestry, and tile-making industries for contributions of materials to
                    be used in the building. Many gave freely, believing that the building would stand as an
                    advertisement for their products. The committee also sought out companies to donate furnishings and
                    decorations. Eventually twenty Indiana businesses contributed over ten thousand dollars'
                    worth of materials. The Committee on Women's Work also helped with the building by
                    appealing to women's organizations throughout the state. The women responded by providing
                    drawings, paintings, decorated china, handmade curtains, inlaid tables, and several large
                        statues.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Throughout 1892 the various committees of the board worked feverishly to arouse public interest in
                    the fair and to gather the best exhibits they could. Havens helped by sending out thousands of
                    letters and circulars to merchants and manufacturers. Several committees found it useful to work
                    through existing agencies. The Committee on Agriculture, for example, was aided by the State Board
                    of Agriculture and county committees responsible for running county fairs. In addition, the
                    committee enlisted the professional expertise of several Purdue University faculty members in

            <p>Two of the board committees, women's work and education, were particularly active in

                    an aggressive campaign to involve the women of Indiana in the fair. Relying heavily on
                    women's clubs and literary societies, Sewall and her committee sought to exhibit fully the
                    economic, artistic, and intellectual contributions of Indiana women. Although the committee
                    encouraged women to make exhibits in all departments of the great fair, it was primarily concerned
                    with soliciting donations for the Indiana Building and the Woman's Building.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                    including Clement Studebaker's wife, accepted the invitation. Williamson also visited

            </p>
            <p>As early as June, 1892, the board learned from its committees that the original
                    seventy-five-thousand-dollar appropriation would not be sufficient to carry out its plans. In fact,
                    the board predicted that an additional one hundred thirty-five thousand dollars would be needed to
                    complete the state building, mount the exhibits, and cover other costs. Since the legislature did
                    not meet again until early 1893, the board decided to proceed on the assumption that the assembly
                    would provide more money. No one seemed willing to reduce the scope of the exhibit to fit the
                    existing appropriation.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>In appealing for more funds the board confronted a difficult political situation. The choice of Cobb
                    as architect for the state building had rankled some legislators. Of more immediate concern, the
                    fall elections had produced Democratic majorities in both houses of the legislature while the
                    leadership of the board remained Republican. Nonetheless, in late December, 1892, the board sent a
                    lengthy report of its progress to Governor Ira J. Chase and requested that he urge the legislature
                    to appropriate an additional one hundred thirty-five thousand dollars for fair work. Chase expressed
                    strong support for the board in a message to the legislature delivered January 9, 1893. "I
                    cannot speak too strongly in behalf of this great work," said Chase. "It is an
                    opportunity never again to be realized for the State to take her proper place in the front rank with
                    the leading States of the Union." Chase reminded the legislators that no state could match
                    Indiana's varied resources. Indiana produced more coal than any other state west of the
                    Alleghenies. Its building stone enjoyed a national market. Its oil fields "have become the
                    most extensive," while its natural gas production "is without equal
                    anywhere." He asked if most Hoosiers even realized that the state contained the
                    world's largest wagon and plow factories. Moreover, Chase noted, Indiana had
                    glass-producing plants and a reaper and mower company that ranked among the biggest in the nation.
                    All of this, he argued, needed to be made clear to everyone, including Indiana's own
                    citizens. The governor concluded by stating that the state had the necessary funds and that the
                    legislators should "not hesitate in the great duty before us."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The legislature, for its part, appointed world's fair committees in both houses and then
                    buried the appropriation measure in a procedural tangle. Democrats openly questioned whether the
                    board had wisely spent the money already appropriated. In late January, Havens and the state
                    world's fair board, in an effort to save the bill, proposed that both houses travel by
                    train to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to see the exposition grounds and the Indiana Building. The board hoped that a
                    firsthand view of the partially finished white palaces of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> Park would persuade the legislators that the board needed more money to represent the
                    state properly. After some hesitation the two houses declined the invitation, preferring to dispatch
                    their world's fair committees to conduct a joint investigation.</p>

                    the twin towers that rose from either side of the structure. At several points along the tour many
                    of the legislators expressed strong approval both of the fair and Indiana's effort,
                    promising that the pending appropriation would soon pass the legislature.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> on January 29 printed a long story conveying a very different impression.
                    The <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> claimed that many of the Indiana legislators were angered at their
                    treatment on the trip. Allegedly these individuals objected to the inclusion of many friends of the
                    state world's fair managers in the party and to the location of the rooms they had been
                    assigned in the hotel. There was also a charge that these legislators had felt compelled to support
                    the appropriation publicly as a matter of state pride when, in fact, they still entertained serious
                    reservations about its wisdom. They believed, said the <hi rend="i">Tribune,</hi> that Havens had
                    placed them in an embarrassing position. Although the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> story elicited
                    denials from legislators who had made the trip, it was clear that legislative hostility toward the
                    exposition appropriation had increased. Indeed, a few days after the <placeName>

                    </placeName> excursion, the House of Representatives approved without dissent a peremptory demand
                    that the state board of world's fair managers provide a full accounting of all prior
                        expenditures.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>The world's fair appropriation languished in the legislature until March when a bill was
                    finally sent to the governor. The legislation abolished the position of secretary of the state
                    world's fair board, prohibited meetings of the full board at state expense, gave full
                    supervisory authority to the executive committee, and appropriated a mere fifty thousand dollars to
                    complete all work on the exhibits. It was a case of being too little and far too late. The fair was
                    to open in less than two months. The executive <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The Democratic majorities in the legislature had reacted to what they perceived to be a partisan
                    political situation. The behavior of the world's fair board certainly had contributed to
                    this impression. Still, the legislature's action was both shortsighted and unfair. Whatever
                    the politics of its members, the board of managers had served the state well. They had devoted
                    nearly two years of their lives to the fair and had planned for exhibits that would have fully
                    expressed Indiana's claims to national recognition. Now, working with inadequate funds, the
                    board could not hope to compete at the fair with many other states of comparable size and
                    importance. To its credit, the board did not resign but determined to do the best it could under the
                    circumstances.</p>
            <p>As the May opening date of the Columbian Exposition approached, excitement mounted throughout

            <p>The Indiana Building was officially dedicated on June 15, 1893. Thousands of Hoosiers took advantage
                    of reduced railroad fares and journeyed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to join in the celebration. The building, which cost sixty-four thousand dollars if the
                    value of donated materials is included, was a striking structure. Cobb, its architect, called the
                    building "baronial." Others described it as French Gothic in style. In size it was
                    102 feet wide and 142 feet long including the broad, hospitable verandas. The building sported
                    numerous pinnacles and two imposing towers each 120 feet tall. Gables of gothic design stood above
                    each window and door. In the center of each gable was engraved the Indiana seal. Indiana stone and a
                    substance called staff composed the exterior walls, which were a deep gray in color. The roof of the
                    three-story structure was covered with red and gray shingles. Stone, particularly <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName> limestone, was prominently displayed not only in the walls but in the steps, doorways,
                    and massive fireplaces. An ornamental balustrade surrounded the verandas, which had floors of
                    Indiana hardwood. The first floor was divided between a large assembly hall to the south and
                    men's and women's lounges, a post office, and a checkroom to the north. Reading
                    and committee rooms occupied the second floor, while a large lunchroom filled much of the third
                    story. Throughout the building Indiana tile and hardwood were featured.</p>
            <p>Decorations and furnishings were sparse due to the reduced appropriation. Nevertheless, the
                    interested visitor could find much that reflected Indiana's culture and history. Indiana
                    artists donated nineteen paintings and drawings, none of which drew critical praise. There were also
                    portraits of prominent Hoosiers such as Benjamin Harrison. The assembly room housed three statues.
                    One, donated by the women of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, was executed by Janet Scudder and titled "Nymph." The second one,
                    called "Indiana," had been sculpted by Retta Matthews of Arlington and was a gift
                    of the women of <placeName>

                    floor reading room visitors could browse among state newspapers or the two bookcases filled with the
                    works of Indiana authors.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

                    purchased a ride on the moving sidewalk that had two electrically powered belts operating at
                    different speeds. The faster belt, which moved at six miles per hour, had seats; many fair visitors
                    chose to eat their lunches here while gliding about the pier.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most Hoosiers would have walked quickly to the entrance of the fair, passing through an enormous
                    colonnade known as the Peristyle. Beyond the huge Greek pillars, the most impressive view of the
                    fair, the Court of Honor, captivated the visitor. The greatest of the fair buildings stood around a
                    large basin filled with monumental sculptures. To the left was the classical-style Agricultural
                    Building. Farther to the west stood the Machinery Building with its vaguely Spanish towers. Directly
                    ahead, the Administration Building dominated the entire scene; only St. Peter's in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName> possessed a larger dome. Located just north of the Administration Building were the
                    exhibition halls for electricity and for mines and mining. To the right of the Peristyle loomed the
                    largest building in the world, the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building. Covering over thirty
                    acres of land, the structure was a full mile around its perimeter. Its roof towered over twenty
                        stories.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Indiana visitors rented an electric boat or one of the authentic Venetian gondolas for the trip
                    to the Indiana Building. Taking this route, the visitor could see such major fair structures as the
                    Government, Fisheries, Horticulture, Woman's, and Illinois buildings. Undoubtedly many
                    stopped at the Transportation Building to examine architect Louis Sullivan's elegant Golden
                    Door. Alighting at the landing before the Woman's Building, the visitor could enjoy a brief
                    walk to the Indiana Building. To the west were the fascinating and occasionally risqué
                    attractions of the Midway Plaisance, which occupied a six-hundred-foot-wide stretch of land
                    extending for a mile before ending at <placeName>

            <p>Visiting Hoosiers arriving early for the Indiana Day festivities might be lucky enough to find an
                    empty rocking chair on the east veranda of the state building. From here, across a quiet lagoon,
                    could be seen the most universally admired building at the fair, the Palace of Art. Fortunately,
                    modern visitors can have the same view. The site of the Indiana Building is now a grassy park area,
                    but the Museum of Science and Industry, the former Palace of Art, still stands.</p>
            <p>During the entire six-month run of the Columbian Exposition, three hundred thousand Hoosiers attended

                    "from nearly every city, town and hamlet" arrived at the fair's huge

                    Harrison, and various state world's fair officials were on the program, and so too was
                    James Whitcomb Riley. A band from <placeName>

                    Indiana which, for some reason, featured "a Chinese Pagoda made of 10,000 separate burning

            <p>Between the speeches and the fireworks many Hoosier visitors would have explored the grounds in

                    Indiana's commercial, manufacturing, agricultural, and cultural strength. In the

                    applied rigorous standards. American juries were especially strict, knowing that American art would
                    be in competition with entries from <placeName>

            <p>Taken as a whole, Indiana's involvement in the World's Columbian Exposition was
                    remarkable. Approximately one Hoosier in seven attended the fair. Nearly four hundred individuals,
                    two hundred companies, one hundred twenty school districts, and dozens of other state institutions
                    contributed almost a thousand exhibits. Uncounted Hoosiers donated to the Penny Fund or served on
                    committees to prepare exhibits for the exposition. Indiana natural gas and oil had helped power the
                    fair, while Indiana stone and wood had been incorporated into the structure of the Mines and Mining
                    Building and the Forestry Building. An engine built in <placeName>

                    fair visitors had traveled through Indiana on their way to <placeName>

            <p>The Indiana Board of World's Fair Managers was justifiably proud of its achievements.
                    Despite legislative hostility, the board had arranged a series of exhibits that won 275 medals,
                    certificates, and premiums. In its final report, the board pointedly noted that Cobb's
                    controversial design for the Indiana Building had been awarded a medal for excellence. Although
                    Indiana's relatively modest state exhibits were criticized by some newspapers, the work of
                    the managers earned commendations from fair officials and from others associated with the
                    exposition. In representing Indiana at the fair, the managers spent $122,241 and returned
                    over $2,500 of their appropriation to the state.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While it is apparent that Indiana contributed to the success of the world's fair, it is more
                    difficult to evaluate the effect of the fair on Indiana. Economically, Indiana farmers and
                    manufacturers were able to bring their products to the attention of easterners and foreign
                    representatives. There is, however, no evidence that such contacts significantly expanded markets
                    for Indiana goods. Moreover, a prolonged depression began in 1893 that greatly slowed American
                    economic development and obscured possible advantages to Indiana resulting from participation in the
                    fair. The Columbian Exposition undoubtedly had a profound if unmeasurable educational impact. Tens
                    of thousands of Hoosiers, for the first time, saw the potential uses of electricity and learned
                    something of foreign cultures. Residents of Hoosier cities saw in the White City an example of
                    cleanliness, orderliness, and architectural beauty and harmony that contrasted sharply with the
                    dirt, disorder, and ugliness that characterized most American urban centers. The exposition gave
                    rise to the "City Beautiful" <list type="footnotes">

                    elsewhere for several decades. Indiana farmers had the opportunity to examine a bewildering variety
                    of agricultural machines that were effecting a revolution in farming techniques. They also could
                    compare the quality of their agricultural products with those from other areas of the nation and the
                    world. Art lovers enjoyed unique opportunities to see much of the world's great sculpture
                    and painting, while educators could examine instructional innovations from other states.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indiana's exhibits at the Columbian Exposition revealed a great deal about the state. On the
                    positive side, Hoosiers found that they lived in a state rich in natural resources, agriculturally
                    productive, and rapidly developing as a manufacturing center. The fair demonstrated that, for the
                    age, Indiana was progressive in its attitudes toward education and women. Finally, anyone who
                    studied the six hundred volumes of Indiana authors displayed in the Indiana Building had to be
                    impressed with the state's literary prowess. Yet, in at least one area, the Indiana Board
                    of World's Fair Managers was less than liberal. Faced with a strong demand by the
                    state's black citizens to participate in the exhibition, the board chose to ignore their
                    proposals. In taking this position, the board followed the lead of most other states and the
                    exposition management.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the great fair ended in the fall of 1893, the Indiana Building was sold and the exhibits packed
                    and shipped home. By state law, the board of world's fair managers was required to send the
                    agricultural, floricultural, and forestry exhibits to the State Board of Agriculture. The mining
                    exhibit became the property of the state geologist, and the Department of Public Instruction took
                    possession of the education display. Furniture from the state building was scattered among
                    Indiana's benevolent institutions. In January and July of 1894 two great fires destroyed
                    most of the White City. The exposition was nothing more than a wonderful memory. But for years to
                    come many Hoosier homes proudly displayed a photograph of the exposition or a framed certificate
                    testifying that the owner had been honored at the greatest world's fair ever held.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>

            <p>The Wall Street crash of 1929 ushered in a decade of economic misery for America's cities.
                    At first the federal government refused to intervene to aid the millions of urban dwellers who lost
                    their jobs with the onset of the Great Depression. Like many Americans, President Herbert C. Hoover
                    insisted that unemployment relief had to be a local responsibility. In his view, federal action
                    would have undermined business confidence, necessitated ruinous taxation, created a centralized
                    bureaucratic state, and destroyed the basic strengths of the American character.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In the early 1930s, therefore, every city had to mobilize its resources to deal with the
                    mounting problem of providing relief for the unemployed. Urban communities did not respond to this
                    national crisis in uniform fashion or with identical results.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Local factors
                    were very significant in determining the nature and development of each city's relief
                    efforts.</p>
            <p>A number of local factors were influential in the case of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana. These included the condition of the city's economy before the crash,
                    the nature of the local structure of political power, the ideology of the city's business
                    elite, the quality of civic leadership, and the political culture of the community. As a result of
                    the interplay of these factors, Indiana's "Summit City" avoided <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Older industrial cities immediately felt the chill winds of economic catastrophe. By mid-1930 eighty
                    soup kitchens and breadlines could be counted in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a city where 10.4 percent of the labor force had been unemployed even before the
                    crash. In contrast, only 5 percent of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s labor force, nearly twenty-five hundred people, had no job in April, 1930.
                    Just over one thousand people, who still had jobs, had also been temporarily laid off.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The majority of those without jobs lived in the east-central district between downtown
                    and the railroad yards. They included many blacks and poor whites who normally occupied a peripheral
                    position in the local economy as unskilled laborers, casual workers, and domestics. A large
                    proportion of those people who had been laid off or lost steady jobs had been employed in the
                    construction industry. Other local businesses appeared to be holding up quite well.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Civic leaders were therefore confident that normal relief measures would suffice. Although
                    the Community Chest anticipated accumulating a debt of thirty-two thousand dollars before the fall
                    drive to meet increased demand from the needy, its administrators pointed out that the relief quota
                    allocated from the 1930 fund had been particularly low.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>Initially <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s political and business leaders focused their energies on halting the growth
                    of unemployment rather than on expanding local relief. The GFWDC continued its efforts to attract
                    new industries. In 1930 Magnavox located two plants in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, creating about one thousand jobs. The Inca Corporation received aid to expand its
                    existing factory premises. Later, in 1932, Theodore Zollner moved his piston business from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Duluth</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the Summit City after the GFWDC helped him secure a mortgage for site acquisition
                    and plant development. This proved to be the booster organization's last success before
                    World War II.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As was the case in other cities, efforts were made to prop up the ailing construction industry. In
                    1930 eight leading businesses announced building improvement plans and issued contracts totalling
                    over four million dollars. The municipal government also decided to build a new reservoir, dam, and
                    filtration plant, which it financed through a bond issue of two million dollars.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> The city <list type="footnotes">

                    people included representatives of the trade unions, farmers, social workers, and both political
                    parties. Nevertheless, it was dominated by its business members—two financiers, the

            <p>In a classic essay on influence within the community, the sociologist Robert K. Merton distinguished
                    between "local" and "cosmopolitan" influentials. He categorized
                    localites as people with essentially parochial interests focused on the local community. The
                    interests, perspectives, and reputation of cosmopolitans, on the other hand, extended beyond their
                        hometown.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The biographical material compiled in <hi rend="i">Builders of

            <p>Both cosmopolitans and locals supported voluntary relief organizations because of shared ideological
                        convictions.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Both were committed to making a success of local voluntary
                    action because they wanted to keep government out of relief. The specter of higher taxation
                    continually haunted them, and they objected strongly to increases in direct relief expenditure by
                    the township trustee. In 1931 the Chamber of Commerce opposed holding a special session of the
                    Indiana General Assembly to discuss the relief crisis. ACEUC was also hostile to the
                    President's Emergency Committee for Employment (PECE), which Hoover had established to
                    advise local organizations on relief policy.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

                    </placeName>'s businessmen regarded PECE as the harbinger of direct federal responsibility
                    for relief. Like Hoover, Hall feared that an interventionist state would undermine the foundations
                    of the American system. "No-one," he declared, "wants Governmental
                    Taxation or Governmental Supervision for the care of the unfortunate."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Businessmen whose concern was essentially local could also appreciate the dangerous
                    precedents for intervention in community affairs that federal involvement in relief would establish.
                    Significantly, their initial break with the Roosevelt administration in late 1933 was occasioned by
                    the New Deal's threat to the local system of industrial relations that had been established
                    after World War I.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

                            associations because they provided a means for extending personal relations. Nevertheless,

                    projects benefitting the community, such as river beautification, park landscaping, road
                    improvement, and snow clearance. About half of the first two thousand relief applicants had been
                    clients of local social agencies and charities in the 1920s. As a result, ACEUC's initial
                    attitude toward the unemployed was not wholly sympathetic. After consulting the social agencies, it
                    adopted a hard line and alerted the creditors of those able-bodied persons who refused work relief
                    and sought township relief instead. The committee even threatened to bring child neglect charges
                    against some individuals who proved particularly stubborn in rejecting work opportunities.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By March, 1931, over four thousand people had registered with the ACEUC. There was simply not enough
                    relief work available for everyone. The eagerness of most relief applicants to undertake any task
                    soon dispelled notions that they were lazy or responsible for their predicament. One episode
                    graphically illustrated their determination. The gang working on the Blooming-dale Park project knew
                    in advance that only half of its members could be hired on the final work day. Since the foreman
                    intended to select workers in order of their arrival at the site, many of the men turned up at 4:00
                    a.m. for the 8:00 a.m. start, some having walked miles to get there. In these circumstances the
                    ACEUC decided that a social worker should always be on duty at the Unemployment Center to deal with
                    people whose morale showed signs of collapse because relief work was unavailable.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> It is also worth noting that neither of <placeName>

                    the voluntarist era when businessmen played a dominant role in organizing the local relief effort.
                    Hall was a "rock-ribbed Republican," and so were most members of the Chamber of
                    Commerce, but they did not use the voluntarist relief organization to further the GOP's
                        interests.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> It was evident to them that the voluntarist approach would not
                    succeed if it bred divisions within the community. In fact, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> did not experience a serious political dispute over relief during the period of the
                    ACEUC's existence. Party loyalty was not a qualification for receiving voluntarist relief
                    aid. Nor is there evidence that the committee discriminated against any ethnic or racial group in
                    distributing aid. Some complained that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s relief administrators tended to favor former servicemen and that they
                    neglected single people; but, in keeping with its community approach, ACEUC's prejudices
                    were mainly focused against outsiders. As a major railroad center, the Summit City attracted many
                    transients who stopped off for a short time in search of food, shelter, and work. From early 1931
                    onwards relief administrators manifested a very hostile attitude toward these people.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides communal solidarity, the voluntary approach depended on generous donations. Under Charles
                    Buesching's leadership the first three ACEUC financial campaigns proved very successful.
                    The first two financial drives netted ACEUC a yearly budget of $360,000, about double the
                    sum normally raised by the Community Chest in the late 1920s.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Forty percent of
                    the money raised in the first drive of December, 1930, came from "big gifts,"
                    donations from <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s leading businesses and wealthiest citizens. The rest came from small firms
                    and the pockets of ordinary people. Workers who earned under fifty dollars a month were not
                    solicited; those who made over one hundred dollars were requested to pledge a day's pay
                    each month until May; and those earning over fifty dollars were asked for half a day's pay
                    on the same basis.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>

            <p>At this stage the ACEUC was still confident that the economy would revive within six months, but it
                    had to hold another drive in the spring of 1931 to secure funds for the second half of that year. In
                    September it decided to plan for the reality of worsening circumstances. Civic leaders agreed to
                    scrap the normal Community Chest drive, which raised money in part for
                    "character-building" organizations such as the Boy Scouts and the YWCA, so that
                    all fund-raising activity could focus on the relief effort. It was also decided that "big
                    gifts" should account for 60 percent of its $385,000 target, a move recommended
                    by the guidelines that the President's Organization on Unemployment Relief (POUR) had set
                    for local voluntarist organizations. Nearly one thousand citizens were recruited to work in the 1931
                    campaign. By now, of course, some people who had donated to the previous campaigns were themselves
                    unemployed. Nevertheless, the community rallied generously again, and the drive went over the top by
                        $30,000.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

                    </placeName> citizens probably donated generously because they perceived the Depression primarily as
                    a local crisis, at least prior to the federal government's intervention in 1933. Certainly
                    the ACEUC assiduously cultivated local attachments when appealing for funds. Even though Hall
                    personally had a broad, national perspective of the crisis, he launched the fall drive of 1931 by
                    proclaiming: "We are protecting our city and our community against the perils of social
                    destruction inherent in poverty, idleness, ill health, dependence and discontent."<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to raising money, ACEUC had to organize the expenditure of funds. Unlike <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s famous relief committee leader, Horatio Gates Lloyd, Hall did not devote
                    himself full time to the voluntarist effort. The burden of administration fell on Chamber of
                    Commerce manager J.B. Wiles and social worker E.J. Hornick. They registered the unemployed in five
                    categories denoting their priority for relief aid. Men and women who were the sole support of their
                    families and lived in rented accommodation received top priority, followed by heads of family who
                    owned mortgaged property. Unemployed heads of family who still had some income, such as rents or
                    pensions, constituted the third group and single people with no dependents the next. Finally came
                    those people who had paid off their mortgages and had some equity to fall back on. In June, 1931,
                    the numbers in each category were 2,503; 601; 436; 1,305; and 166 respectively. As well as <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>There is little doubt that ACEUC had able, efficient leadership. Less than 5 percent of its budget
                    went to administration in 1931. Both PECE and POUR, as well as the state government, considered it
                    one of the best local relief organizations in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Yet ACEUC never came to
                    grips with the ever mounting problem of unemployment. In its first six months of operation only
                    3,724 of its 5,011 registrants received work placements. Moreover, some jobs lasted only a few days,
                    and a large number of people received just one placement. At best, reliefers worked four-day shifts
                    on an alternating weekly basis until a project was completed. Pay was only forty cents an hour.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> In the last quarter of 1931 the 1,570 people who received placements earned
                    $32 on average. During the same period the relief organization also spent
                    $33,753 in giving direct aid. Despite its emphasis on work relief, the relief committee
                    acknowledged that those in direst poverty, the aged, and the disabled needed some direct assistance.
                    This cash aid, intended to meet food, rental, and medical expenses, was distributed among a total of
                    2,354 families.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The voluntarist organization simply lacked the financial means to cope with the relief problem. As
                    the Depression progressed, fund raising became more difficult. About $40,000 in pledges
                    could not be collected after the winter drive of 1931, probably because donors had lost their jobs
                    or faced imminent unemployment. The 1932 campaign fell $50,000 short of its
                    $385,000 target.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> The shortcomings of voluntarism inevitably
                    necessitated the increase of public relief. Wayne Township spent $3,766 on poor relief
                    for 230 families in May, 1930. Within a year its monthly expenditure had risen to over
                    $10,000. Direct public aid shot up to over $31,000 per month in the harsh
                    winter of early 1932. Yet expenditure per case had dropped slightly in comparison to mid-1930
                    because aid was now spread among 2,904 families.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>

                    which Hall chaired. They used their influence to restrict the scope of public relief. Between
                    October, 1931, and April, 1932, Wayne Township spent a monthly average of only fourteen dollars on
                    each relief client, while Portage Township in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> averaged twenty-seven dollars.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> Yet local politicians were
                    reluctant to increase public expenditure. Like their counterparts in virtually every Hoosier
                    community during the Depression, they were under intense pressure from the public to lower local tax
                    rates. In fact, tax delinquencies became a serious problem in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> as the Depression worsened.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> Confident that their opposition to
                    high municipal tax rates had popular support in this city of homeowners, local business leaders
                    later formed the Taxpayers Research Association in 1934. This body acted as a watchdog over

                    </placeName> governments decided to reduce nonrelief expenditures in order to avoid large tax
                    increases and still pay for escalating relief costs. Education bore the brunt of the first cuts.
                    Between 1930 and 1932 the number of teachers was reduced by 10 percent, salaries were cut by up to
                    25 percent, and increments were discontinued.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> In 1932, however, the city
                    council approved an overall reduction of 10 percent in municipal expenditure. The smaller
                    departments suffered disproportionately. The budgets of the Utilities Commission and the Airport
                    Commission were cut by 20 percent, while the City Plan Commission's finances were halved.
                    Yet every department had to economize. The police and fire departments suffered salary cuts and some
                    layoffs. As a result, the fire chief warned that it would no longer be possible to answer calls

                    it impossible for them to run the city. Some councillors, who represented working-class districts
                    where unemployment was heavy, suggested issuing public bonds to cover the rising cost of relief or

                    himself did not want to incur heavy debts, but from late 1932 onwards he did begin to see the

                    civic leaders resorted to new measures to underwrite the local relief effort. Several cities outside

                    In 1932 a new state law enabled Hoosier counties to issue scrip to the value of one hundred thousand

                    Democratic county commissioner, devised the scheme and enlisted business and labor support. His plan
                    was to introduce scrip gradually into the local economy. Initially two hundred reliefers, working
                    one shift in three, received three dollars of their weekly pay in scrip. They could use this money
                    to pay local taxes and municipal utility bills and to buy goods in a wide variety of stores <list type="footnotes">

                    governments and local retailers would then recirculate the scrip as part of their own
                    employees' wages. Some factory workers, including over five hundred at General Electric,
                    also volunteered to accept two dollars pay per week in scrip. Cleland hoped that the scheme would
                    eventually finance one thousand relief workers, who would therefore be removed from the

                    scrapped in November when the federal Civilian Works Administration took over full responsibility

                    continuing the program. The skilled unions had disliked the plan from its inception. Cleland had
                    promised that their unemployed members should be paid scrip wages at the prevailing rates for their
                    trade, but the Democratic county administration did not honor this undertaking. In July the building

                    </placeName> Unemployment Association (ACUA). This body ran its own educational campaign against
                    "un-American ideologies," strove to maintain discipline among the unemployed, put
                    on entertainments, and organized work relief. ACUA was entirely officered by the unemployed and soon
                    had well over five hundred members. It could provide regular work for about one hundred fifty people
                    each week, except in midwinter. With financial aid from the FRA, the association ran a fleet of

                    </placeName> Veterans' Cooperative Association, and the Children's Relief
                    Association. These three bodies were not as well led or as efficiently organized; they folded in
                    1935, but the ACUA continued to operate until the end of the decade. Its membership did shrink in
                    the New Deal era, but it gave some employment to older people who could not obtain federal relief

                    of failures reduced their numbers to seven by mid-1933. In part their problems stemmed from the
                    failure of some businesses to repay loans made during the prosperous 1920s. But local banks were
                    also heavily involved in the mortgage market, saddling them with too many nonliquid assets. Their
                    general policy before the 1930s had been to lend on mortgages and sell bonds, which were not
                    guaranteed, at lower rates of interest. Moreover, as the economic crisis deepened, the number of

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The letters were published in a collection of essays, letters, and newspaper extracts,
                    titled <hi rend="i">Atlantische Studien, von Deutschen in Amerika.</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">1</hi> The <placeName>

                    </placeName> writer was inquisitive, literate, perceptive, and critical; and he discussed many
                    aspects of the land, the people, and the way of life. His letters are skillfully written and
                    provocative. Detailed, vivid, and scathing, they add up to a worthy description and a graphic
                    account.</p>
            <p>Yet the letters are as mysterious as they are valuable. Their author, addressee, and editor remain
                    unknown. The author signed himself Ddkd, the editor is not named, and attempts to identify them have
                    failed. The letters reveal the addressee only as a <placeName>

                    Ddkd's letters came to be included. In sum, three letters and their anonymous author,
                    nameless editor, shadowy addressee, cryptic purpose, and arcane audience pose a riddle that defies
                    solution.</p>

            <p>Two inferences are possible. First, Ddkd might have been a Forty-Eighter. The Forty-Eighters were <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> émigrés who had taken up arms for the Revolution of 1848 and fled
                    when it failed. Though some were ordinary citizens who had fought as common soldiers, the famous
                    ones were intellectuals and professionals, commanders of insurrectionist forces, and actually or
                    potentially prominent figures. The best remembered is Carl Schurz. In America, Forty-Eighters
                    entered various occupations. The exceptional Schurz had a multifarious career as political leader,
                    military officer, newspaperman, lecturer, author, diplomat, <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator, and secretary of the interior. Some Forty-Eighters, even ones who had never
                    before seen a plow or touched a hoe, became farmers—notably in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, Indiana, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. Called "Latin farmers" because of their proficiency in the classics,
                    they could quote the Greeks and Romans while hacking at the wilderness and grubbing for a livelihood
                    from stubborn soil. Passages of Hesiod's <hi rend="i">Works and Days</hi> fell from their
                    lips more readily than trees before their axes. Notable was Friedrich Karl Hecker, quondam officer
                    in the Revolution, who farmed in southwestern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Unlike hundreds of thousands of ordinary Germans who emigrated
                    for economic reasons in the 1850s, Forty-Eighters were mostly unwilling exiles; educated and
                    accomplished people seldom emigrated unless forced. Forty-Eighters loved <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and wanted not to leave it but to change it. Having fought to right its wrongs, most
                    Forty-Eighters would have preferred success and prominence in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> they would have improved, instead of back-breaking labor on a continent they found
                    oppressed by ignorance and slavery.</p>
            <p>Ddkd, presumably male, sounds like such a man. In his third letter, dated June, 1853, he says he
                    arrived "four years ago," which corresponds to the coming of the Forty-Eighters.
                    And, though farming, he writes with subtlety, erudition, complexity, and skill not to be expected
                    from a lifelong farmer; he also quotes Latin. Furthermore, he seems to share with Forty-Eighters the
                    status of a displaced person, not a willing immigrant. At the end of the first letter, he appears
                    sad about "the forsaken fatherland" and seems to miss "loved
                    ones" and "many a good comrade," as if he is involuntarily separated from
                    them. Again, early in that letter, when rejecting the entreaty to come east, he speaks like a newly
                    arrived Forty-Eighter without American roots: he could have settled <list type="footnotes">

                    quarrels with established, Americanized Germans. He seems to have been urged to return to big-city
                    life. Moreover, throughout the letters, he expresses an anti-American anger common to many
                    Forty-Eighters who looked for high-mindedness, freedom, and culture in the <placeName>

                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> over emigration. Mid-nineteenth-century Germans debated the wisdom of leaving the

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    who returned from America to argue for emigration because <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> was overpopulated while America, particularly the Missouri River Valley, was a fine

                    </placeName>; good is slight, evil great. Indeed, he resembles B's people who flee corrupt

                    Disliking much about Indiana, he grumbles over money-grubbing and grouses at ignorant men, unruly
                    children, lazy women, barbarous table manners, and monotonous food. He does approve of the state
                    constitution adopted in 1851, claiming it represents tolerance, honesty, and respect for freedom,
                    qualities he finds and approves in Hoosiers generally.</p>
            <p>Ddkd's reproach and anger seem sincere. Neither a hack nor a blockhead but an excellent
                    stylist with a lot on his mind and the power to express it, he conveys complicated and significant
                    ideas with studied precision, measured nuance, and uncommon verve. His wit imparts energy, and his
                    irony adds color; his third letter is spiced with hilarious comments on ghosts and poltergeists,
                    while his first is disingenuously acid in referring to Yankees in "the incomparably
                    civilized East." Perhaps his attitude was biased, his viewpoint distorted, his judgment
                    skewed; maybe his words bite unfairly; and no doubt he abused Indiana and savaged the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. What he finds wrong with Germans—"Germanic nonsense," lack of
                    judgment, harmful imitativeness, and "other undesirable qualities"—matches
                    neither in amount nor severity his lashes at so much of Indiana and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. But as his partiality is not absolute, so he is not an extremist. If he lacks balance,
                    he does not necessarily slight the truth. His observations, however one-sided, and his criticisms,
                    though caustic, deserve to be reprinted in English. And they deserve to be read as part of the

                        <p>Perhaps, since I departed, much has changed to the advantage of Germans living in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>

                                    </placeName>. Nothing else could be expected after the incredible immigration and
                                    pullulation those cities have experienced.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> But I gather, from
                                    what I see in the news, that conditions are not attractive enough to lure me from
                                    here. Despite my fifty years, I don't want to be an objective observer in
                                    the East. I am too sanguine, and too proud of my national heritage, not to
                                        participate.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> I would also have to be afraid of Germanic
                                    nonsense, and of getting into party quarrels. Therefore, though I applaud European
                                    comfort, and appreciate the material pleasures, I would not be happy in the East. My
                                    spleen would be unnecessarily riled, even were I lucky enough to avoid the
                                    arguments, advanced for my own good, in favor of the freedom that remains there. <hi rend="i">Exempla sunt odiosa</hi> [Examples are offensive].<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So I prefer life in the wild. Yes, it is secluded and withdrawn. You would dislike
                                    it. But do not assume I'm apathetic and unobservant. Raw Nature, wild in
                                    her dominion, offers much to peruse. And what could a dynamic thinker find more
                                    rewarding than to adapt to savage surroundings while studying, in the perspective of
                                    a wilderness, the problem of developing a useful, worthwhile life under these

                                        training equipped them for artistic and literary careers rather than manual
                                        labor, found little work, particularly in the East. They took what jobs they
                                        could get, however menial; went hungry; and suffered other privation. Some died
                                        prematurely. Others committed suicide. Many, perhaps Ddkd too, seem to have gone
                                        South and West in search of a better life. Moreover, idealistic and high-minded
                                        Forty-Eighters questioned the <placeName>

                                        political corruption and black slavery shocked and angered them. The

                        <p>Let me assure you, then, that in spite of hardship, I am still satisfied with the
                                    decision to settle in a forest in the hinterlands. I want yet to wrest my
                                    subsistence from Nature, like any backwoodsman. What on Earth is to be had without
                                    effort? If unfamiliar labor raises many a drop of sweat, I rest in the true dignity
                                    of a free and independent man.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                        <p>Accordingly, I live in Indiana, which has a new and essentially humane constitution
                                    [the Constitution of 1851] that guarantees freedom to Indiana's people.
                                    Under the old one, in force when Indiana entered the Union in 1816, only American
                                    citizens could vote. Today, foreigners also have that right if, before the election,

                        <p>The constitutions of most of the young states of the West and Northwest embody at

                                    and honestly written than the humbug behind the national government, a travesty of

                                    was a modern, functional, manly, worthy robe of state; but the politicians of
                                    cupidity have infringed it to tatters, patched it with rags, and degraded it to the
                                    cloak of a scoundrel. True, since the promulgation of Indiana's new
                                    document, no blacks are supposed to have entered Indiana and settled, which may seem
                                    inhumane to their angry friends. But Indiana has never had many blacks.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> In the light of practicality, exclusion can be nothing but a

                                            honest, and autonomous. Conversely, most Latin farmers failed, and few had
                                            anything positive to say about farming after they tried it. See <hi rend="i">ibid.,</hi> 112–20.</item>

                                    only explanation I can give is that Indiana's big landowners do not try to
                                    attract immigrants by spreading shameless lies in eastern ports: the humbug of the
                                    American West as a land of milk and honey, and promises of pots of gold. The

                        <p>This region possesses no great natural beauty; the West's wide-open spaces,
                                    at least those I've seen, are poor in beautiful scenes. The terrain is
                                    hilly. The prairie, extending northwest, provides for fresh, free-moving air and
                                    thus health to those who get used to the West's sudden changes in
                                    temperature. In big cities, businessmen and loiterers live near muddy rivers, turbid
                                    canals, and stagnant lakes; seal themselves hermetically against atmospheric
                                    influences, dress in flannel from head to foot; drink brandy, whiskey, and strong
                                    beer; even though the temperature may be in the seventies. I cannot recommend such
                                    practices. They are wrong and rural people's superior health proves how
                                    wrong they are. The country dweller, the American accustomed to shifts in the
                                    weather, wears nothing but homemade coats and trousers of light wool and a cotton
                                    shirt, defies the worst of heat and cold, and enjoys good health.</p>

                                    in temperature. We are at the same latitude as the Caspian Sea but powerful
                                    northwest winds here destroy any similarity in climate. These prevailing American
                                    winds are probably caused by countless big and small lakes in the Northwest.</p>

                                    expansive prairies or of clearings that display marks of plow and axe, and disclose
                                    the presence of sparse population. Everything is so uniform, so arranged to meet the

                                    essential—one might say the most primitive—of needs. When I
                                    found it convenient to build a little house in a garden some distance from where I
                                    live, several neighbors smiled at my airy garden house and asked if it was going to
                                    be a birdhouse. Many things, especially those outside usual life and habits, are
                                    likewise still foreign to American self-sufficiency. There is no variation in their
                                    lifestyle and enjoyment. Fried salt pork, corn, pancakes, cornbread prepared with
                                    baking soda (hence Yankees' melodious belching after a hearty meal),
                                    together with an awful extract of a weed supposed to be tea, or weak coffee in which

                        <p>Accordingly, gardening and fruit-growing are on a very primitive level, and anything
                                    like horticulture is out of the question. In all my time in the West, I have never
                                    seen a pear, a cherry, or a European plum. Local vegetables include beans, cabbage,
                                    cucumbers, and turnips. Potatoes are also grown but certainly not as an essential
                                    food since the Yankee's indispensable nourishment is corn. He can live on
                                    it alone if he must. Potatoes have therefore come only recently into demand because
                                    of increasing numbers of Germans and Irish in the cities. Americans usually raise
                                    them on newly broken land that is wettest and richest in humus. The bigger the
                                    potatoes, the better (Americans think), because peeling small ones hinders fast

                                    child—perhaps an infant, perhaps a year old or more—crying at
                                    her breast, eyes gazing skyward: such is the epitome of pleasure for the Yankee
                                    woman of the West. Only in this way she realizes her full dignity and follows her
                                    highest calling: idleness and childbearing. Immigrant Jewesses especially support
                                    such behavior most enthusiastically. Proper upbringing of children is out of the
                                    question, for the state of morality is too uncertain. When a Yankee urchin runs
                                    wild—good-bye, obedience! And when such an unruly child decides to
                                    misbehave, all these people's attachment to the Bible notwithstanding, it
                                    acts with extreme savagery to its parents.</p>
                        <p>Americans in general are praised for cleanliness of body and household. But if you
                                    look at what an American woman does, and remember that she usually has her
                                    husband's help with domestic chores, her work from day to day is little
                                    more than preparing meals. Whoever has eaten these <hi rend="i">breakfasts,
                                    dinners,</hi> and <hi rend="i">suppers</hi> will agree that preparing one takes
                                    scarcely a quarter of an hour. Friday or Saturday is usually washday and husband or
                                    a son is again called into service. Cotton cloth is so cheap here that no thought is
                                    given to mending clothes made of it: one shirt on one's back, the other
                                    drying on the line. Likewise, tablecloths and blankets. To be condemned, after a

                                    here is in some ways different from what you have had occasion to observe in the
                                    incomparably civilized East. There the Yankee is at the apex of indolence; but
                                    something of a European polish has necessarily smoothed his rough edges, like gold
                                    plating over base metal. Still he is business-minded, greedy and, since he knows
                                    nothing else of value, exuberantly self-important. At the same time he is no less
                                    ignorant than his bucolic (one could say half-savage) yet not so insufferable
                                    brother in the West. Both kinds of Yankee are crafty and bright. Unfortunately they
                                    abhor knowledge not relevant to business and moneymaking. Intellectually lazy, they
                                    accommodate themselves to a Biblical notion of what <placeName>

                                    concerned, they seem to have come to a conclusion about political progress that

                                    heavy tobacco-chewing has so blunted the taste that sour can scarcely be
                                    distinguished from sweet, the digestive system has probably been likewise
                                    desensitized, in some measure justifying the physicians' drastic measures.
                                    But many Americans who are not slaves to chewing tobacco are like savage Indians in

                                    </placeName> doctor of jurisprudence. This capable young man learned the necessary

                                    examination. He intended to earn his living as a lawyer. But to the American mind he
                                    was still not <hi rend="i">smart</hi> enough; for, here, intelligence and
                                    accomplishment lack clear definition and often amount to vulgarity and coarseness.
                                    Therefore the West has many lawyers who, with few exceptions, belong to a class of
                                    beasts whose natural history would fill many pages. Their ruthless avarice and
                                    callous greed are unmatched anywhere in the world, and their most disreputable
                                    counterparts in Prussia and Saxony are weak bunglers compared to these professional

                                    seem to be a delicacy here.) Everything was gobbled as fast as possible, and one
                                    guest after another threw to the winds his credentials as a gentleman and got up and
                                    left. In barely twenty-five minutes the food had been bolted and not a word uttered.
                                    Together with vulgarity and unedifying table talk came a generous helping of

                                    gentlemen went directly from there to the <hi rend="i">grocer,</hi> who was well
                                    paid to leave <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-080-2-073"/> open a back door and provide an
                                    appropriate back room. There they play a dishonest game or tickle their palates with
                                    the repulsive brew they call brandy.</p>
                        <p>But let us return to the shady forests, where even the American is also a more
                                    wholesome and natural person than the urban moneyed aristocracy. Still, even in the
                                    backwoods, an army of drones and charlatans strives to confound the humbler farmers
                                    with incredible sectarian humbug.</p>
                        <p>Not long ago, in the forest near my home, Methodists held a large assembly, a
                                    so-called <hi rend="i">"camp meeting."</hi> About three thousand
                                    made temporary quarters under trees for several days and, with continual singing and
                                    praying, worked themselves into a frenzy. If you have not witnessed these
                                    shenanigans, it is hard to imagine what they are like. I noticed especially how the
                                    clerical scoundrels moved young women of marriageable age, and older ones, to the
                                    most passionate exaltation, to partake of the Holy Spirit, and to enter heaven on
                                    earth: the threshold of divine bliss. Paroxysms of laughter and cataleptic trances
                                    frequently overcome these creatures—proof positive to the singing and
                                    praying congregation that the Holy Spirit has descended on them. Then they are
                                    transported on the wooden platform they call <hi rend="i">heaven</hi> where their
                                    preachers rave like maniacs and foam at the mouth until their voices degenerate to
                                    hoarse roaring, their teeth rattle, and their arms fall lifelessly at their sides.
                                    Whoever is moved to mount this heaven of boards enters the presence of the Holy
                                    Spirit and rants wildly.</p>
                        <p>There is usually no lack of carnal delights during this spiritual gathering. Food and
                                    drink appear at regular intervals.</p>
                        <p>For all their strong sectarian passion, people in these forests are nonetheless
                                    tolerant. In that respect, even cultivated Germans could look to them as models.
                                    Religious conditions are not a factor in how people behave as neighbors and
                                    citizens. Theft is almost unknown hereabouts. Our homes, storehouses, and barns have
                                    no security beyond a simple bolt. If we kill a deer or other large animal in the
                                    forest and cannot immediately bring it away with us, a hunting knife stuck in its
                                    chest holds it for us unconditionally. More likely than theft is assault and
                                    battery—for revenge or because of a quarrel or, more often, in a burst of
                                    anger. No one need fear, however, that the rights of a free man will be infringed
                                    through brutality or any other means. The backwoodsman loves freedom and equality
                                    above all else, and he will see them observed for friends and neighbors. This axiom
                                    passes from father to son and is inviolable around here.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, ignorance—of formal learning, other countries, and
                                    world events—abounds. People here have the most peculiar notions of <hi rend="i">"the old country,"</hi> as they call Europe. A very

                                    man, said to me: "I know all about kings. Kings don't wear hats
                                    like us folks; kings wear golden crowns and live in golden houses." And he
                                    began praising the low cost of American government. This honest farmer certainly
                                    knew nothing of the millions the leaders of this country annually swindle out of the
                                    American people.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> There are individuals in the forests of
                                    Indiana who have never seen a uniformed soldier. People here occasionally pride
                                    themselves on their forefathers' deeds and in their pride look down on all
                                    immigrants, who, to be sure, all too often act ignorant and boorish to Americans.
                                    Still, the American is never at a loss. With axe, gun, and knife he will feed
                                    himself and, sooner or later, in accord with the principal characteristic of his
                                    nation, be intent on business and "making money." These skills
                                    lead him to overrate himself much too readily, and he judges everything foreign by
                                    his limited education and simpler circumstances.</p>

                        <p>Commercialism and the mania for making money seem to have so gripped Americans that
                                    little else matters, and that they are less and less capable of other endeavor.
                                    Thus, for example, even in this thinly settled western region, a good Anglo-American
                                    farmer is as scarce as hen's teeth. For these calculating Yankees, awaiting
                                    the annual harvest is far too slow a way to make money, and to earn a living by
                                    working a farm is "<hi rend="i">too much trouble.</hi>" Therefore,
                                    like a cat for a mouse, the Yankee waits for somebody to buy his farm. The quickest
                                    profit, however narrow, is always what he prefers; for he thus gets capital and the
                                    means to speculate. Always scheming, he breaks the blade of many a knife on the
                                    tough wood of his chair or table, from which he seems to whittle his thoughts. These
                                    farms, objects of speculation, betray at once to any knowledgeable person that they
                                    are nobody's permanent possession. Because the owner hopes daily for the
                                    Irishman or "<hi rend="i">Dutchman</hi>" who will buy the farm,
                                    and sometimes because of greed, sloth, or poverty, he often so neglects the farm
                                    except for planting. Yet, with American impudence, he will ask an almost
                                    unbelievable price. He justifies it with bombast that exceeds the bluster of
                                    landlords and small-time rural gentry in <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. When at last, after significantly lowering the price, he finds a buyer
                                    and the farm is sold, he heads west with bag and baggage. <list type="footnotes">

                                    hopes to find a true Eden; for America too has its share of fabulists whose
                                    publications (products of boneheaded American printers) disseminate to the ignorant
                                    the most incredible tales.</p>
                        <p>Until recently, old women, especially Germans, did a good business among Americans,
                                    telling fortunes and being otherwise clairvoyant. But since poltergeists have found
                                    their way to the western forests and into the pages of those silly papers, the
                                    popularity of female clairvoyants seems to have declined. Poltergeists have caused
                                    nonsense to take a different turn, and farmers around here have been made quite sick
                                    in the head. It is really too bad that this country is so poor in infamous spooky
                                    places—old castles, dilapidated monasteries, haunted houses,
                                    etc.—where these ghosts could find a more suitable home. Our fatherland, <placeName>
                                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                                    </placeName>, has an excess of them, and a pretty penny could be turned if they
                                    could be exported. At present, ghosts here have to be satisfied to do their tricks
                                    on posts and fences.</p>
                        <p>Still, ghosts have been put to good use as messengers. Here it may be a father, or
                                    there a sister, who wants to know whether son or brother has arrived safely in

                                    </placeName>, they say, one planting of wheat suffices for three years and produces
                                    three harvests. People believe you can reap there without sowing. In southern <placeName>

                                    the forests. People expect miracles in cattle-breeding there. Generally speaking,
                                    people here have as perverted a notion of the outlying parts of America as people in <placeName>

                        <p>But when these gullible Americans reach the land of their dreams, they soon realize
                                    that their hoped-for Cockaigne has not been found and that, for better or worse,
                                    they must again take up plow and axe, and plant and prepare for winter. Minds
                                    therefore beginning to clear, they return to their old occupations and keep the
                                    trusty "<hi rend="i">rifle</hi>" at their sides, to be ready
                                    should desirable game appear or a band of Indians lust after guns and scalps.
                                    Thousands, partly encouraged by such humbug, annually leave their homes in the older
                                    states and make room for immigrants. The decline in wild animals confirms the growth
                                    of immigration. Last winter we had fewer lynx, bear, etc. Not even deer are as

                                    whiskey, syrup, etc., are piled boots and shoes of all kinds. Beams are hung with
                                    dresses, stockings, shawls, saddles, bridles, and caps. Among them are to be seen
                                    ironware and tinware, under whose weight the beams threaten to snap. There is even
                                    jewelry: the play of light on large bundles of glass beads draws covetous glances
                                    from Indians. In this spacious building's every corner are stacked all
                                    kinds of raw animal skins. Farmers and Indians move among them, passing the whiskey
                                    bottle and waiting their turns to barter pelts and be humbugged by the smart
                                    storekeeper. At the mills, logs and grain are unloaded and, armed with receipts of
                                    delivery, farmers hurry to the store to exchange them for groceries, shoes, and
                                    clothing. Usually in remote regions a city develops from such a settlement. I
                                    believe I do not exaggerate when I say that, in many a country town in <placeName>
                                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>

                                    combined as is sometimes available in the stock of one enterprising Yankee in a far
                                    corner of the West.</p>
                        <p>Such entrepreneurs are patron saints of slowly growing numbers of farmers in distant
                                    places. Farmers, often in a several days' journey to a store that supplies
                                    all their needs, bring hard-won fruits of labor and, one suspects, part with them at
                                    the lowest prices. The exchange is called "<hi rend="i">trade.</hi>" Except Indians, nobody is more at the mercy of traders than
                                    the western farmer. Traders do business by lying and cheating, especially in grain.
                                    Still the <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-080-2-077"/> farmer must usually count himself
                                    lucky if the trader is kind enough to take his produce; the farmer has nowhere else
                                    to traffic unless he wants to travel a hundred miles to the first city on the edge
                                    of civilization. Drunken, negligent, and unfortunate farmers often mortgage property
                                    to traders and never get it back. Clever traders thus become land speculators, so

                        <p>If the corner of the world where the newly rich storekeepers and land speculators
                                    reap a tidy profit becomes a state, their friends impose them as senators and
                                    representatives on the people of the region in some spectacle of a convention. The
                                    last elections showed clearly the nature of grassroots democracy in its typical
                                    American form. Traders and speculators elected to public office have gotten what
                                    they wanted and can now play even more successfully at growing rich—at
                                    public expense. Indeed, a representative from <placeName>

                                    is possible that America has always lacked disinterested politicians and diverse
                                    viewpoints on great issues, and that this sort of politics has led, not to progress,
                                    but to deterioration in statecraft; for it increasingly regresses to what governs
                                    America: the business of filling politicians' pockets.</p>

                                    requires strict academic preparation. If a young American fails in business and
                                    entertains no prospect for success in western adventures, he packs his bags and goes
                                    to an institution of higher learning in one of the big cities. He need stay only a

                                    arrived here four years ago, a young butcher lived in the nearby town. He was
                                    dissatisfied with his earnings. One day I heard he had closed his doors and headed

                                    returned with his medical degree. Thus empowered to kill people, he set up shop at

                                    display an incredible stupidity in such matters and often comfort themselves with:
                                    "That's the way it is in this country." Bearing in mind
                                    poor laws, extremely defective legal procedures, and (besides dishonesty) ignorance
                                    on the part of American lawyers, nobody will think exaggerated the observation that
                                    nowhere is a trial a greater evil than in America when the contending parties are a

            <p>Publication of the ninth and final volume of <hi rend="i">The Diary of Calvin Fletcher</hi> provides
                    an opportunity not only to review this volume but to comment on the entire project. Volume nine will
                    be of general interest for the light it throws on the reaction in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the closing phase of the Civil War, the assassination of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the adjustments necessarily being made in the aftermath of the conflict. For
                    Fletcher, it was a time when he was trying to reduce his responsibilities in the management of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Branch Banking Company so that he could work on his farm north of the city. There were
                    many days when he visited it twice and others when he put in manual labor during most of the
                    daylight hours. On March 30, 1866, just as he was reaching home, he was badly injured through being
                    thrown from a frightened mare and dragged some distance. In a month or so he was satisfied he had
                    recovered and so resumed his horseback trips to the farm. On May 13 he made his last diary entry. He
                    died May 26, apparently from complications arising out of his injury.</p>
            <p>Calvin Fletcher was born in Vermont in 1798 and left home in 1815 to seek his fortune. In 1817 he was

                    Ohio bar. The couple shortly moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, arriving just a week before the first sale of lots in the new state capital. Fletcher
                    was immediately admitted to the Indiana bar and for over twenty years was a circuit-riding lawyer.
                    He gave up his legal practice entirely in 1846 because he was now a full-time banker. He had entered
                    banking by stages, the first phase being when the General Assembly in 1834 elected him a director of
                    the State Bank. In 1844 he became president of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> branch of the State Bank, which office he held until the charter of the State Bank
                    expired on December 31,1856. The next day he became president of a newly established private bank,
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Branch Banking Company ("the Fletcher and Sharpe bank") and remained so during the rest
                    of his life. He entered manhood with no financial resources, but he gradually built up a fortune
                    from his law practice, an associated debt-collection agency, his banking activities, land
                    speculation, and rather large-scale farming operations. When the Civil War income tax was levied, he
                    was revealed to be the wealthiest inhabitant of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He and Sarah had nine sons and two daughters, all of whom survived him, except Maria
                    who died in 1860 following childbirth and Miles who was killed in a railroad accident in 1862. Sarah
                    died in 1855 and in 1856 Fletcher married Keziah Price Lister, who had come from Maine a few years
                    earlier to teach in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> public schools. After his death she returned to New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, where she died in 1899.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Diary</hi> as published includes a considerable volume of family correspondence, a
                    few journals kept by Sarah for brief periods, and some miscellaneous materials Fletcher thought
                    worth saving. The balance of the work—and by far the greater portion
                    thereof—is made up of Fletcher's entries. These he started in 1820 and continued
                    with gaps of varying length for about twenty years. From the early 1840s he made his notes usually
                    on a day-by-day basis, though occasionally, especially when he had been traveling, he would content
                    himself with a summary of what had taken place since his entry of a week or two earlier. Ultimately
                    his journal was a continuous record not only of what he had done or was doing but also of his
                    thinking. In the 1850s and 1860s he made a practice of ending the old year or beginning the new with
                    a recapitulation of the highlights of the preceding twelve months.</p>

                    especially as the viewpoint is not that of a politician or an economist but rather of an insider
                    involved in day-to-day detail. As Fletcher was for several years a trustee of the common schools of
                    the city, in which office he had wide responsibilities in hiring teachers, exercising discipline,
                    arranging examinations, engaging in visitations, and inspecting facilities, the <hi rend="i">Diary</hi> reveals much concerning these aspects of the educational system. Fletcher was deeply
                    involved in the activities of the considerable number of charitable and benevolent organizations in
                    the community. One of the best ways to piece together an account of the attempts to alleviate the
                    lot of the poor and the unfortunate would be to go through the <hi rend="i">Diary.</hi> Among the
                    other incidental values of the <hi rend="i">Diary</hi> to the local historian are many references to
                    entertainment, this comprising an assortment of games, picnics, concerts, circuses, patriotic
                    celebrations, horse races, fairs, and other events characteristic of the times.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Diary</hi> is likewise of worth for Indiana state history. Fletcher was a member of
                    the Indiana Senate from 1826 to 1833, but thereafter he held no state office. He was, however,
                    active in political matters as a promoter, as an organizer, and as a behind-the-scenes consultant.
                    His role as adviser was especially important during the Civil War, when Governor Oliver P. Morton
                    sought his opinion with respect to the Copperhead menace and other urgent matters. Fletcher was
                    especially identified with the temperance movement and subsequently with the Free Soil movement.
                    Outside the conventional political realm, he was identified with the promotion, construction, and
                    operation of several Indiana railroads, so that there is much scattered information on these
                    enterprises. As he was often away from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> for legal or business reasons, and as he and members of his family made many journeys
                    to the East and elsewhere, the <hi rend="i">Diary</hi> in its entries and correspondence is
                    illuminating on travel in its various aspects from the days of sloshing on horseback along forest
                    trails to the time when trains were safe and reliable.</p>
            <p>Seeing that Fletcher was a lawyer, a banker, and a resident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> involved in multifarious activities, it may come as a surprise that what lay nearest
                    his heart was farming. During his Indiana years he had several farms, some operated by tenants, some
                    in partnership, some by supervised hired help, and some by his sons. His concentration was on
                    livestock, especially cattle and swine. He was scarcely an innovator in his practices, but he did
                    attempt to keep current with improvements, and he was attuned to market fluctuations. Other men in
                    his position would in all likelihood have become outright absentee landlords, but he fancied <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-080-2-084"/> himself as a farmer, in his sixties glorying in his continued
                    capacity to do a hard day's work in the field. There are so many references in the <hi rend="i">Diary</hi> to the inception, evolution, and outcome of his farm-related activities that
                    their cumulative effect is to make it essential to any study of Indiana agriculture.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Diary's</hi> importance extends far beyond the matters mentioned, important
                    though these were. Bit by bit it reveals the many facets of a man who was an exemplary citizen, a
                    hardworking and efficient businessman, and a dedicated self-improver. Fletcher had only a
                    common-school education, supplemented by his reading of law, but he was always interested in
                    learning. He subscribed to leading magazines and bought books—good ones,
                    too—on religion, travel, and other areas of knowledge. He and Keziah had frequent and
                    long discussions of what they were reading. He was greatly concerned that all his children should
                    have a sound education and therefore sent them off to schools (and sometimes colleges) in the East.
                    He was a friend to members of the black population when prevailing pro-Southern sentiments in the
                    city made any such association a rarity. He was always personally generous. One illustration thereof
                    is that it was long his practice to furnish every clergyman in the city a dressed hog at Christmas.
                    This might be taken as an example of a conspicuous benevolence, so it should be added that he made
                    frequent donations in money or kind to individuals and families he considered worthy of help and
                    even sometimes to the wholly undeserving.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Diary</hi> reveals much more of Fletcher than such externals. He had been brought up
                    in an environment in which the old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> virtues were meaningful and respected, and he guided his entire life by adherence to
                    them. Though it would seem that he was not given to making a display of piety, he was deeply
                    religious. He was accordingly identified with various aspects of church work, including a quarter of
                    a century or so as a Sunday-school superintendent. He was bothered when he fell short of his
                    self-imposed standards and suffered remorse when, as not infrequently happened, he lost his temper
                    at some shortcoming or thoughtless act of one of his children.</p>
            <p>It was in the area of generational relationships that Fletcher had his worst problems. There were
                    often serious tensions as his children grew through adolescence into adulthood. Thus Lucy, his
                    younger daughter, was outspokenly opposed to his marriage to Keziah and was, as long as she remained
                    at home, a perennial trial to her stepmother and so to her father. Again, with Cooley, his eldest
                    son, there was a strained relationship over many years, this arising out of the fact that Cooley was
                    financially irresponsible, and so contracted debts which his father felt obliged to pay. <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-080-2-085"/> Fletcher had difficulties with most of his other sons as they were
                    growing up, because they resented his well-intentioned efforts to govern their lives. The parental
                    advice he gave was usually quite sound, but the boys tended to think that they were being hectored,
                    and sometimes said so. After they completed their formal education, Fletcher involved some of them
                    in his farming operations as subordinates or partners, but he would not trust their judgment or
                    respect their capacity, and so the enterprises as like as not ended in recriminations. While the
                    young men unquestionably made serious mistakes, an outsider might well conclude that the fault was
                    not all on their side, that indeed the root of the recurrent problem was that Fletcher did not or
                    perhaps could not see that they had grown up and had developed perspectives at variance with his.</p>
            <p>Among the interesting and thought-provoking aspects of the <hi rend="i">Diary</hi> is its revelation
                    of the problems of operating a large household in the days before modern conveniences. In
                    Sarah's time there were children of all ages, usually a couple of bound girls (supposedly a
                    help, but probably in some instances really just more adolescents to be looked after), a hired man
                    or two, and often guests. Perhaps there might be only one or two of these, but when there was a
                    religious conference in the city, there might be half a dozen or more. Fletcher got up early in the
                    morning to get the fires going, catch up on his reading and correspondence, and make his diary
                    entries, but Sarah ran the household. Nor was this management restricted to the indoors. It was
                    Sarah who looked after the making of maple sugar and who supervised and participated in the autumnal
                    hog butchering. Fletcher realized that Sarah was overworked, and thought it not quite proper that
                    this should be so, but he never did anything tangible to reduce her burdens. It is worth noting that
                    Keziah never allowed herself to become a slave to running the household.</p>
            <p>Such, then, are some of the impressions gained from a reading of the journal and its related
                    materials. The nine volumes, with their accompanying footnotes identifying personages and places or
                    explaining matters that might otherwise be puzzling or meaningless to a modern reader, run to 4,657
                    pages. Many a page, to be sure, is filled with inconsequential items. There is inevitably much
                    repetition and plenty of weather reports. If all such things are passed over, there remains a solid
                    core of worthwhile information. Accordingly, the <hi rend="i">Diary</hi> is a fundamental source for
                    the study of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Indiana in its era. It is also of great value for the business history of much of
                    the Middle West. It does not seem to have any rival in its class. The editing of the work is worthy
                    of the highest commendation, as has been recognized by a succession of reviewers.</p>
            <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-080-2-086"/>

            <p>"The rise of social history has been the most dramatic development in American historical
                    research over the past two decades" (p. 3). That declaration—the opening
                    sentence of the first chapter—provides the rationale for this most recent volume from the
                    American Association for State and Local History. The nine essays collected here are based on
                    presentations the authors made in 1980–1981 to a series of AASLH seminars on current
                    historical scholarship. The editors explain that their goal is "to present various
                    perspectives on what the new social history is all about and where it seems to be going"
                    (p. vii). Among the book's targeted audiences the principal one seems to be
                    "museum and historical agency professionals who are responsible for conducting research and
                    for designing and implementing interpretive programs" (pp. vii-viii).</p>
            <p>The first chapter—Peter Stearns's "overview" of the new social
                    history—is followed by topical chapters dealing with race and ethnicity (by Howard
                    Rabinowitz); women's history (Elizabeth Pleck); urban history (Kathleen Conzen); rural
                    history (Robert Swierenga); family history (Maris Vinovskis); labor history (David Brody); politics
                    (Samuel Hays); and material culture (Barbara and Gary Carson). The essays are of uniformly high
                    quality and the accompanying notes and suggestions for additional reading provide a helpful (though
                    by no means exhaustive) guide to important publications in the various fields under review.</p>
            <p>Different readers will approach this book with different purposes, and many will probably choose to
                    read only the chapter(s) relevant to their own problems or projects. Persons who read the volume
                    straight through should be prepared for some repetition, since several authors besides Stearns try
                    their hands at defining the new social history. While all the essays have much to recommend them,
                    those examining ethnic, urban, rural, and labor history are perhaps the most effective in
                    accomplishing the editors' intention for the book.</p>
            <p>The Carsons' discussion of "Learning Social History from Artifacts" merits
                    special mention. Their observation that recent work <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-080-2-088"/> by social
                    historians has "invested … with new meaning" the "vast array
                    of everyday artifacts that bulk large in museum and historical society collections" (pp.
                    190–91) is a provocative notion with far-reaching implications. Their treatment of the
                    "psychology of learning by looking" should be required reading for historical
                    society and museum personnel responsible for planning exhibits, interpretive programs, and tours.
                    And academic social historians will profit from consideration of the argument that they
                    "can do worse than make common cause with students of material culture" (pp. 184,
                    183).</p>
            <p>This carefully edited and thoughtful collection of essays is highly recommended for public and
                    academic libraries, as well as for all organizations that have an historical dimension in their
                    programming.</p>

            <p>Wooton patent desks are the masterpieces of Indiana's nineteenth-century furniture industry.
                    Connoisseurs of Victorian furniture admire the handsome Wooton cabinetry and are fascinated by the
                    intricate internal arrangement of drawers and pigeonholes. Designed originally for commercial use,
                    Wooton desks were found in the offices of such Gilded Age notables as Ulysses Grant, Jay Gould, and
                    John D. Rockefeller. This book, actually a catalog for an exhibit produced jointly by the Oakland (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>) Museum and the Indiana State Museum, contains a series of essays that interpret Wooton
                    desks as important examples of Victorian material culture.</p>
            <p>In the introduction, Kenneth Ames links the Wooton desk with the Victorians' predilection
                    for order. Ames says that the desks helped to modernize the businessman by providing "a
                    place for everything." In "The Office in the 19th Century," Page Talbott
                    analyzes changes in spatial arrangement and furnishings that accompanied the transformation of
                    countinghouses into offices. In this context, the Wooton desk is seen as one in a series of
                    technological innovations that the Victorian businessman used to impose order on the workplace and
                    to cope with the complexity of industrialization.</p>
            <p>In a curatorial interpretation, Deborah Cooper documents the physical changes and variations in the
                    Wooton desk as it evolved. <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-080-2-089"/> She shows that the primary changes
                    were in ornamentation and style. Wooton resisted substantial alteration of the desk's form,
                    despite a threat from competitors who closely imitated his patented design. Eventually the
                    adaptation of office hardware and procedures, such as the typewriter and modular filing systems,
                    made Wooton's desk obsolete.</p>
            <p>Betty Lawson Walters describes William S. Wooton, furniture maker and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> minister, and chronicles the Indiana firms that produced his desks. For most of its
                    twenty-odd years of production, the desk was made by Wooton's own <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> firm. Only when the desk's popularity declined did Wooton license a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> factory to produce his design. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> factory workers are examined by Susan Dickey in "The Men Who Made the Wooton
                    Desks." Dickey also suggests some generalizations about the labor force of the Indiana
                    furniture industry.</p>
            <p>This book is amply illustrated, including sixteen sumptuous color plates. Both institutions and all
                    contributors deserve credit for the quality of this catalog, which should be interesting to anyone,
                    not just collectors of Victoriana.</p>

            <p>The Donning Company specializes in the production of urban pictorial histories underwritten by local
                    firms—in the case of <hi rend="i">Gary, Indiana,</hi> by the Gary <hi rend="i">Post-Tribune</hi> and the Bank of Indiana. The company has no distribution facilities and often
                    commissions authors who are not historians. Such is not the case with this book; James B. Lane and
                    Ronald D. Cohen are both reputable historians who have previously done research in the city and have
                    a sense of the community's history. Their skills and past experiences combine to make the
                    book superior to Donning's similar publications.</p>
            <p>Still, the authors have not totally solved the problems inherent in all pictorial histories, the
                    major one of which is organization. Lane and Cohen must explain and connect the book's
                    illustrations. The question is how can this best be accomplished. They chose to organize the book
                    chronologically into six chapters; chapters two and three cover ten years, chapters four and five
                    cover fifteen years, and chapter six covers twenty-two years. Each chapter is introduced by a
                    one-page essay, and the only other text <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-080-2-090"/> consists of
                    paragraph-length captions. This format allows approximately three to four images per page, providing
                    good explanations of the picture's context but sacrificing a sense of historical change.</p>
            <p>The lack of this sense of change is a particular problem in the study of Gary since its history is
                    short and all modern. A twentieth-century invention, Gary evolved from a planned company town of
                    ethnic immigrants to a predominantly black city in a sixty-year period. The major question is why
                    did this happen? Unfortunately, <hi rend="i">Gary, Indiana</hi> does not answer this question. Part
                    of the reason for this failure is the division of space. The years to 1929 occupy over half the book
                    while the most recent years, from 1961, are covered in a few pages. The earlier sections include
                    many pictures of ethnic groups at work, school, church, and play. The later ones show more blacks
                    involved, but the emphasis is upon political and social events. Oddly enough, in the last chapter
                    there is no picture of anyone at work, although there are two of picket lines. The impression
                    conveyed by the chapter is that Gary's major occupation is political campaigning. Perhaps
                    this impression is a reflection of the priorities of the 1970s as industrial growth reflected the
                    priorities of fifty years earlier. If so, the pictures may be a more accurate barometer of changing
                    attitudes than the text.</p>
            <p>Despite the limitations, <hi rend="i">Gary, Indiana</hi> is a useful book which ought not be
                    overlooked by those interested in the history of the city, region, or state.</p>

            <p>The last general history of Ohio agriculture appeared in 1900. Now Robert Leslie Jones has replaced
                    it with a massively detailed and thoroughly documented volume. Few states, surely not Indiana, have
                    any comparable history of their farming. Hoosiers should profit from this study of a near and
                    similar neighbor; it might properly inspire emulation.</p>
            <p>Jones chooses to focus on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s principal lines of commercial production as they developed through 1880. He
                    concludes then, because he perceives by that year "a shading into a new farmers'
                    age with somewhat different problems" (p. ix). That "shading" eludes
                    sharp, general definition but is illustrated by concrete changes that overtook various kinds of
                    production around 1880. In the dairy business, for example, Holsteins were starting to <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-080-2-091"/> attain acceptance by that date. At the same time wool producers,
                    discouraged by western and foreign competition, were looking for new opportunities, especially in
                    dairying. Other kinds of farming appear to have continued through 1880 without attaching any special
                    significance to the year, but Jones senses that Ohio agriculture in general left its pioneering
                    stage about then.</p>
            <p>Nine of the fourteen chapters in this book are essentially self-contained histories of particular
                    products. Emphasis in each case is given to technical innovations and markets. Tables compiled from
                    census reports show where Ohio ranked among the states in each kind of production, and just which
                    parts of Ohio produced what animals and crops most abundantly. Ample numbers support particular
                    facts about particular industries.</p>
            <p>A few more broadly conceived chapters consider the physical setting of Ohio agriculture, pioneer
                    farms, the "Old Cleared Farm" that followed primitive beginnings, introduction of
                    farm machines, and agricultural organizations. An epilogue takes up a few miscellaneous facts that
                    "do not logically fit into other chapters" (p. 313) and takes a general, though
                    very brief, view of the changes that Ohio farming had experienced by 1880. If any part of the book
                    ought to be expanded, it would be that parting overview.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, too, more could be said about farmers. They are part of this study, certainly, and sometimes
                    make an interesting impression, but get little extended description. Jones's observations
                    about their technical conservatism, equalitarian relations with workmen, and attitudes toward women
                    are tantalizing. So is his observation that some farmers, in Holmes, Tuscarawas, and Monroe
                    counties, made better cheese than other folk because "their standards of cleanliness
                    reflected the Swiss background" (p. 202). It would be good to know more about the estimable
                    Swiss in that lovely part of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. It would be good to know more in general about cultural variations among Ohio farmers.</p>
            <p>But this book properly focuses on its author's chief interests. It does that so well that
                    anyone who wants to know about farming, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, or both together should find it as enjoyable as it is instructive.</p>

            <p>As John B. Boles reminds us, not all southerners were white. This slim volume succinctly synthesizes
                    over a decade of scholarship <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-080-2-092"/> on southern blacks from their
                    entry into Virginia in 1619 to their response to Emancipation in the late 1860s. Scholars will find
                    the bibliographic essay a useful guide to research that has been on the cutting edge of the
                    historical profession. Much of this work has been in response to specific questions, such as
                    "Which came first, racism or slavery?" Boles has used the issues raised as a
                    framework for developing his interpretation of the black experience.</p>
            <p>The book reveals how much the field has changed in recent years. The most important shift occurred in
                    the switch from writing from the perspective of the slaveholders to that of the slaves, a shift
                    stimulated by Stanley Elkins' portrayal of Sambo. Blacks are no longer viewed as passive
                    victims but as creative actors, building a community capable of ensuring their survival. The
                    consensus is that Melville Herskovits was more nearly correct than E. Franklin Frazier on the
                    question of African "survivals." An increased understanding of African culture has
                    resulted in a repudiation of the older "pie in the sky" view of black religion,
                    although Boles limits the element of black protest. An appreciation of African culture has also
                    promoted a view of Afro-American culture as the "after hours" creation of slaves
                    in their quarters, a development largely outside the influence of white society. The borrowing of
                    methodologies from other disciplines has encouraged comparative studies which have forced a
                    reevaluation of the harshness of American slavery. Demographic studies, in particular, have opened
                    up the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, allowing historians to overcome a static view of
                    slavery derived from their former emphasis upon the institution as it existed in its final decades.</p>
            <p>Boles sidesteps the issue of promiscuity among blacks. Early scholars believed that slavery
                    undermined the family and led to indiscriminate mating. The pendulum has recently swung in the
                    opposite direction, with historians claiming that slaves' sexual morality was healthier
                    than that of Victorian whites. Although the author mentions sanctions by the black church against
                    fornication and adultery, he does not discuss courtship patterns and prebridal pregnancy. He does
                    caution against romanticizing the notion of family stability, however, feeling that the custom of
                    exogamous marriage resulted in too many unions off the home plantation to permit the
                    "two-parents-present household" from ever having been the most common form in the
                    eighteenth century. A significant omission is the frequency—about 30 percent by the
                    mid-nineteenth century—with which slave marriages were broken by masters.</p>
            <p>Although Boles notes the pervasiveness of white racism, he sometimes glosses over its harsher
                    manifestations. For example, <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-080-2-093"/> the reader will look in vain for
                    mention of organized terrorist groups like the Jayhawkers or the Ku Klux Klan. This sanguine
                    approach may account for his conclusion: "perhaps it will be in the South after all that
                    racial harmony and justice will take deep root and prosper." Nevertheless, this is an
                    admirably lucid, comprehensive, and concise synthesis, and a useful addition to the shelves of
                    scholar and student alike.</p>

            <p>The War of 1812 has never had the hold on the national consciousness as the two major conflicts that
                    preceded and followed it: the American Revolution and the Civil War. The relative lack of interest
                    in the war is probably owing to its failure to resolve the stated principal problem that led to the
                    war: the impressment of American seamen by the British navy. Also, several brilliant victories were
                    offset by major disasters that left the two sides in a virtual stalemate at the end of the conflict.</p>
            <p>Most studies of the War of 1812 can be divided into two groups: studies on the causes of the war and
                    studies on military operations during the war. J.C.A. Stagg attempts to break from this pattern by
                    focusing on James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his political philosophy and on how he implemented that philosophy in conducting
                    the war. In a superbly researched and written volume, Stagg has managed to say something new about
                    an important period in American history.</p>
            <p>In his first two chapters, which cover the period 1783–1812 and occupy a full third of the
                    book, Stagg concentrates on two questions: "why James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> believed he could win a war against Great Britain, and win it, moreover, by seizing <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>" and "why the war occurred when it did" (p. ix). Although
                    the author has a good discussion of the development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s thought after the Revolution and the place of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> in his thought, the analysis could have been strengthened with a discussion of the
                    allure of a Canadian conquest to many American leaders both before and during the Revolution. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> was greatly influenced by their ideas. In both cases, the conquest of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> failed, in Stagg's words "from the practical difficulties of waging a
                    Canadian war" (p. 502).</p>
            <p>The remaining two-thirds of Stagg's book is devoted to a discussion of several factors that
                    influenced the conduct of the <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-080-2-094"/> war, including state-federal
                    politics, diplomacy, Indian-white relations, and army operations. The author succeeds remarkably
                    well in integrating these important themes into a coherent story. Rather than emphasizing the
                    ineptness with which the Americans conducted the war, a popular approach to the War of 1812 among
                    historians from the time of Henry Adams, Stagg focuses on "a detailed study of what the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> administration intended to happen in the War of 1812, of how it translated this
                    intention into specific policies, and only then to consider what happened to those policies as they
                    were carried out" (p. x).</p>
            <p>While the study is well balanced, there are some problems. Some readers will be dismayed with the
                    harsh treatment of William Henry Harrison. Stagg portrays Harrison as an indecisive, incompetent
                    leader through the use of several quotations from his enemies, but a more balanced appraisal of
                    Harrison would have to include statements from his friends and discuss his accomplishments. It could
                    not have been simply blind luck that made Harrison the most successful commanding general in the
                    Northwest during the War of 1812.</p>
            <p>There are other weaknesses in <hi rend="i">Mr. Madison's War,</hi> although they are not
                    wholly the fault of the author. A select bibliography, a more detailed index, and maps would have
                    made the work more useful. The hefty price for the hardcover edition is a part of a disturbing trend
                    in the publishing world that might result in many worthy academic works not being published at all
                    or only being available to more affluent individuals and institutions.</p>
            <p>Despite these drawbacks, <hi rend="i">Mr. Madison's</hi> War is an important work that
                    deserves to be read and reread. Stagg has made a significant contribution to our understanding of
                    the history of the early American republic.</p>

                    </placeName> scholarship" (p. 39). The last mentioned of these essays was written in 1960
                    and, unfortunately, <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-080-2-095"/> was not revised prior to republication.
                    Chapters which better stand the test of time deal with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s maturing racial and ethnic views, his political ideals and sense of
                    America's mission, and a comparison of his effect on history with that of Mahatma Gandhi.
                    Current further argues that President <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> acted with due restraint during the secession crisis and absolves him of blame for the
                    outbreak of civil war. (To support this assertion the author cites, among other sources, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Daily Journal.</hi>) Once hostilities commenced, however, the president realized that
                    more than a union of states was at stake—and the Civil War was fought to demonstrate that
                    political ideals such as democracy and representative government could survive the challenge.</p>
            <p>The three essays here published for the first time deal with Thaddeus Stevens, George Bancroft, and
                    the conception of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a southerner. In a lecture delivered in 1972, Current attempts to restore <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s tarnished image as the Great Emancipator. While Stevens was an aggressive,
                    steadfast advocate of slave emancipation and the enrollment of black troops in the Union Army, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> lagged behind. But Current correctly emphasizes that their responsibilities were
                    incomparable. The president had to hold the nation together and enlist the aid of conservatives and
                    Radicals, War Democrats as well as moderate Republicans. He had to move cautiously, and his personal
                    feelings regarding racial issues encouraged him to do so. Current does not portray <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> as an omniscient statesman because "it is naive to look for perfection in our
                    political leaders, either past or present" (p. 92).</p>
            <p>George Bancroft certainly understood this. The foremost historian of his time and a staunch Democrat,
                    Bancroft came to appreciate the contributions made by President <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but he never truly grasped "the complexities of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s personality" (p. 185). The chapter written in 1982 relating to
                    Bancroft's discourse at the public observance of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s birthday in 1866 is most revealing.</p>
            <p>The essay Indianans will especially appreciate was also written in 1982. In "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> the Southerner," Current disabuses the reader of the notion that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> (born in Kentucky of Virginian ancestry) developed a southern character and sentiments.
                    Instead, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> was well aware that his ancestors lived in Pennsylvania before emigrating to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, and he "developed an ambivalence toward his native state" (p. 155).
                    Although <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> obviously had a stronger emotional attachment to Illinois than to the Hoosier state, he
                    "retained much more fond and vivid memories of Indiana than of <placeName>

                    </placeName>" (p. 156). Current notes that while campaigning for Henry Clay in 1844, <placeName>

                    </placeName> "revisited the <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-080-2-096"/> Indiana scenes of his

                    transcended sectionalism.</p>
            <p>The format of this volume precludes a unifying theme beyond the fact that all the essays pertain to

            <p>As William Hanchett points out in the introduction to this fine book, most Americans have at least a
                    hazy notion of what transpired at Ford's Theater in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C., on April 14, 1865, but very few understand the complex background of the
                    assassination of Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Misconceptions and myths abound. Anyone who has ever taught American history has
                    listened to breathless students unfolding tales of various incredible conspiracies that explain this
                    event. Even scholarly accounts of the assassination have often contained factual errors and
                    questionable hypotheses.</p>
            <p>Part of the problem has been the lack of scholarly interest in the assassination. Hanchett shows how
                    amateurs and popularizers have dominated the historiography. The author argues that the
                    assassination was a political act that cannot be explained either by Booth's supposed
                    "madness" or by some deep-laid plot of government officials. Rather Booth and his
                    band of conspirators believed they had reason to hate the "tyrant" <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and acted to defend a long tradition of republican liberty, hi this way,

                    He gives only brief attention to the attempts by Radical Republicans to implicate Andrew Johnson in

                    But as Hanchett cogently observes, believers in conspiracy theories are seldom deterred by a
                    shortage of evidence. They merely assume that the conspirators destroyed critical information to
                    protect themselves. This very tenacity of belief makes it likely that even this excellent book will

                    appendix, notes, bibliography, index. $18.95.)</head>
            <p>Dorothy Schwieder has written the first study of the Iowa coal-mining industry, paying particular
                    attention to the lives of the miners and their families. She surveyed available literature on the
                    industry nationally, the folkways and attitudes of immigrants, and the development of the United
                    Mine Workers Union. To give this material an Iowa cast, she conducted oral interviews with former
                    miners, their wives, and descendants as well as collected social and economic data on three small
                    mining communities. Her major Iowa documentation was state government reports and district union
                    records.</p>
            <p>Schwieder clearly defines the importance of her topic: coal mining in the years 1895–1925
                    was second only to agriculture in contributing to the state economy. The UMW was the largest union
                    ever to operate in the state and disbanded there only in the early 1950s. Because the first miners
                    were of eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and British origin, succeeded after 1890 primarily by Italians and Croatians, the
                    industry introduced ethnic pluralism to the state. Many former miners and their families settled in
                    larger Iowa cities after coal production there peaked in 1917.</p>
            <p>Ethnic historians will react to Schwieder's discussion of the Italian-American family. She
                    insists that the Iowa situation confirms the national studies on other topics but concludes that
                    Iowa Italians lived more comfortably and were less alienated from employer <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-080-2-098"/> and society than their northeastern factory counterparts. She cites as
                    evidence that, because mine work was seasonal, many took summer jobs and lived in cities like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>—and returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>. Also, the author attributes a greater economic role to women than is generally
                    perceived. The miner's wife cared for house and children, of course, but she also took in
                    three to five boarders at an average eight-dollar monthly charge per boarder. She sometimes earned
                    more than her husband, and her work was steady and nonseasonal. Nor was income from garden-grown
                    produce and midwifery negligible. The author found interviewees generally optimistic, probably
                    reflecting the Iowa expectation of owning the family home or a nearby rich farm.</p>
            <p>For Indiana readers this book substitutes for a comparable study of the Indiana coal-mining industry.
                    Indiana and Iowa are related not only through the UMW and miners moving from one state to the other
                    but also because the decline of Iowa mining in the 1920s led some former miners to find jobs at <placeName>

            <p>With this study of rank and file employees of America's first big businesses, Walter Licht
                    has taken a long step toward closing a large and inexplicable gap in the history of
                    nineteenth-century railroading. He has also made a substantial contribution to American labor
                    history. At a time when workers' "cultures," strikes, and the
                    ever-popular Industrial Workers of the World absorb the attention of most scholars, Licht reminds
                    his readers of the central role of work in the lives and behavior of industrial employees.</p>
            <p>Licht asks the right questions. Who were the early railroad workers, how were they recruited and
                    compensated, what did they do, what difficulties did they face, and how did they live? By scouring
                    the records of early railway companies, the reminiscences of railroad employees, the reports of
                    various public agencies, and the many historians' studies of railroad companies and
                    railroad lore, he provides convincing but hardly definitive answers to most of these questions. In a
                    series of useful tables Licht documents wage levels, turnover, discharges, mobility, ethnicity, and
                    other pertinent subjects. In general, he finds that railroad workers lived hard and insecure lives.
                    They came from farm homes, reached <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-080-2-099"/> their highest positions
                    while still in their thirties, worked long hours, earned high but uncertain wages, chafed at
                    managerial directives and restraints, and often suffered death or disability in the performance of
                    their duties. In short, Licht concludes that railroad workers worked and lived much like most other
                    nineteenth-century industrial workers, despite the distinctive character of the railroad industry.
                    While much room remains for additional studies, Licht's research will be a benchmark for
                    all subsequent explorations of railroad labor in the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Of his many conclusions, Licht is most intrigued with the discovery that local superintendents and
                    foremen exercised virtually complete control over subordinate employees. They hired and fired and
                    disciplined at will. In effect, the corporate bureaucracies of the nineteenth century operated at
                    the lowest level, just as did the small factories and mines of the period. In his last chapter Licht
                    exploits this insight to explain the rise and success of trade unionism among railroad employees in
                    the years after the great strikes of 1877. He is fascinated by the phenomenon of workers demanding
                    the extension of bureaucratic procedures to the base of the corporate hierarchy. His analysis is
                    persuasive as far as it goes, but it is also incomplete and perplexing. It disregards several
                    relevant inquiries, most notably why corporate managers did not realize the disadvantages of
                    unsystematic, decentralized supervisory practices before the workers did. Licht seems to be arguing
                    that railroad executives were far less astute than manufacturing executives, a point that deserves
                    more thorough and detailed development. The last chapter therefore should be read as an invitation
                    to additional research, rather than an extension of the earlier material. The rest of the volume
                    will stand alone, a valuable examination of an important but little-known group that occupied center
                    stage in the drama of American industrial expansion.</p>

                    </placeName> immigrant workers and the radical political culture that emerged among some during this
                    period informs most essays. Hartmut Keil provides a useful introduction that seeks to unify the
                    various studies and place them within recent historiography. The papers are arranged in four major
                    groupings: the place of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> immigrant workers in American urban society, the changing character of industrial work
                    and worker adaptation, working-class neighborhoods and their everyday life, and radical politics and
                    culture. Most of the essays utilize local <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>-language press, census and enumeration district material, and extant union and
                    political records. Most impressive is the section dealing with industrialization and the
                    transformation of work. James R. Barrett's study of the rival conceptions of economic
                    rationalization held by management and by butcher workmen and the consequent conflict waged on the
                    shop floor for control of the work process is a gem. Similarly insightful is John B.

                    capturing the reality of immigrant working-class life: wives were desperate to make ends meet, half
                    of family income went for the most basic food, spouses fought over husbands' claims to beer
                    money, sickness was economically fatal, and running out from under accumulated rent was a survival
                    skill.</p>

            <p>This is a denominational history book for a nondenomination. It writes the history of the Christian
                    church in America being certain that its own religious family is clearly and favorably traced. It
                    shows that its own religious family has been and is an especially reliable representative of the
                    historic faith. It shows where its own religious family went wrong at some points, indicating
                    present hazards and offering counsel. By setting up the extremes as rigid fundamentalism on one side
                    and unrestrained modernism on the other, the preferred religious family can claim to occupy a
                    sensible middle ground along with God, the Bible, <hi rend="i">Christianity Today,</hi> Wheaton,
                    Fuller, Billy Graham, the National Association of Evangelicals, and a network of conservative
                    parachurch organizations never quite willing to declare loyalty to any existing denomination. Here
                    they stand along with what they see as the best of America's religious past and a
                    substantial conservative constituency across most Protestant denominations. This stance is
                    especially apparent when the account describes the tension in the churches over evolution and
                    biblical criticism. In this book the mainline denominations and every attempt at theological
                    accommodation for the past 150 years have gone frittering away into modernism and earned their
                    statistical obituaries now being compiled. Meanwhile the preferred religious family of evangelicals,
                    along with a few embarrassingly overheated companions, have held the old biblical line and pressed
                    on to victories unlimited. So this book is not the best place to go for a comprehensive treatment of
                    mainline denominational history. It will serve its best purpose as a church history reader for
                    adherents to this large paradenomination needing to find its own roots and self identity.</p>

                    William Hutchison, and Martin Marty. One is required to say of such a compilation that it is uneven,
                    but the joyful surprise is that so many have taken care to distill a little gem of an article out of
                    a profound knowledge of the area assigned. The editors and publisher have gone far beyond assembling
                    a collection of words. They have actually integrated narrative text, <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-080-2-102"/> subject articles, inset quotations, generous illustrations, color in
                    both illustration and paper, and expert typographic layout to produce a book which is a pleasure to
                    read. For those who can handle history with some advocacy, who want a review of American church
                    history capable of keeping a reader awake and occasionally aggravated, who welcome more
                    understanding of the manifestations of religious life so visible on America's skylines and
                    roadside signs and radio and television, this book is warmly recommended.</p>

            <p>If this first volume of his projected two-volume biography of John Foster Dulles is an accurate
                    indicator, Ronald W. Pruessen's work should be considered definitive, at least for this
                    generation of historians. Analyzing Dulles's life and thought from his birth in early 1888
                    until shortly before his appointment as Dwight D. Eisenhower's secretary of state in late
                    1952, Pruessen has produced a carefully researched, authoritatively argued study that deserves to be
                    read not only by <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> diplomatic historians but also by anyone interested in the international political
                    economy, in international organization, or in Republican politics in this century. This book is so
                    impressive, in fact, that Hoosiers can forgive the author for the inclusion of a humorous but
                    derogatory story about practicing law in Indiana in the 1880s, in which the lawyers
                    "earnestly engaged before the judge in contesting the ownership of a hog!" (p. 6).</p>
            <p>When he began his research, Pruessen expected "to fill in the details of a rough sketch of
                    Dulles as a rabid and unbalanced anticommunist, a megalomaniacal Presbyterian preacher, a viciously
                    partisan Republican, and a McCarthyite pushover" (p. 2). Instead, the "Dulles who
                    finally took form for me is a complex amalgam, many of whose characteristics have not really been
                    understood before" (p. 2). Pruessen convincingly portrays Dulles as a person whose concern
                    about world affairs "evidenced always a keen interest in the forest as well as the
                    trees" (p. 134), a leader with "a capacity for vision that was broader and deeper
                    than that of many in similar positions …" (p. 509).</p>
            <p>In numerous articles and speeches from the 1920s onward, in books like <hi rend="i">War, Peace and
                        Change</hi> (1939), and in his leadership during World War II on the National Council of
                    Churches' Commission on a Just and Durable Peace, Dulles sought to understand and explain
                    the causes of the world wars and economic crises of <pb n="189" id="VAA4025-080-2-103"/> his era and
                    to devise ways to prevent their recurrence in the future. The experience with the high tariff
                    policies of the interwar years, combined with his role as a Wall Street lawyer specializing in
                    international business, convinced him of the value of free trade and stable currencies. The
                    experience of World War II, combined with an abiding admiration for Woodrow Wilson, convinced him of
                    the need, in Pruessen's words, for "a strong mature <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to accept its responsibilities. Americans, he felt, could lead others away from
                    economic autarchy and its inevitable political and military repercussions, could lead others toward
                    a more integrated and rational community of nations" (p. 263).</p>
            <p>Pruessen generally praises Dulles for his thinking about world affairs in the 1930s and early 1940s,
                    a time when Dulles emphasized the economic causes of war and warned of the dangers of moralism and
                    chauvinism in describing the Axis powers. The author is much more critical of Dulles's
                    stridently anti-Soviet stance in the late 1940s, of his "increasing tendency to fall prey
                    to the classic trap of confusing national interests with universally desirable goals" (pp.
                    505–506). In an excellent chapter that analyzes the reasons for Dulles's shift
                    to the Cold War position in 1945–1946, Pruessen suggests the importance of peer pressure
                    among policy makers in lining up against Russia. He also emphasizes Dulles's belief
                    "that Moscow was resisting, and blatantly resisting, the kinds of international reforms
                    which he wanted to see accomplished in the postwar era" (p. 289). While in his diplomatic
                    work for the Harry S. Truman administration Dulles "went far beyond any simplistic Cold
                    Warrior's style" (p. 337); in his speeches and articles he dealt with East-West
                    relations in black/white terms—a pattern that he would continue as secretary of state in
                    the 1950s.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, Pruessen's otherwise excellent work is less than carefully edited. The book
                    is wordy and repetitive in places; symptomatic of the problem is that at least three quotes from
                    Dulles are used twice, and frequently the reader has the sense of having encountered a specific
                    point before. Properly edited, the volume would have been more impressive at 409 pages than it is
                    currently at 509. More awareness of the findings of other scholars, especially for the 1940s, might
                    also have strengthened the author's conclusions.</p>

                    $19.95.)</head>
            <p>Diane Ravitch concludes her survey of American education since World War II on an upbeat note:
                    "Those who have labored <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-080-2-104"/> on behalf of American
                    education have seen so many barriers scaled, so much hatred dispelled, so many possibilities
                    remaining to provide the basis for future reconciliation. To believe in education is to believe in
                    the future, to believe in what may be accomplished through the disciplined use of intelligence,
                    allied with cooperation and good will" (p. 330). <hi rend="i">The Troubled Crusade</hi> is
                    hardly a celebration of the triumphs of modern schooling, however. On the contrary, it is a catalog
                    of the trials and tribulations of public schooling and higher education, with a central focus on the
                    battles in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Her thesis is that following World War II the locus of power shifted from the local
                    college and school system to the president, congress, and the supreme court.</p>
            <p>At war's end a myriad of school problems came to the nation's attention, and they
                    have remained to the present. Three issues were paramount: federal aid, church-state relations, and
                    racial justice. And they were interrelated. The Catholic Church opposed federal funding because
                    parochial schools were excluded, and this opposition, combined with conservative political forces,
                    prevented federal spending for two decades. Another battle was fought over the meaning and role of
                    progressive education, a legacy of earlier decades. While she applauds some of progressive
                    education's contributions, she sympathizes with those critics of the 1950s (and since) who
                    preferred a return to "intellectual development and mastery of subject matter" (p.
                    55). And they won, or did they?</p>
            <p>Her discussion of the influence of the Red Scare on education is concise, starting with an
                    explanation of the role of radical politics in the 1930s. She is less than sympathetic with the
                    purges, concluding that "when the rage for conformity ended, it was like a fever that
                    broke" (p. 113). The system had, after all, survived (but many teachers had not). Her
                    discussion of race and education, spread over two chapters, traces the move from desegregation to
                    affirmative action, from a civil rights consensus to conflict and confusion. Equally disturbing were
                    the changes taking place in higher education, particularly the campus rebellions in the 1960s. The
                    public schools were also plagued by criticism and disruption. By the 1970s, however, there was less
                    call for open classrooms and curriculum reform, and more interest in meeting the needs of the
                    handicapped, those who could not speak English, or who in other ways felt discriminated against. As
                    the 1980s opened, there were many answers but few solutions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Troubled Crusade</hi> is a fascinating overview of the dominant issues that have
                    marked primary, secondary, and higher education during the last four decades. Ravitch is most
                    sensitive to the nuances of each issue. Yet there are problems. This is the story of court cases,
                    national legislative battles, and books and <pb n="191" id="VAA4025-080-2-105"/> articles. Children
                    do not appear. Teachers and classrooms are invisible. The success or failure of education cannot be
                    measured from such a lofty perch. Moreover, while discussing the background of many issues, such as
                    the Red Scare, she has little discussion of the changing socioeconomic context. What about the role
                    of corporate business interests, technology, changing job markets? Her liberal orientation prevents
                    her from seriously analyzing the sources and uses of power in American society. The dearth of
                    historical studies of American education since World War II makes this an important contribution,
                    but it is only an initial exploration.</p>

                    Buley's <hi rend="i">Old Northwest</hi> should trap the reader: the 1,200 pages of text
                    that follow will easily hold all but the most anesthetized television devotee. <hi rend="i">The Old
                        Northwest</hi> is narrative history at its best, written with sparkling detail, involvement, and
                    enthusiasm, written in clear prose of well-crafted sentences, paragraphs, and chapters, written to
                    explain a subject of fundamental significance and large human interest. Buley's history of
                    the territories and states of the Old Northwest is largely a history of the people, of their
                    migration and settlement in the new land, their work and pleasure, sickness and health, family and
                    friends, schools and churches, travel and trade, politics and government. It is based on laborious
                    research in primary sources, particularly newspapers and travel accounts, all of which Buley used to
                    "read" the culture without falling prey to the overly romantic notions that often
                    attach to pioneer life. <hi rend="i">The Old Northwest</hi> lacks some of the quantitative,
                    analytical, and theoretical apparatus that marks the "new" social history of the
                    last two decades; yet, no other book tells more about pioneer life west of the Appalachians. The
                    committee that awarded <hi rend="i">The Old Northwest</hi> a Pulitzer Prize in 1950 made a wise and
                    enduring choice. This reissue again makes available a book that should be in every library and a
                    book that all interested in Indiana's history must read. Those who do <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-080-2-106"/> will likely argue that it is the very best book ever written about

                    Institutional histories are normally dry, stuffy affairs which can turn even the most vigorous
