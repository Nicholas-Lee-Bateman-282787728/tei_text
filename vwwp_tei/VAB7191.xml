                <opener>MY LORD,</opener>
                <p><hi>AN</hi> anonymous Author, whose own name could give no importance to this
                    ephemeral production, ventures to claim the aid of yours; as one not only noble,
                    but intimately connected with the subject of his verse.</p>
                <p>To the justâminded, the opinions of <emph>no</emph> individual, however obscure,
                    should be utterly indifferent; since each man undoubtedly represents the
                    opinions of a certain number of his fellowâmen. It is the conviction of this,
                    and the belief, that to abstain from giving our views on any point because we
                        fear<pb n="vi" xml:id="VAB7191-002"/> due attention will not be paid us,
                    savours rather of vanity than humility, which have induced me to intrude at this
                    time on your Lordship and the Public.</p>
                <p>For the <emph>mode</emph> in which I have done so, some apology is perhaps
                    necessary; since the application of serious poetry to the passing events of the
                    day has fallen into disuse, and is, if not absolutely contemned, at least much
                    discouraged.</p>
                <p>Doubtless there are those to whose tastes and understandings, dry and forcible
                    arguments are more welcome than reasonings dressed in the garb of poetry. Yet as
                    poetry is the language of feeling, it should be the language of the multitude;
                    since all men can feel, while comparatively few can reason acutely, and still
                    fewer reduce their reasoning theories to practicable schemes of improvement.</p>
                <p>My Lord, I confess myself anxious to be <emph>heard</emph>, even though unable to
                    convince. It is the misfortune of the time, that subjects of great and
                        pressing<pb n="vii" xml:id="VAB7191-003"/> interest are so numerous, that
                    many questions which affect the lives and happiness of hundreds, become, as it
                    were, comparatively unimportant; and are thrust aside by others of greater
                    actual moment. Such, as it appears to me, is the present condition of the
                    Factory Question: and although I am conscious that it requires but an inferior
                    understanding to <emph>perceive</emph> an existing evil, while the combined
                    efforts of many superior minds are necessary to its remedy; yet I cannot but
                    think it is incumbent on all who feel, as I do, that there <emph>is</emph> an
                    evil which it behoves Christian lawgivers to remove,âto endeavour to obtain such
                    a portion of public attention as may be granted to the expression of their
                    conviction.</p>
                <p>My Lord, my ambition extends so far, and no farther. I publish this little Poem
                    with the avowed hope of obtaining that attention; I publish it
                        <emph>anonymously</emph>, because I have no right to expect that my personal
                    opinion would carry more weight with it than that of any other individual. The
                        inspiriting<pb n="viii" xml:id="VAB7191-004"/> cheer of triumph, and the
                    startling yell of disapprobation, are alike composed of a number of voices, each
                    in itself insignificant, but in their union most powerful. I desire, therefore,
                    only to <emph>join</emph> my voice to that of wiser and better men, in behalf of
                    those who suffer; and if the matter or the manner of my work be imperfect,
                    allowance will, I trust, be made for its imperfection, since it pretends to so
                    little.</p>
                <p>I will only add, that I have in <emph>no</emph> instance overcharged or
                    exaggerated, by poetical fictions, the picture drawn by the Commissioners
                    appointed to inquire into this subject. I have strictly adhered to the printed
                    Reports; to that which I believe to be the melancholy truth; and that which I
                    have, in some instances, myself had an opportunity of witnessing.</p>
                <p>I earnestly hope I shall live to see this evil abolished. There will be
                    delayâthere will be opposition: such has ever been the case with all questions
                    involving interests, and more especially<pb n="xi" xml:id="VAB7191-005"/> where
                    the preponderating interest has been on the side of the existing abuse. Yet, as
                    the nobleâhearted and compassionate Howard became immortally connected with the
                    removal of the abuses which for centuries disgraced our prison discipline; as
                    the perseverance of Wilberforce created the dawn of the longâdelayed
                    emancipation of the negroes;âso, my Lord, I trust to see <emph>your</emph> name
                    enrolled with the names of these great and good men, as the Liberator and
                    Defender of those helpless beings, on whom are inflicted many of the evils both
                    of slavery and imprisonment, without the odium of either.</p>
