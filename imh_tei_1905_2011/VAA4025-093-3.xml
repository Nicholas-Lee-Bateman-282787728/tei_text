            <p>In the first decade of the twentieth century poor relief policies and practices were rewritten and
                    reworked to adjust to a changing perception of who was deserving of help and what kind of help they
                    should receive. Before the national depression of the 1890s relief was limited almost exclusively to
                    those residents who were unable to work because they were too old, too young, too sick, or too
                    disabled. This deserving group did not include the able-bodied unemployed because of the prevalent
                    belief (true or not) that jobs existed in this land of opportunity for anyone who was willing to
                    work. The ablebodied unemployed were not only denied help they were blamed for their condition. It
                    was their fault that they were out of work, poor, and needy. They lacked something or some
                    things-industry, sobriety, or thrift. This belief was so strong that being down and out was
                    considered both a shame to hide and a crime to punish. Those indigent able-bodied who left home to
                    find work, denigrated as tramps, were excluded from official help and could be classified as
                    vagrants and jailed.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This commonly held negative perception of the poor was a central principle of the Charity
                    Organization Society (COS), which focused on reforming character rather than giving alms with the
                    overall goal of helping the poor to help themselves. Conceived in <placeName>

            <p>In a number of studies of welfare reform, social historians have indicated that the pressures of
                    national depressions eventually forced COS reformers to realize that poverty-producing factors were
                    not simply personal weaknesses but were tied to the economic climate, a realization that caused
                    society members gradually to change their aim from reforming the individual to reforming the
                    environment. According to these historians, the perception of a causal relationship between
                    unemployment and poverty was more fully realized and even extended to transient homeless men after
                    the depression following the panic of 1907.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                    asserts that an alliance of business, academic, and charity interests knowingly constructed tramps

                    claims that the COS members' defining factor was their religious orientation.
                    "Charity organizers regarded themselves as religious people working in a religious
                    tradition," Leiby states, and they embodied a "Christian notion of a community

                    welfare historian Clarke A. Chambers, the "deep cultural anxiety on the part of elites and
                    middle Americans" who "feared subversion of values and cultural norms" is
                    responsible for the "American habit of distinguishing between those perceived to be

                    of Indiana in the upper <geogName>Wabash River</geogName> valley. The surrounding farms, valued at
                    $14,078,470, produced excellent crops, especially corn and oats. A railroad center, <placeName>

                    passenger trains daily. Ease of transportation made it the site of large jobbing houses dealing with
                    all kinds of merchandise. Although <placeName>

            <p>The LCOS's focus on finding employment for those needing relief distinguished it from other
                    alms-giving private charities. An examination of the LCOS's General Register from December,
                    1905, to September, 1908, reveals that only a few applicants (11 percent) were out of work or
                    homeless. Although only 46 asked for work, jobs were found for 121 of the 557 petitioners. If an
                    applicant was unable to work, employment was often found for other members of the family. Sometimes
                    applicants asking for garments were given jobs instead.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> The work was of all
                    kinds-much of it temporary, as indicated by such notations as "secured work off and on all
                    winter" or "secured several small jobs."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> One single
                    mother was given employment as a wet nurse. Many different hotels and local plants such as the Safe
                    and Lock Company or Barbee Wire provided more permanent work.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to gain the cooperation of all the city's charities, the LCOS assured existing
                    charitable organizations that it would not "interfere" with or
                    "supersede" them.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Nonetheless, the society found it more
                    difficult to secure their cooperation than that of the township trustee, in part because of their
                    large number and variable character. The primary strategy for getting the support of other agencies
                    was to include their members on an advisory council; however, despite the promise of the organizers
                    of the nascent LCOS that "every church and institution in <placeName>

                    The men and women of this LCOS coalition were middle-class citizens and, by and large, were neither
                    of the wealthy nor of the working class. The policy-making bodies were weighted slightly in favor of
                    males (the board of directors, six males and three females; the advisory council, fourteen males and
                    fourteen females); but the committees-such as the relief bureau-that worked directly with the needy
                    were all-female. The men in the LCOS coalition were primarily professionals and businessmen; most
                    were educators and ministers, but the membership included newspapermen, bank directors, retailers,
                    manufacturers, real estate and insurance dealers, and a funeral director. The women were spouses
                    from these groups (except for one teacher, one Purdue professor, and one deaconess). The coalition
                    was almost stereotypically WASP. The members shared the same political affiliation, Republican (just
                    one Democrat), and the same general religious orientation, Protestant (just two Jews). These people
                    were joiners. They belonged to many other charities and clubs-the Civic League, the YMCA, the Humane
                    Society-and as such were active boosters in promoting their vision for their community and in
                    securing their own place in it. The group had an air of snobbery about it. Many members were
                    actively involved in organizing the city's first country club, an exclusive group. The
                    seven Protestant clergymen who served on the LCOS's advisory council did not include any
                    from the city's churches with a "foreign" element, such as the Colored
                    Baptists or the <placeName>

            <p>Although the LCOS achieved substantial support for its selfappointed leadership role, cooperation was
                    far from universal. Advisory council minutes complained about lack of cooperation from some church
                    aid societies and the Jackson Club (a Democratic organization),<hi rend="sup">30</hi> but the
                    biggest thorn in the side of the LCOS was a small nondenominational evangelical organization, the
                    Union Mission. Unlike the LCOS the Union Mission was not part of a national movement, nor was it
                    sponsored by a group of leading citizens. It sprang from the efforts of one man, Frank Wetzel, a

            <p>Wetzel's Union Mission gained a foothold in the community almost immediately, partly as a
                    result of his self-promotion through newspaper announcements and public appearances but also because
                    it filled a void in the community left by the Salvation Army's departure in 1897. In 1904 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> had no evangelical Christian group that strongly appealed to the working class and
                    sought to rescue sinners through faith in Christ and to help the poor. Wetzel established a
                    relationship with law enforcement officials by inviting the city police to refer the needy to him
                    and by conducting weekly services at the jail, which was also the county sheriffs home. Within two
                    months Superintendent Wetzel was conducting three Sunday services, including a large Sunday School,
                    and had organized a picnic for poor children (to become a yearly event) which began with a parade of
                    young people waving American flags and led by a brass band. In December 210 people attended the
                    mission's first annual Christmas dinner for the poor. By the end of the first year Wetzel
                    had acquired an assistant, John Nichols, a machinist from the Monon shops, and had published his
                    annual statistics, which boasted of thirty-three conversions and forty-eight jail meetings, as well
                    as 370 meals served, lodging found for 134, garments distributed to 1,250, and employment secured
                    for 12. The year's work was financed by $884 received from collections,
                    donations, and lectures.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The mission's annual statistics also mentioned work with twenty-four wayward girls and homes
                    found for seventeen children, indicating that Wetzel had ventured into areas already claimed by two
                    well-established organizations, the Young Women's Christian Home Association (YWCHA) and
                    the <placeName>

                    YWCHA's board president, was actively working to form a COS in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As a result of rumors that surfaced after Wetzel received favorable publicity for
                    securing the custody of two girls who had run away from the YWCHA home, McKay was compelled to issue
                    a denial that the YWCHA and the Union Mission were going to consolidate. This denial foreshadowed
                    future incompatibilities with the LCOS.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>Even though the Union Mission had provided general relief in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> for a year and a half, Wetzel was not invited to belong to the LCOS's advisory
                    council. The Union Mission's alms giving epitomized the kind of charity that the LCOS
                    opposed-indiscriminate giving without investigation of worthiness. Differences boiled out into the
                    open after the LCOS had been in operation for a year. The <hi rend="i">Sunday Times</hi> reported
                    that Wetzel had been "bitterly assailed by certain energetic workers of the opposition
                    society"; in reply Wetzel protested against the "meddling" in his affairs
                    and threatened suit for "slanderous ways." Although the specifics of the alleged
                    slander were not spelled out, the general accusation apparently intimated that Wetzel was a
                    "grafter" with "ill gotten goods diverted from the purposes from which
                    they were intended."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> The one-sided newspaper accounts described
                    Wetzel as "a self-appointed agent of charity who seeks a monopoly on gifts and
                    donations" and "demands the good people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> contribute to charity through him."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> These descriptions
                    are certainly ironic since the LCOS itself was openly seeking a monopoly on donations. Although
                    Wetzel was accused of ungentlemanly rhetoric, the LCOS's response was belligerent in tone:
                    "if you are in my way, step down and out, else you may get hurt, morally I
                        mean."<hi rend="sup">36</hi> Wetzel went to the Ministers' Association, an
                    organization that had already endorsed the LCOS, to try to explain his side of things, but the
                    ministers walked out before he finished his presentation. Although the <hi rend="i">Sunday
                    Times</hi> suggested an investigation to settle the matter, this was not done.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ill feelings between the LCOS and the Union Mission smoldered on, fueled by LCOS attacks. The
                    society's general secretary denigrated the mission's picnics, pointing out that
                    the LCOS worked "quietly" to improve conditions for the poor rather than
                    "parading our poor children in the streets as paupers headed by a brass band."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Newspaper editorials criticized the mission's Christmas dinner,
                    calling it "mistaken charity" because "a public dinner …
                    breaks up the family circle and attracts members away from the rightful observance of the
                        day."<hi rend="sup">39</hi> In talks entitled the "City Mission and How I see
                    It," given to groups such as the women's circle of the Baptist Church, the LCOS
                    general secretary even attacked Wetzel's religious mission. Later, in 1910, LCOS board
                    members helped to organize a competing city mission because of so-called serious difficulties in the
                    Union Mission. This new mission offered a Christmas dinner, too, competing with Wetzel for the
                    attendance of the poor. Despite the <list type="footnotes">

                    Wetzel's mission continued to provide religious services and poor relief. Its summary of
                    services in the last five months of 1908, for example, listed numerous distributions: 510 meals; 117
                    nights lodging; 128 garments; 2 tons of coal; as well as employment found for 10. In January, 1910,
                    the mission sponsored a well-attended revival meeting featuring music and outside speakers.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Union Mission endured because it received enough money and goods through donations to function
                    and because the needy poor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> went to it for help. Despite the LCOS's preemption of contributions from the
                    Merchants' Association and other organizations, the Union Mission continued to receive
                    strong support, collecting $750 for the five months ending in January, 1909, for example.
                    The revenue loss resulting from the diverted donations was partially made up by larger amounts that
                    were collected in corner kettles from ordinary people, whom the Sunday Times described as from
                    "more modest quarters," rather than from the "influential
                    citizens" who sanctioned the LCOS. The Union Mission also had the support of the city
                    officials (all but one of whom were Democrats) and the city police (half Democrats and half
                    Republicans). The police continued placing women and children at the mission rather than at the
                    LCOS-supported institutions despite the pressure to do otherwise.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who had historically put together the means of survival from any and all sources, did
                    not necessarily heed the LCOS's behavioral demands. Garden seeds for poor children to plant
                    for food remained at the LCOS office for want of takers, a long-planned saving system to inculcate
                    thrift never got off the ground, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s poor continued to patronize the mission. The mission's Christmas
                    dinner was attended by 248 people in 1907 and was prepared for 500 in 1908. The Union
                    Mission's continued attraction can be partly understood in personal terms. Destitute
                    families might well prefer a place run by someone like themselves rather than by someone who looked
                    down on their character. The mission also added some color to hard lives. Its Christmas
                    entertainment, for example, with songs, children's recitations, and Santa with toys for the
                    little ones, was certainly more fun than the receipt of a basket of food after a screening to
                    determine if one deserved help and another <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The depression following the panic of 1907 jeopardized the LCOS's strategy of using
                    employment as a means of relief and as a way to differentiate the deserving from the undeserving.
                    When the national depression began with two jolts in the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s newspapers were commenting on the unemployment. The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> noted that many men were hunting work while the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> observed:
                    "Almost every industrial institution of which the city boasts is running on short time or
                    has laid off some men." Editorials continued to note the hard times throughout 1908 and
                    into 1909. In November, 1908, for example, the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> commented: "Many
                    men have been idle, there has been little opportunity for saving and an increase in the number of
                    destitute is expected"; and as late as June, 1909, the newspaper reported: "There
                    are men out of work. … business and industrial conditions are improving but it takes time
                    after a crisis for industrial conditions to get to the substantial basis."<hi rend="sup">43</hi> No official numbers of unemployed in <placeName>

            <p>As noted by COS historian Frank D. Watson, many unemployed managed by themselves the first year but
                    were unable to do so the second. The LCOS's advisory council minutes confirm the local
                    unemployment, noting in December, 1908, that "unemployed exist who need to be cared
                    for"; in January, 1909, that there was "no work in case men applied"; and
                    in December, 1909, that there were "calls for work but no calls for workers." From
                    September, 1908, to August, 1909, LCOS applicants in the homeless, out-of-work category increased
                    dramatically. Almost one-half (94 out of 194) of the LCOS's new applicants (both residents
                    and nonresidents) were classified as out of work or homeless (compared to 4 in 1905–1906;
                    17 in 1906–1907; and 42 in 1907–1908). In addition, 16 ongoing cases were also
                    listed in this category, making a total of 110 in that one year. In January, 1908, <list type="footnotes">

            <p>By making special efforts the LCOS did provide some kind of work for thirty-seven applicants between
                    September, 1908, and August, 1909. Examples of the LCOS's creativity included giving a
                    woman laundry equipment and providing axes for two men who were to pay for them within thirty days.
                    In January, 1909, the society tried to set up a woodyard, but snow soon stopped that effort. In
                    addition, in April, 1909, the LCOS placed advertisements in the local newspapers asking for jobs
                    relating to spring housecleaning. A few longtime clients did small jobs for the LCOS, such as
                    running errands for ten cents or cleaning the office for sixty cents, but no amount of extra
                    attention could eliminate the depression's effect on the job market. In
                    1908–1909 the percentage of applicants who received no aid more than doubled from that of
                    the preceding year (from 18 percent to 43 percent), and only two applicants refused work that was
                    offered (1 percent as compared to 12 percent).<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

            <p>Considering the number of working people affected by the depression throughout the nation, the local
                    homeless and out-of-work residents who were helped by either the LCOS or the township trustee were
                    relatively few. (Most of the LCOS's homeless and out-of-work applicants were nonresidents.)
                    The LCOS aided only twenty such residents (new applicants and continuing cases) between September
                    1,1908, and August 31,1909, and public poor relief was given by the township trustee to
                    approximately twenty-six more in this category. The small number of unemployed residents who were
                    helped by either private or public relief givers indicates that the majority of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> citizens struggled along on their own. Research by Leah Hannah Feder found that in a
                    number of eastern cities in this period relief from charitable agencies was the last of several
                    options, including emigration and use of savings, chosen by the unemployed. Similarly, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> savings from thrift accounts were also depleted.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> the very few unemployed who sought relief indicated that they were not looking for
                    "the easy life" of three-dollar grocery vouchers and secondhand clothes. Although
                    some might have benefited from what COS historian Watson identified as the first source of help in a
                    community, the "invisible relief fund" from kin, friends, and neighbors, the mass
                    of struggling unemployed residents refused to define themselves as charity cases through
                    applications for formal relief. Eligibility rules allowed for relieving the distress of the
                    involuntarily unemployed residents, but shared values did not. The working poor, like the
                    middle-class reformers, believed that work was an individual responsibility and that not working was
                    shameful. Few ablebodied men were willing to accept the onus and stigma attached to asking for
                    official help. The Courier, in fact, speculated that many of the poor, "too proud to tell
                    of their condition," would never be identified. LCOS President Moran concurred: "A
                    great many of the deserving poor are rather backward about making their wants known and in many
                    cases suffering and privation result."<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

            <p>Thirty-three-year-old Harry Runda was a case in point. A family man with five children, Runda was out
                    of work for three months but did not apply for any kind of relief. He was known as "a good
                    worker," and he tried to support his family with occasional jobs as a teamster. One June
                    day carrying a load of cherries into town to sell, with his ten-year-old son by his side, he stopped
                    his team on the bridge over the <geogName>Wabash River</geogName> and jumped. It was said that he
                    committed suicide because his family was destitute and because of his failure to procure steady

            </p>
            <p>The LCOS immediately took over the Runda relief effort. The general secretary, board president, and
                    treasurer met in the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>'s office just three days after the suicide
                    to devise a plan for this "worthy" case. They approved the baseball benefit, added
                    a moving picture benefit at the Arc Theater, and opened a special relief fund. The local press
                    deemed the response to the appeal "remarkable"; merchants, businessmen, and
                    neighbors gave liberally. The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> published a daily listing of contributors to
                    the fund, which totaled $850. The contributors were assured that the money would be
                    disbursed and used "to the very best advantage" under the direction of the LCOS.
                    The money, placed in a trust fund at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> Savings Bank, was to be given to Mrs. Runda in installments for rent and necessities
                    and was expected to last four or five years until the children could be employed. The LCOS provided
                    more than financial help for the Rundas; the advisory council minutes reported that the general
                    secretary visited the Rundas every two or three days.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The response to the Runda case was quite different from that to another publicized case that same
                    year. James Deboe, an AfricanAmerican hod carrier and a family man with six children, lived in a
                    two-room shack that also housed his wife's insane brother, her sister, and her
                    sister's child. On January 22,1909, the township trustee, the probation officer, and two
                    policemen descended upon the Deboe home with an order from the juvenile court to remove the
                    children. The officials found conditions described as "the worst ever known to exist in the
                    city." Deboe was at work that day, but five of the "half clad" children
                    were "romping amid the squalor" while the sixth, an infant, was nursing at his
                    mother's breast. Mrs. Deboe was lying uncovered on a filthy cot, so weakened by
                    tuberculosis that she could not turn over. The officials sent her to St. Elizabeth's
                    Hospital where she died a few days later; she was just thirty years of age. They removed the
                    children and placed them temporarily with other families and then at institutions in <placeName>

                    could have escaped the charity workers, the police, and even the neighbors of the stricken
                    family." The editor suggested that other families "of the same desperate
                    character" could exist, but no special funds or benefits for this miserable family were
                    initiated. In fact, just one week later the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> retracted its criticism and
                    upheld the LCOS, saying that the case was a "new discovery" and adding,
                    "It is comforting to know that charity was given and an effort made to improve the
                    surroundings of the family."<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

            <p>Despite the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>'s defense, the Deboes' case was not a new
                    discovery. The LCOS and the township trustee had been aware of conditions in the Deboe shack for
                    almost a year. A relative had reported the family to the society on February 4, 1908. Ten days
                    later, after the assistant secretary had visited and investigated, the family received clothing from
                    the LCOS and food from the township trustee. Listing improvidence as the cause of distress, the
                    society implied that Deboe had not managed his resources well enough to take care of his dependents.
                    Half a year later, in October, the LCOS again investigated the Deboe shack in response to a report
                    regarding the illness of Deboe's sister-in-law. Her case was dismissed with no dispensation
                    of aid. On December 28, 1908, a month before the official action, the district nurse reported that
                    the Deboes needed help because of illness. Nothing was done until an LCOS volunteer reported the
                    case again ten days later, at which time a visit was made and provisions dispensed. In just one week
                    the oldest Deboe son, twelveyear-old Willie, asked for more help, and the family received additional
                    provisions. The LCOS visited the Deboes again on January 19; three days later neighbors once more
                    called attention to their condition, and official action was taken.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the advisory council meeting of January 25, the general secretary defended the work of the LCOS,
                    pointing to a recent donation of fifty garments for the children. An explanation exonerating the
                    LCOS also appeared in the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> under the signature "one
                    interested." The letter stated that the LCOS had given the Deboes food and clothing during
                    the winters of 1907–1908 and 1908–1909, but when it became evident that the
                    family could not care for itself (for example, the children did not know how to put on the donated
                    clothing), the case was reported for "official action." The writer went on to
                    claim, "But for personal investigation and prompt action the family might have continued a
                    charge for years to come." In fact the surviving children did remain wards as did the next
                    generation. Just five years later daughter Ida Deboe released her illegitimate child to the County

            <p>It was true that the LCOS had given direct help to the Deboes, but it was without a sense of urgency.
                    The aid was slow in coming and minimal, with no continuity or follow up. The children's
                    situation was not deemed critical as they were not included on the lists of children presented to
                    the Board of Children's Guardians by the general secretary. When the Deboes were finally
                    referred to that board on January 12, action was delayed until old cases were off the docket.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Perhaps race helps to account for the dilatory response to the
                    Deboes' plight,<hi rend="sup">56</hi> but another more potent factor was that of
                    deservingness. The deserving were those morally excused from work. Mrs. Runda, a widow and a mother
                    of five children, one a two-week-old infant, could not possibly be responsible for her condition.
                    There was no moral slur on her dependency. The newspapers painted an appealing picture of
                    "a frail woman" who was "left to fight the world's
                    battles" or as "the little woman who is left dependent with five children to care
                    for." As the Journal put it, "The case of Mrs. Runda, her helplessness, the
                    injustice of it all, has appealed to all." And so it dideveryone wanted to help a mother
                    who hoped "to keep the family together, until her children can be earning
                        something."<hi rend="sup">57</hi> James Deboe's situation did not have this
                    universal appeal. He was an able-bodied male, working but not earning enough to support his eleven
                    dependents. The categorization of improvidence (used three separate times to describe his case in
                    the LCOS General Register) implied a deficiency on his part. The newspapers had no empathetic
                    descriptions of his situation and no suggestions of help to keep his family together. Not a word was
                    written about low wages; no efforts were made to find Deboe better-paying work. Able-bodied working
                    men were suspect.</p>
            <p>Deboe's case illustrates the lack of sympathy for the needy ablebodied male and the blind
                    eye turned toward economic causes of poverty, even during a depression. As a resident, however,
                    Deboe was eligible for help. He and his dependents did receive services from a combination of public
                    and private sources. He had a job, albeit a lowpaying one; he had a place to live, albeit a shack;
                    he got help, albeit inadequate. A nonresident's lot could be far worse.</p>

                        of varied aid to a black family man who would not be classified as ablebodied; John Morgan, who
                        was ill (traditionally worthy), received provisions, shoes, and visits, and work was found for
                        other family members. LCOS Day Book, July 3, 7, October 24, November 5, 1908.</item>

            <p>Hundreds of nonresidents, dislocated because of the aftereffects of the panic of 1907, rode the rails

                    </placeName> during 1908 and 1909. The LCOS did not exclude these able-bodied nonresidents from
                    consideration for aid as previous <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> private charities had done and as the township trustee still did. Although the revised
                    poor law of 1901 permitted the trustee to provide some form of hard manual labor for able-bodied
                    nonresidents, this option was not exercised in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> as it was in some other Indiana cities, such as Anderson, where the men were put to
                    work clearing stumps. Almost half (46 percent) of the LCOS's applicants from September 1,
                    1908, through August 31, 1909, were homeless nonresidents (all but six of them males). The society
                    treated these men more superficially than residents, giving no aid to 51 percent of the eighty-nine
                    nonresident applicants and only helping one a second time. The LCOS's concern about
                    nonresidents was directed more toward tactics to deal with the overall "tramp
                    problem" than toward helping individual transients through a desperate situation.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tramp problem was not a new one. Vagrancy was a crime in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the local press represented nonresident transients as nuisances and threats.
                    Nevertheless, rather than being fined and imprisoned for up to thirty days as called for in a city
                    ordinance, tramps who requested shelter for themselves were rarely formally charged or sentenced and
                    were usually fed breakfast before they left. The State Board of Charities (run by COS reformers),
                    which was vehemently against police-station lodging, condemned <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s permissive policy of providing shelter and breakfast. According to the
                    board's 1902 annual report, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe County</region>
                    </placeName> was the "worst offender" in the state, receiving 632 tramps in the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a tramps' "haven" because the jail sheltered an annual
                    average of 705 vagrants. It concluded that by offering an "open door to the bum" <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Scholars posit that behind the common permissive policy of police lodging was the need to keep a
                    cheap mobile labor force at hand. That need for cheap available manpower was lessening in Indiana
                    because of the impact of improved machinery and of the increasing use of electrical power and
                    internal combustion engines on the farm and in the city. The changing situation in <placeName>

                    vagrants." The <placeName>

                    'vags' furnished food and lodging free at county's expense,"
                    emphasized the stone pile as a deterrent. The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> concurred, noting that

            <p>The State Board of Charities had identified the fee system that recompensed county sheriffs for jail
                    inmates as one of the abuses of the Indiana jail system. The board argued in its 1904 report that a
                    sheriff had no legal right "to admit a tramp to the county jail, discharge him the next
                    morning and charge the county for his board and lodging." The report also quoted the state
                    attorney general's opinion that payments were illegal if the tramps were not committed to
                    jail by a judge.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> In <placeName>

                    county paid turnkey fees of twenty-five cents in and twenty-five cents out, as well as forty cents
                    for board, to the county sheriff for the tramps brought in by the city police. The county sheriff
                    made some easy money, and the city police <list type="footnotes">

                    from jail placements. Its columnist, "The Man about Town," hinted at possible
                    collusion among the city and county officials, sarcastically adding, "I am not saying that
                    Sheriff Ray does not earn every cent he receives, for I have never boarded at his hotel,
                    consequently I am not competent to speak of the quality of his table, the service or the merit of
                    his management."<hi rend="sup">64</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The controversy over sheriffs' fees had reached the courts in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1905, with ex-sheriffs and the county commissioners filing claims and counterclaims.
                    In April, 1906, the commissioners refused to pay the current sheriff the customary boarding costs
                    for vagrants pending the outcome of a superior court case to decide on the legality of jailing
                    tramps without trial and commitment. Jail lodging of tramps in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> stopped immediately; instead, transients were legally charged with the crime of
                    vagrancy and sentenced to fourteen days in jail if convicted. This change caused a new fear-that the
                    two-week jail term would attract tramps rather than discourage them. A Courier editorial warned,
                    "a long sentence holds no terrors" for tramps who will be "well fed, warm
                    and know they will have a home every night."<hi rend="sup">65</hi> This fear proved
                    unwarranted. At the end of the year Sheriff Ray reported fewer vagrants in jail for the preceding
                    quarter than for any other quarter during his term of office.<hi rend="sup">66</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The city police also changed their behavior as a result of a new legal interpretation-an appellate
                    court decision in December, 1906, finding the provision of a station house for the detention of
                    persons arrested by city police to be a municipal responsibility. Since the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> had no structure for detention and the county jail was no longer available, the police
                    discontinued picking up large numbers of vagrants. Putting a favorable spin on the change, the
                    police superintendent boasted that after a "bitter war on Wearie Willies" the
                    number jailed for vagrancy in the winter of 1906–1907 was reduced to only forty-one.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> The end of jail lodging, however, did not stop the influx of transients to <placeName>

                    spot that an iron fence was built to lock the main corridor at night to keep the homeless from
                    "slipping in … and resting til morning."<hi rend="sup">69</hi>

            <p>The cessation of jail lodging presented the LCOS with an opportunity to press for a solution to the
                    tramp problem compatible with its principles, one that would eliminate indiscriminate giving and
                    differentiate between the able-bodied who were and were not willing to work. After extensive
                    groundwork, which included educational lectures, meetings with civic groups, and visits to other
                    cities, the LCOS secretary in October, 1908, formally proposed the creation of a municipal lodging
                    house with a woodyard or rock pile "where every able-bodied man is required to give the
                    equivalent in labor for meals, clothing and lodging." This work test would weed out those
                    with "a tendency to be lazy" from those who were "deserving of
                        assistance."<hi rend="sup">70</hi> The LCOS's two general secretaries shared a
                    perception of tramps as probable idlers. In 1908 Fauntleroy stated in the <hi rend="i">Morning
                        Journal,</hi> "In many cases where aid was solicited the men were able-bodied but had a
                    tendency to be lazy"; in 1909 Mary Lindley remarked to the advisory council, "It
                    is very apparent that tramps reporting at Room 40 are seeking for the most part something for
                        nothing."<hi rend="sup">71</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The work test had been commonly applied in large cities during the depression of the 1890s as a way
                    to indicate worthiness: vagrants could thereby demonstrate a willingness to work when real jobs were
                    unavailable. In practice, however, the test was difficult to effect. As COS historian Watson pointed
                    out, it had to be simple enough for anyone to perform but at the same time it had to be difficult
                    enough to be a true test; he warned that it should not destroy one's self respect.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>

                    </placeName>, Dr. Millard Knowlton, reveal the work test's shortcomings. Knowlton contended
                    that limited labor in a woodyard, rather than testing willingness to work at a steady job, made the
                    tramp's life easier by allowing him to work two or three hours instead of laboring at a
                    regular eight-hour-a-day job. Knowlton also questioned the motives of charity workers, suggesting
                    that they created woodyards for self-glorification and "took great delight in seeing these
                    old 'bums' exert themselves enough to saw wood." In questioning the <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Before the LCOS had to face any of the practical problems associated with a municipal lodging house,
                    however, it had to secure the cooperation of city officials-the police who dealt directly with
                    vagrants and the city council that funded their disposition. City officials had not cooperated with
                    the LCOS in the past. In the spring of 1908 the city council failed to approve an ordinance for an
                    LCOS-desired jail matron, and policemen placed women and children at the unapproved Union Mission
                    rather than at the LCOS-approved Young Women's Christian Home.<hi rend="sup">74</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although city officials had already agreed to pay the county a smaller board fee for the few homeless
                    that were now charged with vagrancy, the majority of the transients still had no official shelter.
                    The mayor and the city council were exploring other options to care for the nonresident homeless.
                    When the weather turned colder, the city policemen, on their own, began to take those tramps
                    considered not dangerous to Wetzel's Union Mission. On December 22, 1908, much to the
                    LCOS's dismay, the council entered into an agreement with Superintendent Wetzel to shelter
                    and feed "any deserving person who might apply" for a twenty-five-cent per diem,
                    stating: "This will relieve the police department of a great source of trouble";
                    it would also save "unfortunate men" from being arrested for vagrancy. The
                    contract with the Union Mission, the city council felt, provided at least "a temporary
                    solution of the tramp problem."<hi rend="sup">75</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The city's Union Mission contract preempted the LCOS's proposed municipal lodging
                    house, but the society persevered in its efforts. At the January, 1909, advisory council meeting,
                    the general secretary denigrated the Union Mission's shelter, describing it as "in
                    a cold basement" where the homeless slept "on a canvas cot with one
                    blanket." Council members discussed a plan to have the sanitary conditions at the mission
                    investigated and proposed asking a sympathetic priest to tell Catholics not to support Wetzel, a
                    suggestion later partially erased from the minutes. The LCOS tramp committee did find a landlady who
                    would lodge tramps for a fee; but, discouraged about the possibility of the needed support of police
                    and city council, members feared that they would have "to leave the police to dispose of
                    homeless men as they see fit." In February and March of 1909, however, the committee met
                    with both the police chief and the mayor to try again; the minutes recorded that "nothing
                    was accomplished" and "no sympathy" found. Six months later the committee

                    Civic League, but no action was taken. To seal the matter, in December, 1909, the city council
                    renewed its contract with the Union Mission. Raising the fee to thirty-six cents, the council
                    explained: "many who apply to the police department for shelter are worthy persons and
                    deserve better treatment than being placed in jail."<hi rend="sup">76</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The LCOS failed in its attempt to establish a municipal lodging house with a work test. The city
                    council, ignoring the recommendations of both daily newspapers, the Merchants' Association,
                    and the Ministers' Association, gave its vote to the Union Mission, an organization that
                    epitomized the kind of charity that the LCOS contended did more harm than good, alms giving with no
                    work requirement and with no discrimination between the deserving and the undeserving.</p>
            <p>Why did these municipal officials "readily" approve the Union Mission rather than
                    the proposed municipal lodging house backed by so many influential citizens? All but one of the ten
                    councilmen and the mayor (ten Democrats, one Republican) came from very modest circumstances.
                    Included on the council were a butcher, a drayman, a clerk, and a grocer. Many of them had started
                    working as children; for example, Jacob Dienhard, who became a bellboy at the Lahr Hotel when he was
                    eleven. Many of them had worked their way up, as had S. J. Hannagan, who first earned fifty cents a
                    day at a stave factory but who bought his own saloon in 1894, or Tom Hogan, who worked at the
                    McFarland Drug Company at three dollars a week but owned the business by 1887. These men,
                    remembering their early experiences, empathized with the working poor. Although the wealthiest
                    councilman, Ferdinand Dryfus, owned and operated a large pork packing plant, he was well known as a
                    "champion of the poor"; he, too, had begun at the bottom after arriving from <placeName>

                    in pianos and organs, often appointed workingmen to city positions; for example, a boilermaker at
                    the Monon shops to the position of assistant fire chief. His natural sympathy for the poor lasted
                    until the end of his political career; as a congressman in 1934 he replied to an attack on his votes
                    for money-spending bills by saying, "I'll vote more billions if it is necessary to
                    keep the people from starving and keep them in jobs."<hi rend="sup">78</hi>

            <p>Knowing firsthand that at any time misfortune could strike and force one over the poverty line, these
                    public officials differed from the better-positioned, better-educated members of the COS coalition
                    who presumed that most applicants for relief were potentially undeserving. With a more sanguine view
                    of human nature, city officials saw no need for an artificial work test to eliminate slackers. They
                    believed that any policeman could judge whether a tramp was a potentially dangerous vagrant or a
                    benign unfortunate needing shelter.</p>
            <p>Rather than striving toward a Christian community with the poor, as Leiby described COS workers as
                    doing, the LCOS distanced itself with "scientific" charity work that affirmed the
                    successful lives of its members. Fauntleroy's derogatory description of the LCOS applicant
                    exhibits a distinct attitude of superiority and attests to the perceived chasm between the society
                    and the working poor: "Through ignorance or stupidity his conception of living has been
                    dwarfed and deformed, and he is incapable of intelligent conclusion." COS reformers, on the
                    other hand, were "'to the manor born,'" "normal human
                    beings, in tune with our surroundings, [who] must for our own protection, as well as the protection
                    of society advise, guide, and cure and lift them, if possible, to a higher level."<hi rend="sup">79</hi>

                    state poor law of 1901, recognized a relationship between the economy and unemployment and offered
                    limited help to unemployed able-bodied residents. Rather than simply granting temporary emergency
                    aid, the society preferred to find jobs for the unemployed. Very few able-bodied unemployed
                    residents, however, availed themselves of the newly allowed relief. Contrary to the assertions of
                    some welfare historians that a reforming elite imposed its values on the working poor, in <placeName>

                    imposition. The working poor were not passively acted upon by the LCOS coalition; they were doing

                    trustee or the LCOS. As Handler and Hasenfeld proposed in their analysis of welfare, relief
                    practices and policies did affirm the work ethic as a basic value of society; in <placeName>

            <p>The economic depression following the panic of 1907 compromised the LCOS's job-finding

                    industries, and no unruly mobs, even though charity organizers acknowledged the scarcity of jobs,
                    even though the working poor saw their jobs eliminated by depressed business conditions, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s citizens were unrelenting in their belief in an individual's
                    responsibility to support himself and his family. This underlying consensus, however, did not change
                    the perception of the poor as flawed nor alter the belief that their destitution resulted from that
                    flaw. Although aware of the lack of jobs, the LCOS held to its suspicion that most ablebodied
                    unemployed nonresidents were lazy "no-goods" looking for a hand-out. The society
                    insisted that a work test was needed to weed out those idlers; city officials did not agree. The
                    city council's actions, officially at least, questioned the denigration of tramps as
                    dangerous criminals and ended jail lodging as a means of providing a floating work force. By
                    accepting the city's obligation to house the homeless nonresident, the council also
                    officially recognized the nonresident able-bodied unemployed as deserving of help. This more
                    sympathetic response to the working poor's situation came from a group who, by and large,
                    had experienced that life. The LCOS coalition, on the other hand, was composed primarily of
                    professionals who had never been wage earners and had never been poor.</p>
            <p>The return of prosperity did not diminish the LCOS's desire to identify those who were
                    willing to work; in the annual report of October, 1910, members still expressed their wish for a
                    municipal lodge with a stone pile or woodyard because of its effectiveness in applying a work test
                    when employment was not available at local factories.<hi rend="sup">80</hi> The persistence of this
                    idea was not just a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> phenomenon, nor one of just that time period. Watson noted in his 1922 survey of the
                    American charity organization society movement that although most professional social workers had
                    come to realize that poverty was a result of complex social causes they had failed to educate many
                    who continued to divide the poor into the "worthy" and the
                    "unworthy."81 The view that poverty is a consequence of personal deficiencies and
                    the suspicion that the able-bodied unemployed are undeserving remain strong influences in
                    today's welfare reform.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Lutes's interest in acquiring an education was somewhat unusual for his time and place. Born
                    in 1903 in Salt Creek Township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson County</region>
                    </placeName>, he grew up on what was, for the most part, a subsistence farm in one of the poorer,
                    less developed areas of south central Indiana. His family was probably a bit better off economically
                    than many of its neighbors. Lutes's father owned considerable acreage in the county, some
                    of it good tillable soil, some of it timbered, much of it worthless "yeller
                    ditches" overgrown with "broom sage." By the time Lutes was a young man,
                    the family farm boasted a solid house, a large barn, and other outbuildings; a team of horses or
                    mules; several head of cattle; and basic farm machinery-much of which could not be found on
                    neighboring properties. Four of the five Lutes children graduated from high school; two of them-one
                    older, one youngeralso taught in rural elementary schools in the area (although neither obtained as
                    much education as did Marshall). The Lutes family, then, was not precisely typical in this poorly
                    developed, economically deprived area, which later historians have referred to as an arrested
                    frontier. Regardless of financial circumstances, however, the family members dressed, played,
                    worked, worshiped, lived much as did their neighbors. Hard money was often difficult to secure, and
                    hard work was the definition of life. The Luteses existed primarily on what they grew; rarely, if
                    ever, marketed surplus crops beyond the local community; heated their home with and cooked on wood
                    stoves; drew all water in a bucket, hand over hand, from a well; as children used twigs as
                    toothbrushes and soda as toothpaste; and-until the boys were older and "on their
                    own"-seldom traveled more than twenty-five miles from home.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For most of the first two decades of his career Lutes taught close to home in small, isolated,

            <p>Descriptions of the schools' physical facilities, students' activities, and
                    Lutes's duties are strikingly reminiscent of mid-to latenineteenth-century schools all
                    across the rural Middle West. There were pegs or hooks for the students' coats, a table for
                    the water bucket, and sometimes shelves for lunch buckets. Occasionally these facilities were
                    located in an anteroom, more often in the schoolroom itself. There were symmetrically arranged desks
                    and seats for the pupils, a desk for the teacher, the ever-present picture of George Washington and
                    quite often one of Abraham Lincoln, too. Rarely was there a map unless the teacher owned one; never
                    was there a globe. Lutes collected maps throughout his career-of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the Northwest Territory, Indiana-and guarded them jealously as he moved from school to
                        school.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In most of his schools Lutes served as janitor as well as teacher. He swept the floors, fired the
                    wood or coal stoves, and saw that the buckets were filled with water for drinking. If windows were
                    washed, desks dusted, or blackboards cleaned, he did it. Teachers in the one-room, rural schools of
                    the 1920s and 1930s-as had those in the nineteenth century-accepted these "extra
                    duties" as the norm, not the exception. The local township trustee was in charge of the
                    maintenance of the school building; he provided any major repairs and supplied wood or coal for
                    heating. Anything more was usually left to the teacher or to the students themselves.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Many teachers of this era also played nursemaid and mediator, not only to students but
                    to their families as well. In addition, teachers organized and participated in community social
                    programs such as box socials, pie suppers, plays, school picnics, and holiday programs. Costumes for
                    the plays, Christmas decorations, Valentine boxes, or other similar "extras" were
                    made by the students or provided by the teachers.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>As Lutes organized his school day, there were almost always morning and afternoon recesses of fifteen
                    minutes each and a noon lunch hour. Students brought their lunches from home, in sacks, boxes, lard
                    buckets, or whatever they had, as did Lutes himself. <list type="footnotes">

                    Sometimes there was a "community" dipper; at other schools students brought their
                    own drinking cups. Students raised their hands to ask "to be excused" to make
                    trips to the outdoor privies. Usually these facilities were housed in two separate frame
                    buildings-one for the boys, one for the girls. Occasionally there was only one building with a wall
                    dividing it into two sections. Games played at recess were of the students' own devising:
                    "sheepie" (or run, sheep, run), fox and geese, three deep, skip to my Lou, Andy
                    over. Sometimes the older boys would make slides in the snow, and the entire school would play on
                    them all recess-the older students helping the younger ones. There were snowball fights and
                    sometimes regular fisticuffs when the teacher was not looking. Skipping rope was very popular with
                    the girls if one of them could provide a rope from home, and the boys frequently played Softball,
                    sometimes with a homemade bat. Rarely did the schools have any playground equipment, the possible
                    exception a swing if there were suitable trees in the vicinity.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>Isolated may be the most apt description of the one-room schools in which Lutes taught. The rugged,
                    rolling hills of southern Indiana provided the general setting. Roads in the area were never more
                    than gravel and were frequently more mud than anything else. Sometimes the school sat alone on
                    property that may at one time have been donated by a local family (as was possibly true of
                    White's); sometimes it was located in a very small enclave of houses with a general store
                    (Elkinsville, Harrodsburg); sometimes the dominant geographical feature was the creek that ran
                    nearby (Allen's Creek, Hunter's Creek). During the early years of his career Lutes
                    "boarded round" in the community, just as the pedagogues of the nineteenth century
                    had done. One tends to recall Eggleston's story of Hoosier schoolmaster Ralph Hartsook and
                    his "boarding" experiences. Lutes, a shy, reserved man, did not like this aspect
                    of teaching any more than did Hartsook. After Lutes was married in 1934, either the township trustee
                    or a resident of the local community found a house that he could rent for the length of the school
                    term. During the summer months he and his wife, Ruth, lived with his father-in-law and
                    mother-in-law, then back to a rented house for the school months. Although Lutes owned a car during
                    most of the 1920s and 1930s, he often walked to his school because the roads were impassable for an
                    automobile. At Hunter's Creek he frequently had to "ride in" on horseback
                    during the spring flood season.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>Lutes taught the expected "readin', 'ritin', and

                    science, language (grammar), and physiology (or hygiene). All were subjects listed in the 1934

                    little if any mathematical theory, they were well grounded in what he considered the
                    "fundamentals." Much of what Lutes taught the students learned "by
                    rote" or memorization, which was the system he thought best and the one by which he himself
                    had been trained. In referring to this instructional method, various studies spoke of the
                    "pure" recitations each child should have with the teacher in each subject.
                    Keeping up with approximately twenty students across eight grades doing recitations in each subject
                    required stamina as well as organizational and pedagogical skills. A great many of the teachers of
                    the day taught in this manner; it was the way they had been trained in their colleges and normal
                        schools.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>Discipline was a high priority in the rural elementary schools of the 1920s and 1930s. Trustees often
                    hired teachers with this criterion alone in mind. Recommendations from trustees and county
                    superintendents almost always mentioned a teacher's ability to discipline. Lutes, a
                    well-built, rather heavy-set man, was proud of his reputation as a disciplinarian. He often spoke of
                    being hired to "clean up" a school or to keep certain recalcitrant students in
                    line. The difficulties are rarely recounted in his reminiscences; his undoubted failures never. Gwen
                    Hays, another male teacher who spent a year at Allen's Creek in the 1920s, claimed that the
                    school was credited with being the worst in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe County</region>
                    </placeName> and that "after I got down there and taught them awhile I decided they were
                    right. …" Lutes taught at Allen's Creek for three years, from 1934 to
                    1937. He may well have agreed with Hays's assessment. His reminiscences, however, reveal
                    only that many of his best memories and lifelong friends came from Allen's Creek. Lutes
                    believed in corporal punishment and used it, although not to the exclusion of other forms of
                    discipline. He frequently said in later years that had he paddled as many students as proudly
                    claimed that he had he would have had no time to do anything else. There were those, of course, who
                    disliked him, who thought him "too strict," and who maintained their bitterness
                    for many years. There were others, however, who judged him as just and fair. A few <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Lutes's schools, as reconstructed from his reminiscences and related documents, are similar
                    to those found throughout the rural <placeName>
                        <country reg="xxu">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the 1920s and 1930s. The setting, players, even plot are familiar. In one-room
                    schools across the nation ministers spoke, politicians caucused, citizens voted, families gathered
                    for Christmas parties and bean suppers, and children learned their lessons. One Kansas settler wrote
                    of the country school in his community during those decades: it "was a small white-painted
                    building which was not only the schoolhouse, but the center-educational, social, dramatic,
                    political, and religious-of a pioneer community. …"<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                    Change, of course, was inevitable. It came slowly to Indiana, but it came; and Lutes, sometimes
                    gladly, often reluctantly, was a participant.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, Lutes's first two decades of teaching, the interwar years, coincided with a
                    time of widespread support for improving and expanding education in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="xxu">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The 1920s and 1930s marked a period of intense concern about the rural elementary
                    schools in Indiana and elsewhere-particularly one-room schools. During these years national, state,
                    and local surveys and studies outlined the conditions in such schools throughout the nation.
                    Legislators, educators, and concerned citizens responded with suggestions and laws meant to
                    alleviate the problems. Many of their proposals would drastically alter life in the small, isolated
                    communities of south central Indiana. As one historian summarized, much of what the rural
                    subsistence farmer held dear was under attack.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1921, four years before Lutes began his teaching career, the Indiana General Assembly appointed a
                    five-member commission composed of Indiana educators to survey public education in the state.
                    Staffed and funded by the General Education Board (GEB) of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which was financed by John D. Rockefeller, the commission looked at elementary and
                    high school instruction, buildings and equipment, local and state administration, finances, and
                    teacher training and licensing. One of the major areas of investigation was the rural school,
                    especially the small, one-room elementary school. The commission deemed most such schools inadequate
                    at best, often "much worse," and cited several reasons for their conclusion: poor
                    schoolhouses, irregular attendance, shorter school year in rural areas, many <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>The Indiana GEB survey, which was published in 1923, described rural elementary teachers "as
                    a body immature, unprepared, inexperienced and deficient in teaching skill."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> The commission further found these teachers a most unstable group, many of them
                    teaching only a few years before leaving the profession entirely or moving "up" to
                    city schools, which on the whole were rated better. According to the survey, 65 percent of the
                    teachers in one-room schools had taught fewer than five years; almost 30 percent were beginners.
                    Since the turnover in favor of urban schools was great, the newly licensed many times had to begin
                    their careers in the small township schools. As the survey stated, "One teacher schools are
                    … the dumping ground not only for untrained teachers, but also for temporary and
                    inexperienced teachers."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Salaries for the rural elementary teachers
                    were also poor: 69 percent of them were paid only the state minimum of $800 for an
                    eight-month term.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>In 1925, four years after the GEB study, the state of Indiana commissioned a Rural Education Survey
                    Committee to investigate the condition of rural education in the state. The survey indicated
                    minimal, though not appreciable, improvement over the years covered in the GEB report. Rural
                    township teachers were still paid on the average $140 less than city teachers, the rural
                    median being approximately $840. The average rural teacher in 1925 had only three
                    years' experience, and rural school terms still lasted only eight months. The Rural
                    Education Survey Committee, as had the earlier GEB survey, thus concluded that city schools and city
                    teachers were better than their rural counterparts.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Lutes's average

                            protested the concept that teachers moved "up" from rural to urban schools
                            or indeed that they moved "up" from elementary schools to high schools.
                            Although he recognized and condemned the inequities in the rural systems, he refused
                            universally to condemn the teachers, many of whom he insisted did an excellent job amid
                            extremely poor conditions. He further refused to accept that "only
                            ne'er-do-wells or ignoramuses who would teach for a pittance under the eye and
                            thumb of the community" manned the rural schools, a charge that was later made

                    recalled in the fading memories of former students. To the [Rural Education] Survey Commission they
                    were instead localist bastions of backwardness that were resisting the needs of modern

                    plans for improvement and change, however, met with limited success. Eleven years after the GEB

                    </placeName> schools conducted by the Indiana University School of Education repeated many of the
                    earlier criticisms and recommendations: city schools better than county schools, rural schools

                    contention.</p>
            <p>The movement to take the control of rural common schools from local communities and to turn it over
                    to the experts was part of a general organizational revolution throughout America between the turn
                    of the century and World War II. As recurring waves of reform swept Indiana and the nation, schools
                    were tugged between rural and urban, layman and professional, consolidation and the one-room
                    schoolhouse, centralized control and local control. Experts wanted to "free education from
                    politics" by coercing consolidation. Nationwide the number of one-room schools decreased
                    from 200,000 to 20,000 between 1910 and 1960, but the victory had not come easy in any section of
                    the country. A <placeName>

                    people wanted to elect their own county superintendents, and 69 percent opposed consolidation.

            <p>Lutes was an informed teacher. He met frequently with township trustees and county superintendents-in
                    later years at least once a week-to discuss the needs of his schools. He was aware of new trends and
                    responded to new legislation and regulations as carefully as he could, although he did not always
                    believe that they brought "progress." His licensing and education, the subjects he
                    taught, and eventually the consolidation of his schools in some communities illustrate that the
                    reforms of the 1920s and 1930s affected him and the schools in which he taught. On the other hand,
                    Lutes's records and reminiscences confirm that, indeed, from 1920 to 1940 education
                    remained much the same in the rural, one-room elementary schools of south central Indiana. Change
                    was on its way, but it was so slow as to appear almost ephemeral.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The GEB survey and the 1925 study pushed for several reforms that were somewhat more successful than
                    consolidation. The teacher licensing law of 1923, for example, required that prospective teachers
                    have one year of formal education from an approved teacher training institution-with specialization
                    in rural, primary, or high school teaching-in order to obtain a teacher's license. This
                    requirement effectively stopped licensing by examination by county superintendents, which was
                    considered the easiest way to secure a license at the time. In fact, in 1921–1922 over 61
                    percent of the elementary teachers (40 percent of the entire teaching body) had obtained licences in
                    this manner. After 1923 all licenses were issued by the State Board of Education. By 1926, according
                    to the Indiana Rural Education Survey, two-thirds of all teachers had achieved the thirty-six weeks
                    of education; however, 54 percent had fewer than forty weeks. Lutes with forty-eight weeks in 1925
                    did have more professional training than most, especially for a beginning teacher in the rural
                        schools.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lutes held five licenses during his teaching career. His first, issued in 1925 by the state of
                    Indiana, was termed a second-grade license good for two years for rural schools and for primary and
                    grammar grades. A rural school license was "good for teaching in any oneteacher elementary
                    school." The primary license covered teaching "in the first, second, third, and
                    fourth grades of any elementary school," and the grammar-grade provision extended the
                    license for "the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades of any elementary school
                    and first grade in the seventh and eighth grades of any junior <list type="footnotes">

                    "Second-grade" referred to the length of time for which the license was valid. Any
                    second-grade teaching license, regardless of level, was good for only two years; first-grade
                    licenses were good for five years. The amount of education that the teacher had acquired determined
                    the grade level of the license. Those with thirty-six weeks of training received a second-grade
                    license. Completion of an approved two-year course for any elementary license raised the license to
                    first grade. The initial licensing law in 1923 provided that a life license could be issued to
                    anyone with a first-grade license who had completed three years of successful teaching. The
                    state's attorney general, however, ruled that the life license could be granted only after
                    completion of the five-year period for which the first-grade license was valid.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1927 Lutes renewed his second-grade license. He had by this time acquired an additional twelve
                    hours of credit at Central Normal. By 1929 Lutes had completed two years of course work, and his
                    third license was upgraded to first grade. When this license expired in 1934, Floyd S. McMurray,
                    state superintendent of public instruction, signed Lutes's life license. Along with his
                    marriage and his new job at Allen's Creek, it was cause for celebration. Lutes had acquired
                    an additional ninety-six quarter hours of education between 1929 and 1934. With his life license in
                    hand, he needed no further schooling to continue his career. In 1941, however, Lutes graduated from
                    Indiana University with a B.S. in Education and received his fifth, and last, license-also for life.
                    He had now satisfied the criteria for a regular first-grade high school license in specified
                    subjects: social studies, option II, which was general or <placeName>
                        <country reg="xxu">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history; and science, option II, which included biology and physiology. Ironically, the
                    mathematics he liked so well was not included. Lutes was, then, a rural elementary teacher who
                    worked to upgrade and improve his licenses and who continued his education to the end of his career.
                    He was also unusual for his time in that very few of his contemporaries were able to teach from
                    first grade through twelfth grade in any type school.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second law that resulted in part from the GEB and Rural Education surveys dealt with teacher
                    tenure. In 1927 the Indiana legislature passed a law that granted teachers who had taught at one
                    school for at least five years a permanent contract. This regulation was an effort to stop the
                    indiscriminate dismissal of teachers <list type="footnotes">

                            or near rural areas, schools in which he found "bright" students who, he
                            insisted, deserved the best education that he could provide regardless of
                        circumstances.</item>

                    salaries to more experienced teachers. Unfortunately, the teacher tenure law was repealed for rural
                    township schools in 1933 because of the effects of the Great Depression.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
                    Exactly how this law affected Lutes is uncertain. He changed schools fairly frequently, never
                    remaining at the same location for more than three consecutive years. He taught at Allen's
                    Creek for three years; at Harrodsburg and Hunter's Creek for two years each, at the latter
                    on two separate occasions; and at Elkinsville and White's for one year each. In only one
                    instance is the reason for his departure from these schools stated explicitly. In 1934 the township
                    trustee at Harrodsburg in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe County</region>
                    </placeName> indicated his intention to hire "Home tallant" rather than an
                    "outsider" from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson County</region>
                    </placeName>. Since trustees frequently hired relatives, friends, and local residents in preference
                    to teachers from other localities, the incident at Harrodsburg was not unique. Trustees often fired
                    teachers for political reasons as well. Lutes, however, was a Democrat who for the first ten years
                    of his career taught in the heavily Democratic areas of Jackson, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName>, and southern <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe counties</region>
                    </placeName>. He could have been dismissed for purely political reasons, but it seems unlikely.
                    Personal animosities are also possible causes for dismissal, as was the accepted, though unwritten,
                    rule throughout the Midwest that teachers be employed for only one term or at most for two. Lutes,
                    like a number of his contemporaries, may have chosen to change schools in an effort to improve his
                    salary or working conditions.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> His move to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Consolidated elementary school in 1937 would certainly have been a case in point.
                    Unfortunately, Lutes's reminiscences reveal little about his moves from one school to
                    another; evidently "getting fired" was a painful subject regardless of the
                    reasons. At any rate, Lutes was never granted tenure until he taught for a city school corporation
                    much later in his career.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>The 1920s and 1930s also saw informed legislators and interested citizens push for reform in school
                    financing, particularly equalization of school taxes and increased state support. During these
                    decades most of the revenue burden for schools was borne by the general property tax. In the 1920s
                    around 95 percent of all school moneys came from local property taxes; the remaining 5 percent
                    resulted from state support. The Great Depression of the 1930s significantly affected teachers and
                    the school system as a whole. Many received lower or deferred salaries or had to "make
                    do" with short-term appointments. A few of the less fortunate lost their jobs altogether,
                    and the remainder struggled with larger student-teacher ratios. The depression's <list type="footnotes">

                    funding. By 1933 the state was providing a 30 percent share of the local school revenue, an increase
                    made possible in part by the gross income tax instituted by Governor Paul V. McNutt.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Although eventually increased state support would mean increased state control of local
                    schools, many recognized the necessity for the change. A recurrent theme in Lutes's
                    reminiscences is his contention that teachers as a group were relatively well off during the
                    depression. People could do without the services provided by other occupations, Lutes often said,
                    but unless state laws were changed, kids had to be taught. His salary might be lower, but at least
                    he had a salary. He was better off during the depression, he claimed, than he had ever been before.
                    Despite the obvious discrepancies in his reasoning and despite the fact that after one school term
                    he and other teachers had to sue the township trustee for their salaries (they eventually received a
                    portion of what was due them), Lutes's point was particularly valid for him. He bought and
                    paid for a twenty-acre homeplace during the depression years, something he could never have done
                    earlier and that would have been difficult even in later years. In general, historians agree with
                    Lutes's assessment. Teachers' salaries throughout the <placeName>

            <p>During the period 1920–1940-and indeed for many years before and after-township trustees
                    controlled rural elementary education in Indiana. For at least half of his long career Lutes taught
                    under the trustee system, which had been initiated in 1852. Trustees, whose major duties were to
                    supervise the local schools and disburse welfare in the township, were elected to a four-year term
                    on a party ballot. Under their jurisdiction were the several small township schools that served each
                    community. Trustees were in charge of hiring and firing teachers, all school finances (supplies,
                    budget, tax levies), school buildings, and all school property.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

            <p>Any survey, study, discussion, or recommendation concerning rural education sooner or later focused

                    interests. According to the GEB survey, trustees were therefore not prepared to make good decisions,
                    hiring and firing teachers and purchasing supplies on the basis of personal or partisan desires.
                    Indeed, the commission found the entire system inefficient and financially extravagant, and the
                    survey concluded: "personal bias, political ambition, favoritism, and inefficiency will
                    continue, in most counties, to rule the rural school so long as township trustees are in

            </p>
            <p>In 1926 the survey of the Rural Education Commission in Indiana confirmed the GEB findings. Of the
                    teachers questioned 85 percent had moved mom one school position to another because of the personal
                    whims of the trustees or because of their political party affiliations. Gwen Hays, for example, had
                    to move from a larger school to a small, one-room rural school because "my politics
                    wasn't quite the same as the Trustee's was." Such an occurrence, Hays
                    indicated, was not unusual.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> In 1934 the <placeName>

                    historians have continued to blast the trustee system in Indiana and elsewhere. A trustee's
                    decisions in locating and building schools and in purchasing only the basic supplies often reflected
                    his "politically partisan and local orientation and sometimes his own economic selfinterest
                    as well." Further, trustees frequently used their power to appoint and dismiss teachers
                    "to reward friends and punish enemies, whether personal or political."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As indicated earlier, Lutes, too, ran afoul of the trustee system on occasion. For example, the Clear
                    Creek Township (<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe County</region>

                        township trustees' personal or political whims should, of course, be used cautiously.
                        While undoubtedly true in a large majority of cases, teachers were far more likely to attribute
                        their departure from a school to reasons other than their own inadequacies. Further, virtually
                        every early twentieth-century teacher's reminiscence, journal, or oral interview
                        recounts at least one dismissal by the township trustee for political reasons. That the practice
                        was widespread is certain; that it became a matter of considerable pride for teachers to claim
                        the experience equally so.</item>

                    and Hunter's Creek; but many of them had originated in a different area of the South, and
                    they had arrived in southern Indiana and <placeName>

                    </placeName> Consolidated, particularly a principalship, was a definite "step up"
                    in his career. The township trustee, however, was still the dominant figure in the educational
                    system. At Consolidated, as the community termed it, Lutes was hired by a Republican who knew that
                    he was a Democrat; he then taught for a Republican who suspected that he was a Democrat but did not
                    know for sure; still later he taught for a Democratic trustee; and finally he was fired by a
                    Republican. Lutes was never certain whether he was fired because of his political affiliation or
                    because of personal differences with a few of the more influential men in the community (all

                    communities should retain as much control as possible over the education of their children, and he

                    did the best they could with usually meager funds, Lutes averred, and most of them left
                    "teaching to the teachers," to his mind the ultimate accolade.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In recent years a number of well-known historians have agreed with much of Lutes's
                    assessment of the township trustee. "It was easy," one of them writes,
                    "to pass such men off as country bumpkins, and, unfortunately, the numerous complaints
                    lodged against them through the years drew a portrait of miserly, apathetic, uneducated educators
                    leading their little schools into educational bankruptcy." However, the author continues,
                    "The most that can be known about the midwestern country-school directors is to be found in
                    the accounts of'their doings,' as their book of records called them, and these,
                    considered as a whole, show them to have been conscientious, earnest men, who tried to improve their
                    schools and who displayed a considerable amount of common sense and business ability in managing
                    their schools' affairs."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Other critics recognized that <hi rend="i">all</hi> governmental school administrators, not merely the township trustees, were
                    inclined to be too partisan and involved in politics. Even at the state level, according to these
                    historians, there was a "lack of stability" that affected the entire educational
                    system. Lutes agreed. A victim of the trustee system on more than one occasion, he had also
                    struggled under the dictates of a state-controlled bureaucracy.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>County superintendents also received their share of the critics' attention during the 1920s
                    and 1930s. Elected for a four-year term by all township trustees in a county, superintendents, too,
                    were enmeshed in local partisan political struggles. State requirements for the office, which had
                    been created in 1873, included a college degree and teaching experience. Few counties, however,
                    adhered to these regulations, party affiliation being the paramount criterion for election. The
                    position was considered a weak one, with the superintendent often seen as the trustees'
                    errand boy. In actual fact, a strong superintendent could often exert considerable influence over
                    both the trustees and the local schools. Technically, the superintendent's duties included
                    serving as a go-between for the trustees and the state superintendent of public instruction,
                    collecting and forwarding to the state various statistics on the county schools, and supervising and
                    grading all teachers in the county. The trustees hired the teachers, but it was the superintendent
                    who evaluated them, usually in twiceyearly visits of approximately eighty minutes each.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

            <p>Superintendents used a success schedule, or standardized checklist, to rate teachers and to assign
                    them a grade. Evaluation categories included: personality, 15 points; preparation, 15 points;
                    teaching technique, 20; pupil achievement, 20; management, 10; cooperation and professional
                    attitude, 15; and professional reading, 5. A score of 95 and above was excellent; 90–94,
                    good; 85–89, average; 80–84, poor; and 79 and below, failure. Grades were to
                    be assigned according to a normal distribution, meaning that the majority of teachers should fall in
                    the 85–89, or average, category. These "success grades" were used for
                    salary negotiations, for recommendations, for teacher knowledge, and for renewing or converting
                    licenses. Teachers had to have all success grades at 80 or above for license renewal. The 1925 Rural
                    Education survey reported that the majority of one-room rural teachers had ratings in the
                    90–94, or good, range. Not surprisingly, the county superintendents did not agree with
                    the committee's assessment of "inadequate" instruction in the one-room
                    rural schools.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

                    "average" for his first two teaching years-at White's and
                    Hunter's Creek. At Elkinsville (1929–1930) and during his second stint at
                    Hunter's Creek (1930–1931), he scored a 94-the top end of the
                    "good" category. From 1931 on, his success grade was
                    "excellent," ranging from 95 to 98. Lutes almost always received high marks in
                    personality and professional attitude, teaching technique, and management. He rated lowest in
                    "professional reading," something, as the <placeName>

                    covered all subjects across eight grades in isolated, deeply rural schools with virtually no access

            <p>Although, as previously indicated, consolidation was fought longer and harder than other reforms
                    suggested by the GEB, Rural Education, and similar surveys, the period from 1920 to 1940 was the
                    beginning of the end for the rural one-room schools. Many reformers who pushed for consolidation
                    lobbied for a county-unit system, with a county board to replace the township trustees. The
                    advantages of this type organization included more centralized purchasing of school supplies, more
                    efficient use of teachers, more uniform and fairer tax rates, and more uniform quality throughout
                    the schools. Because of the extremely stiff opposition to consolidation in the local communities,

                    decades of the 1920s and 1930s most superintendents of public instruction favored the county-unit
                    plan. In 1923 the state Senate debated but failed to pass legislation that would mandate schools to
                    reorganize along county lines. In 1924 the Department of Public Instruction, with funds provided by
                    the Greneral Education Board, established in <placeName>

                    experiment was deemed successful by some in improving teaching and learning in the two model
                    counties; the financial feature of the model program was considered a failure, primarily because the
                    township trustees refused to cooperate. Overall the project convinced only those who wanted to
                    believe. In 1925 the state legislature soundly defeated a second county-unit bill.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

                    it. True, centralization might mean higher taxes, which they did not want, but it would also mean
                    new policies and programs that they thought alien to their way of life. These they did not want
                    either. The school, along with the church, was a source of local pride, the focus of the community,
                    and most local citizensnot merely the township trustees-did not want to relinquish control. The
                    consolidation movement, they felt, threatened to destroy the institution that held the rural areas
                        together.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Many reformers who attacked the "bookish"
                    curriculum, haphazard selection and supervision of teachers, erratic school attendance, discipline,
                    diversity of buildings, and lack of equipment recognized these problems as merely symptoms of what
                    was wrong with rural school education. More basic, they averred, was the fact that rural residents
                    wanted to run their own schools and that they did not know what was good for them in the complex new
                    society. Antagonists in the conflict also realized that basic community and societal values were at

                    number of one-room schools in the Hoosier state was reduced by over one-half. There were 4,500

                    politicians had not been able to do, increasing technology in the form of better communication and

                            consider replacing this teacher with one who had more training. Although the trustees all
                            agreed that the situation, in a professional sense, was unsatisfactory, they apparently
                            could find no one else who was willing to come to the rural school. Further, the teacher was
                            very popular in the community. Lutes was extremely proud that free textbooks were available
                            for all students at Consolidated, something that had not been and would not be the case in
                            his other rural schools. One entire day at the end of each year he set aside for students to
                            erase marks in and mend books for the next year's use. Lutes, Reminiscences.</item>

                    teachers, dealt with the township trustee and county superintendent, taught both the seventh and
                    eighth grades, and organized special events. Box suppers and pie socials raised money for
                    "extras" such as reference books or balls and bats; the annual Christmas play was
                    attended by the entire township; and the eighth grade graduation ceremony was a larger and even more
                    important occasion than it had been in the smaller, one-room schools. For some students this
                    ceremony signaled the end of formal education; the rest would attend the high school in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The building was a two-story, four-room brick structure, but again little else was
                    different. The school was administered by a township trustee; there was no water inside the
                    building, thus no bathroom facilities; there was no school lunch program; and for the first few
                    years there were no free textbooks. Situated just outside one of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s poorest districts, Hensonburg was labeled a "tough"
                    school, but Lutes evidently felt at home there. He remained as principal and head teacher for
                    twenty-one years. By the early 1950s virtually all one-room schools in Indiana were gone, and even
                    the small four- and six-room consolidations were being closed, their students transferred to schools
                    in the growing towns and cities. Hensonburg continued to exist as a rural township school until 1953
                    when it was absorbed into the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Metropolitan School Corporation, administered by a superintendent and school board.
                    Lutes had finally made the transition to the city schools, with their higher salaries, improved
                    school conditions, and tenure. While at Hensonburg-as indeed he had while at Consolidated-Lutes
                    supplemented his salary, as most male teachers who were heads of families had to do, by working at
                    the local soft-drink bottling companies during the summer months. It was a seasonal arrangement that
                    benefited both employer and employee. He also continued his education. At the age of fifty-eight
                    Lutes obtained his master's degree in education from Indiana University, often taking
                    classes with his son and son-in-law who were working toward the same goal.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>

            <p>In 1969, one year before Lutes's mandatory retirement at the age of sixty-seven, Hensonburg

                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Lutes was asked to teach his final year at the Arlington Elementary School and to test
                    a new concept. Fearful at first, he agreed when told that the administration wanted to place two
                    grades-the fifth and sixth-in one room to see what benefits or problems, if any, might occur. Lutes
                    told his daughter, with a grin, that he thought he "could handle that."<hi rend="sup">64</hi> Another teacher who wrote of the changes in education over time would have
                    shared the humor in the situation: "It was inevitable that, as society urbanized, the
                    educational system would be caught in the throes of consolidation, unification, desegregation, and
                    all the other 'tions' that designate the development of mass education. It was
                    also inevitable such developments would necessitate change, growth, and innovation in the educative
                    process"; but, the author points out, many, if not most, of the innovations and ideas that
                    are considered "new age," such as flexible scheduling, open classrooms,
                    individualized instruction, cooperative learning, and parent-teacherpupil interaction are just the
                    old ideas started in the one-room schools.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lutes retired in 1970 after forty-four years in the teaching profession. His early career, from 1920
                    to 1940, was both consistent with and divergent from the norm as revealed in the GEB study and the
                    1925 survey. Lutes taught in one-room schools for ten years-longer than most of his contemporaries.
                    He remained in rural consolidated schools for even more years before his employment by a large city
                    school corporation in 1953. He had more formal training than many of his colleagues in the rural
                    schools. The small, rural, district schools that emerge from his reminiscences are, however,
                    archetypes of those throughout the Midwest in the 1920s, 1930s, and beyond. Often unwilling
                    participants in the reform fervor that swept Indiana and the nation in the early decades of the
                    twentieth century, these schools changed little between 1920 and 1940. Not until after World War II,
                    in fact, did any significant modifications occur, and even then they came slowly. Lutes was, of
                    course, aware of the changes that affected the schools and communities in which he taught. Many of
                    them he welcomed; many he did not. Had he and his contemporaries been asked to assess their careers
                    during the 1920s and 1930s, most would have agreed that there were good times and bad times during
                    these decades; but "if there was pain as well as joy in their one-room schools, so was
                    there in life itself."<hi rend="sup">66</hi>

            <p>The Indiana Archives section of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> turns its attention
                    this year to local archival holdings in the northern part of Indiana. Defining northern Indiana is
                    admittedly an impressionistic enterprise, easily subject to debate. Its boundaries are largely a
                    matter of ascertaining identity; that is, how a city or county orients itself toward the rest of the
                    state and toward areas outside Indiana's borders. After careful consideration, and
                    acknowledging that the Calumet Region of northwest Indiana claims its own particular identity,
                    "northern Indiana" in this article is geographically outlined as the region
                    extending northward from a line roughly going through <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>, <region type="county">Wabash</region>, <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur</region>
                    </placeName>; the region, in other words, lying east of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Starke, <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The history and culture of northern Indiana offer more helpful ways of distinguishing it from other
                    parts of the state. The names of its towns, rivers, and lakes are reminders that the original
                    inhabitants were several Native American tribes of the Great Lakes region, particularly the
                    Potawatomi and Miami. It was the first part of Indiana to be seen by European explorers and
                    missionaries, yet, with the exception of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it was the last part of the state to be opened to European settlement. Large numbers
                    of these migrants came from the East-<placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName>, and, after the Revolution of 1848, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
                    </placeName>-rather than from the South as was the case in southern Indiana. Their descendants,
                    along with the Eastern European immigrants who arrived in the twentieth century and the Amish
                    communities still sprinkled across the region, have led some writers to suggest that in demographic
                    terms northern Indianians have blurred and modified the usual conceptions of Hoosierdom.</p>
            <p>Northern Indiana's distinctiveness also stems in part from its particular ties to industry,
                    education, and some of the state's most <list type="footnotes">

                    automobile industry: the region's museums commemorate models such as Duesenberg and
                    Studebaker. Large amounts of durable manufactured goods continue to pour out of its factories, from
                    automobile parts to household appliances to recreational vehicles. Its most prominent place of
                    higher education is the University of Notre Dame, whose football prowess and academic agenda, the
                    latter cultivated during the administration of Father Theodore Hesburgh, make it as much a national
                    institution as a college in Indiana. Northern Indiana also has been home to Thomas R. Marshall,
                    Progressive Era governor and Woodrow Wilson's vice-president; early twentieth-century
                    writer and naturalist Gene Stratton Porter, who used the wilderness around her Limberlost cabin as a
                    background for her novels and studies; Jesse Lee Dickinson, who worked to end racial discrimination

                    Republican Otis R. "Doc" Bowen, longtime state legislator, two-term governor, and
                    Secretary of Health and Human Services during the Ronald Reagan presidency, who brought the state
                    into a closer working relationship with the federal government.</p>
            <p>In short, beyond its popular reputation as "lake country," where thousands of
                    vacationers congregate every summer, or "Michiana," where residents share a close
                    affinity with southern <placeName>

                    </placeName>, northern Indiana possesses an independent historical identity worthy of further study,
                    as this year's contributors make clear. Patrick J. Furlong offers a useful panoramic
                    overview of the kinds of sources available at university, college, church-related, museum, county,
                    and historical society archives throughout the region. Complementing this survey is Elizabeth A.
                    Krehbiel-Kutzko's description of the archival holdings of the <placeName>

                    museum's curatorial facilities and accession lists as well as the revamping of its
                    organizational strategies. Their essays are reminders that establishing local and regional
                    identities, even within the boundaries of a single state, is almost always a work in progress.</p>

                    them can afford trained archivists. As a result, their holdings are often not systematically
                    arranged and cataloged, and finding aids are few. At local historical societies the archival
                    collections are often managed by volunteers who can work only a few hours a week. Researchers
                    therefore should call ahead and be prepared to explain clearly what sorts of information they are
                    seeking.</p>

                        <region type="county">St. Joseph County</region>
                    </placeName> has one of a very few formally established archives among Indiana's ninety-two
                    counties. It holds virtually all noncurrent county records except deeds, easements, and other land
                    records, which remain at the county recorder's office. Criminal, civil, and probate court
                    records are located in the archives, as well as the minutes books of the county commissioners and
                    the county council, the county coroner's files, and most other departmental files. The
                    county archives also have the noncurrent records of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> from its incorporation in 1865 and the few surviving records of the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Very few township records have been preserved, and only Union Township records dating
                    from the early years of the twentieth century have been placed in the county archives. Except for
                    juvenile court and paternity case files after 1941, almost all records are open for research.</p>
            <p>The special collections of the Hesburgh Library at the University of Notre Dame are wide ranging in
                    time and distance, and this essay reviews only those likely to interest researchers in Indiana and
                    midwestern history. There is, of course, an extensive collection of Notre Dame materials, as well as
                    the Catholic Americana Collection of parish histories and religious pamphlets, the Modern
                    Manuscripts Collection, and the Modern Authors Collection. Two other groups deserve particular
                    attention. First, there is an extensive collection of items relating to Catholic missionaries to the
                    Indians of the southern <geogName>Great Lakes</geogName> region, primarily the Potawatomi and Ojibwa
                    (Chippewa), in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Second, the richest portion of
                    the Joyce Sports Research Collection concerns college football, but there are extensive holdings for
                    professional football and boxing, as well as for college basketball and baseball. There are annual
                    guides and yearbooks dating from 1891 to the present, more than twenty thousand college and
                    professional football game programs, and coaching notebooks from the early twentieth century. The
                    papers of sportswriter Rowland P. "Red" Smith offer a close-up view of American
                    sports for the middle years of the twentieth century. A detailed list of the archives'
                    holdings can be found at its World Wide Web site: http:/www.nd.edu/~rarebook/Dept/<placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName> holds a large collection of Bowen's personal papers covering his many years of
                    public service in the Indiana General Assembly, as governor from 1973 to 1981, and as Secretary of
                    Health and Human Services from 1985 to 1989. The collection is most extensive for his eight years as
                    governor. Bethel College also holds the Missionary Church Archives and Historical Collection that
                    traces the growth of the Missionary Church from its Amish, Mennonite, and River Brethren traditions.
                    Although the earliest documents are from the 1820s, the bulk of the collection dates from the 1860s.</p>

                    some tapes from 1954–1955 and a virtually complete collection from 1961 to 1979, more
                    than three hundred altogether. Complementing the tapes is a complete file of typed transcripts for
                    the years 1955–1961, as well as a file of the <hi rend="i">Manion Forum</hi> newsletter

            <p>Religious bodies often have valuable archival collections, although many of them are not
                    professionally cataloged. The Congregation of Holy Cross, the religious order that founded and still
                    directs the University of Notre Dame, has its own Indiana Province Archives adjacent to the Notre
                    Dame campus. The Congregational Archives of the Sisters of the Holy Cross are located at Saint
                    Mary's College in Notre Dame and are kept separately from the college library and archives.</p>

                    aspects of the civil rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The papers of Mt. Morris College of Mt.

                    conferences and more than six hundred congregations. There are also the personal papers of a number
                    of Mennonite ministers, most notably John F. Funk, who published the <hi rend="i">Herald of

                    </placeName> has a small but distinguished collection. The Colfax Family Papers include letters from
                    Schuyler Colfax concerning his service as congressman and speaker of the House, as well as letters
                    from Evelyn Clark Colfax, Ellen Wade Colfax, and Hannah Matthews, which offer three women's

            <p>There are no business archives open for research in northern Indiana, but there are two extensive
                    collections that document automobile and other manufacturing by firms no longer in business. The
                    Studebaker-Packard Archives at the Studebaker National Museum include a vast collection of
                    Studebaker records dating from the wagonand carriage-building efforts of the Studebaker brothers in
                    1854 to the closing of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> plant of the Studebaker Corporation in 1963. The Studebaker Collection is rich in
                    photographs of wagons, automobiles, and factories and in advertising and other visual material.
                    There is a complete file of the minutes of the corporation's directors and incomplete
                    correspondence files of corporate officers. There are extensive automobile manufacturing records for
                    the period 1946–1963 and a limited number of records concerning automotive design. The
                    records of the Packard Motor Car Company are also incomplete, but their scope extends from the
                    company's beginnings in 1899 to its merger with Studebaker in 1956.</p>
            <p>The Studebaker-Packard Archives also have extensive holdings of the records of the Oliver Chilled
                    Plow Company and its successor firms. Included are many glass-plate negatives showing a variety of
                        <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-093-3-066"/> plow designs and manufacturing techniques. The records of
                    the recently closed O'Brien Paint Company have not yet been cataloged. Audio tapes and
                    transcripts of interviews by the Michiana Oral Labor History Project document union formation
                    efforts at local plants during the 1930s and 1940s, especially those of United Auto Workers Local 5
                    at Studebaker and Local 9 at Bendix, including the Bendix sitdown strike of 1936.</p>

                    </placeName> governmental offices. The founders also recognized the importance of preserving
                    personal documents regarding the county's early history. Some written correspondence was
                    obtained in the late 1800s, but the bulk of the personal and business materials and photographic
                    images has been donated in more recent years by private individuals who currently live in the county

                    descendant, are twentiethcentury accounts of an increasingly urbanizing local society. Umberhower
                    was an exceptionally active individual who kept a detailed record of his life in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>

                    going to various churches and revivals, visiting children, and renting properties. Smith's
                    personal papers discuss her memories of family life and community activities as she was growing up

            <p>Civil War materials at the society are numerous and include both personal documents and government
                    papers. Soldiers' diaries and letters are a valuable source of information. For example,
                    the letters of George B. Dausman, who served in Company H of the 75th Regiment, Indiana Volunteers,
                    contain vivid descriptions of his experiences on the march and in an army hospital in

               </placeName>. Along with Dausman's correspondence are letters
                    written by family members regarding his illness and by his commanding officers explaining the
                    circumstances of his death on February 28,1863. Other Civil War sources of particular note are the
                    diaries and papers of Captain E. L. Billings, a member of Company K of the 57th Regiment, Indiana
                    Volunteers, and Companies I and D of the 2nd Regiment (Convalescent Camp); the diary of Sergeant
                    Rueben R. Lutz, who served in Company G of the 74th Regiment, Indiana Volunteers; and the diary and
                    papers, including muster roll, of John D. Myers of Company D of the 74th Regiment, Indiana
                    Volunteers. County records also document support payments to the families of the men who were away

                    Many letters to friends and families have been preserved; these describe life overseas as well as at
                    home. The James Ozanne collection, in particular, contains a number of letters from James Ozanne,
                    Jr., initially stationed at Camp Forrest, <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> from the 1870s until 1996. J. M. Dale owned a dry goods store in <placeName>

                    </placeName> from the 1870s until the turn of the century. Among the items donated are a vast number
                    of the cash and daily account books from this business. Dale's daughter, Cora Belle Dale,
                    was a composer and painter of some repute at the turn of the century. Her personal letters and

            <p>The recent film <hi rend="i">Gene Stratton-Porter: Voice of the Limberlost</hi> is further evidence
                    of the perennial interest in the life and works of Gene Stratton-Porter. It is an attractive and
                    comprehensive documentary that will be welcomed by readers and conservationists alike.</p>
            <p>Beginning with Stratton-Porter's childhood on a farm near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Geneva</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, the film dramatizes her early interest in birds, following her through her
                    growing commitment to the study of the Limberlost, to the publication of the nature novels that made
                    her famous (and rich), to the move to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> where she made movies of her novels, carried on new nature studies, and met an untimely
                    death in a car accident. The narration by Tom Cochran is a model of clarity and objectivity.</p>
            <p>One of the beauties of the film lies in the magnificent shots of the Limberlost Swamp, the close-ups
                    of the birds and wild flowers, and the significant attention given to the residences Stratton-Porter
                    built to accommodate her nature and photographic activities. Some of the pictures are from archival
                    sources, but many are of the contemporary scene as well. Another strong point of the film is its
                    expert interleaving of social, political, and business events and scenes with
                    Stratton-Porter's story: the industrial activity reflected in the busy railroads and
                    factories, the burgeoning oil and timber industries that spelled bad news for the Limberlost, the
                    impact of World War I, the women's suffrage movement, the little Chautauquas that provided
                    both learning and social activities. Life in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries comes
                    alive in these related segments.</p>
            <p>The focus, however, remains on Stratton-Porter and her conservation activities. Her major writings
                    are given careful and illustrative attention demonstrating not only how she wove into her stories
                    the nature she knew so well but also how she underscored the lives of her characters with her own
                    active principles of hard work and integrity. In addition, her characters were engaged in
                    understanding nature and preserving it against developers and industrialists.</p>
            <p>The comments of Scott Sanders reflect the filmmakers' implied conviction that
                    Stratton-Porter was an ecologist long before the name of the science had become a household word.
                    The apt quotations from her own writings, extremely well read by Annette O'Toole, are proof
                    of Stratton-Porter's early concern for the vital relation between organisms and their
                    environment. The opening and closing pictures of the renewal of Limberlost Swamp and the restoration
                    of wetlands in the area dramatize the vision that Stratton-Porter had many years earlier.</p>
            <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-093-3-071"/>
            <p>It is not hard to see why this film won an award of excellence from the Film Advisory Board. The
                    filming itself, the story it tells of a strong-minded conservationist, and the weaving together of
                    the strands of nature, literature, and conservation-all are admirably served in a short space.</p>

                    selection of these top-drawer models yielded superb results. For the Indiana volume some thirty-four
                    scholars supplied texts on thirty ethnic groups plus additional topics such as the overall ethnic
                    history of the state and an appendix piece detailing ethnicity in what was once the Old Northwest.
                    These articles are followed by tables and maps of the foreign born by ethnic group as a percentage
                    of total population and ethnic group by county. Covering the decades from 1850 to 1990, these tables

                    people and their religion when he deals with the problem of place of origin, nationality, and
                    ethnicity and the fact that many Slovaks were called Hunkies because they emigrated from the region
                    that had belonged to the Austro-Hungarian empire. A comparable warmth for his subject matter

                    </placeName>, has been enshrined as the quintessential epicenter. There, according to labor lore,
                    coal miners, confronted by adamantly antiunion employers, launched a series of heroic struggles over
                    the course of the twentieth century. Its place in the popular imagination was secured, it seemed, by
                    Barbara Kopple's Academy Award-winning documentary, <hi rend="i">

            <p>Shaunna L. Scott's carefully presented study, <hi rend="i">Two Sides to Everything,</hi>
                    tells a much more complex story. Based on painstaking research, Scott's anthropological
                    examination offers readers a solid foundation from which to explore the nature of class
                    consciousness, both in the historical and the present setting. In the end, it is far more useful
                    than any mere celebration of class struggle could be.</p>
            <p>A daughter of the region herself, Scott uses her personal experiences and contacts in order to probe
                    the evolution and transformation of working-class identity over several generations. Throughout both
                    her research and her writing, Scott the scholar remains acutely sensitive to the promise and
                    pitfalls of her insider/outsider status. In so doing, she not only opens windows into working-class
                    experience but also into the challenges of conducting contemporary research.</p>
            <p>As her title suggests, Scott finds "two sides to everything." <placeName>
                        <region type="county">While Harlan County</region>
                    </placeName>'s miners and their families are aware of the differences between their
                    experiences and status and those of their employers, their ideological constructions revolve more
                    around their regional identities and the threat they sense from outside economic and political
                    interests. That these outside interests include United Mine Workers officials as well as
                    multinational conglomerates further complicates the narrative. The miners draw upon kinship,
                    community, and religion to build their sense of class; but these factors also provide the <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-093-3-075"/> material for a regional identity that excludes class altogether
                    and draws them into a series of alliances and coalitions with local middle-class elements, including
                    the owners of small, nonunion mines.</p>
            <p>Scott carefully traces these dynamics over a half century punctuated by both strikes and ventures
                    into labor-management partnerships. She draws on historical research and oral history interviews
                    with men and women from three generations to piece together this fascinating story, punctuating it
                    with an analysis drawn from recent work in several scholarly disciplines. But it is her closing
                    treatment of the effort to construct a Miners Memorial in the mid-1980s that draws her account
                    together in a compelling fashion. There, she explains the inner workings of a coalition that
                    includes the Jaycees, veteran union miners, and diverse community members, a coalition that sought
                    to depoliticize the experiences of miners in order to make them acceptable. While this project
                    failed at first even in its own rather convoluted terms, it ultimately resulted in a monument which
                    seemed to satisfy all of those involved. That Scott does not hide her surprise but uses it
                    constructively to make sense out of this complex tale suggests the quality of this study.</p>
            <p>Although Scott herself notes that she did not accord enough attention to the dynamics of race and
                    gender in her research and her analysis, she has written a strong and valuable book. Students of
                    class consciousness-not just in <placeName>

            <p>In the historiography of the trans-Appalachian West, the basic law of physics applies: for every
                    action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Over a century ago Theodore Roosevelt and Frederick
                    Jackson Turner wrote histories narrating (and celebrating) the achievements of pioneer emigrants to
                    the <geogName>Ohio</geogName> and <geogName>Mississippi valley</geogName> frontiers. A generation
                    later they were countered by less "triumphalist" Depression-era scholars (most
                    notably Turner's student Thomas Perkins Abernethy) who were, in turn, countered by
                    post-World War II scholars such as R. Carlyle Buley and Thomas D. Clark. Reaction to this
                    neo-Turnerian positivism began in the late 1960s and <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-093-3-076"/> has now
                    reached high tide. Thus, a hundred years after Roosevelt wrote <hi rend="i">The Winning of the

                    cross-acculturation of native people and the long hunters (represented by Boone), Aron proceeds
                    systematically through initial settlement, land distribution, customary vis-a-vis formal legal
                    rights, agriculture, slavery, and the evolution of the market-driven <placeName>

                    definition of frontier history. Most of Aron's critique of the new western history,
                    however, consists of a minor disagreement over the "site" of victimization. The
                    new western historians argue that only the trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> West should be the focus of their study of race, class, gender, and environment. Aron
                    argues that the trans-Appalachian West should also be included in the study of race, class, gender,
                    and environment. It is a sign of the state of contemporary western history scholarship (and all
                    contemporary historical scholarship for that matter) that scholars are somehow to construe a
                    disagreement over <hi rend="i">where</hi> to apply this tired, politically correct viewpoint as
                    evidence of lively scholarly debate.</p>
            <p>Absent from Aron's presentist analysis is a discussion of important facets of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> culture and the many benefits westerners accrued from the industrial revolution,
                    capitalism, and republican political institutions. These include a rapidly increasing standard of
                    living, a land distribution system more egalitarian than anywhere else on earth, expanded suffrage,
                    increased literacy, and the development <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-093-3-077"/> of a coarse, vibrant
                    folk culture. Turner, Roosevelt, and Clark pointed to, and overemphasized, these positive frontier
                    characteristics. They did not stress the class strife documented (sixty-seven years ago) by
                    Abernethy and now again by Aron. After one hundred years both camps have made their points again and
                    again. In light of the emerging reaction to the neo-Marxist scholarship of the past generation,
                    historians of the <geogName>Ohio</geogName> and <geogName>Mississippi valleys</geogName> would do
                    well to return to two evenhanded syntheses. Malcolm J. Rohrbough's <hi rend="i">The
                        Trans-Appalachian West</hi> (1978) and Richard Bartlett's <hi rend="i">The New

                    century, a less polemical interpretation of the West of Daniel Boone and Henry Clay.</p>
            <p>All specialists should read this well-written and provocative book. It should appear in graduate and
                    undergraduate libraries in the trans-Appalachian West and in graduate libraries elsewhere. It
                    complements, but does not replace, the work of Turner, Roosevelt, Abernethy, Buley, Clark, and other
                    scholars who have described how the West was "won" and "lost."</p>

            <p>A president of a midwestern university once said that he was attempting to build a university that
                    the football team could be proud of. Gregory Kent Stanley, in his study of sports at the University
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> down to 1940, writes of presidents simultaneously trying to create a good university
                    and a manageable sports program, the athletic impulse, especially football, sometimes hindering the
                    academic mission.</p>
            <p>Using newspapers of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and university records, Stanley views the sports program through the presidencies of
                    three men. All had to deal with problems in its governance. James Patterson, first president of the
                    university (1869–1910), disliked football and wished to ban it, believing that it
                    deprived students of time necessary to their studies. The student athletic association, which
                    controlled football, frustrated his attempt in 1893 to prohibit its play. He did manage to give the
                    faculty jurisdiction over the association.</p>
            <p>In the hands of the students the football program limped along at the turn of the century. Its
                    financial health was too dependent on the annual Thanksgiving Day game with Transylvania University,
                        <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-093-3-078"/> the other university in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The competition with Transylvania engendered charges and countercharges about the use
                    of ineligible players, often "ringers."</p>
            <p>The successor to Patterson, Henry Barker (1910–1917), was more sympathetic to the game. He
                    created the position of athletic director; the director, faculty, students, and alumni constituted
                    an athletic council controlling sports. More importantly, the director and his assistant coaches
                    received faculty salaries, and the assistant football coaches served as coaches for minor sports
                    such as track and men's and women's basketball. Marring Barker's
                    administration was a scandalous episode involving a former assistant football coach accused of
                    setting fire to the office of a faculty member on the athletic council who had become
                    "harsh" on issues of eligibility.</p>
            <p>Succeeding Barker was Frank McVey (1917–1940). Under McVey the university, with the help
                    of alumni, constructed a football stadium and basketball gymnasium. Much to the distress and
                    distraction of the president, who wanted to give his attention to important academic matters,
                    construction of the gymnasium saw the contractor go bankrupt and the university besieged with law
                    suits; but the building of the gymnasium and the coming of Adolph Rupp to the university as
                    basketball coach in 1930 ushered in an era of tremendous success in the game. Ironically, that
                    success may have created expectations of greater success in football than could be met. Prompted by
                    shrinking attendance at football games and alumni discontent, McVey restructured the athletic
                    program in 1938, reducing the power of the athletic council and investing all decision making in the
                    athletic director, who answered to him alone.</p>
            <p>McVey also presided over an important change in women's sports. For years Florence Stout,
                    director of women's physical education, had opposed the competition of women, notably their
                    basketball team, in intercollegiate sports. Finally, in 1924, she persuaded the faculty senate to
                    abolish such play. Stanley attributes Stout's opposition more to her thirst for
                    "political gain"-the athletic department, not Stout, controlled the basketball
                    team-than to prevailing notions that competitive sports were not conducive to the emotional and
                    physical health of women.</p>
            <p>Stanley presents an interesting account of sports at the university. Often he integrates it with what
                    was happening nationally. Indianians may find his book instructive for understanding why the
                    University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, like Indiana University, has enjoyed great success in basketball but sporadic success
                    in football. Stanley's explanations of governance of sports at the university are sometimes
                    murky and confusing: on page 11 he states that the university board placed the "student-run
                    athletic association under the jurisdiction of the faculty"; but not until page 57 does he
                    identify the body as the "faculty athletic council," and never does he explain the
                    nature of its jurisdiction. Nor does he differentiate the council from the faculty <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-093-3-079"/> senate that banned women's basketball. At the risk of becoming
                    a public relations man, he might have said more about the sports heroes of the university who became
                    household words in the state. What of halfback John "Shipwreck" Kelly, for
                    instance? Stanley might have also provided tables on the records of the teams; such records could
                    illustrate the evolution of schedules in football and basketball that he briefly describes.

                    original research. Fifteen substantial chapters (of roughly sixty to seventy-five pages each),
                    written by highly regarded archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians, cover the <placeName>

                    record of the state of knowledge in this field in the mid-1990s, as well as a benchmark against
                    which future progress can be measured" (p. xix), and they aim the book at readers
                    throughout the world.</p>
            <p>It is a tricky business, in an age that encourages relativism and alternative histories, to write
                    about Indians or other minority groups, and the editors and authors here have wisely chosen a
                    traditional approach with high standards of objectivity. "Professional historians have a
                    responsibility to subject all interpretations to scholarly analysis," the editorial preface
                    asserts. "As more historical data become available, the possibility of subjective factors
                    wholly determining interpretations diminishes" (p. xvi).</p>
            <p>The editors, to be sure, are a bit embarrassed that there are no Indians or Inuit among the authors
                    and assert that this was not because of any lack of desire or effort to recruit Native American
                    authors. "The professional study of Native American history," they say,
                    "remains largely the domain of historians and anthropologists of European descent"
                    (p. xvii). The focus of the writing, however, is on the native peoples and the ways they reacted to
                    the diversity of environments and to the European cultures that invaded their lands. If there is a
                    theme to the book, it is that native groups have persisted <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-093-3-080"/> and
                    have struggled, more or less successfully, to maintain some autonomy and to preserve their cultural
                    identity and community life.</p>
            <p>The long history begins with the third chapter, in which Dean R. Snow describes the Paleo-Indians
                    with their nomadic hunter-gatherer cultures and then their gradual economic change and
                    diversification into bands within the standard culture areas of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="xxu">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. He pays attention, too, to linguistic diversification and relations between various
                    linguistic groups. Linda S. Cordell and Bruce D. Smith carry the story forward with a discussion of
                    mixed economies based on farming native domesticated plants combined with hunting and gathering.
                    They deal at length with both the Southwest and the Eastern Woodlands and offer a comparison of the
                    two regions. Smith further studies the agricultural chiefdoms of the Eastern Woodlands, with
                    emphasis on Mississippian culture, especially at three sites: Powers Phase in southeastern <placeName>

            <p>After these archaeological chapters, Bruce G. Trigger and William R. Swagerty present the history of
                    North America in the sixteenth century, a once neglected period now recognized as a time of major
                    change over much of the continent, including the devastation caused by the introduction of European
                    pathogens. Neil Salisbury then writes about the unprecedented spread of European cultures in the
                    eastern part of the continent between 1600 and 1783, with special attention to native accommodation
                    and resistance. Michael D. Green continues with a historical survey of eastern Indians in the
                    century from 1780 to 1880 as they reacted to the expansion of European colonization into the
                        <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>.</p>
            <p>Part II moves backward in time to pick up the history in other culture areas-the Great Plains from

                    modern times (by David Damas). Inserted halfway through this series is a chapter by Frederick E.
                    Hoxie that deals with the reservation period in the <placeName>

            <p>The whole work comes to a close with an idiosyncratic chapter by Wilcomb E. Washburn. Described in
                    the preface as "a personal evaluation of trends in Native North American life since
                    1960" (p. xv), this chapter furnishes a good deal of factual material and presents
                    Washburn's view that the Indians have experienced political, legal, economic, artistic,
                    literary, scholarly, and religious "renaissances," which are largely pan-Indian
                    movements. Washburn sees the future in a favorable light: "Judged by the standards of other

                    and confidence" (p. 468).</p>
            <p>The first two chapters remain to be noted. They do not fit the pattern of the book as a whole and
                    probably should have been entered at the end as appendices. The first, by anthropologist Peter
                    Nabokov, describes native views of history under headings of myth, prophecy, memory, legends and
                    oral traditions, oratory, folktales, ritual, and "things." The chapter is a
                    linking together of brief statements from a great many authors; the names of 110 authors, including
                    a few duplications, are entered into the text itself. The second chapter, written by the two editors
                    of the volume, is an extensive and valuable historiographical discussion of how historians have
                    treated native peoples of North America from the fifteenth century to the present. Since the authors
                    of the main chapters do not base their studies on Indian views of history but follow traditional
                    European-American practice, the first essay is out of place at the beginning of the volume. The book
                    as a whole does not pay any attention to the historiographical summary but moves forward on its own
                    terms.</p>
            <p>One of the best features of this work is the information in the bibliographical essays (running from
                    three to twelve pages each), which offer authoritative analyses of the literature pertaining to the
                    chapters. Another valuable feature is the excellent cartography. The maps are numerous (twenty-eight
                    in Part I, twenty-five in Part II, including six two-page spreads) and are very well drawn. They add
                    immeasurably to the understanding of the story, but, unfortunately, there is no identification of
                    the cartographer and no documentation of the sources used for each map. Only the archaeological
                    chapters have other illustrations (drawings of artifacts and sites).</p>
            <p>The editors have allowed the authors considerable leeway. All use personal preferences for naming
                    their subjects-Indians, Eskimos, Inuit, Native Americans, Native peoples, or simply Natives. They
                    chose their own schemes of documentation, from no footnotes at all, to footnoting only direct
                    quotations, to heavy documentation of the material; the number of footnotes per chapter runs from
                    none to 162.</p>
            <p>In a work as large and complex as this one, there are bound to be sections that will arouse criticism
                    and perhaps controversy. Historians may want less archaeological detail and more historical
                    development, while archaeologists and anthropologists may ask for just the opposite. But the authors
                    present an amazing amount of useful material and authoritative and carefully balanced judgments,
                    from which general readers can profit and against which scholars can check their own studies.</p>

            <p>Lewis Cass, according to Willard Carl Klunder, is "a curiously neglected historical
                    figure" (p. ix). Though he served for nearly half a century as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> territorial governor, <placeName>

                    minister to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, he has received no modern scholarly biography. This thorough, well-researched work
                    aims to rectify that defect.</p>
            <p>If historical importance is measured by the length of one's political vita, then Cass was
                    certainly important. Like fellow Democrat Buchanan and Whig John McLean, he was forever in the
                    public eye as a prominent officeholder and presidential hopeful. Today, however, he usually merits
                    only a brief mention as the Democratic standard bearer against Zachary Taylor in 1848 and author of
                    the ill-fated "popular sovereignty" formula for addressing the issue of slavery in
                    the western territories.</p>
            <p>Klunder does better at remedying the neglect of Cass than at showing why it was undeserved. His Cass
                    is a stalwart patriot and Democratic partisan, aggressively expansionist in foreign policy yet
                    always seeking accommodation and compromise in domestic controversy. Cass's preference for
                    moderation and the middle way, combined with his administrative talent and amiable personal
                    qualities, served him well politically until the sectional division over slavery opened the ground
                    beneath his feet. Like Buchanan, Cass always appeased the slave interest, even sacrificing popular
                    sovereignty to southern demands for a more definite proslavery stance. Yet he stood for the Union
                    when it came to war.</p>
            <p>Though he avoids hagiography, Klunder evidently considers Cass an admirable and sympathetic figure.
                    Many contemporaries did not, and it is easy to see why. Cass's gasconading belligerence
                    against Britain and <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> and persistent evasiveness on hot-button domestic issues could be read as proof of pure
                    patriotism-or of crass popularity seeking. As Klunder shows, Cass had a penchant for political
                    trimming and truckling. Always eager to avoid offense, Cass abstained from alcohol but pretended to
                    drink at parties; he held Masonic office but refused to appear in regalia. It was perfectly
                    characteristic of the man that his one undoubted claim to fame, the popular sovereignty doctrine,
                    was an ingenious device for dodging a difficult question. In the end those who thought it could not
                    be dodged were right.</p>
            <p>"Above all," concludes Klunder, Cass was "a true democrat."
                    However, he assigns no content to Cass's democracy beyond a platitudinous belief in
                    "the ability and right of the people to govern themselves" (p. 313). If Cass had
                    the courage of his convictions, it was <pb n="293" id="VAA4025-093-3-083"/> often unclear what those
                    convictions were. Cass's disposition to segregate moral concerns from practical politics,
                    while sometimes an asset, was certainly also his greatest weakness. Statesmanship does not reside
                    only in political expediency. Many in Cass's own party who looked for forthright principled
                    stands on issues from banking to slavery despised and distrusted him. Lewis Cass went along to get
                    along. Whether that best fits him for obscurity or renown, praise or obloquy, is something readers
                    can judge for themselves.</p>

                    by Michael J. Birkner. (Selinsgrove, Pa.: Susquehanna University Press, 1996. Pp. 215.
                    Illustrations, notes, select bibliography, index. $29.50.)</head>
            <p>This monograph emerged from a symposium held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Marshall College, <placeName>

                            <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, marking the bicentennial
                    of James Buchanan's birth. It contains several articles and a panel discussion exploring
                    the career of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>'s only president. It will appeal almost exclusively to political historians
                    who study the 1850s. There are, for example, only fleeting references to contemporary Indianians
                    such as Jesse D. Bright.</p>
            <p>Michael J. Birkner introduces the historical debate swirling around Buchanan's presidency.
                    He notes that Philip S. Klein's sympathetic biography <hi rend="i">(President James
                        Buchanan: A Biography,</hi> 1962) stands in stark contrast to the assessment of most historians,
                    including the contributors to this volume. Setting the stage, Birkner castigates Buchanan for his
                    mismanagement of the Dred Scott case and "Bleeding Kansas" and concludes that he
                    was "a canny wheelerdealer" (p. 25) undone by the pressures of the White House.</p>
            <p>Michael F. Holt, influential author of <hi rend="i">The Political Crisis of the</hi> 1850<hi rend="i">s</hi> (1978), surveys the election of 1856 and claims that it could have been much closer.
                    Holt argues that John C. Fremont, the first Republican presidential candidate, was irreparably
                    damaged in the three-way race by rumors that he was a Catholic. The American party or
                    "Know-Nothing" nominee, Millard Fillmore, failed spectacularly in his effort to
                    gain the votes of conservative Whigs and Democrats. The heated national debates over the Lecompton (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>) Constitution and the nomination of Buchanan, who drew the united support of southern
                    and northern Democrats, scuttled Fillmore. This pivotal canvass was the last for both the Whigs and
                    Know-Nothings and presaged the Republican triumph of 1860.</p>
            <p>Peter B. Knupfer depicts Buchanan as "a typical member of the Jacksonian political
                    generation" (p. 152) who was morally obtuse regarding slavery. Buchanan's
                    ostracism of fellow Democrat Stephen <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-093-3-084"/> A. Douglas and his
                    heavy-handed patronage policies further alienated "young, new voters" (p. 164).
                    Although readers may quibble about whether Republicans employed "new techniques"
                    (p. 165) in their probes of Democratic corruption, Knupfer forcefully contends that the election of
                    1860 was a repudiation of "old fogyism" (p. 166).</p>
            <p>Mark W. Summers and Robert E. May investigate distinct issues relating to Buchanan's
                    administration. Summers portrays a bumbling president unable to control the Democratic press, which
                    turned increasingly toward Douglas during the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> controversy. May contrastingly commends Buchanan's diplomacy, particularly his
                    handling of southern filibusterers such as William Walker, the erstwhile conqueror of <placeName>
                        <country reg="nq">Nicaragua</country>
                    </placeName>. May convincingly asserts that, in this case at least, Buchanan did not take the
                    proslavery path.</p>
            <p>Buchanan and his successor, Abraham Lincoln, are the focus of the article by William E. Gienapp. In
                    every category <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s leadership skills are judged superior. Gienapp dismisses Buchanan's
                    "reckless foreign policy" (p. 105) and declares that "few presidents have
                    done more in four years to bring the opposing party to power" (p. 120). It is not
                    surprising that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> has outshone Buchanan; a more apt comparison would have been between Buchanan and his
                    predecessor, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Pierce.</p>
            <p>The discussion featuring Don E. Fehrenbacher, Robert W. Johannsen, Elbert B. Smith, and Kenneth M.
                    Stampp manifests the disparate opinions held within the historical discipline regarding Buchanan.
                    Fehrenbacher emphasizes Buchanan's meddling in the Dred Scott decision, which exacerbated
                    the schism among Democrats. Significantly, he also credits the Buchanan administration with actively
                    suppressing the African slave trade. Johannsen questions the efficacy of studies confined to narrow
                    aspects of Buchanan's career and calls for further research into the president's
                    motivations and ideology. He cogently places Buchanan within the context of his times; the
                    Pennsylvanian was a constitutional unionist who believed that moralistic agitation of the slavery
                    issue would destroy the Union. Johannsen also stresses that President Buchanan ultimately stood firm
                    during the secession crisis, a stand that allowed for a smooth transition with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> administration despite the creation of the Confederacy. Smith censures Buchanan for
                    failing to comprehend the significance of the free-soil movement, thus indirectly bolstering
                    Republican chances in 1860. Stampp retells Buchanan's bungling regarding patronage and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> but joins Johannsen in praising his conduct during the secession crisis.</p>
            <p>This slim volume will not rehabilitate Buchanan's political reputation-nor was it intended
                    to do so. It does, however, add modestly to an understanding of his presidency and underscores the
                    need for further study.</p>

                    Fee.</hi> By Victor B. Howard. (Selinsgrove, Pa.: Susquehanna University Press, 1996. Pp. 261.
                    Notes, bibliography, index. $41.50.)</head>
            <p>After a long career in both the military and academia, Victor B. Howard has written several useful
                    works examining the role religious and moral concerns played in America's struggle with
                    racial oppression and slavery. His latest production is a careful study of the antislavery career of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>'s John G. Fee, a sometimes overlooked but nonetheless compelling figure in the
                    religious war against slaveholding. A rare species indeed, Fee lingered as long as he might among
                    slavery's proponents to preach against the institution while seeking to enlarge his
                    antislavery flock. Finally forced to flee his native state in the wake of John Brown's raid
                    in 1859, Fee soon returned to southern soil to fight slavery and racism (or what the author refers
                    to as caste) through the Civil War and beyond.</p>
            <p>Howard's biography of Fee serves to recall the labors and sacrifices of supporting
                    characters in America's epic struggle to escape the burdens of human bondage.
                    Fee's residence in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and his unswerving devotion to his religious mission could not fail to capture the
                    attention of slavery's northern opponents, not to mention the institution's
                    defenders in the Bluegrass state. (Howard figures Fee faced antiabolitionist mobs twenty-two times.)
                    Along with Cassius M. Clay, Fee remained at times virtually the lone antislavery advocate from the
                    slave South. Ironically or not, the more despised Fee became in his native state the more attention
                    he won from national abolitionist leaders. His constant efforts no doubt continued to inspire
                    antislavery elements in the North, although the restricted scope of his activities may have reduced
                    his role to a symbolic one.</p>
            <p>Still, interested readers will gain greater knowledge and doubtless deeper appreciation of
                    Fee's activities thanks to Howard's detailed account of his life and work. The
                    minister's ties with the American Missionary Association as well as his often strained
                    relations with Cassius Clay are closely examined. Fee's more lasting contributions probably
                    lie in his efforts to help freed slaves gain some <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> land, as well as in his role in founding <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Berea</settlement>
                    </placeName> College (at first nonsectarian as well as nondiscriminating) and freedmen schools at
                    Camp Nelson. In the latter case Howard capably demonstrates Fee's most specific
                    achievement, helping to win legislation freeing the dependents of African-American Union soldiers.
                    Although Fee's postwar focus included other issues, such as nonsectarianism, baptism by
                    immersion, and prohibition, his lifelong devotion to seeking racial justice never wavered. While
                    many of the freemen naturally preferred independent black churches, Fee pointedly visited and
                    maintained fellowship with African-American congregations throughout the postwar period.</p>
            <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-093-3-086"/>
            <p>Howard's continuing scholarly contributions should by now be recognized. On one hand he has
                    almost single-handedly pursued a mission to highlight the work of devoted Christians during the
                    Civil War era. On the other his work is reminiscent of that of Gilbert Barnes and especially Dwight
                    Dumond and is often reliant on the more recent findings of scholars such as Merton Dillon, Bertram Wyatt-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, John McKivigan, and Stanley Harrold. Indeed, such reliance may explain why
                    occasionally Howard leans a bit too much on the writings of others (including this reviewer). Other
                    minor flaws appear in the book, but such lapses may be excused considering the obvious diligence of
                    Howard's work.</p>
            <p>Readers and scholars now have an easily accessible account of one of slavery's most
                    determined and propinquent, if not most prominent, opponents. The role religion played in the
                    careers of such antislavery activists as Fee warrants this greater amplification. Readers also have
                    yet another reminder of racism's strong grasp and the way it helps to form an enduring
                    American caste system. Even some of Fee's associates fell victim despite the
                    clergyman's best efforts. While still further revelations of racism's corruption
                    and endurance can be depressingly familiar and repetitive, this fact should not diminish the
                    recognition due the devoted efforts and actual accomplishments of the Reverend John G. Fee. Once
                    again Howard has succeeded in his mission to recall the missionary endeavors of such dedicated
                    Christians in the Civil War era.</p>

            <p>Stephens was a son of free, mixed-blood parents who had fled the eastern shore of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> at the time of the Nat Turner slave rebellion to take their place in the

                    impressed upon his young mind and heart "the horrors of Southern slavery and the history of
                    America's bloodiest slave revolt" (p. 3). As a young man employed with the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Coast Survey, Stephens spent two weeks ashore in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>, <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
               </placeName>,
                    where he saw firsthand the cruelty and dehumanization of a slave-based economy. His veins boiled
                    with the "hot blood of revenge which nothing but the blood of a slaveholder can
                    satiate" (p. 3). Six years later he would return to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a Union soldier.</p>
            <p>The Civil War was to Stephens an opportunity for black men to demonstrate their worth to white
                    America, to help slaves escape to freedom, and to punish the abhorrent system that fueled its
                    economy with human flesh. He won support from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Governor John A. Andrew, a dedicated abolitionist who recognized the contribution black
                    soldiers could make and who would continue to rally support for their equal rights. Governor Andrew
                    organized the 54th <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Volunteer Infantry, the first black army unit raised in the North, outfitted the proud
                    and well-trained fighting men, and appointed Robert Gould Shaw as their commander.</p>
            <p>At Battery Wagner near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> the 54th fought valiantly under dreadful conditions. White troops failed to support the
                    assault, Confederate officers refused a truce, and wounded black soldiers were slaughtered where
                    they fell. Colonel Shaw was one of 1,515 Union casualties. African-American soldiers had
                    demonstrated their brave persistence, but instead of recognition they were offered half pay,
                    demeaning fatigue duty, and refusal of commissions. Further inflamed, Stephens took up his pen,
                    inciting his readers to right the wrongs inflicted on the men who were fighting for them. For
                    eighteen months the men of the 54th refused to accept half the pay of white soldiers. Word reached
                    them that their families were destitute, but they stood firm. Morale deteriorated, and Stephens
                    wrote early in 1864 of "mutinous discontent" over what the men considered another
                    form of slavery (p. 71).</p>
            <p>The 54th fought in other engagements and suffered severe losses, yet Stephens saw the war as a way
                    for blacks to gain respect and believed defeat might even have a favorable effect by prolonging the
                    war and providing more opportunity for black men. Stephens's letters burn with reports of
                    white troops returning fleeing slaves to their cruel masters, of harsh conditions suffered by
                    African-American soldiers, of cynicism toward President Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation
                    Proclamation, and of the inhumanity of proposed colonization.</p>
            <p>Yacovone draws the character of Stephens as focused and determined. He underscores the outrage that
                    drove Stephens to lead a campaign of words for equal rights and after the war to work in the South
                    as an educator. Stephens's "arduous and sometimes anguished life remains a heroic
                    story, and his writings chart the black struggle <pb n="298" id="VAA4025-093-3-088"/> for freedom
                    and equality during the era of the Civil War. Through him, we can recapture the aspirations of black
                    soldiers who fought for the Union, and against slavery and racial oppression" (p. 109).
                    This is a book of attitudes defining social history that are just as relevant today as they were in
                    Stephens's time.</p>

            <p>The publication of this study suggests that historical investigation of the matrix of the
                    twentieth-century fundamentalist-neoevangelical movement has moved beyond its initial stages. There
                    are excellent synthetic analyses embracing the work of such scholars as George Marsden, Joel
                    Carpenter, and Bradley Longfield and biographies of important figures as diverse as J. Gresham
                    Machen, Billy Sunday, and Aimee Semple McPherson. Now it seems appropriate to probe that complex
                    cultural phenomenon in sharper and richer detail, and Barry Hankins is among those pressing the
                    quest.</p>
            <p>The author underscores the deeply contradictory nature of his subject. A key initiator of southern
                    fundamentalism, chiefly from the pulpit of the First Baptist Church in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Worth</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
               </placeName>, J. Frank Norris also spent a good part of his career in the North in
                    the Temple Baptist Church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Hankins argues persuasively that Norris was not even a good southern Baptist when he
                    was in the South. He frequently violated Baptist traditions of local congregational democracy and
                    anticreedalism yet never departed from his powerful involvement in the Baptist denomination.
                    Norris's adult public life over more than three decades seemed an exercise in skipping from
                    one "cause" to another, mostly in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Hankins
                    convincingly portrays Norris's turbulent career through largely thematic chapters on the
                    minister's nativism, his anticommunism, his work in the North in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Motor City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and his commitment to certain fundamentalist theological principles, especially
                    dispensationalism. An unfortunately skimpy and far less convincing chapter on Norris's
                    racial views ends the book.</p>
            <p>A fascinating chapter entitled "Sphinx" examines the deeply conflicted personality
                    that constituted the core of J. Frank Norris. Effectively utilizing the Norris papers and oral
                    interviews with some of the preacher's most intimate associates, Hankins lays bare
                    Norris's deeply authoritarian tendencies. The passages regarding relations <pb n="299" id="VAA4025-093-3-089"/> between Norris and his son are especially painful and revealing, but
                    Hankins does not probe deeply enough the psychological dimensions of this central topic to explain
                    fully Norris's powerful, charismatic personality. A complete picture of Norris's
                    personal life is also missing. For example, except for the brief, tantalizing comments in the
                    "Sphinx" chapter, Hankins reveals little about the minister's relations
                    with his wife and family. One has to conclude that this book is more an examination of the public
                    life of J. Frank Norris than a fully rounded biography.</p>
            <p>Still, Hankins has crafted an effective study. His work is rooted in solid archival research, and he
                    writes in an engaging, "down home" style not found in most scholarly monographs.
                    Hankins enables Norris to take his place in the historiography of a movement as a dramatic yet
                    representative "type" within American fundamentalism and modern evangelicalism.</p>

                    By Maureen Ogle. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>

            <p>America's love affair with their bathrooms and their obsession with cleanliness seem to be
                    ever-continuing phenomena that historians have only begun to explore. Maureen Ogle's brief
                    history of the development of indoor plumbing in the nineteenth century is a welcome contribution to
                    this growing body of literature.</p>
            <p>Ogle's study focuses on the history of indoor plumbing fixtures (sinks, basins, bathing
                    tubs, shower baths, and water closets) before they took their modern form in the 1890s. From 1840 to
                    1870 she finds a period of experimentation and inventiveness that was the consequence of a
                    nationwide interest in plumbing. This interest, she maintains, stemmed from growing American
                    affluence, a belief in progress, and the desire to improve the convenience of family and domestic
                    life and was not connected, as generally believed, with the provision of public water and sewer
                    systems. Early indoor plumbing utilized water pumped from cisterns, tanks, wells, or nearby bodies
                    of water and disposed of wastes in cesspools or drains. It was therefore available to residents in
                    country settings and in villages as well as those in cities. Hot water heaters or boilers provided
                    additional convenience to mid-nineteenth century homes. Ogle supplies fascinating descriptions as
                    well as illustrations of these early indoor plumbing fixtures, most especially of mechanical,
                    water-flushed water closets. <pb n="300" id="VAA4025-093-3-090"/> Ogle asserts that both middle- and
                    upper-class Americans enjoyed indoor plumbing in this period, but her evidence for this widespread
                    use is scant.</p>
            <p>The second part of Ogle's book covers the period from 1870 to 1890 when indoor plumbing was
                    transformed from a private, relatively unregulated matter to a concern of the whole community. A new
                    group of professionals (mainly engineers and physicians) who called themselves sanitarians, immersed
                    in the culture of "scientism," denounced then current plumbing practices as
                    bringing the dangers of disease and even death not only to individual families but also to the
                    public health. Plumbing fixtures ceased to be conveniences and became the objects of the laws of
                    science as fears of the "abominable evil" of sewer gas and other poisonous
                    emanations proliferatedfears that predated the general acceptance of the germ theory of disease in
                    the 1880s. Sanitarians not only called for scientific plumbing but also demanded scientifically
                    designed public water and sewer systems that would be professionally connected to household fixtures
                    whose characteristics and installation would be regulated by law. Local governments responded by
                    building waterworks, if they did not already have them, and sewer systems and by passing plumbing
                    codes.</p>
            <p>This monograph is based on intensive research in nineteenthcentury architectural works,
                    builder's and plumber's guides, domestic advice books, and <placeName>

                    information on nineteenth-century plumbing fixtures-how they worked and where they were located in
                    the home. One would like to hear more from the consumers and users of nineteenth-century plumbing
                    beyond the few intriguing excerpts from diaries and family papers included in this book.
                    Ogle's analysis of the difficult historical question of the relationship between the
                    development of technology and "the underlying cultural setting" (p. 6) rejects the
                    notion of technology's impact on society. The author chooses instead to consider
                    "the values and ideas [that] prompted the selection of a technology" and the ways
                    in which "cultural shifts shape technology's form or lead away from one form and
                    toward another" (p. 157). Ogle relates the development of household plumbing to
                    "existing interpretations of American culture" (p. 158) and finds that in the
                    1840–1870 period, for example, values of "privatism, individualism and limited
                    government" (p. 158) were reflected in the choice of individual household plumbing systems
                    with private water supplies and waste systems. Between 1870 and 1890 individualism was replaced by
                    "interconnection" and a more activist role for government produced an integrated
                    system of water mains, sewers, and household plumbing.</p>

                    depression 1930s, however, the road faced its fourth receivership in 1938.</p>
            <p>A successful reorganization followed the receivership, and by the early 1940s heavy wartime traffic
                    permitted a dividend on <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName> was facing increased highway truck competition, restive labor unions, and larger

                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName> officials began to look around for a possible merger. The <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad (Lackawanna) was located in the same areas of <placeName>

                    </placeName> that were served by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Lackawanna, remembered as the Route of Phoebe Snow, had long been a prosperous
                    line but after World War II faced hard times as anthracite gave way to oil as the best fuel for
                    heating. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Lackawanna had had extensive cooperation in the late 1950s and were merged as
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Lackawanna in 1960.</p>
            <p>The 1960 merger had been preceded by only meager planning, and the larger <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as the senior partner, took over most of the top positions. The major savings
                    anticipated from the merger did not appear, and by 1963 the new road was again near receivership.
                    Under the excellent leadership of William White, a capable railroader and chairman of the line from
                    1963 to 1967, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Lackawanna managed to survive. In 1968 the road was taken over by Dereco, a holding
                    company controlled by the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway. Hurricane Agnes in 1972 destroyed many
                    of the <placeName>

                    major portions of the line were included in the newly formed Conrail. The remaining portions of the <placeName>

                    liquidated over the next dozen years for the benefit of the bondholders and other creditors.</p>
            <p>Grant's excellent and detailed review of the decline and death of a major line is unique,
                    since most rail histories cover only a railroad's birth and growth. The author's
                    extensive sources include a wealth of primary and secondary material, plus numerous interviews with
                    dozens of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Lackawanna might still have been in operation in the 1990s if the Staggers Act of 1980
                    (which greatly deregulated railroads) had been enacted twenty years earlier.</p>

                    Burns. (<placeName>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Inventing the Modern Artist</hi> draws many fascinating parallels between the way
                    artists behaved in the late nineteenth century and the way other people did. The most striking
                    example, perhaps, is the artist's studio, best exemplified by the curio-stuffed painting
                    rooms of Hoosier William Merritt Chase at 51 West Tenth Street in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The interior of the Chase establishment was well known to art lovers through
                    illustrated articles about it in the popular press, Chase's own painted views of his
                    self-created environment, and the round of receptions and entertainments he held there. The latter,
                    argues Sarah Burns, amounted to public sales: in the absence of reliable mechanisms for marketing
                    their work, artists created their own showrooms, decorated with the same romantic, exotic trappings
                    that department stores used to lull shoppers into impulse buying. The manly but fashionable persona
                    of the host showing his wares was also in line with the image of the American businessman-hero of
                    the day, solid and sound despite his extravagant surroundings. Chase might have passed for a captain
                    of industry who had just plundered the natural resources and artistic treasures of some remote
                    corner of the new American empire overseas!</p>
            <p>There are some surprises in <hi rend="i">Inventing the Modern Artist,</hi> including a fresh
                    appraisal of Winslow Homer. Even old-fashioned art historians with little interest in other kinds of
                    history had figured out that Homer's hunters with their slain prey and his characteristic
                    battles between sailors and the sea had something to do with Social Darwinism and the mechanics of
                    relentless capitalism. But Burns draws a sharp portrait of a shrewd businessman with a taste for
                    subject <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-093-3-093"/> matter that touched responsive chords in American men
                    much like himself: small, neat fellows in suits (if photographs of the artist are to be believed)
                    who pined for outdoor he-man adventures and often behaved as though a business deal were a muscular
                    tussle with the very forces of the universe.</p>
            <p>Reflecting current historical scholarship, Burns takes particular care to point out how artists fit
                    into a new world view defined by consumerism, masculinity, and the image-making capacities of the
                    mass media. But one wonders, in the end, if artists thought about department store baubles, the
                    rules of proper drawing-room deportment, or much of anything else in these terms; whether, to use
                    her recurring phrase, they "constructed" or invented a world anything like the one
                    imagined by historians. Thirty years ago historians of art saw artists as essentially passive
                    characters waiting on the railroad platform of style. The train pulled in, and they scurried into
                    cars labeled "Post Impressionism" or "Cubism"-and the
                    historian's task was done. Today the cars are labeled "gender,"
                    "consumption," and the like, but the effect is much the same. Artists are passive
                    creatures, hapless passengers on a train propelled by forces utterly beyond their control.</p>
            <p>Determinism is a real danger in Burns's methodology. When she speaks of art objects,
                    however, her observations are startlingly original and always wise. Art, if not the artist, still
                    seems immune to categorizing: the quibble with her methodology is a quibble with the fashion of the
                    times and not with <hi rend="i">Inventing the Modern Artist.</hi> In this book Burns has constructed
                    a sturdy bridge between contemporary historical writing and the stuff of art history. She also
                    invites readers to observe significant continuities between the Gilded Age and the present century.
                    Modernism was about a rupture with the past, about "Breaking Homes Ties," the
                    title of a sentimental genre painting by Thomas Hovenden that caused a sensation at the 1893
                    World's Fair. Burns points out that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Norman</settlement>
                    </placeName> Rockwell took up the same theme in 1954, with much the same result. People were deeply
                    moved in both instances by images that analyzed and objectified change. The pictures spoke to
                    something in the human condition that was not constructed or invented. It was simply there.</p>

            <p>The book centers on the so-called "classical age" of the big studios although it
                    also provides background material about the early days of the movies, explaining how they took on
                    their particular commercial patterns. Fundamentally, however, the book's thesis is
                    succinctly formulated by the author in his introduction: "The history of Hollywood is the
                    story of a crass, pandering, hypocritical, derivative, capitalist movie making machine, a machine
                    whose products were <hi rend="i">ours,</hi> and we bought at least once a week during its classical
                    era" (p. 7). The book is thus an indictment of greedy and venal capitalist exploiters and
                    an American public whose tastes are low and vulgar.</p>
            <p>All this may seem familiar to many, for a good number of the charges leveled in this book have been
                    brought many times before. It can be said in defense of the book that it intends to place the major
                    issues in an elaborate conceptual framework that makes full use of the work of recently fashionable
                    linguistic scholars as well as studies by psychoanalytical theorists, semiologists,
                    deconstructionists, Marxists, and numerous postmodernist intellectuals. The book is not, however,
                    couched in heavy critical jargon; it is, by and large, clearly written.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Hollywood's High Noon</hi> is part of a series called "The American
                    Moment," and the series editor, Stanley I. Kutler, announces in his foreword that the
                    author "understands and considers moviemaking as an art form on its own terms."
                    This may be true, but one looks in vain for evidence of it here. Clearly the author is not
                    interested in whatever there is of art or triumphs of imagination in the movies; like many
                    postmodernists he sweeps such things under the rug or suggests that whenever they are found they are
                    techniques used to dupe the groundlings.</p>
            <p>So what is one to do if one has a predilection for old movie classics, if one thinks that there may

                    movie viewers might well prefer them in smaller doses. If you see some light, or charm, or wit in
                    the movies you might fall back on a retort given by the late Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.

                    preservation. In a three-part work, Menke highlights the role of one woman, Mary Fauntleroy, in
                    preserving and restoring the historic buildings of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Fauntleroy, an Owen descendant, was a tireless volunteer worker dedicated
                    throughout her ninety-five years to "the history of her family, church and
                    community." Menke sketches the history of Fauntleroy's life in the first section
                    of the book. Readers sifting through the second section, a collection of primary documents, will
                    find particular interest in the documents that recall both the highlights of commemoration, such as
                    a reproduction of the 1914 Centennial Celebration Program, and the disputes and difficulties that
                    often accompanied the process of the historic restorations. The book concludes with a photographic
                    section but also includes many interesting photographs throughout. <hi rend="i">Dawn E. Bakken,

                    his time, documented and illustrated his creation of the Centaur typeface in a small publication.
                    This book, which detailed Roger's interest in the art and craft of creating type and
                    compared examples of Centaur with other typefaces, has become a collector's item among
                    graphic designers, typographers, and others interested in bookmaking. Because of the considerable

                    information on their later careers. The biographies quote heavily from the class members and thus
                    are in large measure oral history. Although occasionally nostalgic the biographies in fact present

                    the presidents and invites readers to make their own judgments. The book may not be professional
