                            <l>BEFORE you came, the stars shone not full bright,</l>
                            <l>But dimly, as by clouds of sorrow veiled;</l>
                            <l>And e&apos;en by day the sun&apos;s vast glory failed;</l>
                            <l>As blind, I wandered in abiding night.</l>
                            <l>Glad spring, which once could blighted hopes renew,</l>
                            <l>Left my dead heart in winter&apos;s dark despair;</l>
                            <l>The fairest roses seemed to me less fair</l>
                            <l>Than mournful cypress or regretful rue.</l>
                            <l>Joy failed me then, and Sorrow, at my side,</l>
                            <l>Chanted her dirge of hopelessness to me.</l>
                            <l>Death beckoned oft, and vowed my friend to be,</l>
                            <l>And oft I turned my steps with her to bide.</l>

                            <l>No start, no spring,- just you, till life is done.</l>

                            <l>A year ago I planned for self alone;</l>

                            <l>Was mine. I plunged into the world&apos; hard strife</l>
                            <l>With one thought, Victory! Then pride urged on.</l>
                            <l>I strove to win fame&apos;s laurel for my brow,</l>
                            <l>That I might hear the world applaud. But now</l>
                            <l>&apos;Tis changed. Since love came with its glory dawn,</l>
                            <l>I think, I plan, I strive all, all for thee,</l>
                            <l>God&apos;s gift the beat of all the gifts to be.</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">Back again to Nature&apos;s fold.</l>
                        <l>Dimmer grows the old year&apos;s vision,</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">When the chilling winds shall blow,</l>
                        <l>And the kettle&apos;s cheery singing</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Shall drive back the ice and snow.</l>
                        <l>Then to Summer we shall bring</l>
