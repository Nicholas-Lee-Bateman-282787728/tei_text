                    <p>Near the eastern boundary of that level region of northern Egypt, known as
                        the Delta, once thridded by seven branches of the sea-hunting Nile, Rameses
                        II, in the fourteenth century B. C., erected the city of Pithom and stored
                        his treasure therein. His riches overtaxed its coffers and he builded
                        Pa-Ramesu, in t part, to hold the overflow. But he died before the work was
                        completed by half, and his fourteenth son and successor, Meneptah, took it
                        up and pushed it with the nomad bond-people that dwelt in the Delta.</p>
                    <p>The city was laid out near the center of Goshen, a long strip of fertile
                        country given over to the Israelites i since the days of the Hyksos king,
                        Apepa, near the year 1800 B.C.</p>

                        wheat and meadow grass. Wherever the soil was better for grazing great
                        flocks of sheep moved in compact clouds, with a lank dog and an ancient
                        shepherd following them.</p>

                            n="2"/> Israelites stood in the center of gardens of lentils, garlic and
                        lettuce, securely hedged against the inroads of hares and roving cattle.
                        Close to these were com- pounds for the flocks and brush inclosures for
                        geese, and cotes for the pigeons used in sacrifice. Here dwelt the aged in
                        trusteeship over the land, while the young and sturdy builded Pa-Ramesu.</p>
                    <p> Sunrise on the uncompleted city tipped the raw lines of her half-built walls
                        with broken fire and gilded the gear of gigantic hoisting cranes.
                        Scaffolding, clinging to bald façades seemed frail and cobwebby at great
                        height, and slabs of stone, drawn and held by cables near the summit of
                        chutes, looked like dice on the giddy slide.</p>
                    <p>Below in the still shadowy passages and interiors, speckled with fallen
                        mortar, lay chains, rubble of brick and chipped stone; splinters, flinders
                        and odd ends of timber; scraps of metal, broken implements and the what-not
                        that litters the path of construction. Without, in the avenues, vaguely
                        outlined by the slowly rising structures on either side, were low-riding,
                        long, heavy, dwarf-wheeled vehicles and sledges to which men, not beasts,
                        had been harnessed. Here, also, were great cords of new brick and avalanches
                        of glazed tile where disaster had overtaken orderly stacks of this
                        multi-tinted material. In the open spaces were covered heaps of sand, and
                        tons of lime, in sacks; lavers of paint and hogsheads of tar; ingots of
                        copper and pigs of bronze. Roadways, beaten in the dust by a multitude of
                        bare feet, led in a hundred directions, all merging in one great track
                        toward the camp of the laboring Israelites.</p>
                    <p>This was pitched in a vast open in the city&apos;s center <pb
                            id="VAA3882-011" n="3"/> wherein Rameses II had planned to build a
                        second Karnak to Imhotep. Under the gracious favor of this, the physician
                        god, the great Pharaoh had re- gained his sight. But death stayed his
                        grateful hand and Meneptah forgot his father&apos;s debt. Here, then,
                        year in and year out, an angular sea of low tents shel- tered Israel.</p>
                    <p>Let it not be supposed that all the sons of Abraham were here. Thousands
                        labored yet in the perfection of Pithom, on the highways of the Lower
                        country, and on the Rameside canal, and the greater number made the brick
                        for all Egypt in the clay-fields of the Delta. Therefore, within the walls
                        of Pa-Ramesu there were somewhat more than three thousand He- brews, men,
                        women and children.</p>
                    <p>On a slight eminence, overlooking the camp, were numerous small structures of
                        sun-dried brick, grouped about one of larger dimensions. Above this was
                        raised a military standard, a hawk upon a cross-bar, from which hung
                        party-colored tassels of linen floss. By this sign, the order of government
                        was denoted. The Hebrews were under martial law. </p>
                    <p>The camp was astir. Thin columns of blue smoke drifted up here and there
                        between the close-set tents, and the sibilant wearing of stone-mills, as
                        they ground the wheat, was heard in many households. The nutty aroma of
                        parching lentils, and the savor of roasting papyrus root and garlic told the
                        stage of the morning meal. The strong-armed women, rich brown in tint from
                        the ardent sun, crowned with coil upon coil of heavy hair, bent over the
                        pungent fires. Sturdy chil- dren, innocent of raiment, went hither and
                        thither, bearing well filled skins of water. Apart from these <pb
                            id="VAA3882-012" n="4"/> were the men of Israel, bearded and grave,
                        stalwart and scantily clad. They repaired a cable or fitted an ax-handle or
                        mended a hoe. But they were full of serious and absorbed discourse, for the
                        great Hebrew, Moses, from the sheep-ranges of Midian, had been among them,
                        showing them marvels of sorcery, preaching Jehovah and promising freedom.
                        The first high white light of dawn was breaking upon the century-long night
                        of Israel.</p>
                    <p>Before one of the tents an old woman knelt-beside a bed of live coals,
                        turning a browning water-fowl upon a pointed stick. She was a consummate
                        cook, and the bird was fat and securely trussed. Now and again she sprinkled
                        a pinch of crude salt on the embers to suppress the odor of the burning
                        drippings, and lifted the fowl out of the reach of the pale flames that
                        leaped up thereafter. Presently she removed the fowl S and forked it off the
                        spit into a capacious earthenware Bowl near by. Then, with green withes as
                        tongs, she drew forth a round tile from under the coals and set it over the
                        dish to complete the baking. From anothi tile-platter at hand she took
                        several round slices of durra bread and proceeded to toast them with much
                        skill, tilting the hot tile and casting each browned slice in on the fowl as
                        it was done. When she had finished she removed the cover and set the bowl on
                        the large platter, protecting her hands from its heat with a fold of her
                        habit. With no little triumph and some diffi- culty she got upon her feet
                        and carried the toothsome dish into her shelter, to place it beyond the
                        reach of stealthy hands. No such meal was cooked that morn- ing, elsewhere,
                        in Pa-Ramesu, except at the military headquarters on the knoll.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-013" n="5"/>
                    <p>There was little inside the tent, except the meager- est essential
                        furnishing. A long amphora stood in a tamarisk rack in one corner; a linen
                        napkin hung, pinned to the tent-cloth, over it; a glazed laver and a small
                        box sat beside it. A mat of braided reeds, the handiwork of the old
                        Israelite, covered the naked earth. This served as seat or table for the
                        occupants. Several wisps of straw were scattered about and a heap of it,
                        over which a cotton cloak had been thrown, lay in one corner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rachel,&quot; the old woman said briskly.</p>
                    <p>Evidently some one slept under the straw, for the heap stirred.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rachel!&quot; the old woman reiterated, drawing off the
                        cloak.</p>
                    <p>Without any preliminary pushing away of the straw, a young girl sat up. A
                        little bewildered, she divested her head and shoulders of a frowsy straw
                        thatch and stood erect, shaking it off from her single short garment.</p>
                    <p>She was not more than sixteen years old. Above me- dium height and of nobler
                        proportions than the typical woman of the race, her figure was remarkable
                        for its symmetry and utter grace. The stamp of the coun- tenance was purely
                        Semitic, except that she was dis- tinguished, most wondrously in color, from
                        her kind. Her sleep had left its exquisite heaviness on eyes of the
                        tenderest blue, and the luxuriant hair she pushed back from her face was a
                        fleece of gold. Hers was that rare complexion that does not tan. The sun but
                        brightened her hair and wrought the hue of health in her cheeks. Her
                        forehead was low, broad, and white as marble; her neck and arms white, and
                        the hands, <pb id="VAA3882-014" n="6"/> busied with the hair, were strong,
                        soft, dimpled and white. The grace of her womanhood had not been overcome by
                        the slave-labor, which she had known from infancy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good morning, Deborah. Why—thy bed—have I slept under it?&quot;
                        she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Since the middle of the last watch,&quot; the old woman
                        assented.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But why? Did Merenra come?&quot; the girl inquired
                        anxiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay; but I heard some one ere the camp was astir and I covered
                        thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And thou hast had no sleep since,&quot; the girl said, with
                        regret in her voice. &quot;Thou dost reproach me with thy goodness,
                        Deborah.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She went to the amphora and poured water into the laver, drew forth from the
                        box a horn comb and a vial of powdered soda from the Natron Lakes, and
                        proceeded with her toilet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Came some one, of a truth?&quot; she asked presently.</p>
                    <p> Deborah pointed to the smoking bowl. Rachel in- spected the fowl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Marsh-hen!&quot; she cried in surprise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Atsu brought it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Atsu?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so. From his own bounty and for Rachel,&apos;&quot;
                        Deborah explained.</p>
                    <p>Rachel smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art beset from a new direction,&quot; the old woman
                        continued dryly, &quot;but thou hast naught to fear from
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay; I know,&quot; Rachel murmured, arranging her dress.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-015" n="7"/>
                    <p>The garb of the average bondwoman was of start- ling simplicity. It consisted
                        of two pieces of stuff little wider than the greatest width of the
                        wearer&apos;s body, tied by the corners over each shoulder, belted at
                        the waist with a thong and laced together with fiber at the sides, from the
                        hips to a point just above the knee. It was open above and below this simple
                        seam and interfered not at all with the freedom of the wearer&apos;s
                        movements. But Rachel&apos;s habit was a voluminous surplice, fitting
                        closely at the neck, supplied with wide sleeves, seamed, hemmed and of ample
                        length. Deb- orah was literally swathed in covering, with only her withered
                        face and hands exposed. There was a hint of rank in their superior dress and
                        more than a sug- gestion of blood in the bearing of the pair; but they were
                        laborers with the shepherds and serving-people of Israel.</p>
                    <p> &quot;He would wed thee, after the manner of thy people, and take thee
                        from among Israel,&quot; Deborah continued.</p>
                    <p>The girl drooped her head over the lacing of her habit and made no answer.
                        The old woman looked at her sharply for a moment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, eat; Rachel, eat,&quot; she urged at last. &quot;The
                        marsh-hen will stand thee in good stead and thou hast a weary day before
                        thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel looked at the old woman and made mental comparison between the ancient
                        figure and her strong, young self. With great deliberation she divided the
                        fowl into a large and small part.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This,&quot; she said, extending the larger to Deborah,
                        &quot;is thine. Take it,&quot; waving aside the protests of the old
                        woman, &quot;or the first taste of it will choke me.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-016" n="8"/>
                    <p>Deborah submitted duly and consumed the tender morsel while she watched
                        Rachel break her fast.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What said Atsu?&quot; Rachel asked, after the marsh- hen was
                        less apparent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Little, which is his way. But his every word was worth a harangue
                        in weight. Merenra and his purple- wearing visitor, the spoiler, the pompous
                        wolf, de- parted for Pithom last night, hastily summoned thither by a royal
                        message. But the commander returns to- morrow at sunset. This morning, every
                        tenth Hebrew in Pa-Ramesu is to be chosen and sent to the quarries. Atsu
                        will send thee and me, whether we fall among the tens of a truth or not. So
                        we get out of the city ere Merenra returns. He called the ruse a cruel one
                        and not wholly safe, but he would sooner see thee dead than despoiled by
                        this guest of Merenra&apos;s—or any other. I doubt not his heart
                        breaketh for thy sake, Rachel, and he would rend himself to spare
                        thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Lord God bless him,&quot; the girl murmured ear-
                        nestly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where dost thou say we go?&quot; she asked after a little
                        silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To the quarries of Masaarah, opposite Memphis.&quot; The color
                        in the young Israelite&apos;s face receded a little.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To the quarries,&quot; she repeated in a half-whisper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fearest thou?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, not for myself, at all, but we may not have another Atsu over
                        us there. I fear for thee, Deborah.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old woman waved her hands.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Trouble not concerning me. I shall not die by heavy
                        labor.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-017" n="9"/>
                    <p>But the girl shook her head and gazed out of the low enftiance of the tent.
                        Her face was full of trouble. Once again the old woman looked at her with
                        suspi- cion in her eyes. Presently the girl asked, coloring painfully:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was Atsu commanded to hold me for this guest of
                        Merenra&apos;s-ah!&quot; she broke off, &quot;did Atsu name
                        him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not by the titles by which the man would as lief be
                        known,&quot; Deborah answered grimly, &quot;but I remember he called
                        him &apos;the governor.&apos; &quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a brief pause.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so,&quot; she resumed, answering Rachel&apos;s first
                        question. &quot;Atsu but overheard him say to Merenra to see to it that
                        thou wast taken from toil and made ready to journey with him to
                        Bubastis.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He can not take me by right save by a document of gift from
                        tJ&amp; Pharaoh,&quot; Rachel protested indig- nantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth,&quot; the old woman admitted; &quot;but Merenra
                        is chief commander over Pa-Ramesu and how shall thine appeal to the Pharaoh
                        pass beyond Merenra if he see fit to humor this ravening lord with a breach
                        of the law? The message summoning him in haste to Pithom before the order
                        could be fulfilled was allthat saved thee. And if Merenra return ere thou
                        art safely gone, thou art of a surety undone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel moved away a little and stood thinking. The old woman went on with a
                        note of despondency in her voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Alas, Rachel! thou art in eternal peril because of thy lovely face.
                        Beauty is a curse to a bondwoman. What I beheld in truth yesterday I have
                        seen in <pb id="VAA3882-018" n="10"/> dreams—the discourteous hand put forth
                        to seize thee and the power back of it to enforce its demand. And yet, I
                        would not wish thee old and uncomely, for that, too, is a curse to the
                        bondwoman,&quot; she added with a reflective shrug of the shoulders.</p>
                    <p> &quot;If I but knew his name—&quot; Rachel pondered aloud.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What matter?&quot; the old woman answered almost roughly.
                        &quot;Suffice it to know that he is a knave and a noble and hath evil in
                        his heart against thee.&apos;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, if I might dye my hair or stain my face—&quot; Rachel
                        began after a pause.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou foolish child! It would not wear, nor hide thy charm at
                        all!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I dread the quarries for thee, Deborah. If only we might be
                        hidden here, somewhere.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, dost thou want to marry Atsu?&quot; the old woman
                        demanded harshly.</p>
                    <p>The girl turned toward her, her face flushed with resentment.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay! And that thou knowest. For this very mingling with Egypt is
                        Israel cursed. The idolatrous have reached out their hands in marriage and
                        wedded the Hebrews away from the God of Abraham. When did an Egyptian desert
                        his gods for the faith of the Hebrew he took in marriage? Not at any time.
                        Therefore have we fed the shrines of the idols and in- creased the numbers
                        of the idolaters and behold, the hosts of Jehovah have dwindled to naught.
                        There- fore is He wroth with us, and justly. For are there not pitiful
                        shrines to Ra, Ptah and Amen within the boundaries of Goshen? Nay, I wed not
                        with an idola-. ter,&quot; she concluded firmly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-019" n="11"/>
                    <p>Deborah&apos;s wrinkled face lighted, and she put a ten- der arm about
                        the girl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth, then, it is for me that thou wouldst&quot; avoid
                        the quarries,&quot; she said. &quot;I did but try thee,
                        Rachel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel looked at her reproachfully, but the old woman smiled and drew her out
                        into the open.</p>
                    <p>Without, Israel of Pa-Ramesu made ready to sur- render a tenth of her number
                        to the newest task laid on it by the Pharaoh. Quarrying was unusual labor
                        for an Israelite and the name carried terror with it. Long had it meant
                        heavy punishment for the malefac- tor and now was the Hebrew to take up its
                        bitter life. The hard form of oppression following so closely upon the
                        promise of liberty by Moses had diversified effects upon the camp. There was
                        rebellion among the optimists, and the less hopeful spirits were crushed.
                        There was the scoffer, who exasperates; the enthusi- ast, the over-buoyant,
                        who could point out favorable omens even in this bitter affliction; and it
                        could not be divined which of,these troubled the people more. But whatever
                        the individual temper, the entire camp was overhung with distress.</p>
                    <p>Israel had gathered in families before her tents— the mothers hovering their
                        broods, the fathers tramp- ing uneasily about them. In the heart of each,
                        per- haps, was an indefinable conviction that he should fall among the tens.
                        Since Israel had died in droves by hard labor in they brick-fields and along
                        the road- ways and canals, in what numbers and with what dire speed would
                        not Israel perish in the dreaded stone- pits!</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-020" n="12"/>
                    <p>Just outside the doorway of their shelter, Deborah and Rachel overlooked the
                        troubled camp.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Moses comes in time,&quot; Rachel said, speaking in a low tone,
                        &quot;for Israel is in sore straits. The hand of the oppressor assaileth
                        with fury his bones and his sinews now. How shall it be with him if he is
                        be- queathed from Pharaoh to Pharaoh of an intent like unto the last three?
                        He shall have perished from the face of the earth, for the Hebrew bends not;
                        he breaks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Deborah did not answer at once. Her sunken eyes were set and she seemed not
                        to hear. But presently she spoke:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast said. But the Hebrew droppeth out of the inheritance of
                        the Pharaohs in thy generation, Rachel. The end of the bondage is at hand.
                        Thou shalt see it. Of a truth Israel shall perish, if its af- flictions
                        increase for long. But they shall not continue. Have we entered Canaan as
                        God sware unto Abraham we should? Have we possessed the gates of our ene-
                        mies? Shall He stamp us out, with His promise yet unfulfilled? Behold, we
                        have gone astray from Him, but not utterly, as all the other peoples of the
                        earth. For centuries, amid-the great clamor of prayers to the hollow gods,
                        there arose only from this compound of slaves, here, a call to Him. Out of
                        the reek of idola- trous savors, drifted up now and again the straight col-
                        umn from the altar of a Hebrew, sacrificing to the One God. Where, indeed,
                        are any faithful, save in Israel? Shall He condemn us who only have held
                        steadfast? Nay! He hath but permitted the oppres- sion that we may have our
                        fill of the glories of Egypt <pb id="VAA3882-021" n="13"/> and be glad to
                        turn our backs upon her. He will cure us of idols by showing forth their
                        helplessness when they are cried unto; and when Israel is in its most
                        grievous strait and therefore most prone to attach itself to whosoever
                        helpeth it, He will prove Him- self at last by His power. Aye, thou hast
                        said. Israel can suffer little more without perishing. Therefore is
                        redemption at hand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel had turned her eyes away from the humilia- tion of Israel to its
                        exaltation—from fact to prophecy. She was looking with awed face at Deborah.
                        The prophetess went on:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Israel hath been a green tree, carried hither in seed and grown in
                        the wheat-fields of Mizraim. The herds and the flocks of the Pharaoh
                        gathered under its branches and were sheltered from the sun by day and from
                        the wolves by night. The early Pharaohs loved it, the later Pharaohs used it
                        and the last Phara- ohs feared it. For it grew exceedingly and overshad-
                        owed the wheat-fields and they said: &apos;It will come be- tween us and
                        Ra who is our god and he will bless it instead of the wheat. Let us cut it
                        down and build us temples of its timber.&apos; But the Lord had planted
                        the tree in seed and in its youth it grew under the tendance of the
                        Lord&apos;s hand. And in later years, though it lent its shadow as a
                        grove for the idols and temples of gods, the most of it faced Heaven, and
                        for that the Lord loves it still. The Pharaohs have lopped its branches,
                        unmolested, but lo! now that the ax strikes at its girth, the Lord will
                        uproot it and plant it elsewhere than in Mizraim. But the soil will not
                        relinquish it readily, for it hath struck deep. There <pb id="VAA3882-022"
                            n="14"/> shall be a gaping wound in Mizraim where it stood and all the
                        land shall be rent with the violence of the parting.&quot;</p>
                    <p> The prophetess paused, or rather her voice died away as if she actually
                        beheld the scene she foretold, and no more words were needed to make it
                        plain.</p>
                    <p>Rachel&apos;s hands were clasped before her breast.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sayest thou these things in prophecy?&quot; she asked finally
                        in an eager half-whisper. Deborah&apos;s eyes seemed to awaken. She
                        looked at Rachel a moment and answered with a nod. The girl&apos;s
                        vision wandered slowly again toward the camp, and the sorrowful un- rest of
                        Israel subdued the inspired elation that had begun to possess her. Her face
                        clouded once more. Deborah touched her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Trouble not thyself concerning these people. They go forth to
                        labor, but their burdens shall be lightened ere long. As for thee and
                        me—&quot; she paused and looked up toward the eminence on which the
                        military headquarters were built.</p>
                    <p>&quot;As for thee and me—&quot; Rachel urged her. Deborah motioned in
                        the direction she gazed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, let us make ready,&quot; she said; &quot;they are be-
                        gitining.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian masters over Israel of Pa-Ramesu were emerging from the
                        quarters. They were, almost uniformly, tall, slender and immature in figure.
                        Dressed in the foot-soldier&apos;s tunic and coif, they looked like
                        long-limbed youths compared with the powerful manhood of the sons of
                        Abraham.</p>
                    <p>Among them, in white wool and enameled aprons, was a number of scribes,
                        without whom the official <pb id="VAA3882-023" n="15"/> machinery of Egypt
                        would have stilled in a single revolution.</p>
                    <p>The men advanced, sauntering, talking with one an- other idly, as if awaiting
                        authority to proceed. .</p>
                    <p>That came, presently, in the shape of an Egyptian charioteer. The vehicle was
                        heavy, short-poled, set low on two broad wheels of six spokes, and built of
                        hard wood, painted in wedge-shaped stripes of green and red. The end was
                        open, the front high and curved, the side fitted with a boot of woven reeds
                        for the ax and javelins of the warrior. Axle and pole were shod with spikes
                        of copper and the joints were secured with tongues of bronze. The horses
                        were bay, small, short, glossy and long of mane and tail. The harness was
                        simple, each piece as broad as a man&apos;s arm, stamped and richly
                        stained with many colors.</p>
                    <p>The man was an ideal soldier of Egypt. He was tall and broad-shouldered, but
                        otherwise lean and lithe. In countenance, he was dark,-browner than most
                        Egyptians, but with that peculiar ruddy-swarthi- ness that is never the
                        negro hue. His duskiness was accentuated by low and intensely black brows,
                        and deep-set, heavy-lidded eyes. Although his features were marked by the
                        delicacy characteristic of the Egyptian face, there was none of the Oriental
                        affa- bility to be found thereon. One might expect deeds of him, but never
                        words or wit.</p>
                    <p>He wore the Egyptian smock, or kamis-of dark linen, open in front from belt
                        to hem, disclosing a kilt or shenti of clouded enamel. His head-dress was
                        the kerchief of linen, bound tightly across the forehead and falling with
                        free-flowing skirts to the shoulders. <pb id="VAA3882-024" n="16"/> The
                        sleeves left off at the elbow and his lower arms were clasped with bracelets
                        of ivory and gold. His ankles were similarly adorned, and his sandals of ga-
                        zelle-hide were beaded and stitched. His was a somber and barbaric presence.
                        This was Atsu, captain of char- iots and vice-commander over Pa-Ramesu.</p>
                    <p> His subordinates parted and gave him respectful path. He delivered his
                        orders in an impassive, low- pitched monotone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Out with them, and mark ye, no lashes now. Leave the old and the
                        nursing mothers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The drivers disappeared into the narrow ways of the encampment, and Atsu,
                        with the scribes at his wheels, drove out where the avenue of sphinxes would
                        have led to the temple of Imhotep. Here was room for three thousand. He
                        alighted and, with the scribes who stood, tablets in hand, awaited the
                        coming of the Israelites.</p>
                    <p>The camp emptied its dwellers in long wavering lines. Into the open they
                        came, slowly, and with downcast eyes, each with his remnant of a tribe.
                        Though the columns were in order, they were ragged with many and varied
                        statures—now a grown man, next to him a child, and then a woman. Here were
                        the red-bearded sons of Reuben, shepherds in skins and men of great
                        hardihood; the seafaring children of Zebulon; a handful of submissive
                        Issachar, and some of Benjamin, Levi, and Judah.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do we not leave the aged behind?&quot; the scribe asked,
                        indicating Deborah who came with Judah.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give her her way,&quot; Atsu replied indifferently, and the
                        scribe subsided.</p>
                    <p>The lines advanced, filling up the open with moody <pb id="VAA3882-025"
                            n="17"/> humanity. A scribe placed himself at the head of each column,
                        and as the hindmost Israelite emerged into the field the movement was
                        halted.</p>
                    <p>If an eye was lifted, it shifted rapidly under the stress of desperation or
                        suspense. If any spoke, it was the rough and indifferent, whose words fell
                        like blows on the distressed silence. Many were visibly trembling, others
                        had whitened beneath the tropical tan, and the wondering faces of children,
                        who feared without understanding, turned now and again to search for their
                        elders up and down the lines.</p>
                    <p>The drivers distributed themselves among the Israel- ites and each with a
                        scribe went methodically along the files choosing every tenth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Get thee to my house and bring me my lists,&quot; Atsu said to
                        the soldier who was beginning on Judah. &quot;I will look to thy
                        work.&quot; The man crossed his left hand to his right shoulder and
                        hastened away.</p>
                    <p>One by one nine Israelites dropped out of line as Atsu numbered them and
                        returned to camp. He touched the tenth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Name?&quot; the scribe asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Deborah,&quot; was the reply.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile Atsu walked rapidly down the line to Rachel. The Hebrews fell out
                        as he passed, and the relief on the faces of one or two was mingled with
                        astonishment. He paused before the girl, hesitating. Words did not rise
                        readily to his lips at any time; at this moment he was especially at
                        loss.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou canst abide here, in perfect security—with me,&quot; he
                        said at last. She shook her head. &quot;I thank thee, my good
                        master.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;For thy sake, not mine own, I would urge thee,&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA3882-026" n="18"/> he continued with an unnatural steadiness.
                        &quot;Thou canst accept of me the safety of marriage. Nothing more shall
                        I offer—or demand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The color rushed over the girl&apos;s face, but he went on evenly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A part go to Silsilis, another to Syene, a third to Masaarah. If
                        thine insulter asks concerning thy whereabouts I shall not trouble myself to
                        remember. But what shall keep him from searching for thee— and are there any
                        like to defend thee, if he find thee, seeing I am not there? And even if
                        thou art securely hidden, thou hast never dreamed how heavy is the life of
                        the stone-pits, Rachel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Keep Deborah here,&quot; the girl besought him, dis- tressed.
                        &quot;She is old and will perish-&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I will not send thee out alone,&quot; was the reply.
                        &quot;If thou goest, so must she. But-hast thou no fear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Once again she shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I trust to the triumph of the good,&quot; she replied
                        earnestly.</p>
                    <p>The sound of the scribe&apos;s approach behind him, moved him on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Farewell,&quot; he said as he went, and added no more, for his
                        composure failed him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The grace of the Lord God attend thee,&quot; she whis- pered.
                        &quot;Farewell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>All the morning the work went on, and when the Egyptian mid-winter noon lay
                        warm on the flat coun- try, three hundred Israelites were ready for the long
                        march to the Nile. They left behind them a camp oppressed with that
                        heart-soreness, which affliction S added to old afflictions brings,-the numb
                        ache of sor- row, not its lively pain. Only Deborah, the childless, <pb
                            id="VAA3882-027" n="19"/> and Rachel, the motherless, went with lighter
                        hearts, —if hearts can be light that go forward to meet the unknown fortunes
                        of bond-people.</p>
                    <p>As they moved out, one of the older Hebrews in the forward ranks began to
                        sing, in a wild recitative chant, of Canaan and the freedom of Israel. The
                        elders in the line near him took it up and every face in the long column
                        lighted and was lifted in silent concord with the singers. Atsu in his
                        chariot, close by, scanned his lists absorbedly, but one of the drivers
                        hurried forward with a demand for silence. A young Hebrew, who had tramped
                        in agitated silence just ahead, worked up into recklessness by the fervor of
                        the singers, de- fled him. His voice rang clear above the song.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go to, thou bald-faced idolater! Israel will cease to do thy
                        bidding one near day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The driver forced his way into the front ranks and began to lay about him
                        with his knout. Instantly he was cast forth by a dozen brawny arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mutiny!&quot; he bawled.</p>
                    <p>A group of drivers reinforced him at once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By Bast,&quot; the foremost cried, as he came running
                        &quot;The sedition of the renegade, Mesu,<ref id="ref_A" target="note_A"
                            >*</ref> bears early fruit!&quot;</p>
                    <p>But the spirit of rebellion became contagious and the men of Israel began to
                        throw themselves out of line. At this moment, Atsu seemed to become con-
                        scious of the riot and drove his horses between the combatants.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Into ranks with you!&quot; he commanded, pressing forward upon
                        the Hebrews. The men obeyed sullenly.</p>
                    <note id="note_A" place="foot" anchored="yes"><ref target="ref_A"
                        >*</ref>―Moses.</note>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-028" n="20"/>
                    <p>&quot;I have said there was to be no use of the knouts,&quot; he said
                        sharply, turning upon the drivers. &quot;Forward with
                        them!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The first driver muttered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What sayest thou?&quot; Atsu demanded.</p>
                    <p>The man&apos;s mouth opened and closed, and his eyes drew up, evilly, but
                        he made no answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Forward with them,&quot; Atsu repeated, without re- moving his
                        gaze from the driver.</p>
                    <p>Slowly, and now silently, the hereditary slaves of the Pharaoh moved out of
                        Pa-Ramesu. And of all the departing numbers and of all that remained be-
                        hind, none was more stricken in heart than Atsu, the stern taskmaster over
                        Israel.</p>

                    <p>Holy Memphis, city of Apis, habitat of Ptah!</p>
                    <p>Not idly was she called Menefer, the Good Place. Not anywhere in Egypt were
                        the winds more gentle, the heavens more benign, the environs more
                        august.</p>
                    <p>To the south and west of her, the Libyan hills notched the horizon. To the
                        east the bald summits of the Arabian desert cut off the traveling sand in
                        its march on the capital. To the north was a shimmer- ing level that
                        stretched unbrokento the sea. Set upon this at mid-distance, the pyramids
                        uplifted their stu- pendous forms. In the afternoon they assumed the blue of
                        the atmosphere and appeared indistinct, but in the morning the polished
                        sides that faced the east reflected the sun&apos;s rays in dazzling
                        sheets across the valley.</p>
                    <p>Out of a crevice between the heights to the south the broad blue Nile rolled,
                        sweeping past one hundred and twenty stadia or sixteen miles of urban
                        magnifi- cence, and lost itself in the shimmering sky-line to the north.</p>
                    <p>The city was walled on the north, west, and south, and its river-front was
                        protected by a mighty dike, built by Menes, the first king of the first
                        dynasty in <pb id="VAA3882-030" n="22"/> the hour of chronological daybreak.
                        Within were orderly squares, cross-cut by avenues and relieved from monotony
                        by scattered mosaics of groves. Out of these shady demesnes rose the great
                        white temples of Ptah and Apis, and the palaces of the various Memphian
                        Pharaohs.</p>
                    <p>About these, the bazaars and residences, facade above facade, and tier upon
                        tier, as the land sloped up to its center, shone fair and white under a
                        cloudless sun.</p>
                    <p>Memphis was at the pinnacle of her greatness in the sixth year of the reign
                        of the divine Meneptah. She had fortified herself and resisted the great
                        inva- sion of the Rebu. Her generals had done battle with him and brought
                        him home, chained to their chariots. And after the festivities in
                        celebration of her prow- ess, she laid down pike and falchion, bull-hide
                        shield and helmet, and took up the chisel and brush, the spindle and loom
                        once more.</p>
                    <p>The heavy drowsiness of a mid-winter noon had depopulated her booths and
                        bazaars and quieted the quaint traffic of her squares. In the shadows of the
                        city her porters drowsed, and from the continuous wall of houses blankly
                        facing one another from either side of the streets, there came no sound.
                        Each house- hold sought the breezes on the balconies that galleried the
                        inner walls of the courts, or upon the pillared and canopied housetops.</p>
                    <p>Memphis had eaten and drunk and, sheltered behind her screens, waited for the
                        noon to pass.</p>
                    <p>Mentu, the king&apos;s sculptor, however, had not availed himself of the
                        hour of ease. He did not labor because he must, for his house stood in the
                        aristocratic portion <pb id="VAA3882-031" n="23"/> of Memphis, and it was
                        storied, galleried, screened ad topped with its breezy pavilion. Within the
                        hollow space, formed by the right and left wings of his house, the chamber
                        of guests to the front, and the property wall to the rear, was a court of
                        uncommon beauty. Palm and tamarisk, acacia and rose-shrub, jasmine and
                        purple mimosa made a multi-tinted jungle about a shadowy pool in which a
                        white heron stood knee- deep. There were long stretches of sunlit sod, and
                        walks of inlaid tile, seats of carved stone, and a single small obelisk, set
                        on a circular slab, marked with measures for time—the Egyptian sun-dial. On
                        every side were evidences of wealth and luxury.</p>
                    <p>So Mentu labored because he loved to toil. In a land languorous with tropical
                        inertia, an enthusiastic toiler is not common. For this reason, Mentu was
                        worth particular attention. He towered a palm in height over his Egyptian
                        brethren, and his massive frame was entirely in keeping with his majestic
                        stat- ure. He was nearly fifty years of age, but no sign of the early decay
                        of the Oriental was apparent in him. His was the characteristic refinement
                        of feature that marks the Egyptian countenance, further accentuated by
                        self-content and some hauteur. The idea of dignity was carried out in his
                        dress. The kilt was not visible, for the kamis had become a robe,
                        long-sleeved, high- necked and belted with a broad band of linen, encom-
                        passing the body twice, before it was fastened with a fibula of massive
                        gold.</p>
                    <p>That he was an artisan noble was another peculiarity, but it was proof of
                        exceptional merit. He had de- scended from a long line of royal sculptors,
                        heighten- ing in genius in the last three. His grandsire had <pb
                            id="VAA3882-032" n="24"/> elaborated Karnak; his father had decorated
                        the- Rameseum, but Mentu had surpassed the glory of his ancestors. In the
                        years of his youth, side by side with the great Rameses, he had planned and
                        brought to perfection the mightiest monument to Egyptian sculp- ture, the
                        rock-carved temple of Ipsambul. In recog- nition of this he had been given
                        to wife a daughter of the Pharaoh and raised to a rank never before occupied
                        by a king&apos;s sculptor. He was second only to the fan-bearers, the
                        most powerful nobles of the realm, and at par with the murket, or royal
                        architect, who was usually chosen from among the princes. And yet he had but
                        come again to his own when he entered the ranks of peerage. In the long line
                        of his ancestors he counted a king, and from that royal sire he had his
                        stature.</p>
                    <p>He sat before atable covered with tools of his craft, rolls of papyrus, pens
                        of reeds, pots of ink of various colors, horns of oil, molds and clay images
                        and ves- sels of paint. Hanging upon pegs in the wooden walls of his
                        work-room were saws and the heavier drills, chisels of bronze and mauls of
                        tamarisk, sus- pended by thongs of deer-hide.</p>
                    <p>The sculptor, rapidly and without effort, worked out with his pen on a sheet
                        of papyrus the detail of a frieze. Tiny profile figures, quaint borders of
                        lotus and mystic inscriptions trailed after the swift reed in multitudinous
                        and bewildering succession. As he worked, a young man entered the doorway
                        from the court and, advancing a few steps toward the table, watched the
                        development of the drawings with inter- est.</p>
                    <p>Those were the days of early maturity and short life. <pb id="VAA3882-033"
                            n="25"/> The Egyptian of the Exodus often married at sixteen, and was
                        full of years and ready to be gathered to Osiris at fifty-five or sixty. The
                        great Rameses lived to the unheard-of age of seventy-seven, having occu-
                        pied the throne since his eleventh year.</p>
                    <p>This young Egyptian, nearly eighteen, was grown and powerful with the might
                        of mature manhood. A glance at the pair at once established their relation-
                        ship as father and son. The features were strikingly similar, the stature
                        the same, though the young frame was supple and light, not massive.</p>
                    <p>The hair was straight, abundant, brilliant black and cropped midway down the
                        neck and just above the brows. There was no effort at parting. It was
                        dressed from the crown of the head as each hair would naturally lie and was
                        confined by a circlet of gold, the token of the royal blood of his
                        mother&apos;s house. The complexion was the hue of a healthy tan,
                        different, however, from the brown of exposure in that it was transparent
                        and the red in the cheek was dusky. The face was the classic type of the
                        race, for be it known there were two physiognomies character- istic of
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The forehead was broad, the brows long and deli- cately penciled, the eyes
                        softly black, very long, the lids heavy enough to suggest serenity rather
                        than lan- guor. The nose was of good length, aquiline, the nostril thin and
                        sharply chiseled. The cut of the south and the warmth of its color gave
                        seriousness, sensitiveness and youthful tenderness to the face.</p>
                    <p>Egypt was seldom athletic. Though running and wrestling figured much in the
                        pastime of youths, the nation was languid and soft. However, Seti the Elder
                            <pb id="VAA3882-034" n="26"/> demanded the severest physical exercise of
                        his sons, and Rameses II, who succeeded him, made muscle and brawn popular
                        by example, during his reign. Here, then, was an instance of king-mimicking
                        that was ad- mirable.</p>
                    <p>Originally the young man had been gifted with breadth of shoulder, depth of
                        chest, health and vigor. He would have been strong had he never vaulted a
                        pole or run a mile. To these advantages were added the results of wise and
                        thorough training, so wise, so thorough, that defects in the national
                        physique had been remedied. Thus, the calves were stanch and Prominent,
                        whereas ancient Egypt was as flat-legged as the negro; the body was round
                        and tapered with proper athletic rapidity from shoulder to heel, with- out
                        any sign of the lank attenuation that was char- acteristic of most of his
                        countrymen.</p>
                    <p>The suggestion of his presence was power and bigness, not the good-natured
                        size that is hulking and awkward, but bigness that is elegant and
                        fine-fibered and ages into magnificence.</p>
                    <p>He wore a tunic of white linen, the finely plaited skirt reaching almost to
                        the knees. The belt was of leather, three fingers in breadth and ornamented
                        with metal pieces, small, round and polished. His sandals were of white
                        gazelle-hide, stitched with gold, and, by way of ornament, he had but a
                        single armlet, and a collar, consisting of ten golden rings, depending by
                        eyelets from a flexible band of the same material. The metal was unpolished
                        and its lack-luster red harmon- ized wonderfully with the bronze throat it
                        clasped.</p>
                    <p>Diminutive Isis in profile had emerged part-way from the background of
                        papyrus, and the sculptor lifted <pb id="VAA3882-035" n="27"/> his pen to
                        sketch in the farther shoulder as the law re- quired. The young man leaned
                        forward and watched. But as the addition was made, giving to the otherwise
                        shapely little goddess an uncomfortable but thoroughly orthodox twist, he
                        frowned slightly. After a mo- ment&apos;s silence he came to the
                        bench.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou caught some great idea on the wing or hast thou the round
                        of actual labor to perform?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>His attention thus hailed, the sculptor raised him- self and answered:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Meneptah hath a temple to Set<ref id="ref_B" target="note_B"
                            >*</ref> in mind; indeed he hath stirred up the quarries for the stone,
                        I am told, and I am making ready, for I shall be needed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The older a civilization, the smoother its speech. Age refines the vowels and
                        makes the consonants suave. They spoke easily, not hastily, but as oil
                        flows, continuously and without ripple. The younger voice was deep, soft
                        enough to have been wooing and as musical as a chant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would that the work were as probable as thou art hopeful,&quot;
                        the young man said with a sigh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Out upon thee, idler!&quot; was the warm reply. &quot;Art
                        thou come to vex me with thy doubts and scout thy sovereign&apos;s pious
                        intentions?&quot; The young man smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hath the sun shone on architecture or sculpture since Meneptah
                        succeeded to the throne?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>Mentu&apos;s eyes brightened wrathfully but the young man laid a soothing
                        palm over the hand that gripped the reed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not mock thee, father. Rather am I full of <note id="note_B"
                            place="foot" anchored="yes"><ref target="ref_B">*</ref>Set-the

                        <pb id="VAA3882-036" n="28"/> sympathy for thee. Thou mindest me of a
                        war-horse, stabled, with his battle-love unsatisfied, hearing in every
                        whimper of the wind a trumpet call. Nay, I would to Osiris that the
                        Pharaoh&apos;s intents were per- manent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Somewhat mollified, Mentu put away the detaining hand and went on with his
                        work. Presently the young man spoke again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I came to speak further of the signet,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, but what signet, Kenkenes?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;The signet of the Incomparable Pharaoh.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What! after three years?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The sanctuary of the tomb is never entered and it is more than
                        worth the journey to Tape<ref id="ref_C" target="note_C">*</ref> to search
                        for the scarab again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you would search in vain,&quot; the sculptor de- clared.
                        &quot;Rameses has reclaimed his own.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes shifted his position and protested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But we made no great search for it. How may we know of a surety if
                        it be gone?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because of thy sacrilege,&quot; was the prompt and forcible
                        reply. &quot;Osiris with chin in hand and a look of imystification on
                        his brow, pondering over the mis- deeds of a soul! Mystification on Osiris!
                        And with that, thou didst affront the sacred walls of the royal tomb and
                        call it the Judgment of the Dead. Not one law of the sculptor&apos;s
                        ritual but thou hadst broken, in the sacrilegious fresco. Gods! I marvel
                        that the rock did not crumble under the first bite of thy
                        chisel!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mentu fell to his work again. While he talked a small ape entered the room
                        and, discovering the paint- <note id="note_C" place="foot" anchored="yes"
                                ><ref target="ref_C">*</ref>―Thebes</note>. <pb id="VAA3882-037"
                            n="29"/> pots, proceed to decorate his person with a liberal hand. At
                        this moment Kenkenes became aware of him and, by an accurately aimed lump of
                        clay, drove the meddler out with a show of more asperity than the offense
                        would ordinarily excite. Meanwhile the sculp- tor wetted his pen and,
                        poising it over the plans, re- garded his drawings with half-closed
                        eyes.&quot; Then, as if he read his words on the papyrus he
                        proceeded:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou wast not ignorant. All thy life hast thou had the decorous
                        laws of the ritual before thee. And there, in the holy precincts of the
                        Incomparable Pharaoh&apos;s tomb, with the opportunity of a lifetime at
                        hand, the skill of thy fathers in thy fingers, thou didst execute an impious
                        whim,-an unheard-of apos- tasy.&quot; He broke off suddenly, changing
                        his tone, &quot;What if the priesthood had learned of the deed? The
                        Hathors be praised that they did not and that no heav- ier punishment than
                        the loss of the signet is ours.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But it may have caught on thy chisel and broken from its fastening.
                        Thou dost remember that the floor was checkered with deep black
                        shadows.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The hand of the insulted Pharaoh reached out of Amenti<ref
                            id="ref_D" target="note_D">*</ref> and stripped it off my
                        neck,&quot; Mentu replied sternly. &quot;And consider what I and all
                        of mine who come after me lost in that foolish act of thine. It was a token
                        of special favor from Rameses, a mark of appreciation of mine art, and, more
                        than all, a signet that I or mine might present to him or his successor and
                        win royal good will thereby.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That I know right well,&quot; Kenkenes interrupted with <note
                            id="note_D" place="foot" anchored="yes"><ref target="ref_D"
                            >*</ref>Amenti―The realm of Death</note>
                        <pb id="VAA3882-038" n="30"/> an anxious note in his voice, &quot;and
                        for that reason am I possessed to go after it to Tape.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The sculptor lifted a stern face to his son and said, with emphasis:
                        &quot;Wilt thou further offend the gods, thou impious? It is not there,
                        and vex me no further concerning it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes lifted one of his brows with an air of en- forced patience, and
                        sauntered across the room to another table similarly equipped for
                        plan-making. But he did not concern himself with the papyrus spread thereon.
                        Instead he dropped on the bench, and crossing his shapely feet before him,
                        gazed straight up at the date-tree rafters and palm-leaf in- terbraiding of
                        the ceiling.</p>
                    <p>Though the law of heredity is not trustworthy in the transmission of
                        greatness, Kenkenes was the product of three generations of heroic genius.
                        He might have , developed the frequent example of decadence; he might have
                        sustained the excellence of his fathers&apos; gift, but he could not
                        surpass them in the methods of their shool of sculpture and its results.
                        There was one way in which he might excel, and he was born with his feet in
                        that path. His genius was too large for the limits of his era. Therefore he
                        was an artistic dissenter, a reformer with noble ideals.</p>
                    <p>Mimetic art as applied to Egyptian painting and sculpture was a curious
                        misnomer. Probably no other nation of the world at that time was so devoted
                        to it, and certainly no other people of equal advancement of that or any
                        other time so wilfully ignored the simplest rules of proportion, perspective
                        and form. The sculptor&apos;s ability to suggest majesty and repose, and
                        at the same time ignore anatomical construction, <pb id="VAA3882-039" n="31"
                        /> was wonderful. To preserve the features and indivi- dual characteristics
                        of a model and obey the rules of convention was a feat to be achieved only
                        by an Egyptian. There was no lack of genius in him, but he had been denied
                        liberty of execution until he knew no other forms but those his fathers
                        followed genera- tions before.</p>
                    <p>All Egypt was but a padding that the structural framework of religion
                        supported. Science, art, litera- ture, government, commerce, whatever the
                        member, it was built upon a bone of religion. The processes and uses of
                        sculpture were controlled by the sculptor&apos;s ritual and woe unto him
                        who departed therefrom in depicting the gods! The deed was sacrilege.</p>
                    <p>In the portrait-forms the limits were less severely drawn. There were a dozen
                        permissible attitudes, and the characteristic features might be represented
                        with all fidelity; but there were boundaries that might not be overstepped.
                        The result was an artistic perver- sion that well-nigh perpetrated a
                        grotestque slander on the personal appearance of the race.</p>
                    <p>After the manner of Egyptians it was understood that Kenkenes was to follow
                        his father&apos;s calling, and ahead of him were years of labor laid in
                        narrow lines. [When] he rebelled, he incurred infinite difficulty and oppo-
                        sition, and yet he could not wholly submit. He had been an apt and able
                        pupil during the long process of his instruction, but when the moment of
                        actual prac- tice of his art arrived, he had rebelled. His first work had
                        been his last and, in the estimation of his father, had entailed a grievous
                        loss. Thereafter he had been limited to copying hte great
                        sculptor&apos;s plans, the work of scribes and underlings.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-040" n="32"/>
                    <p>Thus, he had passed three years that chafed him because of their comparative
                        idleness and their implied rebuke. The pressure finally became too great,
                        and he began to weigh the matter of compromise. If he could secretly satisfy
                        his own sense of the beautiful he might follow the ritual with grace.</p>
                    <p>His cogitations, as he sat before his table, assumed form and purpose.</p>
                    <p>Presently Mentu, raising his head, noted that the shadows were falling aslant
                        the court. With an in- terested but inarticulate remark, he dropped his pen
                        among its fellows in an earthenware tray, his plans into an open chest, and
                        went out across the court, entering an opposite door.</p>
                    <p>With his father&apos;s exit, Kenkenes shifted his position, and the
                        expression of deep thought grew on his face. After a long interval of
                        motionless absorption he sprang to his feet and, catching a wallet of
                        stamped and dyed leather from the wall, spread it open on the table. Chisel,
                        mallet, tape and knife, he put into it, and dropped the wallet and all into
                        a box near-by at the sound of the sculptor&apos;s footsteps.</p>
                    <p>The great artist reentered in court robes of crea[sed] linen, stiff with
                        embroidery and gold stitching.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Har-hat passes through Memphis to-day on his way to Tape, where he
                        is to be installed as bearer of the king&apos;s fan on the right hand.
                        He is at the palace, and nobles of hte city go thither to wait upon
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The King was not long in choosing a successor to the lamented
                        Amset,&quot; Kenkenes observed. &quot;Har-hat vaults loftily from
                        the nomarchship of Bubastis to an advisership to the Pharaoh.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rather hath his ascent been slower than his deserts. <pb
                            id="VAA3882-041" n="33"/> How had the Rebu war ended had it not been for
                        Har-hat? He is a great warrior, hath won honor for Egypt and for Meneptah.
                        The army would follow him into the jaws of Tuat,<ref id="ref_E"
                            target="note_E">*</ref> and Rameses, the heir, need never take up arms,
                        so long as Har-hat com- mands the legions of Egypt. But how the warrior will
                        serve as minister is yet to be seen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who succeeds him over Bubastis?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Merenra, another of the war-tried generals. He hath been commander
                        over Pa-Ramesu. Atsu takes his place over the Israelites.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Atsu?&quot; Kenkenes mused. &quot;I know him
                        not.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;He is a captain of chariots, and won much distinc- tion during the
                        Rebu invasion. He is a native of Meiides.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Left alone, Kenkenes crossed the court to the door his father had entered and
                        emerged later in a street dress of mantle and close-fitting coif. He took up
                        the wallet and quitted the room. Passing through the intramural park and the
                        chamber of guests, he entered the street. It was a narrow, featureless
                        passage, scarcely wide enough to give room for a chariot. The brown dust had
                        more prints of naked than of sandaled feet, for most men of the young
                        sculptor&apos;s rank went abroad in chariots.</p>
                    <p>Once out of the passage, he turned across the city toward the east. Memphis
                        had pushed aside her screens and shaken out her tapestries after the noon
                        rest and was deep in commerce once again. From the low balconies overhead
                        the Damascene carpets swung, lending festivity to the energetic traffic
                        below. The <note id="note_E" place="foot" anchored="yes"><ref target="ref_E"

                        <pb id="VAA3882-042" n="34"/> pillars of stacked ware flanking the fronts of
                        pottery shops were in a constant state of wreckage and re- construction; the
                        stalls of fruiterers perfumed the air with crushed and over-ripe produce;
                        litters with dark- eyed occupants and fan-bearing attendants stood be- fore
                        the doorways of lapidaries and booths of stuffs; venders of images,
                        unguents, trinkets and wines strove to outcry one another or the
                        poulterer&apos;s squawking stall. Kenkenes met frequent obstructions and
                        was forced to reduce his rapid pace. Curricles and char- iots and wicker
                        chairs halted him at many crossings. Carriers took up much of the narrow
                        streets with large burdens; notaries and scribes sat cross-legged on the
                        pavement, surrounded by their patrons and clients, and beggars and
                        fortune-tellers strove for the young man&apos;s attention. The crowd
                        thickened and thinned and grew again; pigeons winnowed fearlessly down to
                        the roadway dust, and a distant yapping of dogs came down the slanting
                        street. At times Kenkenes en- countered whole troops of sacred cats that
                        wandered about the city, monarchs over the monarch himself. By crowding into
                        doorways he allowed these pam- pered felines to pass undisturbed.</p>
                    <p>In the district near the lower edge of the city he met the heavy carts of
                        rustics, laden with cages of geese and crates of produce, moving slowly in
                        from the wide highways of the Memphian nome. The broad backs of the oxen
                        were gray with dust and their drivers were masked in grime.</p>
                    <p>The smell of the river became insistent. In the open stalls the fishmongers
                        had their naked brood keeping the flies away from the stock with leafy
                        branches. The limits of Memphis ended precipitately at a sudden <pb
                            id="VAA3882-043" n="35"/> slope. In the long descent to the Nile there
                        were few permanent structures. Half-way down were great lengths of high
                        platform built upon acacia piling. This was the flood-tide wharf, but it was
                        used now only by loiterers, who lay upon it to bask dog-like in the sun. The
                        long intervening stretch between the builded city and the river waS covered
                        with boats and river-men. Fishers mending nets were grouped together, but
                        they talked with one another as if each were a furlong away from his fellow.
                        Freight bearers, emptying the newly-arrived vessels of cargo, staggered up
                        toward the city. Now and again sledges laden with ponderous burdens were
                        drawn through the sand by yokes of dxen, oftener by scores of men, on whom
                        the drivers did not hesitate to lay the lash.</p>
                    <p>River traffic was carried on far below the flood-tide wharf. Here the long
                        landings of solid masonry, cov- ered with deep water four months of the
                        year, were lined with vessels. Between yard-arms hanging aslant and over
                        decks, glimpses of the Nile might be caught. It rippled passively between
                        its banks, for it was yet seven months before the first showing of the June
                        rise. Here were the frail papyrus bari, constructed like a raft and no more
                        concave than a long bow; the huge cedar-masted cangias, flat-bottomed and
                        slow-moving; the ancient dhow with its shapeless tent- cabin aft; the
                        ponderous cattle barges and freight ves- sels built of rough-hewn logs; the
                        light passenger skiffs; and lastly, the sumptuous pleasure-boats. These were
                        elaborate and beautiful, painted and pan- eled, ornamented with garlands and
                        sheaves of carved lotus, and spread with sails, checkered and embroid- ered
                        in many colors. From these emerged processions <pb id="VAA3882-044" n="36"/>
                        of parties returning from pleasure trips up the Nile. They came with much
                        pomp and following, asserting themselves and proceeding through paths made
                        ready for them by the obsequious laboring classes.</p>
                    <p>Presently there approached a corps of servants, bear- ing bundles of
                        throw-sticks, nets, two or three fox- headed cats, bows and arrows, strings
                        of fish and hampers of fowl. Behind, on the shoulders of four stalwart
                        bearers, came a litter, fluttering with gay- colored hangings. Beside it
                        walked an Egyptian of high class. Suddenly the bearers halted, and a little
                        hand, imperious and literally aflame with jewels, beckoned Kenkenes from the
                        shady interior of the litter.</p>
                    <p>He obeyed promptly. At another command the litter was lowered till the poles
                        were supported in the hands of the bearers. The curtains were withdrawn,
                        reveal- ing the occupant—a woman.</p>
                    <p>This, to the glory of Egypt! Woman was defended, revered, exalted above her
                        sisters of any contemporary nation. No haremic seclusion for her no
                        semi-con- temptuous toleration of her; no austere limits laid upon her uses.
                        She bared her face to the thronging streets; she reveled beside her brother;
                        she worshiped with him; she admitted no subserviency to her lord beyond the
                        pretty deference that it pleased her to pay; she governed his household and
                        his children; she learned, she wrote, she wore the crown. She might have a
                        successor but no supplanter; an Egyptian of the dynas- ties before the
                        Persian dominance could have but one wife at a time; none but kings could be
                        profligate, openly. So, while Babylonia led her maidens to a <pb
                            id="VAA3882-045" n="37"/> market, while Ethiopia ruled hers with a rod,
                        while Arabia numbered hers among her she-camels, Egypt gloried in national
                        chivalry and spiritual love.</p>
                    <p>This was the sentiment of the nation, by the lips of Khu-n-Aten, the artist
                        king:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sweet love fills my heart for the queen; may she ever keep the hand
                        of the Pharaoh.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Whatever Egypt&apos;s mode of worshiping Khem and Isis, nothing could set
                        at naught this clean, impulsive, sincere avowal.</p>
                    <p>Here, then, openly and in perfect propriety was a woman abroad with her
                        suitor.</p>
                    <p>She might have been eighteen years old, but there was nothing girlish in her
                        gorgeous beauty. She was a red rose, full-blown.</p>
                    <p>Her robes were a double thickness of loose-meshed white linen, with a
                        delicate stripe of scarlet; her head- dress a single swathing of scarlet
                        gauze. She wore not one, but many kinds of jewels, and her anklets and
                        armlets tinkled with fringes of cats and hawks in carnelian. Her hair was
                        brilliant black and unbraided. Her complexion was transparent, and the
                        underlying red showed deeply in the small, full-lipped mouth; like a stain
                        in the cheeks; like a flush on the brow, and even faintly on the dainty
                        chin. Her eyes were large and black, with the amorous lid, and lined with
                        kohl beneath the lower lash. Her profile showed the ex- quisite aquiline of
                        the pure-blooded Egyptian.</p>
                    <p>Aside from the visible evidences of charm there was an atmosphere of
                        femininity that permeated her imme- diate vicinity with a witchery little
                        short of enchant- <pb id="VAA3882-046" n="38"/> ment. She was the Lady
                        Ta-meri, daughter of Amen- emhat, nomarch<ref id="ref_F" target="note_F"
                            >*</ref> of Memphis.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian accompanying the litter was nearly thirty years of age. He was
                        an example of the other type of the race, differing from the classic model
                        of Kenkenes. The forehead retreated, the nose was long, low, slightly
                        depressed at the end; the mouth, thick- lipped; the eye, narrow and
                        almond-shaped; the cheek- bones, high; the complexion, dark brown. Still,
                        the great ripeness of lip, aggressive whiteness of teeth and brilliance of
                        eye made his face pleasant. He wore a shenti of yellow, over it a kamis of
                        white linen, a kerchief bound with a yellow cord about his head, and white
                        sandals.</p>
                    <p>He was the nephew of the king&apos;s cup-bearer, who had died without
                        issue at Thebes during the past month. His elder brother had succeeded his
                        father to a high office in the priesthood, but he, Nechutes, was a candidate
                        for the honors of his dead uncle. Kenkenes gave the man a smiling nod and
                        bent over the lady&apos;s fingers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fie!&quot; was her greeting. &quot;Abroad like the rabble,
                        and carrying a burden.&quot; She filliped the wallet with a pink-stained
                        finger-nail.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sit here,&quot; she commanded, patting the cushioned edge of
                        the litter.</p>
                    <p>The sculptor declined the invitation with a smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I go to try some stone,&quot; he explained.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Truly, I believe thou lovest labor,&quot; the lady as- serted
                        accusingly. &quot;Ah, but punishment overtakes thee <note id="note_F"
                            place="foot" anchored="yes">
                            <ref target="ref_F">*</ref> Nomarch―governor of a civil division called

                        <pb id="VAA3882-047" n="39"/> at last. Behold, thou mightst have gone with
                        me to the marshes to-day, but I knew thou wouldst be as deep in labor as a
                        slave. And so I took Nechutes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes shot an amused glance at her companion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would wager my mummy, Nechutes, that this is the first intimation
                        thou hast had that thou wert second choice,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, thou hast said,&quot; Nechutes admitted, his eyes showing
                        a sudden light. He had a voice of profound depth and resonance, that rumbled
                        like the purring of the king&apos;s lions. &quot;And not a moment
                        since she swore that it was I who made her sun to move, and that Tuat itself
                        were sweet so I were there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;O Ma<ref id="ref_G" target="note_G">*</ref>,&quot; the lady
                        cried, threatening him with her fan. &quot;Thou Defender of Truth, smite
                        him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes laughed with delight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, nay, Nechutes!&quot; he cried. &quot;Thou dost betray
                        thyself. Never would Ta-meri have said anything so bald. Now, when she is
                        moved to give me a honeyed fact, she laps it with delicate intimation, layer
                        on layer like a lotus-bud. And only under the warm interpretation of my
                        heart will it unfold and show the gold within.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Nechutes stifled a derisive groan, but the lady&apos;s color swept up
                        over her face and made it like the dawn.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, now,&quot; she protested, &quot;wherein art thou bet-
                        ter than Nechutes, save in the manner of telling thy calumny? But,
                        Kenkenes,&quot; she broke off, &quot;thou art wasted in thy narrow
                        realm. They need thy gallant tongue at court.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The young sculptor made soft eyes at her.</p>

                    <p>&quot;If I were a courtier,&quot; he objected, &quot;I must
                        scatter my small eloquence among many beauties that I would liefer save for
                        one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She appropriated the compliment at once.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou dost not hunger after even that opportunity,&quot; she
                        pouted. &apos;&quot;How long hath it been since the halls of my
                        father&apos;s house knew thy steps? A whole moon!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I feared that I should find Nechutes there,&quot; Ken- kenes
                        explained.</p>
                    <p>During this pretty joust the brows of the prospec- tive cup-bearer had
                        knitted blackly. The scowl was unpropitious.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou mayest come freely now,&quot; he growled. &quot;The
                        way shall be clear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The lady looked at him in mock fear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, Nechutes,&quot; the sculptor implored laughing- ly,
                        &quot;be gracious. Being in highest favor, it behooves thee to be
                        generous.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But the prospective cup-bearer refused to be pla- cated. He rumbled an order
                        to the slaves and they shouldered the litter.</p>
                    <p>Ta-meri made a pretty mouth at him, and turned again to Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, Kenkenes,&quot; she said. &quot;It was mine to say
                        that the way shall be clear—but I promise it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She nodded a bright farewell to him, and they moved away. The sculptor, still
                        smiling, continued down to the river.</p>
                    <p>At the landing he engaged one of the numerous small boats awaiting a
                        passenger, and directed the clout-wearing boatman to drop down the
                        stream.</p>
                    <p>Directly opposite his point of embarkation there were farm lands, fertile and
                        moist, extending inland <pb id="VAA3882-049" n="41"/> for a mile. But
                        presently the frontier of the desert laid down a gray and yellow dead-line
                        over which no domestic plant might strike its root and live.</p>
                    <p>But the arable tracts were velvet green with young grain, the verdant level
                        broken here and there by a rustic&apos;s hut, under two or three
                        close-standing palms. Even from the surface of the Nile the checkered ap-
                        pearance of the country, caused by the various kids of products, was
                        noticeable. Egypt was the most fertile land in the world.</p>
                    <p>However, as the light bari climbed and dipped on the little waves toward the
                        north the Arabian hills began to approach the river. Their fronts became
                        abrupt and showed the edges of stratum on stratum of white stone. About
                        their bases were quantities of rubble and gray dust slanting against their
                        sides in slides and drifts. Across the narrowing strip of fer- tility square
                        cavities in rows showed themselves in the white face of the cliffs. The
                        ruins of a number of squat hovels were barely discernible over the
                        wheat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Set me down near Masaarah,&quot; Kenkenes said, &quot;and
                        wait for me.&quot; The boatman ducked his head re- spectfully and made
                        toward the eastern shore. He effected a landing at a bedding of masonry on
                        which a wharf had once been built. The rock was now over- run with riotous
                        marsh growth.</p>
                    <p>The quarries had not been worked for half a cen- tury. The thrifty husbandman
                        had cultivated his nar- row field within a few feet of the Nile, and the
                        road- way that had once led from the ruined wharf toward the hills was
                        obliterated by the grain.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes alighted and struck through the wheat toward the pitted front of the
                        cliffs. Before him was <pb id="VAA3882-050" n="42"/> a narrow gorge that
                        debouched into the great valley over a ledge of stone three feet in height.
                        After much winding the ravine terminated in a wide pocket, a quarter of a
                        mile inland. Exit from this cul-de-sac was possible toward the east by a
                        steep slope leading to the top of one of the interior ridges of the desert.
                        Kenkenes did not pause at the cluster of houses. The roofs had fallen in and
                        the place was quite unin- habitable. But he leaped up into the little valley
                        and followed it to its end. There he climbed the sharp declivity and turned
                        back in the direction he had come, along the flank of the hill that formed
                        the north wall of the gorge. The summit of the height was far above him, and
                        the slope was covered with limestone masses. There had been no frost nor
                        rain to disturb :the original rock-piling. Only the agencies of sand and
                        wind had disarranged the distribution on which the builders of the earliest
                        dynasty had looked. And this was weird, mysterious and labyrinthine.</p>
                    <p>At a spot where a great deal of broken rock encum- bered the ground, Kenkenes
                        unslung his wallet and tested the fragments with chisel and mallet. It was
                        the same as the quarry product—magnesium lime- stone, white, fine,
                        close-grained and easily worked. But it was broken in fragments too small
                        for his pur- pose. Above him were fields of greater masses.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, I was born under a fortunate sign,&quot; he said aloud as
                        he scaled the hillside; &quot;but I fear those slabs are too long for a
                        life-sized statue.&quot;</p>
                    <p>On reaching them he found that those blocks which appeared from a distance to
                        weigh less than a ton, were irregular cubes ten feet high.</p>
                    <p>He grumbled his disappointment and climbed upon <pb id="VAA3882-051" n="43"/>
                        one to take a general survey of his stoneyard. At that moment his eyes fell
                        on a block of proper dimensions under the very shadow of the great cube upon
                        which he stood. It was in the path of the wind from the north and was buried
                        half its height in sand.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes leaped from his point of vantage with a cry of delight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, now,&quot; he exclaimed; &quot;where in this- is
                        divine disfavor?&quot; He inspected his discovery, tried it for solidity
                        of position and purity of texture. Its location was particularly favorable
                        to secrecy.</p>
                    <p>It stood at the lower end of an aisle between great rocks. All view of it was
                        cut off, save from that posi- tion taken by Kenkenes when he discovered it.
                        A wall built between it and the north would bar the sand and &quot;.
                        form a nook, wholly closed on two sides and partly closed at each end by
                        stones. All this made itself plain to the mind of the young sculptor at
                        once. With a laugh of sheer content, he turned to retrace his steps and
                        began to sing.</p>
                    <p>Then was the harsh desolation of the hills startled, the immediate echoes
                        given unaccustomed sound to undulate in diminishing volume from one to
                        another. He sang absently, but his preoccupation did not make his tones
                        indifferent. For his voice was soft, full, organ-like, flexible, easy with
                        illimitable lung-power and ineffable grace. When he ceased the silence fell,
                        empty and barren, after that song&apos;s unaudienced splendor.</p>

                    <p>Mentu returned from the session at the palace, un- communicative and moody.
                        When, after the evening meal, Kenkenes crossed the court to talk with him,
                        he found the elder sculptor feeding a greedy flame in a brazier with the
                        careful plans for the new temple to Set. Kenkenes retired noiselessly and
                        saw his father no more that night.</p>
                    <p>The next day Mentu was bending over fresh sheets of papyrus, and when his son
                        entered and stood beside him he raised his head defiantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have another royal obelisk to decorate,&quot; he said, fixing
                        the young man with a steady eye, &quot;of a surety,— without
                        doubt,—inevitably,—for the thing is all but ready to be set up at
                        On.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am glad of that,&quot; Kenkenes replied gravely.
                        &quot;Let me make clean copies of these which are
                        complete.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He gathered up the sheets and took his place at the opposite table. Then
                        ensued a long silence, broken only by the loud and restless investigations
                        of the om- nipresent and unabashed ape.</p>
                    <p>At last the elder sculptor spoke.</p>
                    <p> &quot;The eye of heaven must be unblinkingly upon the divine
                        Meneptah,&quot; he observed, as though he had but thought aloud.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes gazed at his father with the inquiry on <pb id="VAA3882-053" n="45"
                        /> his face that he did not voice. The sculptor had riserf from his bench
                        and was searching a chest of rolled plans near him. He caught his
                        son&apos;s look and closed his mouth on an all but spoken expression.
                        Kenkenes continued to gaze at him in some astonishment, and the elder man
                        muttered to himself:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I like him not, though if Osiris should ask me why, I could not
                        tell. But he hath a too-ready smile, and by that I know he will twirl
                        Meneptah like a string about his finger.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The eyes of the young man widened. &quot;The new ad- viser?&quot; he
                        asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so,&quot; was the emphatic reply.</p>
                    <p>Before Kenkenes could ask for further enlighten- ment a female slave bowed in
                        the doorway.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Lady Senci sends thee greeting and would speak with thee. She
                        is at the outer portal in her curricle,&quot; she said, addressing
                        Mentu.</p>
                    <p>The great man sprang to his feet, glanced hurriedly at his ink-stained
                        fingers, at his robe, and then fled across the court into the door he had
                        entered to change his dress the day before.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes smiled, for Mentu had been a widower these ten Nile floods.</p>
                    <p>The slave still lingered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Also is there a messenger for thee, master,&quot; she said,
                        bowing again.</p>
                    <p> &quot;So? Let him enter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The man whom the slave ushered in a few minutes later was old, spare and
                        bent, but he was alert and restless. His eyes were brilliant and over them
                        arched eyebrows that were almost white. He made a jerky obeisance,</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-054" n="46"/>
                    <p>&quot;Greeting, son of Mentu. Dost thou remember me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The young man looked at his visitor for a moment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I remember,&quot; he said at last. &quot;Thou art Ranas,
                        courier to Snofru, priest of On. Greeting and wel- come to Memphis. Enter
                        and be seated.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Many thanks, but mine errand is urgent. I have been a guest of my
                        son, who abideth just without Memphis, and this morning a messenger came to
                        my son&apos;s door. He had been sent by Snofru to Tape, but had fallen
                        ill on the river between On and Memphis. As it happened, the house of my son
                        was the nearest, and thither he came, in fever and beyond traveling an-
                        other rod. As the message he bore concerned the priesthood, I went to
                        Asar-Mut and I am come from him to thee. He bids thee prepare for a journey
                        be- fore presenting thyself to him, at the temple.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes frowned in some perplexity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;His command is puzzling. Am I to become a mes- senger for the
                        gods?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;The first messenger was a nobleman,&quot; the old courier
                        explained in a conciliatory tone, &quot;and the holy father spoke of thy
                        fidelity and despatch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mine uncle is gracious. Salute him for me and tell him I
                        obey.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man bowed once more and withdrew.</p>
                    <p>When Kenkenes crossed the court a little time later he met his father.</p>
                    <p> &quot;The Lady Senci brings me news that makes me envious,&quot;
                        Mentu began at once, &quot;and shames me be- cause of
                        thee!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes lifted an expressive brow at this unex- pected onslaught.
                        &quot;Nay, now, what have I done?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-055" n="47"/>
                    <p> &quot;Nothing!&quot; Mentu asserted emphatically; &quot;and for
                        that reason am I wroth. The Lady Senci&apos;s nephew, Hotep, is the new
                        chief of the royal scribes.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;I call that good tidings,&quot; Kenkenes replied, a cheer- ful
                        note in his voice, &quot;and worth greeting with a health to Hotep. But
                        thou must remember, my father, that he is older than I.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;How much?&quot; the elder sculptor asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Three whole revolutions of Ra.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The artist regarded his son scornfully for a mo- ment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Lady Senci wishes me to prepare plans for the further
                        elaboration of her tomb,&quot; he went on, at last, &quot;but the
                        work on the obelisk may not be laid aside. If I might trust you to go on
                        with them, the Lady Senci need not wait.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I have, this moment, been summoned by my holy uncle, Asar-Mut,
                        to go on a journey, and I know not when I return,&quot; Kenkenes
                        explained.</p>
                    <p>Menta gazed at him without comprehending.</p>
                    <p> &quot;A messenger on his way to Tape from Snofru was overtaken with
                        misfortune here, and Asar-Mut, get- ting word of it, sent for me,&quot;
                        the young man con- tinued. &quot;I can only guess that he wishes me to
                        carry on the message.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Humph!&quot; the elder sculptor remarked. &quot;Asar-Mut
                        has kingly tastes. The couriers of priests are not usually of the nobility.
                        But get thee gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The pair separated and the young man passed into the house. The ape under the
                        bunch of leaves in a palm-top looked after him fixedly for a moment, and
                        then sliding down the tree, disappeared among the flowers.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-056" n="48"/>
                    <p>When, half an hour later, Kenkenes entered a cross avenue leading to a great
                        square in which the temple stood, he found the roadway filled with people,
                        crowd- ing about a group of disheveled women. These were shrieking, wildly
                        tearing their hair, beating themselves and throwing dust upon their heads.
                        Kenkenes im- mediately surmised that there was something more than the usual
                        death-wail in this.</p>
                    <p>He touched a man near him on the shoulder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who may these distracted women be?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The mothers of Khafra and Sigur, and their women.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay! Are these men dead? I knew them once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are by this time. They were to be hanged in the dungeon of the
                        house of the governor of police at this hour,&quot; the man answered
                        with morbid relish in his tone. Kenkenes looked at him in horror.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What had they done?&quot; he asked. The man plunged eagerly
                        into the narrative.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They were tomb robbers and robbed independently of the brotherhood
                        of thieves.<ref id="ref_H" target="note_H">*</ref> They refused to pay the
                        customary tribute from their spoil to the chief of robbers, and whatsoever
                        booty they got they kept, every jot of it. Innumerable mummies were found
                        rifled of their gold and gems, and although the chief of robbers and the
                        governor of police sought and bur- <note id="note_H" place="foot"

                            reduced to a system and governed by law. The chief of robbers received
                            all the spoil and to him the victimized citizen repaired and, upon
                            payment of a certain per cent. of the value of the object stolen, re-

                            divided the profits. This traffic was countenanced in Egypt until the

                        <pb id="VAA3882-057" n="49"/> rowed into every den in the Middle country,
                        they could not find the missing treasure. Then they knew that the looting
                        was not done by any of the licensed robbers. So all the professional thieves
                        and all the police set themselves to seek out the lawless
                        plunderers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Humph!&quot; interpolated Kenkenes expressively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye. And it was not long with all these upon the scent until Khafra
                        and Sigur were discovered coming forth from a tomb laden with spoil, and in
                        the struggle which ensued they did murder. But the constabulary have not
                        found the rest of the booty, though they made great search for it and may.
                        have put the thieves to torture. Who knows? They do dark things in the
                        dungeon under the house of the governor of police.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;And so they hanged them speedily,&quot; said Kenkenes,
                        desirous of ending the grisly tale.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And so they hanged them. I could not get in to see, and these
                        screaming mothers attracted me, so I am here. But my neighbor&apos;s son
                        is a friend of the jailer, and I shall know yet how they died.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Kenkenes was stalking off toward the temple, his shoulders lifted high
                        with disgust.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, ye inscrutable Hathors,&quot; he exclaimed finally;
                        &quot;how ye have disposed the fortunes of four friends! Two of us
                        hanged, a third in royal favor, a fourth an —an—an offender against the
                        gods.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Presently the avenue opened into the temple square. With reverential hand
                        Memphis put back her dwellings . and her bazaars, that profane life might
                        not press upon the sacred precincts of her mighty gods. Here was a vast
                        acreage, overhung with the atmosphere of sanc- tity. The grove of mysteries
                        was there, dark with pro- found shadow, and silent save for a lonesome bird-
                            <pb id="VAA3882-058" n="50"/> song or the suspirations of the wind. The
                        great pool in its stone basin reflected a lofty canopy of sunlit foliage,
                        and the shaggy peristyle of palm-tree trunks. The shadow of the great
                        structure darkened its ap- proaches before it was clearly visible through
                        the grove. The devotee entered a long avenue of sphinxes —fifty pairs lining
                        a broad highway paved with pol- ished granite flagging.</p>
                    <p>At its termination the two truncated pyramids that formed the entrance to the
                        temple towered upward, two hundred feet of massive masonry. Egypt had dis-
                        mantled a dozen mountains to build two.</p>
                    <p>When he reached the gateway that opened like a tunnel between the ponderous
                        pylons, he was delayed some minutes waiting till the porter should admit him
                        through the wicket of bronze. At last, a lank youth, the son of the regular
                        keeper, appeared, and, with an inarticulate apology, bade him enter.</p>
                    <p>Within the overarching portals he was met by a novice, a priest of the lowest
                        orders, to whom he stated his mission. With a sign to the young man to
                        follow, the priest passed through the porch into the inner court of the
                        temple. This was simply an immense roofless chamber. Its sides were the
                        outer walls of the temple proper, reinforced by stupendous pilasters and
                        elabo- rated with much bas-relief and many intaglios. The ends vere formed
                        by the inner pylons of the porch and outer pylons of the main temple. The
                        latter were guarded by colossal divinities. Down the center of the court was
                        a second aisle of sphinxes. They had entered this when the priest, with a
                        startled exclama- tion, sprang behind one of the recumbent monsters in time
                        to avoid the frolicsome salutation of an ape.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-059" n="51"/>
                    <p> &quot;Anubis! Mut, the Mother of Darkness, lends you her cloak!
                        Out!&quot; Kenkenes cried, striking at his pet. The wary animal eluded
                        the blow and for a mo- ment revolved about another sphinx, pursued by his
                        master, and then fled like a phantom out of the court by the path he came.
                        By this time the priest had emerged from his refuge and was attempting to
                        pre- vent the young man&apos;s interference with the will of the
                        ape.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay, nay; I am sorry!&quot; the priest exclaimed as Anubis
                        disappeared. &quot;It is an omen. Toth<ref id="ref_I" target="note_I"
                            >*</ref> visiteth Ptah; Wisdom seeketh Power! Came he by divine summons
                        or did he seek the great god? It is a prob- lem for the sorcerers and is of
                        ominous import!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The pestiferous creature followed me unseen from the
                        house,&quot; Kenkenes explained, rather flushed of coun- tenance.
                        &quot;To me it is an omen that the idler who keeps the gate is not
                        vigilant.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The priest shook his head and led the way without further words into the
                        temple. Here the young sculp- tor was conducted through a wilderness of
                        jacketed columns, over pavements that rang even under san- daled feet, to
                        the center of a vast hall. The priest left him and disappeared through the
                        all-enveloping twilight into the more sacred part of the temple.</p>
                    <p> In a moment, Asar-Mut, high priest to Ptah, ap- peared, approaching through
                        the dusk. He wore the priestly habiliments of spotless linen, and, like a
                        loose mantle, a magnificent leopard-skin, which hung by a claw over the
                        right shoulder and, passing under the <note id="note_I" place="foot"
                            anchored="yes"><ref target="ref_I">*</ref>The ape was sacred to and an

                        <pb id="VAA3882-060" n="52"/> left arm, was fastened at the breast by a
                        medallion of gold and topaz. He was a typical Egyptian, but thin- ner of lip
                        and severer of countenance than the laity. The wooden dolls tumbled about by
                        the children of the realm were not more hairless than he. His high, narrow
                        head was ghastly in its utter nakedness.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes bent reverently before him and was greet- ed kindly by the
                        pontiff.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou guessed why I sent for thee?&quot; he asked at
                        once.</p>
                    <p> &quot;I have guessed,&quot; Kenkenes replied, &quot;but it may
                        be wildly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let us see. I would have thee carry a message for the
                        brotherhood.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes inclined his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good. Be thy journey as quick as thy perception. I ask thy pardon
                        for laying the work of a temple courier upon thy shoulders, but the message
                        is of such import that I would carry it myself were I as young and
                        unburdened with duty as thou.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am thy servant, holy Father, and well pleased with the
                        opportunity that permits me to serve the gods.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know, and therefore have I chosen thee. My trusted courier is
                        dead; the others are light-minded, and Tape is in the height of festivity.
                        They might delay—they might be lured into forgetting duty, and,&quot;
                        the pontiff lowered his voice and drew nearer to Ken- kenes, &quot;and
                        there are those that may be watching for this letter. A nobleman would not
                        be thought a mes- senger. Thou dost incur less danger than the clout-
                        wearing runner for the temple.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A light broke over Kenkenes.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-061" n="53"/>
                    <p>&quot;I understand,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go, then, by private boat at sunset, and Ptah be with thee. Make
                        all speed.&quot; He put a doubly wrapped scroll into Kenkenes&apos;
                        hands. &quot;This is to be delivered to our holy Superior, Loi, priest
                        of Amen. Farewell, and fail not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes bowed and withdrew.</p>
                    <p>It was long before sunset, and he had an unfulfilled promise in mind. He
                        crossed the square thoughtfully and paused by the pool in its center. The
                        surface, dark and smooth as oil, reflected his figure and face faith- fully
                        and to his evident satisfaction. He passed around the pool and walked
                        briskly in the direction of another narrow passage lined by rich
                        residences.</p>
                    <p>He knocked at a portal framed by a pair of huge pilasters, which towered
                        upward, and, as pillars, formed two of the colonnade on the roof. A portress
                        admitted him with a smile and led him through the sumptuously appointed
                        chamber of guests into the in- tramural park. There she indicated a nook in
                        an arbor of vines and left him.</p>
                    <p>With a silent foot he crossed the flowery court and entered the bower. The
                        beautiful dweller sat in a deep chair, her little feet on a carved
                        footstool, a silver- stringed lyre tumbled beside it. She was alone and
                        appeared desolate. When the tall figure of the sculp- tor cast a shadow upon
                        her she looked up with a little cry of delight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;a god led thee hither to
                        save me from the solitude. It is a moody monster not cata- logued in the
                        list of terrors.&quot; She thrust the lyre aside with her sandal and
                        pushed the footstool, only a little, away from her.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-062" n="54"/>
                    <p> &quot;Sit there,&quot; she commanded. Ketkenes obeyed will- ingly.
                        He drew off his coif and tossed it aside.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou seest I am come in the garb of labor,&quot; he con-
                        fessed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see,&quot; she answered severely. &quot;Am I no longer
                        worthy the robe of festivity?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, Ta-meri, thou dost wrong me,&quot; he said. &quot;Chide
                        me, but impugn me not. Nay, I am on my way to Tape. I was summoned hurriedly
                        and am already dis- missed upon mine errand, but I could not use myself so
                        ill as to postpone my visit for eighteen days.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She jeered at him prettily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To hear thee one would think thou hadst been com- il as often as
                        Nechutes.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;How often does Nechutes come?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Every day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of late?&quot; he asked, with a laugh in his eyes.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay,&quot; she answered sulkily. &quot;Not since the day-
                        that day!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes was silent for a moment. Then he put his elbow on the arm of her
                        chair and leaned his head&apos; against his hand. The attitude brought
                        him close to her.</p>
                    <p> &quot;All these days,&quot; he said at length, &quot;he has been
                        unhappy among the happy and the unhappiest among the sad. He has summoned
                        the shuddering Pantheon to hear him vow eternal unfealty to thee, Ta-meri-
                        and lo! while they listened he begged their most potent charm to hold thee
                        to him still. Poor Nechutes!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost treat it lightly,&quot; she reproached him, her eyes
                        veiled, &quot;but it is of serious import to-to Ne-
                        chutes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I shall hold my tongue. I efface myself d nd <pb
                            id="VAA3882-063" n="55"/> intercede for him, and thou dost call it
                        exulting. And when I am fallen from thy favor there will be none to plead my
                        cause, none to hide her misty eyes with contrite lashes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mine eyes are not misty,&quot; she retorted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast said,&quot; he admitted, in apology. &quot;It was
                        not a happy term. I meant bejeweled with repentant dew.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her little finger at him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If thou dost persist in thy calumny of me, thou mayest come to test
                        thy dismal augury,&quot; she warned.</p>
                    <p>He dropped his eyes and his mouth drooped. 4 or- ously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I come for comfort, and I get Nechutes and all the unpropitious
                        possibilities that his name suggests.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Comfort? Thou, in trouble? Thou, the light- hearted?&quot; she
                        laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay; I am discontented, but I might as well h e to heave the skies
                        away with my shoulders as to r bel, against mine oppression. So I came to be
                        petted into submission.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, dost thou hear him?&quot; the lady cried. &quot;And he
                        came, because he was sure he would get it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And he will go away because the Lady Ta-meri means he shall not
                        have it,&quot; he exclaimed. He reached toward his coif and immediately
                        a panic-stricken little hand stayed him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; she said softly. &quot;I was but
                        retaliating.</p>
                    <p>Hast thou not plagued me, and may I not tease thee a little in revenge? Say
                        on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My-but now I bethink me, I ought not to tell thee. It savors of
                        that which so offends thy nice sense of <pb id="VAA3882-064" n="56"/>
                        gentility—labor,&quot; he said, sinking back in his easy attitude
                        again.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Fie, Kenkenes,&quot; she said. &quot;Hath some one put thy
                        slavish love of toil under ban? Does that oppress thee?&quot; He
                        reproved her with a pat on the nearest hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The king toils; the priests toil; the powers of the world labor.
                        None but the beautiful idle may be idle, and that for their
                        beauty&apos;s sake. Nay, it is not that I may not work, but I may not
                        work as I wish and I am heart-sick therefore.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His last words ended in a tone of genuine dejection. Hiyes were fixed on the
                        grass of the nook and his brows had knitted slightly. The expression was a
                        rare one for his face and in its way becoming-for the moment at least. The
                        hand he had patted drew nearer, and at last, after a little hesitancy, was
                        laid on his black hair. He lifted his face and took cheer, from the light in
                        her eyes, to proceed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Since I may speak,&quot; he began, &quot;I shall. Ta-meri,
                        thou knowest that as a sculptor I work within limits. The stature of mine
                        art must crouch under the bounds of the ritual. It is not boasting if I say
                        that I see, with brave eyes, that Egypt insults herself when she creates
                        horrors in stone and says, &apos;This is my idea of art.&apos; And
                        these things are not human; neither are they beasts-they are grotesques that
                        verge so near upon a semblance of living things as to be piteous. They
                        thwart the purpose of sculpture. Why do we carve at all, if not to show how
                        we appear to the world or the world appears to us? Now for my rebellion. I
                        would carve as we are made; as we dispose ourselves; aye, I would display a
                        man&apos;s soul in his face and write his <pb id="VAA3882-065" n="57"/>
                        history on his brow. I would people Egypt with a host of beauty, grace and
                        naturalness—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just as if they were alive?&quot; Ta-meri inquired with
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so—of such naturalness that one could guess only by the hue of
                        the stone that they did not breathe.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The lady shrugged her shoulders and laughed a little.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But they do not carve that way,&quot; she protested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is not sculpture. Thou wouldst fill the land with frozen
                        creatures—ai!&quot; with another little shrug. &quot;It would be
                        haunted and spectral. Nay, give me the old forms. They are
                        best.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes fairly gasped with his sudden descent from earnest hope to
                        disappointment. A flood of half- angry shame dyed his face and the wound to
                        his sensi- bilities showed its effect so plainly that the beauty noted it
                        with a sudden burst of compunction.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Of a truth,&quot; she added, her voice grown wondrous soft,
                        &quot;I am full of sympathy for thee, Kenkenes. Nay, look up. I can not
                        be happy if thou art not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That suffices. I am cheered,&quot; he began, but the note of
                        sarcasm in his voice was too apparent for him to permit himself to proceed.
                        He caught up the lyre, and drawing up a diphros—a double seat of fine woods
                        —rested against it and began to improvise with an assumption of
                        carelessness. Ta-meri sank back in her chair and regarded him from under
                        dreamy lids-her senses charmed, her light heart won by his comeliness and
                        talent. Kenkenes became conscious of her inspec- tion, at last, and looked
                        up at her. His eyes were still bright with his recent feeling and the hue in
                        his cheeks a little deeper. The admiration in her face became <pb
                            id="VAA3882-066" n="58"/> so speaking that he smiled and ran without
                        pausing into one of the love-lyrics of the day. Breaking off in its midst,
                        he dropped the lyre and said with honest apology in his voice:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I crave thy pardon, Ta-meri. What right had I to weight thee with
                        my cares! It was selfish, and yet— thou art so inviting a confidante, that
                        it is not wholly my fault if I come to seek of thee, my oldest and sweetest
                        friend, the woman comfort that was bereft me with my rightful
                        comforter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Neither mother nor sister nor lady-love,&quot; she mused. He
                        nodded, but the slight interrogative em- phasis caught him, and he looked up
                        at her. He nod- ded again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, nor lady-love, thanks to the luck of Nechu- tes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nechutes is no longer lucky,&quot; she said deliberately.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No matter,&quot; Kenkenes insisted. &quot;I shall be gone
                        eighteen days, and his luck will have changed before I can
                        return.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thine auguries seem to please thee,&quot; she pouted.</p>
                    <p> He put the back of her jeweled hand against his cheek.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay, I but comfort thee at the sacrifice of mine own
                        peace.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A futile sacrifice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A futile sacrifice!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, Ta-meri, beseech the Goddess Ma to forget thy words!&quot;
                        he cried in mock horror. She tossed her head, and instantly he got upon his
                        feet, catching up his coif as he did so.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, bid me farewell,&quot; he said putting out his <pb
                            id="VAA3882-067" n="59"/> hand, &quot;and one of double sweetness,
                        for I doubt me much if Nechutes will permit a welcome when I re-
                        turn.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nechutes will not interfere in mine affairs,&quot; she said,
                        as she rose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I shall know if that be true when I return,&quot; he
                        declared.</p>
                    <p>She stamped her foot.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fie!&quot; he laughed. &quot;Already do I begin to doubt
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She turned from him and kept her face away. Ken- kenes went to her and,
                        taking both her hands in his, drew her close to him. She did not resist, but
                        her face reproached him-not for what he was doing, but for what he had done.
                        With his head bent, he looked down into her eyes for a moment. Her red South
                        with its sulky pathos was almost irresistible. But he only pressed one hand
                        to his lips.</p>
                    <p> &quot;I must wait until I return,&quot; he said from the door- way,
                        and was gone.</p>
                    <p>On the broad bosom of the Nile at sunset, four strong oarsmen were speeding
                        him swiftly up to Thebes. Off the long wharves at the southernmost limits of
                        the city, the rapid boat overtook and passed low-riding, slowly moving
                        stone-barges laden with quarry slaves. The unwieldy craft progressed
                        heavily, nearer and within the darkening shadow of the Ara- bian hills.
                        Kenkenes watched them as long as they were in sight, an unwonted pity making
                        itself felt in his heart. For even in the dusk he distinguished many women
                        and the immature figures of children; and none knew the quarry life better
                        than he, who was a worker in stone.</p>

                    <p>Thebes Diospolis, the hundred-gated, was in holiday attire. The great suburb
                        to the west of the Nile had emptied her multitudes into the solemn community
                        of the gods. Besides her own inhabitants there were thousands from the
                        entire extent of the Thebaid and visitors even from far-away Syene and
                        Philae. It was an occasion for more than ordinary pomp. The great god Amen
                        was to be taken for an outing in his ark.</p>
                    <p>Every possible manifestation of festivity had been sought after and
                        displayed. The air was a-flutter with party-colored streamers. Garlands
                        rioted over Colossus, peristyle, obelisk and sphinx without con- serving
                        pattern or moderation. The dromos, or ave- nue of sphinxes, was carpeted
                        with palm and nelumbo leaves, and copper censers as large as caldrons had
                        been set at equidistance from one another, and an un- ceasing reek of
                        aromatics drifted up from them throughout the day.</p>
                    <p>For once the magnificence of the wondrous city of the gods was set down from
                        its usual preeminence in the eyes of the wondering spectator, and the
                        vastness of the multitude usurped its place. The bari of Ken- kenes seeking
                        to round the island of sand lying near the eastern shore opposite the
                        village of Karnak, met <pb id="VAA3882-069" n="61"/> a solid pack of boats.
                        The young sculptor took in the situation at once, and, putting about, found
                        a landing farther to the north. There he made a portage across the flat bar
                        of sand to the arm of quiet water that separated the island from the eastern
                        shore. Crossing, he dismissed his eager and excited boatmen and struck
                        across the noon-heated valley toward the emple. The route of the pageant
                        could be seen from afar, cleanly outlined by humanity. It extended from
                        Karnak to Luxor and, turning in a vast loop at the Nile front,
                        countermarched over the dromos and ended at the tre- mendous white-walled
                        temple of Amen. Between the double ranks of sightseers there was but chariot
                        room. The side Kenkenes approached sloped sharply from the dromos toward the
                        river, and the rearmost specta- tors had small opportunity to behold the
                        pageant. The multitude here was less densely packed. Ken- kenes joined the
                        crowd at this point.</p>
                    <p>Here was the canaille of Thebes.</p>
                    <p>They wore nothing but a kilt of cotton—or as often, only a cincture about the
                        loins, and their lean bodies were blackened by the terrible sun of the
                        desert. They were the apprentices of <hi rend="i">paraschites</hi>,<ref
                            id="ref_J" target="note_J">*</ref> brewers, profes- sional thieves,
                        slaves and traffickers in the unclean necessities of a great city, and only
                        their occasional riots, or such events as this, brought them into gen- eral
                        view of the upper classes. They had nothing in common with the gentry, whom
                        they were willing to recognize as creatures of a superior mold. Among
                        themselves there were established castes, and members of each despised the
                        lower and hated the upper. Ken- <note id="note_J" place="foot"

                        <pb id="VAA3882-070" n="62"/> kenes slackened his pace when he recognized
                        the char- acter of these spectators, and after hesitating a mo- ment, he
                        hung the flat wallet containing the message around his neck inside his kamis
                        and pushed on. Ev- ery foot of progress he essayed was snarlingly dis- puted
                        until the rank of the aggressive stranger was guessed by his superior dress,
                        when he was given a moody and ungracious path. But he finally met an
                        immovable obstacle in the shape of a quarrel.</p>
                    <p>The stage of hostilities was sufficiently advanced to be menacing, and the
                        young sculptor hesitated to ponder on the advisability of pressing on. While
                        he waited, several deputies of the constabulary, method- ically silencing
                        the crowd, came upon these belliger- ents in turn and belabored the foremost
                        into silence. The act decided the young man. The feelings of the rabble were
                        now in a state sufficiently warlike to make them forget their ancient
                        respect for class and turn savagely upon him, should he show any desire to
                        force his way through their lines. Therefore he gave up his attempt to reach
                        the temple and made up his mind to remain where he was. At that moment,
                        several gorgeous litters of the belated wealthy rammed a path to the very
                        front and were set down before, the rabble. Kenkenes seized upon their
                        advance to proceed also, and, dropping between the first and second litter,
                        made his way with little difficulty to the front. With the complacency of a
                        man that has rank and authority on his side he turned up the roadway and
                        continued to- ward the temple. He was halted before he had pro- ceeded ten
                        steps. A litter richly gilded and borne by four men, came pushing through
                        the crowd and was deposited directly in his path.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-071" n="63"/>
                    <p>But for the unusual appearance of the bearers, Ken- kenes might have passed
                        around the conveyance and continued. Instead, he caught the contagious
                        curiosity of the crowd and stood to marvel. The men were stal- wart,
                        black-bearded and strong of feature, and robed in no Egyptian garb. ThQy
                        were draped volumi- nously in long habits of brown linen, fringed at the
                        hem, belted by a yellow cord with tasseled ends. The sleeves were wide and
                        showed the wristbands of a white under-garment. The head-dress was a brown
                        kerchief bound about the brow with a cord, also yellow.</p>
                    <p>While Kenkenes examined them in detail, a long, in-drawn breath of wonder
                        from the circle of specta- tors caused him to look at the alighting owner of
                        the litter.</p>
                    <p>He took a backward step and halted, amazed.</p>
                    <p>Before him was a woman of heroic proportions, taller, with the exception of
                        himself, than any man in the crowd. Upon her, at first glance, was to be
                        dis- cerned the stamp of great age, yet she was as straight as a column and
                        her hair was heavy and midnight- black. Hers was the Semitic cast of
                        countenance, the features sharply chiseled, but without that aggressive-
                        ness that emphasizes the outline of a withered face. Every passing year had
                        left its mark on her, but she had grown old not as others do. Here was flesh
                        compromising with age-accepting its majesty, defy- ing its detay-a sublunar
                        assumption of immortality. There was no longer any suggestion of femininity;
                        the idea was dread power and unearthly grace. Of such nature might the
                        sexless archangels partake.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-072" n="64"/>
                    <p>&quot;Holy Amen!&quot; one of the awed bystanders ex- claimed in a
                        whisper to his neighbor. &quot;Who is this?&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;A priestess from Babylon,&quot; another hazarded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, ye are all wrong,&quot; quavered an old man who had been
                        looking at the new-comers under the elbows of the crowd. &quot;She is an
                        Israelite.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast a cataract, old man,&quot; was the scornful reply
                        from some one near by. &quot;She is no slave.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye,&quot; went on the unsteady voice, &quot;I know her.
                        She was the favorite woman of Queen Neferari Ther- muthis. She has not been
                        out of the Delta where her people live since the good queen died forty years
                        ago. She must be well-nigh a hundred years old. Aye, I Should know her by
                        her stature. It is of a truth the Lady Miriam.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At the sound of his mistress&apos; name one of the bear- ers turned and
                        shot a sharp glance at the speaker. Instantly the old man fell back, saying,
                        as a sneer of contempt ran through the rabbles at the intelligence his words
                        conveyed: &quot;Anger them not. They have the evil eye.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes had guessed the nationality of the stran- gers immediately, but had
                        doubted the correctness of his surmise, because of their noble mien. If he
                        suf- fered any disappointment in hearing proof of their identity, it was
                        immediately nullified by the joy his artist-soul took in the stately Hebrew
                        woman. He for- got the mission that urged him to the temple- and, per-
                        mitting the shifting, restless crowd to surround him, he lingered, thinking.
                        This proud disdain must mark <note id="note_K" place="foot" anchored="yes"

                        <pb id="VAA3882-073" n="65"/> his goddess of stone in the Arabian hills,
                        this majesty and power; but there must be youth and fire in the place of
                        this ancient calm.</p>
                    <p>A porter that stood beside him, emboldened by bar- ley beer and the growing
                        disapproval among the on- lookers, cried:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ha! by the rags of my fathers, she outshines her masters, the
                        brickmaking hag!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes, who towered over the ruffian, became possessed of a sudden and
                        uncontrollable indignation. He pecked the man on the head with the knuckle
                        of his forefinger, saying in colloquial Egyptian:</p>
                    <p> &quot;Hold thy tongue, brawler, nor presume to flout thy
                        betters!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The stately Israelite, who had taken no notice of any word against her, now
                        turned her head toward Kenkenes and slowly inspected him. He had no
                        op&apos; portunity to guess whether her gaze was approving, , for the
                        crowd about him, grown weary of waiting, had become quarrelsome and was
                        loudly resenting-his defense of the Hebrews. The porter, supported by
                        several of his brethren, was already menacing the young sculptor when some
                        one shouted that the pro- cession was in sight.</p>
                    <p>From his position Kenkenes commanded a long view of the street that declined
                        sharply toward the river. As yet there was nothing to be seen of the pag-
                        eant, but the dense crowds far down the highway swayed backward froth the
                        narrow path between them. Presently, scantily-clad runners were
                        distinguished coming in a slow trot between the multitudes. The lane widened
                        before the swing of their maces and there were cries of alarm as the
                        spectators in the mid- <pb id="VAA3882-074" n="66"/> dle were pressed
                        between the retreating forward ranks and the immovable rear. Running
                        water-bearers pur- sued the couriers with gurglets, sprinkling the way.
                        Directly after these, slim bare-limbed youths came in a rapid pace strewing
                        the path with flowers and palm- leaves. By this time the intermittent sound
                        of music had grown insistent and continuous. Solemn bodies of priests
                        approached, series after series of the shaven, white-robed ministers of
                        Amen. The murmur had grown to an uproar. The wild clamor of trumpet, pipe,
                        cymbal and sistrum, with the long drone of the arghool as undertone, drifted
                        by. The upper orders of priests followed in the vibrating wake of the musi-
                        cians. Then came Loi, high-priest to the patron god of Thebes, walking
                        alone, his ancient figure most piti- fully mocked by the richness of his
                        priestly robes.</p>
                    <p>After him the great god, Amen, in his ark.</p>
                    <p>The air was rent with acclaim. The crowd was too dense for any one to
                        prostrate himself, but every Egyp- tian, potentate or slave, assumed as
                        nearly as possible the posture of humility. Kenkenes bent reverently, but he
                        lifted his eyes and looked long at the passing ark. Six priests bore it upon
                        their shoulders. It was a small boat, elaborately carved, and the cabin in
                        the center-the retreat of the deity-was picketed with a cordon of sacred
                        images. The entire feretory was overlaid with gold and crusted with
                        gems.</p>
                    <p>Mentu, his father, had planned one for Ptah, and a noble work it was,—quite
                        equal to this, Kenkenes thought.</p>
                    <p>His artistic deliberations were interrupted by an angry tone in the clamor
                        about him. The Israelites had called out a demonstration of contempt before,
                            <pb id="VAA3882-075" n="67"/> and he guessed at once that they had
                        further dis- pleased the rabble. It was even as he had thought. The four
                        bearers with folded arms contemplated the threatening crowd with a sidelong
                        gaze of contempt. The stately Israelite stood in a dream, her brilliant eyes
                        fixed in profound preoccupation on the distance. Kenkenes knew by the
                        present attitude of the group that they had made no obeisance to Amen: Hence
                        the mutterings among the faithful. Few had seen the offense at first, but
                        the demonstration spread neverthe- less, and assumed ominous
                        proportions.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay, now,&quot; Kenkenes thought impatiently, &quot;such
                        impiety is foolhardy.&quot; But he drifted into the group of Hebrews and
                        stood between the woman of Israel and her insulters. The bearers glanced at
                        him, at one another, and closed up beside him, but he had eyes only for the
                        majestic Israelite. Not till he saw her bend with singular grace did he look
                        again on the pageant, interested to know what had won her homage.</p>
                    <p>She had done obeisance before the crown prince of Egypt. He stood in a
                        sumptuous chariot drawn by white. horses and driven by a handsome
                        charioteer. The princely person was barely visible for the pair of feather
                        fans borne by attendants that walked be- side him. Through continuous
                        cheering he passed on. Seti, the younger, followed, driving alone. His eyes
                        wandered in pleased wonder over the multitude which howled itself hoarse for
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Close behind him was a chariot of ebony drawn by two plunging, coal-black
                        horses. A robust Egyptian, who shifted from one foot to the other and talked
                        to his horses continually, drove therein alone. As he approached, the Hebrew
                        woman raised herself so sud- <pb id="VAA3882-076" n="68"/> denly that one of
                        the nervous animals side-stepped, affrighted. The swaggering Egyptian, with
                        a mut- tered curse, struck at her. with his whip. The four bearers sprang
                        forward, but she quieted them with a few words in Hebrew. Reentering her
                        litter she was borne away, while the Thebans were still lost in the delights
                        of the procession.</p>
                    <p>In the few strange words of the woman of Israel, Kenkenes had caught the name
                        of Har-hat. This then was the bearer of the king&apos;s fan—this
                        insulter of age and womanhood. And the words of Mentu seemed very
                        fitting,—&quot;I like him not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Thebans were in raptures. The splendors of the pageant had far surpassed
                        their expectations. Priests, soldiers and officials came in companies, rank
                        upon rank, of exalted and ornate dignity. Chariots and horses shone with
                        gilding, polished metal and gay housings, while the marching legions clanked
                        with pike and blade and shield. Now that the chief lumi- naries of the
                        procession had passed, the rich and lofty departed with a great show of
                        indifference to the rest of the parade. But the humbler folk, all unlearned
                        in the art of assumption, had not reached that nice point of culture, and
                        lingered to see the last foot-soldier pass.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes, urged by his mission, was departing with the rich and lofty, when
                        his attention was attracted by the chief leading the section of royal
                        scribes now passing. His was a compact, plump figure, amply robed in sheeny
                        linen, and he balanced himself skil; fully in his light shell of a chariot,
                        which bumped over the uneven pavement. He was not a brilliant mark in the
                        long parade, but something other than his mere <pb id="VAA3882-077" n="69"/>
                        appearance made him conspicuous. Behind him, walk- ing at a respectful
                        distance, was his corps of subordi- nates-all mature, many of them aged, but
                        the years of their chief were fewer than those of the youngest among them.
                        From the center of the crowd his face appeared boyish, and the multitude
                        hailed him with delight. But the crown prince himself was not More unmoved
                        by their acclaim. His silent dignity, misunderstood, brought forth howls of
                        genuine pleas- ure, and groups of young noblemen, out of the great college
                        of Seti I, saluted him by name, adding thereto exalted titles in
                        good-natured derision.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Hotep!&quot; ejaculated Kenkenes aloud, catching the name from
                        the lips of the students. &quot;By Apis, he is the royal
                        scribe!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Not until then had he realized the extent of his friend&apos;s
                        exaltation.</p>
                    <p>He turned again toward the temple, walking be- tween the crowds and the
                        marching soldiers, in- different to the shouts of the spectators—lost in
                        con- templation. But the procession moved more swiftly than he and the last
                        rank passed him with half his journey yet to complete. Instantly the vast
                        throng poured out into the way behind the rearmost soldier and swallowed up
                        the sculptor in a shifting multi- tude. For an hour he was hurried and
                        halted and pushed, progressing little and moving much. Before he could
                        extricate himself, the runners preceding the pageant returning the great god
                        to his shrine, beat the multitude back from the dromos and once again
                        Kenkenes was imprisoned by the hosts. And once again after the procession
                        had passed, he did fruitless battle with a tossing human sea. But when the
                        street <pb id="VAA3882-078" n="70"/> had become freer, he stood before the
                        closed portal of the great temple. The solemn porter scrutinized the young
                        sculptor sharply, but the display of the linen-wrapped roll was an efficient
                        passport. In a lit- tle space he was conducted across the ringing pave-
                        ments, under the vaulted shadows, into the presence of Loi, high priest to
                        Amen.</p>
                    <p>The ancient prelate had just returned from install- ing the god in his shrine
                        and was yet invested in his sacerdotal robes. At one time this splendid
                        raiment had swathed an imposing figure, but now the frame was bowed, its
                        whilom comfortable padding fallen away, its parchment-like skin folded and
                        wrinkled and brown. He was trembling with the long fatigue of the
                        spectacle.</p>
                    <p>He spelled the hieratic writings upon the outer cov- ering of the roll which
                        the young man presented to him, and asked with some eagerness in his
                        voice:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou traveled with all speed?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Scarce eight days have I been on the way. Only have I been delayed
                        a few hours by the crowds of the festival.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is well,&quot; replied the pontiff. &quot;Wait here
                        while I see what says my brother at On.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He motioned Kenkenes to a seat of inlaid ebony and retired into a curtained
                        recess.</p>
                    <p>The apartment into which Kenkenes had been con- ducted was small. It was
                        evidently the study of Loi, for there was a small library of papyri in cases
                        against the wall; a deep fauteuil was before a heavy table cov- ered with
                        loosely rolled writings. The light from a high slit under the architrave
                        sifted down on the floor strewn with carpets of Damascene weave. Two <pb
                            id="VAA3882-079" n="71"/> great pillars, closely set, supported the
                        ceiling. They were of red and black granite, and each was sur- mounted by a
                        foliated encarpus of white marble. The ceiling was a marvelous marquetry of
                        many and wondrously harmonious colors.</p>
                    <p>In one wall was the entrance leading to another chamber. It was screened by a
                        slowly swaying cur- tain of broidered linen, which was tied at its upper
                        corners to brass rings sunk in the stone frame of the door. This frame
                        attracted the attention of the young sculptor. It consisted of two
                        caryatides standing out from the square shaft from which they were carved,
                        their erect heads barely touching the ceiling. The figures were of heroic
                        size and wore the repose and dignity of countenance characteristic of
                        Egyptian statues. The sculptor had been so successful in bring- ing out this
                        expression that Kenkenes stood before them and groaned because he had not
                        followed nature to the exquisite achievement he might have attained.</p>
                    <p>He was deeply interested in his critical examina- tion of the figures when
                        the old priest darted into the apartment, his withered face working with
                        excite- ment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go! Go!&quot; he cried. &quot;Eat and prepare to return to
                        Memphis with all speed. Thine answer will await thee here to-night at the
                        end of the first watch,-and Set be upon thee if thou delayest!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes, startled out of speech, did obeisance and hastened from the
                        temple.</p>
                    <p>The outside air was thick with dust and intensely hot under the reddening
                        glare of the sun. It was late afternoon. The city was still crowded, the
                        river front lined with a dense jam of people awaiting transporta- <pb
                            id="VAA3882-080" n="72"/> tion to the opposite shore. Kenkenes knew that
                        many would still be there on the morrow, since the number of boats was
                        inadequate to carry the multitude of passengers.</p>
                    <p>He began to think with concern upon the security of his own bari, left in the
                        marsh-growth by the Nile side, north of Karnak. He left the shifting crowd
                        behind and struck across the sandy flat toward the arm of quiet water.
                        Straggling groups preceded and followed him and at the Nile-side he came
                        upon a number contending for the possession of his boat. They were
                        image-makers and curriers, equally matched against one another, and a Nubian
                        servitor in a striped tunic, who remained neutral that he might with safety
                        join the winning party. The appearance of the nobleman checked hostilities
                        and the contest- ants, recognizing the paternalism of rank after the manner
                        of the lowly, called upon him to arbitrate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The boat is mine, children,&quot;<ref id="ref_L"
                            target="note_L">*</ref> was his quiet answer. He pushed it off, stepped
                        into it, and turned it broad- side to them.</p>
                    <p> &quot;See here, the scarab of Ptah,&quot; he said, tapping the bow
                        with a paddle, &quot;and the name of Memphis?&quot; With that he
                        drew away to the sandbar before the astonished men had realized the turn of
                        events. Then they looked at one another in silence or muttered their
                        disgust; but the Nubian went into transports of rage, making such violent
                        demonstrations that the image- makers and curriers turned on him and bade
                        him cease.</p>
                    <p>At the Libyan shore Kenkenes gave his bari into <note id="note_L"
                            place="foot" anchored="yes"><ref target="ref_L">*</ref>The oriental

                        <pb id="VAA3882-081" n="73"/> the hands of a river-man and by a liberal fee
                        pur- chased its security from confiscation. Then he turned his face toward
                        the center of the western suburb of Thebes Diospolis. He had the larger
                        palace of Rameses II in view and he walked briskly, as one who goes forward
                        to meet pleasure. Only once, when he passed the palace and temple of the
                        Incomparable Pharaoh, which stood at the mouth of the Valley of the Kings,
                        he frowned in discontent. Far up the tortu- ous windings of this gorge was
                        the tomb of the great Rameses and there had the precious signet been lost. .
                        As he looked at the high red ridge through which this crevice led, he
                        remembered his father&apos;s emphatic pro- hibition and bit his lip.
                        Thereafter, throughout a great part of his walk, he railed mentally against
                        the useless loss of a most propitious opportunity.</p>
                    <p>To the first resplendent member of the retinue at Meneptah&apos;s palace,
                        who cast one glance at the fillet the sculptor wore, and bent suavely before
                        him, Ken- kenes stated his mission. The retainer bowed again and called a
                        rosy page hiding in the dusk of the corridor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go thou to the apartments of my Lord. Hotep and tell him a visitor
                        awaits him in his chamber of guests.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The lad slipped away and the retainer led Kenkenes into a long chamber near
                        the end of the corridor. The hall had been darkened to keep out the glare of
                        the day, air being admitted only through a slatted blind against which a
                        shrub in the court outside beat its waxen leaves. Before his eyes had become
                        accus- tomed to the dusk Kenkenes heard footsteps coming down the outer
                        passage, with now and then the light <pb id="VAA3882-082" n="74"/> and brisk
                        scrape of the sandal toe on the polished floor. The young sculptor smiled at
                        the excited throb of his heart. The new-comer entered the hall and drew up
                        the shutter. The brilliant flood of light re- vealed to him the tall figure
                        of the sculptor rising from his chair—to the sculptor the trim presence of
                        the royal scribe.</p>
                    <p>The friends had not met in six years.</p>
                    <p>For a space long enough for recognition to dawn upon the scribe, he stood
                        motionless and then with an exclamation of extravagant delight he seized his
                        friend and embraced him with woman-like emotion.</p>

                    <p>Loi was not present at the sunset prayers in Karnak. An hour before he had
                        summoned the trustiest priest in the brotherhood of ministers to Amen and
                        bade him conduct the ceremonies of the evening. Then he sent to the temple
                        stores, put into service another boat and was ferried over to the Libyan
                        suburb of Thebes. He had himself borne in a litter to the greater palace of
                        Rameses II, and asked an audience with Meneptah.</p>
                    <p>The king was at prayers in the temple of his father, close to the palace, and
                        the dusk of twilight was set- tling on the valley of the Nile, before Loi
                        was sum- moned to the council chamber.</p>
                    <p>The hall he entered was vast and full of deep shad- ows. The two windows set
                        in one wall, many feet above the floor, showed two spaces of darkening sky.
                        A single torch of aromatics flared and hissed beside the throne dais.
                        Tremendous wainscoting covered the base of the walls, more than a foot above
                        a man&apos;s height. It was massively carved with colossal sheaves of
                        lotus- blooms and sword-like palm-leaves. Columns of great girth, bouquets
                        of conventional stamens, ending in <pb id="VAA3882-084" n="76"/> foliated
                        capitals, supported by the lofty ceiling. The few men gathered in council
                        were surrounded, over- shadowed, and dwarfed by monumental strength and
                        solemnity.</p>
                    <p>Behind a solid panel of carved cedar, which hedged the royal dais, stood
                        Meneptah. Above his head were the intricate drapings of a canopy of gold
                        tissue. On a level with his eyes, at his side, was the single torch. His
                        vision, like his father&apos;s, was defective. He was forty years old,
                        but appeared to be younger. His person was plump, and in stature he was
                        shorter than the average Egyptian. His coloring was high and of uniform
                        tint. The arch of the brow, and the conspicu- ous distance between it and
                        the eye below, the dis- dainful tension of the nostril and the drooping
                        comers of the mouth, gave his face the injured expression of a spoiled
                        child. The lips were of similar fullness and the chin retreated. There was
                        refinement in his face, but no force nor modicum of perception.</p>
                    <p>Below, with the light of the torch wavering up and down his robust figure,
                        was Har-hat; Meneptah&apos;s greatest general and now the new
                        fan-bearer. In re- pose his face was expressive of great good-humor.
                        Merriment lighted his eyes and the cut of his mduth . ,was for laughter. But
                        the smile seemed to be set and, furthermore, indicated that the fan-bearer
                        found much mirth in the discomfiture of others. Aside from this undefined
                        atmosphere of heartlessness, it can not be said that there was any craft or
                        wickedness patent on his face, for his features were good and indicative of
                        unusual intelligence. To the unobservant, he seemed <pb id="VAA3882-085"
                            n="77"/> to be a lovable, useful, able man. However, we have seen what
                        Mentu thought of him, and Mentu&apos;s estima- tion might have
                        represented that of all profound thinkers. But to the latter class, most
                        assuredly, Meneptah did not belong.</p>
                    <p>Har-hat, taking the place of the king during the Rebu war, had displayed such
                        generalship that the Pharaoh had rewarded him at the first opportunity with
                        the highest office, except the regency, at his command.</p>
                    <p>To the king&apos;s right, beside the dais, with a hand resting on the
                        back of a cathedra, or great chair, was the crown prince, Rameses. The old
                        courtiers of the dead grandsire, visiting the court of Meneptah, flung up
                        their hands and gasped when they beheld the heir to the double crown of
                        Egypt. They looked upon the old Pharaoh, renewed in youth and strength.
                        There were the same narrow temples with the sloping brow, the same hawked
                        nose, the same full lips, the same heavy eye with the smoldering ember in
                        its dusky depths. The only radical dissimilarity was the hue of the
                        prince&apos;s complexion. It was a strange, un- Egyptian pallor, an
                        opaque whiteness with dark shad- ows that belied the testimony of vigor in
                        his sinewy frame.</p>
                    <p>The old courtiers that were still attached to the court of Meneptah watched
                        with fascination the devel- opment of the heir&apos;s character. He was
                        twenty-two years old now and had proved that no alien nature had been housed
                        in the old Pharaoh&apos;s shape. If any pointed out the
                        prince&apos;s indolence as proving him un- like his grandsire the old
                        courtiers shook their heads and said: &quot;He does not reign as yet and
                        he but saves <pb id="VAA3882-086" n="78"/> his forces till the crown is
                        his.&quot; So Egypt, stagnated at the pinnacle of power by the accession
                        of Meneptah, began to look forward secretly to the reign of Rameses the
                        Younger, with a hope that was half terror.</p>
                    <p>To-night he stood in semi-dusk robed in festal at- tire, for somewhere a rout
                        awaited him. And of the groups of power and rank about him, none seemed to
                        fit that majestic council chamber so well as he. It was not the robe of
                        costly stuffs he wore, nor the trap- pings of jewels, which if he moved
                        never so slightly emitted a shower of. frosty sparks—but a peculiar
                        emanation of magnetism that at once repelled and at- tracted, and made him
                        master over the monarch him- self. He had never met repulse or defeat; he
                        had never entered the presence of his peer; he had never loved, he had never
                        prayed. He was a solitary power, who admitted death as his only equal, and
                        defied even him.</p>
                    <p>The other counselors were minor members of the cabinet, who had been
                        summoned, but expected only to hear and keep silence while the great powers—
                        the king, the prince, the priest and the fan-bearer— conferred.</p>
                    <p>Loi entered, bowing and walking with palsied step. At one time the three
                        central figures of the hall had been his pupils. He had taught them from the
                        sim- plest hieratic catechism to the initiation into the mys- teries. As
                        novices they had kissed his hand and borne him reverence. Now as the
                        initiated, exalted through the acquisition of power, it lay with them to
                        reverse conditions if they pleased. But as the old prelate prepared to do
                        obeisance before Meneptah, he was stayed with a gesture, and after a word of
                        greeting <pb id="VAA3882-087" n="79"/> was dismissed to his place. Rameses
                        saluted him with a motion of his hand and Har-hat bowed reverently. The
                        pontiff backed away to the great council table set opposite the throne and
                        was met there by a courtier with a chair.</p>
                    <p>At a sign from the king, who had already sunk into his throne, the old man
                        sat.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou bringest us tidings, holy Father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so, O Son of Ptah.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The priest moved a little uncomfortably and glanced at the ministers grouped
                        in the shadows.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Save for the worthy Har-hat and our prince, O my King, thou hast no
                        need of great council,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Meneptah raised his hand and the supernumerary ministers left the chamber.
                        When they were gone, Loi unwrapped the roll Kenkenes had brought and began
                        to read:</p>
                    <p>&quot;To Loi, the most high Servant of Amen, Lord of Tape, the Servant of
                        Ra, at On, sends greeting:</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods lend me composure to speak calmly with thee, O Brother.
                        And let the dismay which is mine explain the lack of ceremony in this
                        writing.</p>
                    <p> &quot;It is not likely that thou hast forgotten the good Queen Neferari
                        Thermuthis&apos; foster-son—the Hebrew Mesu, whom she found adrift in a
                        basket on Nilus. But lest the years have driven the memory of his mis- deeds
                        from my mind, I tell again the story. Thou knowest he was initiated a priest
                        of Isis, and scarce had the last of the mysteries been disclosed to him,
                        Sere it was seen that the brotherhood had taken an apostate unto itself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By the grace of the gods, he interfered in a brawl <pb
                            id="VAA3882-088" n="80"/> at Pithom and killed an Egyptian. Before he
                        could be taken he fled into Midian, and the secrets of our order were safe,
                        for a time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One by one our fellows have entered Osiris. The young who knew not
                        have filled their places. Thou and I, only, are left-and the Hebrew!</p>
                    <p>&quot;He hath returned!</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods make strong our hands against him! He went away as a
                        menace, but he returneth as a- pestilence. The demons of Amenti are with
                        him, and his hour is most propitious. He hath sunk himself in the
                        Israelitish pool here in the north, and he will breathe therefrom such
                        vapors as may destroy Egypt —faith—state—all!</p>
                    <p> &quot;The bond-people are already in ferment. There was mutiny at
                        Pa-Ramesu recently, when three hun- dred were chosen to work the quarries.
                        Moreover, the taskmasters are corrupt. The commander, one Atsu by name,
                        appointed when the chief Merenra became nomarch over Bubastis, hath disarmed
                        the under- drivers, removed the women from toil and restored many privileges
                        which are ruinous to law and order, The whole Delta is in commotion. The
                        nomad tribes near the Goshen country are agitated; communities of Egyptian
                        shepherds have been won over to the He- brew&apos;s cause, and now the
                        Israelitish renegade needs but to betray the secrets to bring such calamity
                        upon Egypt as never befell a nation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, Brother, he is within reach of an avenging hand! Commission
                        us, I pray thee, to protect themys- teries after any manner that to us
                        seemeth good. &quot;Despatch is urgent. He may fly again. Give us thine
                        answer as we have sent this to thee-by a noble- <pb id="VAA3882-089" n="81"
                        /> man—a swift and trusty one, and the blessings of the Radiant Three be
                        upon thy head.</p>
                    <p rend="center">&quot;Thy servant, the Servant of Ra,</p>
                    <p rend="right"> &quot;Snofru.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When the priest finished, the king was sitting up- right, his face flushed
                        with feeling.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Sedition!&quot; he exclaimed; &quot;organized rebellion in
                        the very heart of my realm!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He paused for a space and thrust back the heavy fringes of his cowl with a
                        gesture of peevish impa- tience.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What evil humor possesses Egypt?&quot; he burst forth
                        irritably. &quot;Hardly have I overthrown an invader be- fore my people
                        break out. I quiet them in one place and they revolt in another. Must I turn
                        a spear upon mine own?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he cried, stamping his foot, when the three before
                        him kept silence, &quot;have ye no word to say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>His eyes rested on Har-hat, with an imperious ex- pectation in them. The
                        fan-bearer bent low before he answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;With thy gracious permission-, O Son of Ptah,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;I would suggest that it were wise to cool an in- surrection in the
                        simmering. The disaffection seems to be of great extent. But the Rameside
                        army assem- bled on the ground might check an open insurrection.
                        Furthermore, thou hast seen the salutary effect of thy visit to Tape when
                        she forgot her duty to her sover- eign. Thy presence in the Delta would
                        undoubtedly expedite the suppression of the rebellion
                        likewise.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;O, aye,&quot; Meneptah declared. &quot;I must go to Tanis.
                        It seems that I must hasten hither and thither over <pb id="VAA3882-090"
                            n="82"/> Egypt pursuing sedition like a scent-hunting jackal. Mayhap if
                        I were divided like Osiris<ref id="ref_M" target="note_M">*</ref> and a bit
                        of me. scattered in each nome, I might preserve peace. But it goes sore
                        against me to drag the army with me. Hast thou any simpler plan to offer,
                        holy Father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old priest shifted a little before he answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The mysteries of the faith are in possession of Mesu,&quot; he
                        began at last. &quot;The writing saith he hath exerted great influence
                        over the bond-people—in truth he hath entered a peaceful land and stirred it
                        up—and time is but needed to bring the unrest to open warfare. Thou, O
                        Meneptah, and thou, O Rameses, and thou, O Har-hat, each being of the
                        brotherhood—ye know that we hold the faith by scant tenure in the respect of
                        the people.* Ye know the perversity of humanity. Obedience and piety are not
                        in them. Though they never knew a faith save the faith of their fathers, we
                        must pursue them with a gad, tickle them with pro- cessions and awe them
                        with manifestations. So if it were to come over the spirit of this Hebrew to
                        betray the mysteries, to scout the faith and overturn the gods, he would
                        have rabble Egypt following at his heels.</p>
                    <p>&quot;As the writing saith, he hath the destruction of the state in mind,
                        and his own aggrandizement. He but beginneth on the faith because he seeth
                        in that a rift wherein to put the lever that shall pry the whole state
                        asunder. So with two and a half millions of Hebrews and a horde of renegade
                        Egyptians to combat, I fear the Rameside army might spill more good blood
                        than <note id="note_M" place="foot" anchored="yes"><ref target="ref_M"

                        <pb id="VAA3882-091" n="83"/> is worth wasting on a mongrel multitude. The
                        rabble without a leader is harmless. Cut off the head of the monster, and
                        there is neither might nor danger in the trunk. Put away Mesu, and the
                        insurrection will subside utterly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The priest paused and Meneptah stroked the polished coping of the panel
                        before him with a nervous hand. There was complete silence for a moment,
                        broken at last by the king.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mesu, though a Hebrew, an infidel and a malefac- tor, is a prince
                        of the realm, my foster-brother—Nefer- ari&apos;s favorite son. I can
                        not rid myself of him on pro- vocation as yet misty and
                        indirect.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; he added after another pause, &quot;he shall not
                        die by hand of mine.&quot; The prelate raised his head and met the eyes
                        of the king. After he read what lay therein, the dissatisfaction that had
                        begun to show on his ancient face faded.</p>
                    <p>The Pharaoh settled back into his seat and his brow cleared as if the problem
                        had been settled. But sud- denly he sat up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What have I profited by this council? Shall I take the army or
                        leave it distributed over Egypt?&quot; he stopped abruptly and turned to
                        the crown prince. &quot;Help us, my Rameses,&quot; he said in a
                        softer tone. &quot;We had well-nigh forgotten thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rameses raised himself from the back of his cathe- dra, against which he
                        lounged, and moved a step for- ward.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A word, my father,&quot; he said calmly. &quot;Thy per-
                        plexity hath not been untangled for thee, nor even a thread pulled which
                        shall start it raveling. The priesthood can kill Mesu,&quot; he said to
                        Loi, &quot;and it will <pb id="VAA3882-092" n="84"/> do them no hurt.
                        And thou, my father, canst counte- nance it and seem no worse than any other
                        monarch that loved his throne. Thus ye will decapitate the monster. But
                        there be creatures in the desert which, losing one head, grow another. Mesu
                        is not of such exalted or supernatural villainy that they can not fill his
                        place. Wilt thou execute Israel one by one as it raises up a leader against
                        thee? Nay; and wilt thou play the barbarian and put two and a half million
                        at once to the sword?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The trio looked uncomfortable, none more so than the Pharaoh. The prince went
                        on mercilessly. &quot;Are the Hebrews warriors? Wouldst thou go against
                        a host of trowel-wielding slaves with an army that levels lances only
                        against free-born men? And yet, wilt thou wait till all Israel shall crowd
                        into thy presence and defy thee before thou actest? And again, wilt thou
                        descend on them with arms now when they may with justice cry &apos;What
                        have we done to. thee?&apos; Thou art beset, my father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Pharaoh opened his lips as if to answer, but the level eye of the prince
                        silenced him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast not fathomed the Hebrew&apos;s capabilities, my
                        father,&quot; Rameses continued. &quot;In him is a wealth, a power,
                        a magnificence that thy fathers and mine built up for thee, and the time is
                        ripe for the garnering of thy profit. What monarch of the sister nations
                        hath two and a half millions of hereditary slaves—not tribu- tary folk nor
                        prisoners of war—but slaves that are his as his cattle and his flocks are
                        his? What monarch before thee had them? None anywhere, at any time. Thou art
                        rich in bond-people beyond any monarch since the gods reigned.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-093" n="85"/>
                    <p>The chagrin died on the Pharaoh&apos;s face and he wore an expectant
                        look. The prince continued in even tones.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By use, they have fitted themselves to the limits laid upon them by
                        the great Rameses. The feeble have died and the frames of the sturdy have
                        become like brass. They have bred like beetles in the Nile mud for numbers.
                        Ignorant of their value, thou hast been indifferent to their existence.
                        Forgetting them was pampering them. They have lived on the bounty of Egypt
                        for four&apos; hundred years and, save for the wise inflictions of a
                        year or two by the older Pharaohs, they have flourished unmolested. How they
                        repay thee, thou seest by this writing. Now, by the gods, turn the face of a
                        master upon them. Remove the soft driver, Atsu, and put one in his stead who
                        is worthy the office. Tickle them to alacrity and obe- dience with the
                        lash—yoke them—load them—fill thy canals, thy quarries, thy mines with
                        them—&quot; He broke off and moved forward a step squarely facing the
                        Pharaoh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast thine artist-that demi-god Mentu, in whom there is
                        supernatural genius for architecture as well as sculpture. Make him thy

                        every rock-front that faces the Nile; thou canst erect a pyramid tomb for

                        lip!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The prince paused abruptly. Meneptah was on his feet, almost in tears at the
                        contemplation of his pictured greatness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mark ye &quot; the prince began again. His arm shot out and
                        fell and the flash of its jewels made it look like a bolt of lightning.
                        &quot;I would not fall heir to Israel—and if these things are done in
                        thy lifetime I must build my monuments with prisoners of war!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old hierarch, who had been nervously rubbing the arm of his chair during
                        the last of the prince&apos;s speech, broke the dead silence with an
                        awed whisper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, then spake the Incomparable Pharaoh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meneptah put out his hand, smiling.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile the scribe of the &quot;double house of life,&quot; and the
                        son of the royal sculptor were taking comfort on the palace-top beneath the
                        subdued light of a hooded lamp.</p>
                    <p>The pair had spoken of all Memphis and its gos- sip; had given account of
                        themselves and had caught up with the present time in the succession of
                        events.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hotep, at thy lofty notch of favor, one must have the wisdom of
                        Toth,&quot; Kenkenes observed, adding with a laugh, &quot;mark thou,
                        I have compared thee with no mortal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep shook his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, any man may fill my position so he but knows when to hold his
                        tongue and what to say when he wags it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, aye,&quot; the sculptor admitted in good-natured irony.
                        &quot;Those be simple qualifications and easy to combine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The scribe smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mine is no arduous labor now. During my years of apprenticeship I
                        was sorely put to it, but now I have only to wait upon the king and look to
                        it that mine underlings are not idle. If another war should come-if any
                        manner of difficulty should arise in mat- tersof state, I doubt not mine
                        would be a heavy lot.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-096" n="88"/>
                    <p>The young man spoke of war and fellowship with a monarch as if he had been a
                        lady&apos;s page and gossiped of fans and new perfumes.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes looked at hiT with a full realization of the incongruity of the
                        youth of the man and the weight of the office that was his.</p>
                    <p>But at close range the scribe&apos;s face was young only in feature and
                        tint. He was born of an Egyptian ard a Danaid, and the blond alien mother
                        had impressed her own characteristics very strongly on her son.</p>
                    <p>He had a plump figure with handsome curves, wav- ing, chestnut hair and a
                        fair complexion. Nose and, forehead were in line. The eyes were of that type
                        of gray that varies in shade with the mental state. His temper displayed
                        itself only in their sudden harden- ing into the hue of steel; content and
                        happiness made them blue. They were always steady and comprehend- ing, so
                        that whoever entered his presence for the first time said to himself:
                        &quot;Here is a man that discovers my very soul.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Whatever other blunder Meneptah might have made, he had redeemed himself in
                        the wisdom he displayed in choosing his scribe. Kenkenes had been led to ask
                        how Hotep hacdme to his place.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My superior, Pinem, died without a son,&quot; the scribe had
                        explained; &quot;and as my record was clean, and the princes had ever
                        been my patrons, the Pharaoh exalted me to the scribeship.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes had then set down a mark in favor of the princes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I doubt not,&quot; the scribe observed at last, &quot;that
                        my time of ease is short-lived.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The sculptor looked at him with inquiry in his eyes.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-097" n="89"/>
                    <p>&quot;When sedition arises and defies the Pharaoh in his audience
                        chamber,&quot; Hotep went on, &quot;it has reached the stage of a
                        single alternative—success or death. Dost know the Lady
                        Miriam?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Israelite?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw her this day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good. Now, look upon the scene. Thou knowest she is the sister of
                        Prince Mesu, and the favorite waiting-woman of the good Queen Thermuthis.
                        She has lived in obscurity for forty years, but this morning she swept into
                        the audience chamber, did majestic obeisance and besought a word
                        &apos;with him who was an infant in her maturity,&apos; she said.
                        The council chamber was filled with those gathered to welcome Har-hat.
                        Meneptah bade her speak. Hast thou ever heard an Israelitish
                        harangue?&quot; he broke off suddenly.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes shook his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, theirs is pristine oratory—occult eloquence,&quot; the
                        scribe said earnestly, &quot;and she is mistress of the art. She told
                        the history of Israel and catalogued its wrongs in a manner that lacked only
                        measure and mu- sic to make it a song. But, Kenkenes, she did not move us to
                        compunction and pity. When she had done, we had not looked on a picture of
                        suffering and oppres- sion, but of insulted pride and rebellion. Instead of
                        compunction, she awakened admiration, instead of pity, respect. For the
                        moment she represented, not a multitude of complaining slaves, but a race of
                        in- dignant peers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Meneptah—ah! the good king,&quot; the scribe went on,
                        &quot;was impressed like the rest of us. But finally he showed her that
                        the Israelites were what they were <pb id="VAA3882-098" n="90"/> by the
                        consent of the gods; that their unwillingness but increased the burden. He
                        pointed out the ex- ample of his illustrious sires as justification for his
                        course; enumerated some of their privileges,—the fer- tile country given
                        them by Egypt, and the freedom that was theirs to worship their own God,—and
                        sum- marily refused to indulge them further.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Then she became ominous. She bade him have a care for the welfare
                        of Egypt before he refused her. Her words were dark and full of evil
                        portent. The air seemed to winnow with bat-wings and to reek with vapors
                        from witch-potions and murmur with mystic formulas. Every man of us crept,
                        and drew near to his neighbor. When she paused for an answer, the king
                        hesitated. She had menaced Egypt and it stir- reth the heart of the father
                        when the child is threat- ened. He turned to Har-hat in his perplexity and
                        craved his counsel. The fan-bearer laughed good- naturedly and begged the
                        Pharaoh&apos;s permission to send her to the mines before she bewitched
                        his cattle and troubled him with visions. Har-hat&apos;s unconcern made
                        men of us all once more, but Meneptah shook his head. &apos;The name of
                        Neferari Thermuthis defends her,&apos; he said; &apos;let her go
                        hence&apos;.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;And I take no amelioration to my people?&apos; she
                        demanded. &apos;Nay,&apos; he replied, &apos;not in the smallest
                        part shall their labor be lessened.&apos;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Holy Isis, thou shouldst have seen her then, Ken- kenes! </p>
                    <p>&quot;She approached the very dais of the throne and, throwing up her
                        arms, flung her defiance into the face of her sovereign. It were treason to
                        utter her words again. I have seen men white and shaking from rage, <pb
                            id="VAA3882-099" n="91"/> but Meneptah never hath so much of temper to
                        display. Far be it from me to say that the king was afraid, but I tell you,
                        Kenkenes, mine own hair is not yet content to lie flat. She concentrated all
                        the denunciatory bitterness of the tongue and pronounced and gloried in the
                        doom of the dynasty, heaping the blame of its destruction upon the head of
                        Meneptah!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The scribe finished his story in a whisper. Kenkenes was by this time sitting
                        up, his eyes shining with in- terest and wonder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gods! Hotep, thou dost make me creep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Creep!&quot; the scribe responded heartily, &quot;never in
                        my life have I so wanted to flee a royal audience. When she had done, she
                        turned and swept from the presence and no man lifted a finger to stay
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For a moment there was an expressive silence be- tween the two young men. At
                        last Kenkenes broke it in a voice of intense admiration.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What an intrepid spirit! Small wonder that she did not heed the
                        condemnation of the rabble at mid- day—she who was fresh from a triumph over
                        the Pharaoh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep&apos;s eyes widened warningly and he shook his head.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay, hush me not, Hotep,&quot; Kenkenes went on in a reckless
                        whisper. &quot;I must say it. Would to the gods I had been there to copy
                        it in stone!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hush! babbler!&quot; the scribe exclaimed, his eyes twinkling
                        nevertheless, &quot;thine art will make an un- timely mummy of thee
                        yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes poured out his first glass of wine and set it down untasted. The
                        contemplated sacrilege in stone opposite Memphis confronted him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-100" n="92"/>
                    <p>&quot;If Egypt&apos;s lack of art does not kill me first,&quot;
                        he added in defense.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay,&quot; Hotep protested, &quot;why wouldst thou
                        perpetur ate the affront to the Pharaoh?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because it is history and a better delineation of the Israelitish
                        character than all the wordy chronicles of the historians could
                        depict,&quot; was the spirited reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But the ritual,&quot; Hotep began, with the assurance of a man
                        that feels he is armed with unanswerable- argument.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sing me no song of the ritual,&quot; Kenkenes broke in
                        impatiently. &quot;The ritual offends mine ears—my sight, my sense. We
                        have quarreled beyond any treaty-making—ever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The other looked at him with amazement and much consternation. </p>
                    <p>&quot;Art thou mad?&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but I am rebellious-as rebellious as the Israelite, for I have
                        already shaken my fist in the face of tire sculptor&apos;s canons. And
                        the time will come when the world will call my revolt just. I would there
                        were a chronicler, here, now, to write me down,. since I would be remembered
                        as the pioneer. I shall win no justification, in these days, perhaps only
                        perse- cution, but I would reap my reward of honor, though it be a thousand
                        years in coming.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou hast a grudge against the conventional forms and the rules of
                        the ritual?&quot; Hotep asked, after a thoughtful silence.</p>
                    <p> &quot;I have a distaste for the horrors it compels and am ignorant of
                        their use,&quot; Kenkenes answered stubbornly.
                        &quot;Kenkenes,&quot; the scribe began, &quot;Law is a most
                        inex- orable thing. It is the governor of the Infinite. It <pb
                            id="VAA3882-101" n="93"/> is a tyrant, which, good or bad, can demand
                        and en- force obedience to its fiats. It is a capricious thin and it drags
                        its vassal—the whole created world —after it in its mutations, or stamps the
                        rebel into the dust while the time-serving obedient ones applaud. So thou
                        hast set up resistance against a thing greater than gods and men and I can
                        not see thee undone. I love thee, but I should be an untrue friend did I
                        abet thee in thy lawlessness. Submit gracefully and thy cause shall have an
                        audience with Law some day—if it have merit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The young sculptor&apos;s face was passive, but his eyes were fixed sadly
                        on the remote stars strewn above him. He felt inexpressibly solitary. His
                        zest in his con- victions did not flag, but it seemed that the whole world
                        and the heavens had receded and left him alone with them.</p>
                    <p>Again Hotep spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is more court gossip,&quot; he began cheerily; as if no
                        word had been said that could depress the tone of the conversation.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes accepted the new subject gladly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Out with it,&quot; he said. &quot;Within the four walls of
                        my world I hear naught but the clink of mallet and falling
                        stone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The breach between Meneptah and Amon-meses, his mutinous brother,
                        may be healed by a wedding.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Of a surety—nay, and not of a surety, either, but mayhap. A match
                        between the niece of Amon-meses, the Princess Ta-user, and the heir,
                        Rameses.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes sat up again in his earnestness. &quot;Nay,&quot; he
                        exclaimed. &quot;Never!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-102" n="94"/>
                    <p>&quot;Wherefore, I pray thee?&quot; Hotep asked with a dep- recating
                        smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is no mating between the lion and the eagle; the stag and the
                        asp! They could not love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dreamy idealist!&quot; Hotep laughed. &quot;The half
                        of great marriages are moves of strategy, attended more by Set<ref
                            id="ref_O" target="note_O">*</ref> than Athor.&dagger; Ta-user is
                        mad for the crown, Rameses for undisputed power. Each has one of these two
                        desirable things to give the other.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And how shall they appease Athor?&quot; Kenkenes demanded
                        warmly. &quot;Ta-user loves Siptah, the son of Amon-meses, and Rameses
                        will crown whom he loves though he had a thousand other crown-loving,
                        treaty- dowered wives!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep smiled. &quot;I thought the four walls of thy world hedged thee,
                        but it seems thou art right well acquainted with royalty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Scoff!&quot; Kenkenes cried. &quot;But I can tell thee
                        this: Rameses will put his foot on the neck of Amon-meses if the pretender
                        trouble him, and will wed with a slave- girl if she break the armor over his
                        iron heart.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep laughed again and suggested another sub- ject.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The new fan-bearer,&quot; he began.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, what of him?&quot; Kenkenes broke in at once.
                        &quot;And shall we quarrel about him, also?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Dost thou know him?&quot; Hotep queried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Right well-from afar and by hearsay.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do thou express thyself first concerning him, and <note id="note_O"

                        <pb id="VAA3882-103" n="95"/> I shall treat thee to the courtier&apos;s
                        diplomacy if I agree not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I like him not,&quot; Kenkenes responded bluntly.</p>
                    <p>Hotep leaned toward him, with the smile gone from his face, the jest from his
                        manner, and laid his hand on the sculptor&apos;s. The pressure spoke
                        eloquently of hearty concord. &quot;But he has a charming
                        daughter,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes inspected his friend&apos;s face critically, but there was
                        nothing to be read thereon.</p>
                    <p>A palace attendant approached across the paved roof and bent before the
                        scribe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A summons from the Son of Ptah, my Lord,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;At this hour?&quot; Hotep said in some surprise as he arose.
                        &quot;I shall return immediately,&quot; he told Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; the sculptor observed, &quot;my time is nearly
                        gone. Let me depart now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so. I would go with thee. This will be no more than a note. If
                        it be more I shall put mine un- derlings to the task.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He disappeared in the dark. Kenkenes lay back on the divan and thought on the
                        many things that the scribe had told him. But chiefly he pondered on Har-
                        hat and the Israelite.</p>
                    <p>When Hotep returned he carried his cowl and man- tie, and a scroll.
                        &quot;I too, am become a messenger,&quot; he said, &quot;but I
                        am self-appointed. This note was to go by a palace courier, but I relieved
                        him of the task.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The pair made ready and departed through the still populous streets of Thebes
                        to the Nile. There they were ferried over to the wharves of Luxor.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-104" n="96"/>
                    <p>At the temple the porter conducted them into the chamber in which the ancient
                        prelate spent his short- ening hours of labor. He was there now, at his
                        table, and greeted the young men with a nod. But taking a second look at
                        Hotep, he beckoned him with a shaking finger.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didst bring me aught, my son?&quot; he asked as the scribe bent
                        over him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, holy Father; this message to the taskmaster over
                        Pa-Ramesu.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah,&quot; the old man said. &quot;Is that not yet
                        gone?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, the Pharaoh asks that thou insert the name of him whom thou
                        didst recommend for Atsu&apos;s place. The Son of Ptah had forgotten
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man pushed several scrolls aside and pre- pared to make the
                        addition.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But thou art weary, holy Father; let me do it,&quot; Hotep
                        protested gently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, nay, I can do it,&quot; the old man insisted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See!&quot; drawing forth a scroll unaddressed. &quot;I have
                        written all this in an hour. O aye, I can write with the young men
                        yet.&quot; He made the interlineation, rolled the scroll and sealed it.
                        &quot;I am sturdy, still.&quot; At that moment, he dropped his pen
                        on the floor and&apos; bent to pick it up, but was forestalled by Hotep.
                        Then he addressed the scrolls, carefully dried the ink with a sprinkling of
                        sand and delivered one to Hotep, the other to Kenkenes. &quot;This to
                        the king, and that to Snofru. The gods give thee safe journey,&quot; he
                        con- tinued to Kenkenes. &quot;Who art thou, my son?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am the son of Mentu, holy Father. My name is Kenkenes,&quot;
                        the young man answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mentu, the royal sculptor?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-105" n="97"/>
                    <p>Kenkenes bowed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but I am glad. I knew thy father, and since thou art of his
                        blood, thou art faithful. Let neither death nor feat overtake thee, for thou
                        hast the peace of Egypt in thy very hands. Fail not, I charge
                        thee!&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a reverent farewell, the two young men went forth.</p>
                    <p>A slender Egyptian youth went with them to the wharves and awakened the
                        sleeping crew of a bari.</p>
                    <p>Hotep they carried across and set ashore on the western side.</p>
                    <p>&quot;May the same favoring god that brought thee hither, grant thee a
                        safe journey home, my friend. The court comes to Memphis shortly. Till then,
                        farewell,&quot; said Hotep.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All Memphis will hail her illustrious son, O Hotep.
                        Farewell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was not long until the sculptor was drifting down toward Memphis under a
                        starry sky—the shadowy temples of Thebes hidden by the sudden closing-in of
                        the river-hills about her.</p>

                    <p>At sunrise the morning after his return from On, Kenkenes appeared at the
                        Nile, attended by a burden- bearing slave.</p>
                    <p>The first lean, brown boatman who touched his knee and offered his bari for
                        hire, Kenkenes patronized. The slave had eased his load into the boat and
                        Ken- kenes was on the point of embarking when a four- oared bari, which had
                        passed then like the wind a moment before, put about several rods above them
                        and returned to the group on shore.</p>
                    <p>A bent and withered servitor was standing in the bow of the boat, wildly
                        gesticulating, as if he feared Kenkenes would insist on pulling away despite
                        his efforts. The young man recognized the servant of Snofru, old Ranas.</p>
                    <p>The large bari was beached and the servitor alighted with agility and,
                        beckoning to Kenkenes, took him aside.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There has been an error—a grave error, concern- ing the
                        message,&quot; the old man began in excitement; &quot;but thou art
                        in no wise at fault. Yet mayhap thou canst aid us in unraveling the tangle.
                        See&quot;</p>
                    <p>He displayed the linen-wrapped roll, the covering split where Snofru had
                        opened it, but the wavering <pb id="VAA3882-107" n="99"/> hieratic
                        characters of the address in Loi&apos;s hand, still intact.</p>
                    <p>When the young sculptor had gazed, the old servant nervously undid the roll,
                        and showed within a letter to the commander over Pa-Ramesu, written in the
                        strong epistolary symbols of the royal scribe.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes frowned with vexation. Innocent and efficient though he had been,
                        the miscarriage of his mission stung him nevertheless. The blunder was not
                        long a mystery to him.</p>
                    <p>Summoning all the patience at his command, he recounted the events in the-
                        apartments of the ancient hierarch of Amen.</p>
                    <p> &quot;There were two scrolls,&quot; he explained; &quot;one to
                        the Servant of Ra at On, the other to Atsu. The holy father sealed them both
                        before he addressed them and confused the directions. The one which I should
                        have brought to thine august master, hath gone to the taskmaster over
                        Pa-Ramesu.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou madest all speed?&quot; the servant demanded, trembling
                        with eagerness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A half-day&apos;s journey less than the usual time I made in
                        returning. I doubt much, if the messenger with the other scroll hath passed
                        Memphis yet, since he may not have been despatched in such hot haste.
                        Furthermore, because of the festivities in Tape, it Should have been
                        well-nigh impossible for him to hire a boat until the next
                        day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This information kindled alight of hope on the old servant&apos;s
                        face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou givest me life again,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;The
                        blessings of Ra be upon thee!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Without further words he ran back to the boat, and <pb id="VAA3882-108"
                            n="100"/> the last Kenkenes saw of him, he was frantically urg- ing his
                        boatmen to greater speed, back to On.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes had come to the Nile that morning, re- joicing in the propitiousness
                        of his opportunity. Mentu was at that moment in On, seeing to the decora-
                        tion of the second obelisk reared by Meneptah to the sun. The great artist
                        had prepared to be absent a month, and had left no work for his son to do.
                        But the coming of Ranas with the news of his mission&apos;s failure had
                        filled Kenkenes with angry discomfiture.</p>
                    <p>He dismissed his slave and rowed down-stream toward Masaarah.</p>
                    <p>As he approached the abandoned wharf, a glance showed him that some effort
                        toward restoring it had been made. The overgrowth of vines had been cut away
                        and the level of the top had been raised by several fragments of rough
                        stone.</p>
                    <p>The tracks of heavy sledges had crushed the young grain across the field
                        toward the cliffs.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes stood up and looked toward the terraced front of the hills, in which
                        were the quarries.</p>
                    <p>There were dust, smoke, stir and moving figures.</p>
                    <p>The stone-pits were active again after the lapse of half a century.</p>
                    <p> &quot;By the grace of the mutable Hathors,&quot; the young man
                        muttered as he dropped back into his seat, &quot;my father may yet
                        decorate a temple to Set, but by the same favor, it seems that I shall be
                        snatched from the brink of a sacrilege.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He permitted his boat to drift while he contem- plated his predicament.
                        Suddenly he smote his hands together.</p>
                    <p>Grant me pardon, ye Seven Sisters!&quot; he exclaimed. <pb
                            id="VAA3882-109" n="101"/> &quot;I misread your decree. Ye have but
                        covered my tracks toward transgression.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a little thought he resumed his felicitations.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who of Memphis will think I come to Masaarah, save to look after
                        the taking out of stone? Is it not part of my craft? Nay, but I shall make
                        offering in the temple for this. And need any of these unhappy creatures in
                        Masaarah see me except as it pleases me to show myself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He seized his oars and rowed down the river another furlong. Leaving the
                        craft fixed in the tangle of herbage at the water&apos;s edge, he
                        shouldered his cargo and crossed the narrow plain to the cliffs below
                        Masaarah. There he made a difficult ascent of the&apos; fronts facing
                        the Nile and reached his block of stone without approaching the hamlet of
                        laborers.</p>
                    <p>Depositing his burden, he set forth to reconnoiter.</p>
                    <p>He descended again into the Nile valley by the way he had come and wandered
                        toward the mouth of the gorge. From a little distance he looked upon a scene
                        of great activity. In the shadow of one of the di- lapidated hovels, four
                        humped oxen stood, their heavy harness still hanging upon them, though the
                        sledges they drew, covered with stone dust and broken pieces, were some
                        distance away from them. A company of half a score of children were
                        ascending in single file, along a slanting plane of planks, into the hollow
                        in the cliff upon which work had been renewed. Along the rock-wall ahead of
                        them a scaffold had been erected and here were men drilling holes in the
                        stone, or driving wooden wedges into the holes already made, or pouring
                        water on the wedges as the skins the children bore were passed up to
                        them.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-110" n="102"/>
                    <p>Kenkenes picked his way through the debris of sticks, stones, dust and
                        cast-off water-skins, and serenely disregarding the stare of the laborers,
                        went up to the edge of the stone-pit and watched the work with interest. A
                        constant stream of broken stone rattled down under the scaffold and long
                        runlets of water fed an ever increasing pool in the depression before the
                        cliff. A single slab of irregular dimensions lay on the sand at the base of
                        a wooden chute, down which it had descended from the hollow in the cliff the
                        evening before. The cavity it left bade fair to enlarge by nightfall, for
                        the swelling wedges were rending another slab from its bedding with loud re-
                        ports and the sudden etching of fissures.</p>
                    <p>The young sculptor noted with some wonder that the laborers were
                        Israelites.</p>
                    <p>After a time Kenkenes turned away and addressed one of the bearded men at
                        that moment ascending the wooden plane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do ye here?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>The man answered in unready Egyptian, but, for an inferior, in a manner
                        curiously collected.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Pharaoh addeth to the burden of the chosen people. We dig stone
                        for a temple to the war-god.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The chosen people!&quot; Kenkenes repeated inquir- ingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The children of Israel,&quot; the Hebrew explained.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes lifted one eyebrow quizzically and went his way. As he leaped up
                        into the gorge he vaguely real- ized that he had seen no trace of an
                        encampment near the hamlet, which he knew to be uninhabitable.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth, the chosen people seem to follow me <pb
                            id="VAA3882-111" n="103"/> of late,&quot; he said to himself as he
                        rambled up the val- fey. &quot;Meneptah must have scattered them out of
                        Goshen into all the corners of Egypt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As he turned the last winding of the gorge he came upon a cluster of some
                        threescore tents, spread over the level pocket at the valley&apos;s end.
                        Almost against the northern wall the house of the commander had been built
                        to receive the earliest shadow of the afternoon. The military standard was
                        raised upon its roof and a scribe, making entries on a roll of linen, sat
                        cross- legged on a mat before the door. In one of the narrow ways between
                        the tents an old woman, very bowed and voluminously clad, prepared a great
                        hamper of lentils and another of papyrus root for the noonday meal. One or
                        two children sitting on the earth beside her rendered her assistance, and a
                        third kept the turf fire glowing under a huge bubbling caldron. Ken- kenes
                        passed through the camp by this narrow way and paused to look with much
                        curiosity at the ancient Israelite. Never had he seen any old person so
                        active or a slave so wrapped in covering. He hoped she would lift her head
                        that he might see her face; and even as he wished, she pierced him with a
                        look which, from her midnight eyes, seemed like lightning from a
                        thunder-cloud.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gods!&quot; he exclaimed as he retreated up the slope behind
                        the camp. And a moment later he continued his soliloquy in a voice that
                        struggled between mirth and amazement: &quot;Have I never seen an
                        Israelite until I beheld these twain, the Lady Miriam and that bent dart of
                        lightning in the valley? If these be Israelites I never saw one before. If
                        those cowed shepherds <pb id="VAA3882-112" n="104"/> that have strayed now
                        and again out of Goshen, be Hebrews, then these are not. And the gods shield
                        me from the disfavor of them, be they slaves or sibyls!&quot;</p>
                    <p>When he reached his block of stone he unrolled his load of equipments and set
                        to work without delay. He was remote from any possible interruption from
                        Memphis, and the slaves in the gorge and in the stone- pits had no
                        opportunity to come upon his sacrilege in idle hours. They would be held
                        like prisoners within the limits of the quarries. His sense of security had
                        been strengthened by the renewed activities in Masaa- rah.</p>
                    <p>With a shovel of tamarisk he cleared the slab of its drift of sand. He found
                        that the block broadened at the base and was separate from the sheet of rock
                        on which it stood. Among his supplies was a roll of reed matting, and with
                        this cut into proper lengths, he carpeted a considerable space about the
                        block. Pre- caution rather than luxury had prompted this pro- cedure, since
                        the chipped stone falling on the covering could be carried cleanly and at
                        once from the spot.</p>
                    <p>Pausing long enough to eat a thin slice of white bread and gazelle-meat, and
                        to drink a draft from the porous and ever cooling water bottle, he turned to
                        the protection and concealment of his statue.</p>
                    <p>The place was strewn with tolerably regular frag- ments, and the building of
                        a segment of wall to the north at the edge of the matting required more time
                        than strength or skill. He built solidly against the pen- etrative sand, and
                        as high as his head. The early after- noon blazed upon him and passed into-
                        themellower hours of the later day before he had finished. He hid his shovel
                        and two cylindrical billets of wood, such as <pb id="VAA3882-113" n="105"/>
                        were used to roll great weights, under the edge of his reed carpet, and his
                        preparations were complete. He wiped his brow, congratulating himself on the
                        snug- ness of his retreat and the auspicious beginning of his
                        transgression.</p>
                    <p>Weary and happy, he rowed himself back to Mem- phis and slept soundly on the
                        eve of a great offense against the laws of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>But the next day, when the young sculptor faced the moment of actual
                        creation, he realized that his goddess must take form from an unembodied
                        idea. The ritual had been his guide before, and his genius, set free to soar
                        as it would, fluttered wildly without direction. His visions were troubled
                        with glamours of the old conventional forms; his idea tantalized him with
                        glimpses of its perfect self too fleeting for him to grasp. The sensation
                        was not new to him. During his maturer years he had tried to remember his
                        mother&apos;s face with the same yearning and heart-hurt- ing
                        disappointment. But this time he groped after attributes which should shape
                        the features--he had spirit, not form, in mind; and the odds against which
                        his unguided genius must battle were too heroic for it to succeed without
                        aid. The young sculptor real- ized that he was in need of a model Stoically,
                        he ad- mitted that such a thing was as impossible as it was indispensable.
                        It seemed that he had met complete bafflement.</p>
                    <p>He took up his tools and returned to Memphis. ut each succeeding morning
                        found him in the desert&apos;- again, desperately hopeful--each
                        succeeding evening, in the city disheartened and silent.</p>
                    <p>So it followed for several days.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-114" n="106"/>
                    <p>On the sixth of January the festival in honor of the return of Isis from
                        Phenicia was celebrated in Mem- phis. Kenkenes left the revel in
                        mid-afternoon and crossed the. Nile to the hills. He found no content away
                        from his block of stone-no happiness before it. But he wandered back to the
                        seclusion of the niche that he might be moody and sad of eye in all
                        security.</p>
                    <p>The stone-pits were deserted. The festivities in Memphis had extended their
                        holiday to the dreary camp at Masaarah. Kenkenes climbed up to his re- treat
                        and remained there only a little time. The un- hewn rock mocked him.</p>
                    <p>He descended through the gorge and found that the Hebrews were but nominally
                        idle. A rope-walk had been constructed and the men were twisting cables of
                        tough fiber. The Egyptians lounged in the long shadows of the late afternoon
                        and directed the work with no effort and little concern. The young sculptor
                        overlooked the scene as long as it interested him and continued down the
                        valley toward the Nile.</p>
                    <p>Presently a little company of Hebrew children ap- proached, their bare feet
                        making velvety sounds in the silence of the ravine. Each balanced a ski nof
                        water on his head. The little line obsequiously curved out- ward to let the
                        nobleman pass, and one by one the sturdy children turned their luminous eyes
                        up to him, some with a flash of white teeth, some with a down- ward dip of a
                        bashful head. One of them disengaged a hand from his burden and swept a
                        tangle of moist black curls away from his eyes. The sun of the desert had
                        not penetrated that pretty thatch and the fore- head was as fair as a lotus
                        flower.</p>
                    <p>Cenkenes caught himself looking sharply at each <pb id="VAA3882-115" n="107"
                        /> face as he passed, for it contained somewhat of that for which he sought.
                        As he walked along looking after them he became aware that some one was near
                        him. He turned his head and stopped in his tracks.</p>
                    <p>He confronted his idea embodied—Athor, the Golden!</p>
                    <p>It was an Israelitish maiden, barely sixteen years old, but in all his life
                        he had never looked upon such beauty. He had gazed with pleased eyes on the
                        slender blush-tinted throats and wrists of the Egyptian beau- ties, but
                        never had he beheld such whiteness of flesh as this. He had sunk himself in
                        the depths of the dusky, amorous eyes of high-born women of Memphis, but
                        here were fathomless profundities of azure that abashed the heavens. He had
                        been very near to love- liest hair of Egypt, so close that its odorous
                        filaments had blown across his face and his artist senses had been caught
                        and tangled in its ebon sorcery. But down each side this broad brow was a
                        rippling wave of gold, over each shoulder a heavy braid of gold that fell,
                        straightened by its own weight, a span below the waist. The winds of the
                        desert had roughened it and the bright threads made a nimbus about the head.
                        Its glory overreached his senses and besieged his soul. Here was not
                        witchery, but exaltation.</p>
                    <p>Enraptured with her beauty, her perfect fulfilment of his needs, he realized
                        last the unlovely features of her presence. She balanced a heavy water
                        pitcher on her head and wore a rough surplice, more decorous than the dress
                        of the average bondwoman, but the habit of a slave, nevertheless. He had
                        halted directly in her path, and after a moment&apos;s hesitancy she
                        passed around him and went on.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-116" n="108"/>
                    <p>Immediately Kenkenes recovered himself and with a few steps overtook her.
                        Without ceremony he trans- ferred the heavy pitcher to his own shoulder. The
                        girl turned her perfect face, full of amazement, to him, and a wave of color
                        dyed it swiftly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy burden is heavy, maiden,&quot; was all he said.</p>
                    <p>The bulk of the jar on the farther shoulder made it necessary for him to turn
                        his face toward her, but she was uneasy under the intent gaze of his level
                        black eyes. She dropped behind him, but he slackened his pace and kept
                        beside her. For the moment he was no longer the man of pulse and
                        susceptibility but the ar- tist. Therefore her thoughts and sensations were
                        apart from his concern. The unfamiliar perfection of the Semitic countenance
                        bewildered him. He took up his panegyric. Never was a mortal countenance so
                        near divine. And the sumptuousness of her figure- its faultless curves and
                        lines, its lissome roundness, its young grace, the beauty of arm and neck
                        and ankle! Ah! never did anything entirely earthly dwell in so fair, so
                        splendid a form.</p>
                    <p>As they neared the camp the girl spoke to him for the first time. He
                        recognized in her voice the same serene tone he had noted in his talk with
                        the Hebrew some days before.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give me my burden now,&quot; she said. &quot;Thou hast
                        affronted thy rank for me, and I thank thee many times.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The sculptor paused and for a moment stood em- barrassed. It went sorely
                        against his gallantry to lay the burden again upon her and he said as
                        much.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, Egypt has no qualms against loading the <pb id="VAA3882-117"
                            n="109"/> Hebrew,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Wouldst thou put
                        thy na- tion to shame?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes opened his eyes in some astonishment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now am I even more loath,&quot; he declared. &quot;What art
                        thou called?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rachel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It hath an intrepid sound, but Athor would be- come thee better.
                        Now I am a sculptor from the city, come,to study thy women for a
                        frieze,&quot; he continued unblushingly, &quot;and I. would go no
                        farther in my search. Rachel repeated will be beauty multiplied. Let me see
                        thee once in a while,—to-morrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A sudden flush swept over her face and her eyes darkened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It shall not keep thee from thy labor,&quot; he added
                        persuasively.</p>
                    <p>The color deepened and she made a motion of dis- sent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay! thou dost not refuse me!&quot; he exclaimed, his
                        astonishment evident in his voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a surety,&quot; she replied. &quot;Give me my burden, I
                        pray thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dumb with amazement, too genuine to contain any anger, Kenkenes obeyed. As
                        she went up the shady gorge, walking unsteadily under the heavy pitcher, he
                        stood looking after her in eloquent silence.</p>
                    <p>And in eloquent silence he turned at last and con- tinued down the valley.
                        There was nothing to be said. His appreciation of his own discomfiture was
                        too large for any expression.</p>
                    <p>In a few steps he met the short captain who gov- erned the quarries. Kenkenes
                        guessed his office by <pb id="VAA3882-118" n="110"/> his dress. He was
                        adorned in festal trappings, for he had spent most of the day in revel
                        across the Nile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dost thou know Rachel, the Israelitish maiden?&quot; Kenkenes
                        asked, planting himself in the man&apos;s way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The yellow-haired Judahite?&quot; the man inquired, a little
                        surprised.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so,&quot; was the reply.</p>
                    <p>The soldier nodded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look to it that she is put to light labor,&quot; the sculp- tor
                        continued, gazing loftily down into the narrow eyes. The soldier squared off
                        and inspected the nobleman. It did not take him long to acknowledge the
                        young sculptor&apos;s right to command.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It does not pay to be tender with an Israelite,&quot; the man
                        answered sourly.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes thrust his hand into the folds of his tunic over his breast and,
                        drawing forth a number of golden rings strung on a cord, jingled them
                        musically.</p>
                    <p>The soldier grinned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That will coax a man out of his dearest preju- dice. I will put her
                        over the children.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes dropped the money into the man&apos;s palm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall have an eye to thee,&quot; he said warningly.
                        &quot;Cheat me not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went his way. The incident restored to him the power of speech.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, by Horus,&quot; he began, &quot;am I to be denied by
                        an Israelite that which the favoring Hathors designed I should have? Not
                        while the arts of strategy abide within me. The children, I take it, will
                        come here with the water,&quot; he cogitated, stamping upon the wet and
                        deserted ledge which he had reached, &quot;and here will she be,
                        also.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-119" n="111"/>
                    <p>He raised his eyes to the ragged line of rocks top- ping the northern wall of
                        the gorge.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall perch myself there like a sacred hawk and filch her
                        likeness. Nay, now that I come to ponder on it, it is doubtless better that
                        she know naught about it. She might drop certain things to the Egyptians
                        here- about that would lead to mine undoing. The gods are with me, of a
                        truth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He descended into the larger valley and went sing- ing toward the Nile.</p>

                    <p>One late afternoon, in the streets of Pa-Ramesu, a curious new-comer bowed
                        before Atsu, the commander of Israel of the treasure city. The visitor was
                        old and tremulous from fatigue, and the stains of hard travel were evident
                        upon him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Greeting, Atsu. The peace of the divine Mother attend
                        thee,&quot; he said. &quot;Snofru, the beloved of Ra at On, sends
                        thee greeting by his servant, Ranas.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Greeting,&quot; the taskmaster replied, after he had in-
                        spected the white-browed servant. &quot;The shelter of my roof and the
                        bread of my board are thine;&quot; adding after a little pause,
                        &quot;and in truth thou seemest to need these things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man smiled an odd wry smile and followed lamely after the long
                        swinging stride of the comman- der toward the headquarters on the knoll.</p>
                    <p>Within the house of Atsu, Ranas delivered into the hands of the soldier the
                        message that Kenkenes had brought to Snofru. While Atsu undid the roll the
                        old servant made voluble apologies for the broken seal. The commander
                        stepped to the doorway for better light and read the writing.</p>
                    <p>The old servant back in the dusk of the interior saw the stern face harden,
                        the heavy brows knit blackly,, the dusky red fade from the cheek. Ranas knew
                        what <pb id="VAA3882-121" n="113"/> the soldier read, for he had had the
                        roll with its broken seal, from On to Memphis and from Memphis back to On
                        again. But with all his astuteness he could not have guessed what extremes
                        of wrath and grief the insulted taskmaster suffered. The sheet rolled itself
                        together again and was broken and crushed in the iron fingers that gripped
                        it. Presently he tossed it aside. Hardly had it left his hand before he
                        hastened to pick it up, straightened it out and re-read it feverishly. He
                        forgot the old servant; but had he remembered the man&apos;s curious
                        gaze, no resolution could have hidden that joy which slowly wrote itself
                        upon his face. There was balm in the barb for all the wound it made. This is
                        what he read:</p>
                    <p>&quot;To Atsu, Commander over the Builders of Pa- Ramesu, These: To mine
                        ears hath come report of mutiny and idleness through thy weak government of
                        my bond-people. Also that thou hast enforced my commands but feebly, and so
                        defeated my purposes, which were my sire&apos;s, after whose illustrious
                        example I reign.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For these and kindred inefficiencies art thou re- moved from the
                        government over Pa-Ramesu.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hereby bestow upon thee another office within the limits of thy
                        capacity. Thou wilt take up the flagellum over Masaarah when thou hast
                        surrendered Pa- Ramesu to thy successor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By this thou shalt learn that the Pharaohs will Be ably served.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Horemheb of Bubastis, thy successor, accompanieth these.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give him honor. <hi rend="right">MENEFPTAH,&quot;</hi></p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-122" n="114"/>
                    <p>The diction was manifestly the king&apos;s. None other of high estate
                        would have inspired so spiteful a letter. But the appointment to Masaarah
                        made Atsu forget the sting in the second reading. To Masaarah! To Masaarah
                        and Rachel! He folded the broken sheet and thrust it into his bosom. Meeting
                        the keen eye of his guest, the color rushed back to the
                        taskmaster&apos;s face and he summoned two attendant Hebrews to wait
                        upon the old man while he went forth to gain compo- sure in the air.</p>
                    <p>After the old man had been fed and given such other comfort as the
                        soldier&apos;s house afforded, the task- master returned. Then Ranas
                        shifted his position so that he might watch his host&apos;s face most
                        intelligently, and turned to the real purpose of his visit.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou canst see, my master, that if thy message bore the wrapping
                        for the epistle to Snofru, the mes- sage to the holy father must have borne
                        thy name. Thou hast received no letter as yet which was not intended for
                        thee?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The question was delivered politely, but the old man thrust his curious face
                        forward and shook his head with a combination of interrogation and dissent,
                        which was highly insincere.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have received naught which was not intended for me,&quot; the
                        taskmaster replied warmly.</p>
                    <p>After a moment&apos;s intent contemplation of Atsu&apos;s face the
                        courier went on: &quot;Nay, so had I thought. The messenger came to
                        Snofru with all speed and out- stripped the courier bound for Pa-Ramesu. It
                        is even as I had thought. He may arrive shortly, but I must tarry till he
                        comes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Atsu assented bluntly, and after, that if they talked <pb id="VAA3882-123"
                            n="115"/> it was of impersonal things and in a desultory manner. When
                        night came Atsu called his attendants and had the weary old man put to bed
                        in a curtained corner of the house. For himself there was-no sleep:</p>
                    <p>At midnight there came the beat of hoofs on the dust-muffled ways of
                        Pa-Ramesu. A sentry knocked at the door of the commander and announced a
                        visitor. Atsu, who still sat under the unextinguished reed light, greeted
                        the new-comer with an exclamation of con- cern. The man was covered with
                        dust, his dress was torn and bloody, his right hand swathed in cloths, and
                        his lip, right cheek and eye were swollen and dis- colored.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By Horus, friend, thou lookest ill-used,&quot; the task- master
                        exclaimed. &quot;What has befallen thee?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Naught—naught of any lasting hurt,&quot; the new- comer replied
                        carelessly. &quot;We were set upon by a troop of murdering Bedouins this
                        side of Bubastis and had a pretty fight.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, thou hast the stamp of its beauty upon thy face. A slave,
                        here, with some balsam,&quot; Atsu contin- ued, addressing the sentry,
                        &quot;and a captain of the con- stabulary next. We will cure these
                        Bedouins and their hurt at once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; the visitor protested. &quot;It is only a spear-
                        slit in my hand, and a flying stirrup marred my face. I am well. Look to the
                        Bedouins, however; they ran our messenger through—Set consume
                        them!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Doubt not, we shall look to them. They grow strangely insolent of
                        late.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Small wonder,&quot; the other responded heartily. &quot;Is
                        not the whole north a seething pot of lawlessness; and by the demons of
                        Amenti, is not the Israelite the fire <pb id="VAA3882-124" n="116"/> under
                        the, caldron? Nay, but I shall have especial joy in damping
                        him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The man laughed and dropped into the chair Atsu had offered him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then thou art Horemheb, the new taskmaster over
                        Pa-Ramesu?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So! has my news outridden me?&quot; the man ex- claimed in very
                        evident amazement.</p>
                    <p>Ranas, indifferently clad in a hastily donned kamis; at this moment parted
                        the curtains of his retreat and came forth with an apologetic courtesy.</p>
                    <p> &quot;And thy messenger, sir? What of him?&quot; he asked
                        eagerly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dead, and left at a wayside house.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;And the message?&quot; the old man persisted.</p>
                    <p>Horemheb surveyed him with increasing astonish- ment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where hast thou these tidings?&quot; he demanded.
                        &quot;They are scarce three hours old. Who reached thee with them before
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Atsu interposed and explained the interchange of letters.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Horemheb. &quot;So the correct message came
                        to thee, nevertheless, good Atsu. But I can not tell thee aught of the
                        other. It is lost.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lost!&quot; Ranas shrieked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gods! old man. It was only pigment and papyrus,&apos; not gold
                        or jewels. A kindly disposed Hebrew came to our help with some of his
                        people, and we put the Bedouins to flight. But after the struggle, search as
                        we might with torches which the Hebrew brought, the message was not to be
                        found. A Bedouin made off with it, I doubt not.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-125" n="117"/>
                    <p>Ranas stood speechless for an instant, and then he rushed up to the new
                        taskmaster.</p>
                    <p>&quot;His name?&quot; he demanded fiercely. &quot;The Hebrew!
                        What was he like? Where does he dwell?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A-murrain on the maniac!&quot; Horemheb exploded. &quot;He
                        called himself Aaron!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ranas staggered against the wall for support and beat the air with his
                        arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aaron, the brother of Mesu! O ye inscrutable Hathors!&quot; he
                        babbled. &quot;A Bedouin made off with it! Oh! Oh! What
                        idiocy!&quot;</p>

                    <p>The next morning after his meeting with the golden- haired Israelite,
                        Kenkenes came early to the line of rocks that topped the north wall of the
                        gorge and, en- sconced between the gray fragments, looked down un- seen on
                        her whenever she came to the valley&apos;s mouth. All day long the
                        children came staggering up from the Nile, laden with dripping hides, or
                        returned in a free and ragged line down the green slope of the field to the
                        river again.</p>
                    <p>Vastly more simple and time-saving would have been one of the capacious water
                        carts. But what would have employed these ten youthful Hebrews in the event
                        of such improvement? There was to be no labor-saving in the quarries.
                        Therefore, through the dust, up the weary slanting plane, again and again
                        till the day&apos;s work amounted to a journey of miles, the Hebrew
                        children toiled with their captain and co- laborer, Rachel.</p>
                    <p>At the summit of the wooden&quot; slope the beautiful Israelite, who had
                        preceded her charges, passed up the burden of each one to the Hebrews on the
                        scaffold. From his aery Kenkenes watched this particular phase of her tasks
                        with interest. She was not too far from him for the details of her movements
                        to be distinguish- <pb id="VAA3882-127" n="119"/> able, and the posture of
                        the outstretched arms and lifted face fulfilled his requirements. He
                        abandoned the modeling of her features for that day and copied the attitude.
                        Once in the morning and once in the afternoon a countryman of hers, strong,
                        young and but lightly bearded, stepped down from his place on the scaffold
                        and relieved her. The sculptor noted the act with some degree of disquiet,
                        hoping that the graceful protests of the girl might prevail. When the
                        stalwart Hebrew overrode her remonstrances, and mo- tioned her toward a
                        place at the side of the frame-work where she might rest, the young sculptor
                        frowned im- patiently. But his humane heart chid him and he waited with some
                        assumption of grace till she should take up her burden again.</p>
                    <p>At sunset he retired cautiously, but several dawns found him among the rocks,
                        with reed pen, papyri and molds of clay. When he climbed to his retreat
                        within the walls of stone, on the hillside in the late afternoon, he hid
                        several studies of the girl&apos;s head and statuettes of clay under the
                        matting.</p>
                    <p>At last he began the creation of Athor the Golden. For days he labored
                        feverishly, forgetting to eat, fretting because the sun set and the darkness
                        held sway for so long. Having overstepped the law, he placed no limit to the
                        extent of his artistic transgression.</p>
                    <p>After choosing nature as his model, he followed it slavishly. On the occasion
                        of his initial departure from the accepted rules, he had never dreamed it
                        pos- sible to disregard ritualistic commandments so abso- lutely. He even
                        ignored the passive and medita- tive repose, immemorial on the carven
                        countenances of Egypt.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-128" n="120"/>
                    <p>The face of Athor, as she put forth her arms to re- ceive the sun, must show
                        love, submission, eagerness and-great appeal.</p>
                    <p>As Kenkenes said this thing to himself, he lowered chisel and mallet and
                        paused. Posture and form would avail nothing without these emotions written
                        on the face. He began to wonder if he might carve them, unaided. He had not
                        found them in the Israelite, and he confessed to himself, with a little
                        laugh, a doubt that he should ever see them on her countenance. Then a
                        vagabond impulse presented itself unbidden in his mind and was frowned down
                        with a blush of apology to himself. And yet he remembered his co- quetry
                        with the Lady Ta-meri as some small defense in the form of precedent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; he replied to this evidence, &quot;it is a
                        different woman. Between myself and Ta-meri it is even odds, and the
                        vanquished will have deserved his defeat.&quot; That evening-it was
                        several days after the face of the goddess had begun to emerge from the
                        block of stone-he went to the upper end of the gorge and passed through the
                        camp on lis way home, that he might meet his model.</p>
                    <p>The laborers had not returned from the quarries, though the evening meal
                        bubbled and fumed over the fires in the narrow avenue between the tents.
                        Ken- kenes passed by on the outskirts of the encampment and went on.</p>
                    <p>Deep shadow lay on the stone-pits when Kenkenes reached the mouth of the
                        gorge, and a cool wind from the Nile swept across the grain. The
                        day&apos;s work had been prolonged in the towering of a huge slab from
                        its position in its native bed. The monolith was already <pb
                            id="VAA3882-129" n="121"/> on the brink of the wooden incline, and every
                        man was at the windlasses by which the cables controlling its descent were
                        paid out. Kenkenes saw at a glance that none of the water-bearers was
                        present, and he knew the lovely Israelite was with them. He did not
                        pause.</p>
                    <p>Before the sound of the quarry stir had been left behind he heard a sharp
                        report, the frightened shrieks of women and shouts of warning. He looked
                        back in time to see the huge stone turn part way round on the chute and
                        rush, end first, earthward. Expectant silence fell, broken only by the
                        vicious snarl of a flying wind- lass crank. But in an instant the great slab
                        struck the earth with a thunderous sound that reverberated again and again
                        from the barren hills about. A vast all- enveloping cloud of dust and earth
                        filled the hollow quarry like smoke from an explosion. But there was no
                        further outcry, and through the outskirts of the lift- ing cloud men were
                        seen making deliberate prepara- tions to repair the parted cable. Assured
                        that no cal- amity had occurred, Kenkenes went on.</p>
                    <p>In a few steps he met the children water-bearers flying to the scene of the
                        accident. Not one of them bore a water-skin. The excited young Hebrews did
                        not stop to question the sculptor, but ran on, and were swallowed up in
                        dust.</p>
                    <p>Half-way to the Nile he came upon her whom he sought. She was standing alone
                        in the midst of ten sheepskins, and the grain was wetted with the spilled
                        water. He pointed to the discarded hides about her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The camp will go thirsty if the runaways do not return,&quot;
                        he said. &quot;Thy burden is too heavy for even me
                        to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;They will return,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-130" n="122"/>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, it was naught but a parting cable and a falling rock. I was
                        near and saw no evidence of disaster. Had the children asked me, I should
                        have told them as much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They will return,&quot; she repeated, and Kenkenes fan- cied
                        that there was a dismissal in this quiet repetition. But he did not mean to
                        see it. He went on, with a smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am glad they did not stop, for I wanted to see thee, with that
                        frightened longing of a man who hath resolved on confession and meeteth his
                        confessor on a sudden. Now that the moment hath arrived I mar- vel how I
                        shall make my peace with Athor, whose command I most deliberately
                        broke.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She raised her beautiful eyes to his face and waited for him to proceed. The
                        pose of the head was exactly. what he wanted. Rapidly he compared every
                        detail of her face with his memory of the statue of Athor, not- ing with
                        satisfaction that his studies had been happily faithful. His scrutiny was so
                        swift and skilful that there seemed to be nothing unusual in his gaze.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am culpable but impenitent,&quot; he continued. &quot;I
                        shall not forswear mine offense. Neither is there any need of a plea to
                        justify myself, for my very sin is its own justification. Behold me! I
                        perched myself like a sacred hawk at the mouth of the valley and filched thy
                        likeness. Do with me as thou wilt, but I shall die reiterating approval of
                        my deed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His extravagant speech wrought an interesting change on the face before him.
                        There was a pro- nounced curve of her mouth, a slight tension in the
                        chiseled nostril-in fact, an indefinable disdain that had not been there
                        before. It would become Athor <pb id="VAA3882-131" n="123"/> well. Kenkenes
                        understood the look but he did not flinch. Instead he let his head drop
                        slowly until he looked at her from under his brows. Then he sum- moned into
                        his eyes all the wounded feeling, pathos, soft reproach and appeal, of which
                        his graceless young heart was capable, and gazed at her.</p>
                    <p>Khufu might have been as easily melted by the twin- kle of a rain drop. Never
                        in his life had he faced such comprehensive contemplation. Calm, monumental
                        and icy disdain deepened on every feature.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes stood motionless and suffered her to look at him. Being a man of
                        fine soul, the eloquent gaze spoke well-deserved rebuke. He knew that his
                        color had risen, and his eyes fell in spite of heroic efforts to keep them
                        steady. His sensations were unique; never had he experienced the like. When
                        he recovered himself her blue eyes were fixed absently on the dis- tant
                        quarries.</p>
                    <p>Every impulse urged him to set himself right in the eyes of this most
                        discerning slave.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wilt thou forgive me?&quot; he asked earnestly. &quot;I
                        would I could make thee know I crave thy good will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was no mistaking the honesty in these words. Her face relaxed
                        instantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I fear I have not set about it wisely,&quot; he added.
                        &quot;Let me give thee a peace-offering to prove my con-
                        trition.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He slipped from about his neck the collar of golden rings and moved forward
                        to put it about her throat.</p>
                    <p>She drew back, her face flushing hotly under an ex- pression of positive
                        pain.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes dropped his hands to his sides with a limpness highly suggestive of
                        desperate perplexity. <pb id="VAA3882-132" n="124"/> Was not this a slave?
                        And yet here was the fine feel- ing of a princess. He stood, for once in his
                        life, at a loss what to do. He could not depart without the greatest
                        awkwardness, and yet, if he lingered, he sacri- ficed his comfort. Presently
                        he exclaimed helplessly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rachel, do thou tell me what to say or do. It seems that I but sink
                        myself the deeper in the quicksand of thy disapproval at every struggle to
                        escape. Do thou lead me out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had met a slave, justed with an equal and flung up his hands in surrender
                        to his better. He did not confess this to himself, but his words were
                        admission enough. Never would his high-born spirit have per- mitted him to
                        make such a declaration to one slavish in soul.</p>
                    <p>The straightforward acknowledgment of defeat and the genuine concern in his
                        voice were irresistible. She answered him at once, distantly and calmly.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou, as an Egyptian, hast honored me, a Hebrew, with thy notice.
                        I have deserved neither gift nor fee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but let us put it differently,&quot; he replied.
                        &quot;I, as a man, have given thee, a maiden, offense, and hav- ing
                        repented, would appease thee with a peace-offer- ing. Believe me, I do not
                        jest. By the gentle god- desses, I fear to speak,&quot; he added
                        breathlessly.</p>
                    <p>The Israelite&apos;s blue eyes were veiled quickly, but the Egyptian
                        guessed aright that she had hidden a smile in them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Am I forgiven?&quot; he persisted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So thou wilt offend no further,&quot; she said without raising
                        her eyes.</p>
                    <p> &quot;I promise. And now, since the goddess hath re- fused mine
                        offering, I may not take it back. What <pb id="VAA3882-133" n="125"/> shall
                        I do with this?&quot; he asked, holding up the collar of gold.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Put it about thy statue&apos;s neck,&quot; she said
                        softly.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes gasped and retreated a step. Instantly she was imploring his
                        pardon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was a forward spirit in me that made me say it. I pray thee,
                        forgive me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast given no offense, but how dost thou know of this-tell me
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I came upon it by accident three days ago. Several of the children
                        had gone fowling for the taskmaster&apos;s meal, and were so long absent
                        that I was sent to look for them. The path down the valley is old, and I
                        have followed it with the idea of labor ever in my mind. And this was a
                        moment of freedom, so I thought to spend it where I had not been a slave. I
                        went across the hills, and, being unfamiliar with them, lost my way. When I
                        climbed upon one of the great rocks to overlook the labyrinth, lo! at my
                        feet was the statue. I knew myself the moment I looked, and it was not hard
                        to guess whose work it was.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She paused and looked at him with appeal on her face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast told no one?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; was the quick and earnest answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast caught me in a falsehood,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>The statement was almost brutal in its directness. But the question that came
                        back swiftly was not less pointed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There was no frieze of bondmaidens—naught of anything thou hast
                        told me?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay, not anything. I am carving a statue against the canons of the
                        sculptor&apos;s ritual for the sake of my <pb id="VAA3882-134" n="126"/>
                        love of beauty. Until thou didst come upon it, I alone possessed the secret.
                        Thou knowest the punishment which will overtake me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, I know right well. Yet fear not. The statue is right cunningly
                        concealed and none will ever find it, for the children were unsuccessful and
                        the meals for the overseer will be brought him from the city here- after.
                        And I will not betray thee—I give thee my word.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her tone was soft and earnest; her assurances were spoken so confidently, her
                        interest was so genuine, that a queer and unaccountable satisfaction
                        possessed the young artist at once.</p>
                    <p>At this moment the runaway water-bearers came in sight and in obedience to
                        very evident dismissal in the Israelite&apos;s eyes, Kenkenes bade her
                        farewell and left her.</p>
                    <p>But he had not gone two paces before she overtook him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Approach thy work from various directions,&quot; she cautioned,
                        &quot;else thou wilt wear a path which may spy on thee one
                        day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The moment the words passed her lips, Kenkenes, who still held the collar,
                        put it about her neck, passing his hands under the thick plaits, and snapped
                        the clasp accurately.</p>
                    <p>The act was done instantly, and with but a single movement. He was gone,
                        laughing on his way, be- fore she had realized what he had done.</p>
                    <p>There was revel in the young man&apos;s veins that evening, but the great
                        house of his father was silent and lonely. If he would find a companion he
                        must leave its heavy walls. His resolution was not long in <pb
                            id="VAA3882-135" n="127"/> making nor his instinct slow in directing
                        him. An hour after the evening meal, when he entered the chariot that
                        waited, he had laid aside the simple tunic, and in festal attire was, every
                        inch of his many inches, the son of the king&apos;s favorite artist. His
                        charioteer drove in the direction of the nomarch&apos;s house.</p>
                    <p>The portress conducted him into the faintly lighted chamber of guests and
                        went forth silently. Kenkenes interpreted her behavior at once.</p>
                    <p> &quot;There is another guest,&quot; he thought with a smile,
                        &quot;and I can name him as promptly as any chanting sorcerer
                        might.&quot; When the serving woman returned she bade him follow her and
                        led the way to the house- top.</p>
                    <p>There, under the subdued light of a single lamp, was the Lady Ta-meri; at her
                        feet, Nechutes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should wear the symbol-broidered robe of a soothsayer,&quot;
                        the, sculptor told himself.</p>
                    <p> &quot;You made a longer sojourn of your visit to Tape than you had
                        intended,&quot; the lady said, after the greet- ings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I have been in Memphis twenty days at least.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So?&quot; queried Nechutes. &quot;Where dost thou keep
                        thyself?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;In the garb of labor among the ink-pots and papyri of the sculptor
                        class,&quot; the lady answered. &quot;I warrant there are pigment
                        marks on his fingers even now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes extended his long right hand to her for inspection. She received it
                        across her pink palm and scrutinized it laughingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I take it back. Here is naught but henna and a suspicion of
                        attar. He has been idle these days.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-136" n="128"/>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou forgotten the efficacy of the lemon in the removal of
                        stains?&quot; the sculptor asked with a smile. &quot;</p>
                    <p>The lady frowned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give us thy news from Tape, then,&quot; she demanded, putting
                        his hand away.</p>
                    <p> &quot;The court is coming to Memphis sooner. That is all. O, aye, I had
                        well-nigh forgot. There is also talk of a marriage between Rameses and
                        Ta-user.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Fie!&quot; the lady scoffed. &quot;Nechutes hath more to
                        tell than that, and he hath stayed in Memphis.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou wilt come to realize some day, Ta-meri, that I am fitted to
                        the yoke of labor, when I fail thee in all the nicer walks thou wouldst iave
                        me tread. Come, out with\thy gossip, Nechutes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I had a letter from Hotep to-day—a budget of news, included with
                        official matters with which the king would acquaint me. Ta-user, with
                        Amon-meses and Siptah, hath joined the court at Tape—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And Siptah, she brought with her—&quot; the sculptor
                        interrupted softly.</p>
                    <p>Nechutes cast an expressive look at Kenkenes and went on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And the courting hath begun.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Silence fell, and the lady looked at the two young men with wonder in her
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but that is interesting,&quot; Kenkenes admitted,
                        recovering himself. &quot;Tell me more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The offices of cup-bearer and murket are to be be- stowed in
                        Memphis,&quot; Nechutes continued.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And the one falls to Nechutes,&quot; the lady declared
                        triumphantly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-137" n="129"/>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth thou hast a downy lot before thee, Nechutes,&quot;
                        the young sculptor said heartily. &quot;And never one so deserving of
                        it. I give thee joy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And the other goes to the noble Mentu,&quot; Nechutes added in
                        a meek voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sphinx!&quot; Ta-meri cried, tapping him on the head.
                        &quot;You did not tell me that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The surprised delight of Kenkenes was not so be- wildering as to blind him to
                        the reason why Nechutes had withheld this news from Ta-meri. The blunt
                        Egyptian was not anxious to speed his rival&apos;s cause.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does my father know of this?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I doubt not. The same messenger that brought me news of mine own
                        appointment departed for On when he learned that Mentu was
                        there.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay, but that will be wine in his veins,&quot; Kenkenes mused
                        happily. &quot;It will make him young again. His late inactivity hath
                        chafed him sorely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have come honestly by your labor-loving,&quot; Nechutes
                        commented. &quot;Hotep adds further that Mentu is the only one of the
                        king&apos;s new ministers that is no longer a young man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is Rameses who counsels him, I doubt not,&quot; the sculptor
                        replied. &quot;He hath great faith in the powers of youth. And behold
                        what a cabinet he hath built up for his father. First,&quot; Kenkenes
                        continued, enumerat- ing on his fingers, &quot;there is
                        Nechutes—&quot;</p>
                    <p>The new cup-bearer waved his hand, and Kenkenes went on.</p>
                    <p> &quot;There is my father, the murket. He needs no fur- ther praise than
                        the utterance of his name. There is Hotep, on whose lips Toth abideth. There
                        is Sene- <pb id="VAA3882-138" n="130"/> feru, the faithful, whom the Rebu
                        dreads. Next is Kephren, the mohar,<ref id="ref_P" target="note_P">*</ref>
                        who would outshine his father, the right hand of the great Rameses had he
                        but na- tions to conquer. After him, Har-hat—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold! He is not appointed of the prince. He was Meneptah&apos;s
                        choice—and his alone,&quot; Nechutes inter- rupted. &quot;It is
                        rumored that Rameses is not over-fond Shim.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He will be put to it to hold his high place in the face of the
                        prince&apos;s disfavor,&quot; Kenkenes cogitated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but he presses the prince hard for general- ship. It must be
                        so, since he could win the king&apos;s good will over the protest of
                        Rameses. So I doubt not he can hold his own at court by prudence and strat-
                        egy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile Ta-meri, in the depths of her chair, gazed at the pair resentfully.
                        They had grown inter- ested in weighty things and had seemingly forgotten
                        her. So she sighed and bethought her how to punish them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a relief it will be when the Pharaoh returns to
                        Memphis!&quot; she murmured in the pause that now fol- lowed.
                        &quot;He will be more welcome to me than the Nile overflow. The city has
                        been a desert to me since he departed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Nechutes looked at her with reproach in his eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Consider the desert, O sweet Oasis,&quot; Kenkenes said softly.
                        &quot;Is not its portion truly grievous if its single palm
                        complain?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The lady dropped her eyes and her cheeks glowed <note id="note_P"
                            place="foot" anchored="yes">

                        <pb id="VAA3882-139" n="131"/> even through the dusk. After the long
                        interval of Nechutes&apos; blunt love-making the sculptor&apos;s
                        subtleties fell most gratefully on her ear.</p>
                    <p>Nechutes scowled, sighed and finally spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tape is afflicted in anticipation of the king&apos;s de-
                        parture,&quot; he observed disjointedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tape does not love Meneptah as Memphis loves him,&quot;
                        Kenkenes answered. &quot;Hast thou not this mo- ment heard Memphis pine
                        for him? Tape would not have spoken thus. She would have said:
                        &apos;Would that the king were here that I might ask a boon of
                        him.&apos; Memphis is the cradle of kings; Tape, their tomb. Memphis is
                        full of reverence for the Pharaohs; Tape, of pride; Memphis of loyalty;
                        Tape, of boon-craving. Meneptah returns to the bosom of his mother when he
                        returns to Memphis.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;But he will not remain here long,&quot; Nechutes went on.
                        &quot;He goes to Tanis to be near the scene of the Israelitish
                        unrest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Alas, Ta-meri, and wilt thou droop again?&quot; Ken- kenes
                        asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I fear,&quot; she assented with a little sigh. Then, after a
                        pause, she asked: &quot;Does the murket follow the court?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes shook his head. &quot;Not when the Pharaoh travels. But should
                        he depart permanently from Mem- phis my father would go. Many of the court
                        return- ing hither will not proceed to Tanis. The city will not be so
                        desolate then as now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but I am glad,&quot; she said. &quot;Those who re-
                        main will suffice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth?&quot; Nechutes demanded angrily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have I not said?&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-140" n="132"/>
                    <p>Nechutes rose slowly and made his way to a chair some distance away from her.
                        Kenkenes immediately guessed why the cup-bearer was hurt, but the lady was
                        innocent. He knew that he had but to speak to restore Nechutes to favor.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the lady, amazed and deeply offended at the desertion of the
                        cup-bearer, had turned her back on him. Kenkenes arose.</p>
                    <p>Ta-meri sat up in alarm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, do not go. You have but this moment come,&quot; she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Already have I stayed too long,&quot; he replied. &quot;But
                        thy hospitality makes one forget the debt one owes to a prior
                        guest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him from under silken lashes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nechutes has misconducted himself,&quot; she objected,
                        &quot;and I would not be left alone with him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wouldst thou have me stay and see him restored to favor under my
                        very eyes? Ah, Ta-meri, where is thy womanly compassion?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She smiled and extended her hand. Kenkenes took it and felt it relax and lie
                        willingly in his palm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, do not go,&quot; she pleaded softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give me leave to come again instead.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To-morrow,&quot; she said, half questioning, half com- manding.
                        He did not promise, but as he bent over to kiss her hand, he said in a low
                        tone:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou forgotten that Nechutes leaves Memphis with the going of
                        the king?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The lady started and flung a conscience-stricken glance at the scowling
                        cup-bearer. And while her face was turned, Kenkenres departed like a shadow.
                        But the portals of the nomarch&apos;s house had hardly closed <pb
                            id="VAA3882-141" n="133"/> behind him before he demanded of himself,
                        impatientfA ly, why he had made Nechutes&apos; peace, why he kept the
                        cup-bearer for ever between himself and Ta-meri. And as if to evade this
                        catechism something arose in him and asked him why he should not.</p>
                    <p>And to this he could give no answer.</p>

                    <p>For an instant after the sculptor had put the collar about her throat, Rachel
                        stood motionless, her face flushing and whitening with conflicting
                        emotions.</p>
                    <p>But her indecision was only momentary. Rebellion was in the ascendant.</p>
                    <p>She thrust her fingers under the band and essayed to wrench off the offending
                        necklace, but the stout a fastening held and the flexible braid printed its
                        woof on the back of the soft neck. Almost in tears she un- did the clasp and
                        flung the collar away.</p>
                    <p>It struck the earth with a musical ring, and the green of the wheat hid all
                        but a faint ray of the red metal.</p>
                    <p>The rout of children descended on her, each clam- oring a story of the
                        accident. But without a word she marshafed them and turned once again toward
                        the river to refill the hides. At the water&apos;s edge she kept her
                        eyes resolutely from the broad dimpling breast of the Nile toward the south.
                        She feared that she might see the light bari that was driving back to
                        Memphis against that slow but mighty current as easily as if wind and water
                        went with it.</p>
                    <p>But even before she turned again toward Masaarah, her better nature began to
                        chide her. She remembered her impetuous act with a flush of shame.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-143" n="135"/>
                    <p>&quot;His peace-offering—a proof of his good will, and thou didst
                        mistreat it, as if he had meant it for a pur- chase or a fee. The indignity
                        thou hast petulantly fancied, Rachel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a time another thought came to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The act was not womanly. Wherein. hast thou re- buked him, in
                        casting away the trinket? Thou hast the dignity of Israel to uphold in thy
                        dealings with this young man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When she reached the spot where the collar had fallen, she sought for it
                        furtively, and having found it, thrust it into the bosom of her dress.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall not keep it,&quot; she said, quieting the protests of
                        her pride. &quot;I shall make him take it back to-mor-
                        row.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Entering her low shelter in the camp some time later, she found Deborah
                        absent. Impelled by an un- reasoning desire to keep secret this event, she
                        hastily hid the collar in the sand of the tent floor and laid the straw
                        matting of her bed smoothly over its burial place. Again she struggled with
                        her pride and de- manded of herself why she had become secretive.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fie!&quot; she replied. &quot;How couldst thou tell this
                        story to Deborah? Why, it is well-nigh unbecoming.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The dusk settled down over the valley. Deborah came in like a phantom from
                        the camp-fires with the evening meal, and the pair sat down together to eat,
                        Rachel silent, Deborah thoughtful.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Another Egyptian comes to govern Masaarah,&quot; the old woman
                        observed. &quot;Agistas departed but now, leaving the camp in charge of
                        the under-drivers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It makes little odds with us—this change of task- masters,
                        Deborah—be he Agistas or any other Egyp- <pb id="VAA3882-144" n="136"/>
                        tian. They are masters and we continue to be slaves,&quot; Rachel
                        answered after a little silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, art thou losing spirit?&quot; Deborah asked with
                        animation. &quot;How shall the elders keep of good heart if the young
                        surrender?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I despair not,&quot; the girl protested. &quot;I did but
                        re- mark this thing; and I have spoken truly, have I not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so. But this evening there must be more recognition in thee of
                        thy lot since it overflows in words. I, too, have spoken truly, have I
                        not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel smiled. &quot;It may be,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>When they had supped, they went out before the tent to get the cooling air.
                        It was Deborah again that first broke the silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elias is smitten with blindness from the stone- dust,&quot; she
                        said absently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For all time?&quot; Rachel asked anxiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, if he could but rest them and bathe them in the proper
                        simples.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Alas—&quot; Rachel began, but she checked herself hur- riedly.
                        &quot;He was my father&apos;s servant,&quot; she said in-
                        stead—&quot;the last living one. Jehovah spare him. One by one they
                        fall, until I shall be utterly without tie to prove I once had
                        kindred.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Deborah looked at the girl fixedly for a moment. Then she put up her hand and
                        leaned on the soft young shoulder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Am I not left?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>Rachel passed her arm about the bowed figure, with some compunction for her
                        complaint.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My mother&apos;s friend!&quot; she exclaimed lovingly.
                        &quot;I know she died in peace, remembering that I was left to thy

                    <p>&quot;I mind me,&quot; she continued after a little silence,
                        &quot;how tender and frail she was. Thou wast as a strong tree beside
                        her. I seem to myself to be mighty com- pared to my memory of
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Deborah took the white hand that lay across her shoulder. &quot;Thou art
                        like to thy father. Thy mother was black-eyed and fragile-born to the soft
                        life of a princess. Misfortune was her death, though she strug- gled to live
                        for thee. Praise God that thou art like to thy father, else thou hadst died
                        in thine infancy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, hath my lot been sterner than the portion of all
                        Israel?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a surety, thou canst guess it, for are there many of thy tribe
                        like thee-without a kinsman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel shook her head, and the old woman contin- ued absently: &quot;Of
                        thy mother&apos;s family there were four, but they died of the heavy
                        labor. Thy father, Maai, surnamed the Compassionate, was the eldest of six.
                        They were mighty men, tawny like the lion and as, bold-worthy sons of Judah!
                        But there is none left-not one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ten!&quot; Rachel exclaimed, &quot;and not one
                        remaineth!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, and they died as though they were plague- smitten-in pairs and
                        singly, in a little space.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Deborah felt a strong tremor run through the young figure against which she
                        leaned, and the arm across her shoulder was withdrawn, that the hand might
                        clear the eyes of their tears.</p>
                    <p>The old woman discreetly held her peace till the girl should recover.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou must bear in mind, Rachel,&quot; she began, after a long
                        silence, &quot;that Egypt had an especial grudge against thy
                        house,-hence, its especial vengeance. <pb id="VAA3882-146" n="138"/> Seti,
                        the Pharaoh, began the oppression of the children of Israel, but the bondage
                        was not all-embracing, in the beginning. There were Hebrews to whom Egypt
                        was indebted and chief among these was thy father&apos;s grandsire,
                        Aram. Seti paid the debt to him by spar- ing his small lands and his little
                        treasure and himself when he put Israel to toil. Thy father&apos;s
                        father, thy grandsire, Elihu, younger brother to Amminadab, who was
                        father-in-law to Aaron, came to his share of his father&apos;s goods
                        when Aram was gathered to his fathers. This was in the latter days of Seti.
                        Thy grandsire sent his little treasure into Arabia and bought lands with it.
                        After many trials he caused to grow thereon a rose-shrub which had no period
                        of rest —blooming freshly with every moon. And there he had the Puntish
                        scentmaker on the hip, for the Arabic rose rested often. The attar he
                        distilled from his untiring flower, had another odor, wild and sweet and of
                        a daintier strength. When he was ready to trade he sent in a vial of crystal
                        to Neferari Ther- muthis and to Moses, then a young man and a prince of the
                        realm, a few drops of this wondrous perfume. Doubt not, the Hebrew prince
                        knew that the gift came from a son of Israel. The queen andMoses used the
                        attar. Therefore all purple-wearing Egypt must have it or die, since the
                        fashion had been set within the boundaries of the throne. Then did Elihu
                        name a price for his sweet odor that might have been small had each drop
                        been a jewel. But Egypt opened her coffers and bought as though her idols
                        had broken their silence and commanded her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old woman paused and reflected with grim sat- isfaction on the remote
                        days of an Israelitish triumph. <pb id="VAA3882-147" n="139"/>
                        &quot;Meanwhile,&quot; she continued finally, &quot;thy
                        grandsire lived humbly in Goshen. None dreamed that this keeper of a little
                        flock, lord over a little tent and tiller of a few acres, was the great
                        Syrian merchant who was despoiling Mizraim.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Next he became a money-lender, through his stew- ard, to the
                        Egyptians, and wrested from them what they had saved in putting Israel to
                        toil without hire. So his riches increased a hundredfold and the half of
                        noble Egypt was beholden to him. Then he turned to aid his oppressed
                        brethren.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He bribed the taskmasters or kept watch over them and discovered
                        wherein they were false to the Pharaoh, and held their own sin over their
                        heads till they submitted through fear of him. He filled Israel&apos;s
                        fields with cattle, the hills with Hebrew flocks, the val- leys with corn.
                        Alas! Had it not been-but, nay, Jehovah was not yet ready. He had chosen
                        Moses to lead Israel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old woman paused and sighed. After a silence she continued:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy father fell heir to the most of his wealth, but not to his
                        immunity. With a heart as great as his sire&apos;s he continued the good
                        work. He wedded thy mother, the daughter of another free Israelite, and in
                        his love for her, never was man more happy. In the midst of his hope and his
                        peace an enemy betrayed him to Rameses, the Incomparable Pharaoh. And
                        Rameses remembered not his father&apos;s covenant. So Maai&apos;s
                        lands, his flocks, his home, were taken; thou, hut new-born, and thy mother
                        with her people were sent to the brick-fields-himself and his brothers to
                        the <pb id="VAA3882-148" n="140"/> mines; and in a few years thou wast all
                        that was left of thy father&apos;s house.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The effect of this recital on the young Israelite was deep. Anguish, wrath,
                        and the pain that intensifies these two, helplessness, inflamed her soul.
                        The story was not entirely new to her; she had heard it, a part at a time,
                        in her childhood; but now, her understand- ing fully developed, the whole
                        history of her family&apos;s wrongs appealed to her in all its actual
                        savagery. Egypt, as a unit, like a single individual, had done her people to
                        death. Between her and Egypt, then, should be bitter enmity, rancor that
                        might never be subdued, and eternal warfare. Her enemy had conquered her,
                        had put her in bondage, and made sport of her as a pastime. The accumulation
                        of injury and insult seemed more than she could bear, and the vague hope of
                        Israel in Moses seemed in the face of Egypt&apos;s strength a folly most
                        fatuous.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O Egypt! Egypt!&quot; she exclaimed with concen- trated
                        passion. &quot;What a debt of vengeance Israel owes to
                        thee!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old woman laid her shriveled hands on the arm of her ward.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, and it shall be paid,&quot; she said fiercely.
                        &quot;Thou canst not get thy people back, nor alleviate for them now the
                        pangs that killed them; but to the mortally wronged there is one
                        restitution-revenge!&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this moment some one over near the western limits of the camp cried out a
                        welcome; a commotion arose, noisy with cheers and rapid with running.
                        Presently it died down and the pair before the tent saw a horseman ride
                        through the gloom toward the empty frame house of the overseer.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-149" n="141"/>
                    <p>The two women lapsed immediately into their ab- sorbed communion again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lay it not to Egypt alone, but to all the offenders against
                        Jehovah. Midian and Amalek, passing through to do homage to the Pharaoh,
                        sneer at Israel; Babylon in her chariot of gold flicks her whip at the sons
                        of Abraham as she bears her gifts of sisterhood to Mem- phis. We suffer not
                        only the insults of a single nation, but despiteful use by all idolaters.
                        Let but the world gather before Jehovah&apos;s altar and there shall be
                        no more affronts to Israel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Must we bide that time?&quot; Rachel asked. &quot;Or shall
                        we bring it about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; Deborah replied scornfully. &quot;Even my mys-
                        tic eyes are not potent enough to see so far into the future. We throw off
                        the bondage sooner than thou dreamest, daughter of Judah, but if the nations
                        bow at the altar of Jehovah, it will take a stronger hand than
                        Israel&apos;s to bring them there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a silence Rachel murmured, as though to her- self: &quot;We shall
                        go, and soon, and leave no debt behind. Will the vengeance befall all Egypt,
                        the good as well as the bad?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou forgotten God&apos;s promise to Abraham concerning
                        the wicked cities of the plain? If there were ten righteous therein He had
                        not destroyed them utterly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but if there be but one therein?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;One? Now, for what one dost thou concern thy- self?
                        Atsu?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel, startled out of her dream, hesitated, her face coloring hotly, though
                        unseen, beneath the kindly dusk of night.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-150" n="142"/>
                    <p> &quot;Yea,&quot; she said in a low tone, wondering gravely. if she
                        spake the truth. Somebody beside her laughed the short unready laugh of one
                        slow at mirth.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Of a truth?&quot; he asked. Rachel turned about and faced
                        Atsu. He took her hands and drew her near him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, Deborah,&quot; he said sadly; &quot;pursue her not
                        into the secret chambers of her young heart. I doubt not there is
                        &apos;one&apos; therein, but why shall we demand what&apos;
                        manner of &apos;one&apos; it is when she may not even confess it to
                        herself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Confused and a little guilty by reason of the neck- lace, and wondering why
                        she admitted any guilt, Rachel drew away from him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; he went on, retaining his clasp. &quot;Let there
                        be perfect understanding between us twain, thou Radi- ant One. I shall not
                        plague thee with my love, nor even let it be apparent after this. Men have
                        lived in con- stant fellowship, but no nearer to the women whom they love,
                        and am I less able than my kind? So I be not hateful to thee, Rachel, I am
                        content.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hateful to me!&quot; she cried reproachfully.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay? No more then. I have spoken the last with thee concerning my
                        love. And thus I seal the pact.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He drew her, unresisting, to him, and kissed her forehead.</p>
                    <p> &quot;For my gentleness to the Hebrews of Pa-Ramesu,&quot; he
                        continued in a calmer tone as he released her, &quot;they have stripped
                        me of my rank and sent me to govern Masaarah. So they thought to punish me,
                        never dreaming that they joined me to Rachel, and hid me away in a nook with
                        a handful to whom I may be mer- <pb id="VAA3882-151" n="143"/> ciful and
                        none will spy upon me! They thwarted their end.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Happy Masaarah!&quot; Rachel said earnestly.</p>
                    <p>Atsu laughed again and disappeared in the dark. Rachel drew her hand
                        furtively across the place on her brow that the taskmaster&apos;s lips
                        had touched. The keen eyes of the old Israelite saw the motion and un-
                        derstood it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is not Atsu,&quot; she said astutely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; the girl protested, &quot;and yet it is Atsu, in
                        mine own meaning, or any one in Egypt who is fair to Israel. The grace of
                        that one would be sufficient in God&apos;s sight to save all Egypt from
                        doom. That was my meaning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The light in the frame quarters of the taskmaster was extinguished and at
                        that moment a shadowy fig- ure emerged from the dark and approached the
                        pair. &quot;A courier from Mesu speaketh without the camp, even
                        now,&quot; the visiting Israelite said in a half-whisper. &quot;Atsu
                        hath put out his light, to sleep, but even if he sleep not, the people may
                        go without fear and listen to the speaker. Come ye arrd give him
                        audience.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We come,&quot; Deborah replied.</p>
                    <p>As the old woman and her ward walked down through the night in the direction
                        taken by the entire population of the quarries, Deborah said quietly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy cloud of depression hath rifted somewhat since sunset,
                        daughter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel pressed her hand repentantly.</p>
                    <p>At the side of an open space, now closely filled with sitting listeners,
                        stood a Hebrew, not older than thirty- five. A knot of flaming pitch, stuck
                        in a crevice of rock near him, lighted his face and figure. His <pb
                            id="VAA3882-152" n="144"/> frame had the characteristic stalwart
                        structure of the Israelitish bondman. The black hair waved back from a
                        placid white forehead; the eyes were serene and level, the mouth rather wide
                        but firm, the jaw square. The beard would have been light for a much younger
                        man, and it was soft, red-brown and curling. It added a mildness and
                        tenderness to the face. Who- ever looked upon him was impressed with the
                        unflinch- ing piety of the countenance.</p>
                    <p>This was Caleb the Faithful, son of Jephunneh, the Kenezite.</p>
                    <p>He was talking when Rachel and her ancient guard-. ian entered the hollow,
                        and he continued in a passive tone throughout the several arrivals
                        thereafter. He spoke as one that believes unfalteringly and has evi- dence
                        for the faith. He did not recount Israel&apos;s wrongs -he would have
                        worked against his purpose had he wrought his hearers into an angry mood.
                        Besides, the story would have been superfluous. None knew Israel&apos;s

                    <p> When Mentu returned from On a light had kindled in his eyes and his stately
                        step had grown elastic. The man that withdraws from a busy life while in
                        full vigor has beckoned to Death. Inactivity preys upon him like a disease.
                        The great artist, forced into idle- ness by the succession of an incapable
                        king, had been renewed by the prospect of labor which his exaltation into
                        the high office had afforded. With pleasure in his heart, Kenkenes watched
                        his father grow young again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who was thy good friend in this?&quot; the young man asked one
                        evening after a number of contented re- marks concerning the
                        murket&apos;s appointment. &quot;Who said the word in the
                        Pharaoh&apos;s ear?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;So to raise me to this office it is needfuLthat some- thing more
                        than my deserts must have urged the king?&quot; Mentu retorted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay! that was not my meaning,&quot; Kenkenes made haste to say.
                        &quot;But thou knowest, my father, that Meneptah must be for ever
                        directed. Who, then, of- fered him this wise counsel? Rameses?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was never Har-hat,&quot; Mentu replied, but half
                        placated.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-154" n="146"/>
                    <p>&quot;If he had, thou and I must no longer call him a poor
                        counselor.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Bribe—&quot; the murket began, ruffled once more.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; Kenkenes interrupted smiling. &quot;He had but
                        proved himself worthy and wise.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mentu shook his head, but there was no more tem- per evident in his face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now is a propitious hour for a good counselor,&quot; Kenkenes
                        pursued.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What knowest thou?&quot; Mentu asked with interest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tape,&quot; the young man replied briefly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, the sedition in Tape is old and vitiated.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And the Hak-heb.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That breach may be healed. But we have sedition to fear among the
                        bond-people—&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;The bond-people!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so. Open and organized sedition.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;The Israelites?&quot; Kenkenes exclaimed with an in- credulous
                        note in his voice.</p>
                    <p> &quot;The Israelites.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would sooner fear a rebellion among the draft- oxen and the mules
                        of Nehapehu.&quot;<ref id="ref_Q" target="note_Q">*</ref></p>
                    <p>&quot;The elder Seti&apos;s fears and the fears of the great Rameses
                        were other than yours.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, aye, they had cause for fear then, but since Seti yoked the
                        creatures—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Pharaohs did not begin in time,&quot; the elder man
                        interrupted. &quot;Had that royal fiat, the decima- tion of Hebrew
                        children, continued, we should not have had the Israelite to-day, but
                        gods!&quot; he shuddered with horror. &quot;I hope that is a horrid
                        slander—tradition, <note id="note_Q" place="foot" anchored="yes"><ref
                                target="ref_Q">*</ref>The Fayum</note>
                        <pb id="VAA3882-155" n="147"/> not fact. I like not to lay the slaughter of
                        babes at the door of any Egyptian dynasty. But had an early Pharaoh of the
                        house of Tothmes enforced the absorp- tion of the Hebrew by his same rank
                        among the Egyp- tian, we should not have the menace of a hostile alien
                        within our borders to-day. The heavy hand of oppres- sion has made a
                        wondrous race of them for strength. Theirs is no mean intellect; great men
                        have come from among them, and they will be a hardy foe arrayed against
                        us.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;They are not warriors; they are poor and une- quipped for
                        hostilities; they are thoroughly under subjection,&quot; the young man
                        pursued. &quot;What can they do against us?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do!&quot; Mentu exclaimed with impatience in the rep- etition.
                        &quot;They have only to say to the banished Hyksos: &apos;Come ye,
                        let us do battle with Egypt. We will be your mercenaries.&apos; They
                        have only to send greeting to that lean traitor Amon-meses, thus:
                        &apos;Give us the Delta to be ours and we will help you win all
                        Egypt,&apos; and there will be enough done.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;They must have a pact among themselves and a leader,
                        first,&quot; Kenkenes objected.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Have I not said they are organized? And their leader is found. He
                        is a foster-brother to Meneptah; an initiated priest of Isis; a sorcerer and
                        an infidel of the blackest order. He is Prince Mesu, a Hebrew by
                        birth.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Dost thou know him?&quot; Kenkenes asked with in- terest.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay, he has dwelt in Midian these forty years. He returned some
                        time ago and hath dwelt passively in Goshen till—&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-156" n="148"/>
                    <p>The artist dropped his voice and came nearer to his son.</p>
                    <p> &quot;He hath dwelt passively in Goshen till of late, and it is
                        whispered that some secret work against him in- augurated by the priesthood,
                        or mayhap the Pharaoh, hath given him provocation to revolt against Menep-
                        tah.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a silence Kenkenes asked in a lowered tone:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hath he made demonstration?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, aye, he is clamoring to lead his people a three days&apos;
                        journey into the wilderness to make sacrifice to their god.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Shades of mine ancestors! If that is all, let them, so they
                        return,&quot; Kenkenes said amicably.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Let them!&quot; the sculptor exploded. &quot;Dost thou
                        believe that they would return?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;I apprehend that the Rameside army would be capable of thwarting
                        then if they were disposed to depart permanently.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou dost apprehend-aye, of a truth, I know thou dost! Halt all
                        our works of peace for an indefinite time; mass the vast army of the Pharaoh
                        and spend days and good arrows in retrieving the runaways, merely that a
                        barbarian god may smell the savor of holy animals sacrificed! Gods!
                        Kenkenes, thou art as trustworthy a counselor as Har-hat!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thereafter there was a silence in the work-room. But a peppery man is seldom
                        sulky, and Kenkenes was fully prepared for the mildness in his
                        father&apos;s voice when he spoke again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou shouldst see the pretense in his demand, Kenkenes. He must
                        have provocation to urge him to <pb id="VAA3882-157" n="149"/> rebellion,
                        and he knows full well that Meneptah will not grant that
                        petition.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But hath he not provocation— thou hast but a mo- ment ago
                        told—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But that was only an offense against <hi rend="i">him</hi>. The
                        whole people would not go into revolt because some one had conspired against
                        one of their number. There- fore he telleth Israel that its God would have
                        Israel make a pilgrimage, promising curses upon the people if they obey not.
                        Then he putteth the appeal to the Pharaoh and the Pharaoh denieth it.
                        Wherefore the whole people is enraged and hath rallied to the con-
                        spirator&apos;s cause. Seest thou, my son?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is strategy worthy the Incomparable Pharaoh—&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;It is Hebrew craft!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps thou art right. But what personal grudge hath Mesu against
                        Egypt or the priesthood or Menep- tah?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is said that he was wanted out of the way, and by an unfortunate
                        sum of accidents, the miscarriage of a priest&apos;s letter and a fight
                        between a messenger and Bedouins in front of a Hebrew tent, gave the
                        informa- tion into the hands of Mesu himself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>By this time Kenkenes was on his feet.</p>
                    <p> &quot;A miscarriage of a priest&apos;s letter,&quot; he repeated
                        slowly.</p>
                    <p>The artist nodded.</p>
                    <p>After the silence the young man spoke again:</p>
                    <p> &quot;And thou believest truly that because of this letter -because of
                        this Israelite&apos;s grievance against the pow- ers of Egypt, we shall
                        have uprising and serious trouble among our bond-people?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-158" n="150"/>
                    <p>&quot;I have said,&quot; Mentu answered, raising his head as though
                        surprised at the earnestness in his son&apos;s voice. Kenkenes did not
                        meet his father&apos;s eyes. He turned on his heel and left the
                        work-room.</p>
                    <p>Had the spiteful Seven, the Hathors, used him as a tool whereby mischief
                        should be wrought between the nation and her slaves?</p>
                </div2>
                <pb id="VAA3882-159" n="151"/>
                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head rend="center">CHAPTER XII<lb/>
                        <hi rend="sc">CANAAN</hi></head>
                    <p>When the imperative necessity of harmonious ex- pression became apparent, the
                        young artist laid aside his chisel and mallet, and the Arabian desert knew
                        his footsteps no more for many days after the rough- hewing of
                        Athor&apos;s face. Instead, he mingled with the people of Memphis in
                        quest of the expression. The pursuit became fascinating and all-absorbing.
                        With the most deliberate calculation, he studied the faces of Sthe betrothed
                        and of newly wedded wives, and finding too much of content therein, he
                        sought out the unelect for study. And with these, his search ended.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter he made innumerable heads in clay, and covered linen scrolls with
                        drawings. But it was the semblance he gained and not the spirit. The light
                        eluded him.</p>
                    <p>On the day after Mentu&apos;s return from On, Kenkenes paid the first
                        visit to Masaarah since the incident of the collar,—and the last he thought
                        to make until he had won that for which he strove. He went to bury the
                        matting in the sand and to hide other evidences of recent occupancy about
                        the niche. He left the block of stone undisturbed, for the transgression was
                        not yet apparent on the face of Athor. The scrolls, which had been concealed
                        under the carpeting, were <pb id="VAA3882-160" n="152"/> too numerous for
                        his wallet to contain, but he carried the surplus openly in his hand.</p>
                    <p>It was sunset before he had made an end. To return to the Nile by way of the
                        cliff-front would have saved him time, but there was a boyish wish in his
                        heart to look again on the lovely face that had helped him and baffled him.
                        So he descended into the upper end of the ravine and slowly passed the
                        outskirts of the camp, but the bond-girl was nowhere to be seen. The spaces
                        between the low tents were filled with feeding laborers and there was an
                        unusual amount of cheer to be noted among Israel of Masaarah. Kenkenes heard
                        the talk and laughter with some wonderment as he passed. He admitted that he
                        was disappointed when, without a glimpse of Rachel, he emerged into the Nile
                        valley. But he leaped lightly down the ledge, crossed the belt of rubble,
                        talus and desert sand; and entered the now well-marked wagon road between
                        the dark green meadow land on either side. Egypt was in shadow—her sun
                        behind the Libyan heights,—but the short twilight had not fallen. Overhead
                        were the cooling depths of sky, as yet starless, but the river was breathing
                        on the winds and the sibilant murmur of its waters began to talk above the
                        sounds of the city. To the north, the south and the east was pastoral and
                        des- ert quiet; to the west was the gradual subsidence of urban stir. Frogs
                        were beginning to croak in the dis- tance, and in the long grain here and
                        there, a noctur- nal insect chirred and stilled abruptly as the young man
                        passed.</p>
                    <p>Within a rod of the pier some one called:</p>
                    <p>&quot;My master!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The voice came from a distance, but he knew whom <pb id="VAA3882-161" n="153"
                        /> he should see when he turned. Half-way across the field toward the
                        quarries Rachel was coming, with a scroll in her lifted hand. He began to
                        retrace his steps to meet her, but she noted the action and quick- ened her
                        rapid walk into running.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou didst drop this outside the camp,&quot; she said as she
                        came near. &quot;I feared it might have somewhat pertaining to the
                        statue on it, and I have brought it, with the permission of the
                        taskmaster.&quot; She stopped, and putting her hand into the folds of
                        her habit on her breast, hesitated as if for words to speak further.
                        Kenkenes interrupted her with his thanks.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How thou hast fatigued thyself for me, Rachel! Out of all Egypt I
                        doubt if I might find another so constant guardian of my welfare. The grace
                        of the gods attend thee as faithfully. I thank thee, most
                        gratefully.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The purpose in her face dissolved, the hand that seemed to hold somewhat in
                        the folds of her habit relaxed and fell slowly. While Kenkenes waited for
                        her to speak, he noted that a dress of unbleached linen replaced the coarse
                        cotton surplice she had worn before, and her feet were shod with simple
                        sandals—an extravagance among slaves. But the garb was yet too mean. The
                        sculptor wondered at that moment how the sumptuous attire of the high- born
                        Memphian women would become her. He Shook his head and in his imagination
                        dressed her in snow-white robes with but the collar of rings about her
                        throat, and stood back to marvel at his picture of splendid simplicity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou not something more to tell me?&quot; he asked <pb
                            id="VAA3882-162" n="154"/> kindly. &quot;Do thou rest here on the
                        wharf while we talk. Art thou not quite breathless?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I thank thee,&quot; she faltered. &quot;I may not
                        linger.&quot; The hand once again sought the folds over , her
                        breast.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then let me walk with thee on thy way. It will be dark
                        soon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; she protested flushing, &quot;and again, I thank
                        thee. It is not needful.&quot; She made a movement as if to leave him,
                        but he stepped to her side.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Out upon thee, daughter of Israel, thou art ungra- cious,&quot;
                        he remonstrated laughingly. &quot;I can not think thee so wondrous
                        brave. For it is a long walk to the camp and the night will be pitch-black.
                        Why may I not go with thee?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is naught to be feared.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth? Those hills are as full of wild beasts as Amenti is of
                        spirits. And even if no hurt befell thee, the trepidation of that long
                        journey would be cruel. Nay; Ptah, the gallant god, would spurn my next
                        offering, did I send thee back to camp alone. Wilt thou come?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She bowed and dropped behind him. Her resolu- tion to maintain the forms of
                        different rank between them was not characteristic of other slaves he had
                        known. There was no presumption or humble grati- tude in her manner when he
                        would offer her the cour- tesies of an equal, but he had met the disdain of
                        a peer once when he thought he talked with a slave. There was something
                        mocking in her perfunctory def- erence, but her pride was genuine. Her
                        conduct seemed to say: &quot;I would liefer be a Hebrew and a <pb
                            id="VAA3882-163" n="155"/> slave than a princess of the God-forgotten
                        realm of Egypt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The young sculptor was unruffled, however. He was turning over in his mind,
                        with interest, the evi- dence that tended to show that the Israelite had
                        some- thing more to tell him, that her courage had failed her and that her
                        hand had sought something concealed in her dress. He recalled the former
                        meetings with her and arrived at a surmise so sudden and so conclusive that
                        with difficulty he kept himself from making out- ward demonstration of his
                        conviction. &quot;The collar, by Apis! I offended her with the trinket.
                        And she came to make me take it back, but her courage fled. Fie upon my
                        clumsy gallantries! I must make amends. I would not have her hate
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He broke the silence with an old, old remark—one that Adam might have made to
                        Eve.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at the stars, Rachel. There is a dark case- ment in the
                        heavens—a blink of the eye and the lamp is alight.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;So I watch them every night. But they are swifter here in Memphis.
                        At Mendes, where Israel toiled once, they are more deliberate,&quot; she
                        answered readily.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Aye, but you should see them at Phile. They ignite and bound into
                        brilliance like sparks of meeting metal and flint. Ah, but the tropics are
                        precipitate!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know them not,&quot; she ventured.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Their acquaintance is better avoided. They have no mean—they leap
                        from extreme to extreme. They are violent, immoderate. It is instant night
                        and in- stant day; it is the maddest passion of summer always. Nature reigns
                        at the top of her voice and chokes her <pb id="VAA3882-164" n="156"/> realm
                        with the fervor of her maternity. Nay, give me the north. I would feel the
                        earth&apos;s pulse now and then without burning my
                        fingers.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;There is room for choice in this land of thine,&quot; she
                        mused after a little.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Land of mine?&quot; he repeated inquiringly, turning his head
                        to look at her. &quot;Is it not also thine?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, it is not the Hebrews&apos; and it never was,&quot;
                        the clear answer came from the dusk behind him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;After four hundred years in
                        Egypt they have not adopted her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We have but sojourned here a night. The jour- ney&apos;s end is
                        farther on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Israel hath made a long night of the sojourn,&quot; he rejoined
                        laughingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; she answered. &quot;Thou hast not said aright.
                        It is Egypt that hath made a long night of our so- journ.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a silence in which Kenkenes felt accused and uncomfortable. It
                        would require little to make harsh the temper of the talk. It lay with him,
                        one of the race of offenders, to make amends.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is for me to admit Egypt&apos;s sin and ask a
                        truce,&quot; he said gently. &quot;So be thou generous to me, since
                        it is I who am abashed in her stead.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again there was silence, broken at last by the Israel- ite in a voice grown
                        wondrously contrite.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not reproach thee. Nor, indeed, is all Egypt at fault. The sin
                        lies with the Pharaohs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah! the gods forbid!&quot; he protested. &quot;Lay it on
                        the shoulders of babls, if thou wilt, but I am party to treason if I but
                        give ear to a rebuke of the monarch.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-165" n="157"/>
                    <p> &quot;I am not ignorant of the law. I shall spare thee, but I have
                        purchased my right to condemn the king.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou indomitable! And I accused thee of fear. I retract. But tell
                        me—what is the journey&apos;s end? Is it the ultimate goal of all
                        flesh?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Not so,&quot; she answered proudly. &quot;It is
                        Israel&apos;s inheritance promised for four hundred years. The time is
                        ripe for possession. We go forward to enter into a land of our
                        own.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou givest me news. Come, be the Hebrews&apos; his- torian and
                        enlighten me. Where lies the land?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel hesitated. To her it was a serious problem to decide whether the
                        lightness of the sculptor&apos;s tpne were mockery or good fellowship.
                        Kenkenes noted her silence and spoke again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perchance I ask after a hieratic secret. If so, for- give the
                        blunder.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; she replied at once. &quot;It is no secret. All
                        Egypt will know of it ere long. God hath prepared us a land wherein we may
                        dwell under no master but Jehovah. We go hence shortly to enter it. The cap-
                        tain of Israel will lead us thither and Jehovah will show him the way.
                        Abraham was informed that it was a wondrous land wherein the olive and the
                        grape will crown the hills; the corn will fill the valleys; the cattle and
                        sheep, the pasture lands. There will be many rivers instead of one and the
                        desert will lie afar off from its confines. The sun will shine and the rain
                        will fall and the winds will blow as man needeth them, and there will be no
                        slavery and no heavy life therein. The land shall be Israel&apos;s and
                        its enemies shall crouch without its borders, confounded at the splendor of
                        the <pb id="VAA3882-166" n="158"/> children of God. And there will our
                        princes arise arid a throne be set up and a mighty nation established.
                        Cities will shihe white and strong-walled on the heights, and caravans of
                        commerce will follow down the broad roadways to the sea. There will the
                        ships of Israel come bowing over the waters with the riches of the world,
                        and our wharves will be crowded with purple and gold and frankincense.
                        Babylon shall do homage on the right hand and Egypt upon the left, and the
                        straight smoke from Jehovah&apos;s altar will rise from the center
                        unfailing by day or by night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They had reached the ledge and Kenkenes sat down on it, leaning on one hand
                        across Rachel&apos;s way. She paused near him. Even in the dark he could
                        see the light in her eyes, and the joy of anticipation was in her voice. As
                        yet he did not know whether she talked of the Israelitish conception of
                        supernal life, or of a belief in a temporal redemption.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And there shall be no death nor any of the world- sorrows
                        therein?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Since we shall dwell in the world we may not es- cape the
                        world&apos;s uncertainties,&quot; she replied, looking at his lifted
                        face. &quot;But most men live better lives when they live happily, and I
                        doubt not there will be less unhappiness, provident or fortuitous, in
                        Israel, the nation, than in Israel, enslaved.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So the slave talked of freedom as slaves talk of it- hopefully and
                        eloquently. A pity asserted itself in the young sculptor&apos;s heart
                        and grew to such power that it tinctured his speech.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Is thy heart then so firmly set on this thing?&quot; he asked
                        gently.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-167" n="159"/>
                    <p> &quot;It is the hope that bears Israel&apos;s burdens and the balm
                        that heals the welt of the lash.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And in the young man&apos;s heart he said it was a vain hope, a happy
                        delusion that might serve to make the harsh bondage endurable till time
                        dispelled it. The simple words of the girl were eloquent portrayal of
                        Israel&apos;s plight, and Kenkenes subsided into a sorry state of
                        helpless sympathy. She was not long in in- terpreting his silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Vain hope, is it?&quot; she said. &quot;And how shall it
                        come to pass in the face of the Pharaoh&apos;s denial and the might of
                        Egypt&apos;s arms? Thou art young and so am I, but both of us remember
                        Rameses. There has been none like him. He overthrew the world, did he not?
                        And it was a hard task and a precarious and a long one, when he but measured
                        arms with mortals. Is it not a problem worthy the study to ponder how he
                        might have fared in battle with a god?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes lifted his head suddenly and regarded her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye,&quot; she continued, &quot;I have given thee food for
                        thought. Futile indeed were Israel&apos;s hopes if it set itself unaided
                        against the Pharaoh. But the God of Israel hath appointed His hour and hath
                        already de- scended into fellowship with His chosen people.- He hath
                        promised to lead us forth, and the Divine respects a promise. So a God
                        against a Pharaoh. Doth it not appear to thee, Egyptian, that there
                        approaches a mar- velous time?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give me but faith in the hypothesis and I shall sag, of a
                        surety,&quot; he replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast said. Shall we not go on, my master?&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA3882-168" n="160"/> &quot;I am Kenkenes, the son of
                        Mentu,&quot; he told her.</p>
                    <p>She bent her head in acknowledgment of the intro- duction and moved forward
                        as if to climb up by the projecting edges of the strata. But he put a power-
                        ful arm about her and lifted her into the valley. With a light bound he was
                        beside her. Ahead of them was profound darkness, hedged by black and
                        close-drawn walls and canopied by distant and unillumining stars. She
                        resumed her place behind him though he was moved to protest, but her
                        deliberate manner seemed to demand its way. So they continued slowly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou givest me interest in the God of Israel,&quot; he said, to
                        reopen the subject. &quot;The Egyptian dwells in his gods, but thou
                        sayest that the God of Israel dwells in Israel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so. But thou speakest of Israel&apos;s God, even after the
                        fashion of my people. They are jealous, say- ing that the true God hath but
                        one love and that is Israel. If they would think it, let them, but He is the
                        all-God, of all the earth, the One God—thy God as well as
                        mine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mine!&quot; Kenkenes exclaimed.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou hast said.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, by all things worshipful, this is news. I had ever thought
                        that our gods are those to whom we bow. Either thou sayest wrong or I have
                        been remiss in my devotions.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, listen,&quot; she said earnestly, stepping to his side.
                        &quot;Already have I told thee of the captain of Is- rael. He was reared
                        among princes in the house of the Pharaoh, and he is learned in all the
                        wisdom of Egypt. He instructeth the elders concerning Jeho- vah, and from
                        mouth to mouth his wisdom traverseth <pb id="VAA3882-169" n="161"/> till it
                        reacheth the ears of the young. This, then, I have from the lips of Moses,
                        who speaketh naught but the truth. In early times all on earth had perished
                        for wickedness by the sending of the One God, save a holy man and his three
                        sons. These men worshiped the God of Abraham, who was the father of Israel.
                        One of the sons founded thy race, saith Moses, and one established mine. The
                        tribes that went into Egypt worshiped the same God. Lo, is it not written in
                        the early tombs? So Moses testifieth, but if thou doubtest, go question thy
                        historians. And some of the tribes called that God Ra, others, Ptah, and yet
                        others, Amen. But in time they quarreled and each tribe re- fused to admit
                        the identity of the three-named One God, saying, &apos;Thy god sendeth
                        plague and affliction, and ours sendeth rich harvests and the Nile
                        floods.&apos; Did not the same God do each of these things in His
                        wisdom? Even so. But when they were at last united into one great people,
                        they had forgotten the quarrel, forgotten that in the beginning they had
                        worshiped one God, and they bowed down to three instead. Nay, if there were
                        but one among you who dared, there are loose threads fluttering, which, if
                        drawn, might un- ravel the whole fabric of idolatry and disclose that which
                        it hides—the One God—the God of Abraham.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes had walked in silence, looking down into the luminous eyes, lost in
                        wonder. Rachel suddenly realized at what length she had talked and stopped
                        abruptly, dropping back to her place again as if chid- den.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Come,&quot; said Kenkenes, noting her action, &quot;walk
                        beside me, priestess. I would hear more of this. It is like all forbidden
                        things—wondrously alluring.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-170" n="162"/>
                    <p>&quot;I did forget,&quot; she answered stubbornly. &quot;There is
                        nothing more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes stopped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come,&quot; he insisted. &quot;The teacher rather precedes
                        the pupil. At least, thou shalt walk beside me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I pray thee, let us go on. We are not yet at the camp—we have
                        walked so slowly,&quot; she answered. At that moment several fragments
                        of rock, loosening, slid down in the dark just behind her. She caught her
                        breath and was beside the young artist in an in- stant. He laughed in sheer
                        delight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast assembled the spirits by thy blasphemy,&quot; he
                        said. &quot;And remember, I must soon return to this haunted place
                        alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou canst get a brand of fire or a cudgel at the camp,&quot;
                        she said with some remorse in her voice, &quot;and run for the river
                        bank.&quot; With that she resumed her place behind him.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes laughed again. It gave him uncommon pleasure to know that his model
                        was concerned for him. He put out his hand and deliberately drew her up to
                        his side. Not content with that he bent his arm and put her hand under it
                        and into his palm, so that she could not leave him again. She submitted
                        reluctantly, but her fingers, lost in his warm clasp, were cold and ill at
                        ease. He felt their chill and re- leased her to slip about her shoulders the
                        light woolen mantle he had worn. Her apprehension lest he take her hand
                        again was so evident that he refrained, though he slackened his step and
                        kept with her.</p>
                    <p>But she spoke no more until they were beside the outermost circle of coals
                        that had been a cooking fire for the camp. Here they met a man, whom, by his
                            <pb id="VAA3882-171" n="163"/> superior dress, Kenkenes took to be the
                        taskmaster.</p>
                    <p>They were almost upon him before he was seen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rachel!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here am I,&quot; she answered, a little anxiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou wast gone long—&quot; he began.</p>
                    <p>The sculptor interposed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She hath done me a service and it was my pleasure to talk with
                        her,&quot; he said complacently. &quot;Chide her not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The glow from the fire lighted the young man&apos;s face, and the
                        taskmaster, standing in deep shadow, scanned it sharply but did not answer.
                        Kenkenes turned and strode away down the valley.</p>
                    <p>Rachel snatched a thick sycamore club which had been left over in the
                        construction of the scaffold and ran after him. But the young sculptor had
                        disap- peared in the dark.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kenkenes,&quot; she cried at last desperately. He answered
                        immediately.</p>
                    <p>She slipped off the mantle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This, thy mantle,&quot; she said when he approached,
                        &quot;and this,&quot; thrusting the club into his hands.
                        &quot;There is as much danger in the valley for thee as for
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And like a shadow she was gone.</p>
                    <p>As he hurried on again through the dense gloom of the ravine, the young man
                        thought long on the Israelite and her words. She had offered him theories
                        that peremptorily contradicted the accepted idea among Egyptians, that Moses
                        was inspired by a per- sonal motive of revenge. The argument put forth by
                        his father began to show sundry weaknesses. Fur- thermore Rachel&apos;s
                        version gave him a much coveted opportunity to slip from his shoulders the
                        discomfort- <pb id="VAA3882-172" n="164"/> ing blame that had rested there
                        since he had heard that a miscarried letter might effect a national disturb-
                        ance. Much as the practical side of his nature sought to decry the great
                        Hebrew&apos;s motive, a sense of relief possessed him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I fear me, Kenkenes, thou durst not boast thyself an embroiler of
                        nations,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;The Hebrew prince is a
                        zealot, and zealots have no fear for their lives. Truly those Israelites are
                        an uncom- mon and a proud people. But, by Besa, is she not
                        beautiful!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He enlarged on this latter thought at such exhaust- ive length that he had
                        traversed the valley and field, found his boat, crossed the Nile and was at
                        home be- fore he had made an end.</p>

                    <p>On the first day of February, runners, dusty, breath- less and excited,
                        passed the sentries of the Memphian palace of Meneptah with the news that
                        the Pharaoh was but a day&apos;s journey from his capital. They were the
                        last of a series of couriers that had kept the city informed of the
                        king&apos;s advance. For days before, public drapers were to be seen
                        clinging cross-legged to obelisk and peristyle; moving in spread-eagle
                        fashion, hung in a jacket of sail-cloth attached to cables, across the
                        fronts of buildings, looping garlands, besticking banners and spreading
                        tapestries. Scatter- ing sounds of hammer and saw continued even through the
                        night. The city&apos;s metals were polished, her streets were sprinkled
                        and rolled, her stone wharves scoured, her landings painted, her flambeaux
                        new-soaked in pitch. The gardens, the storehouses and the wine- lofts felt
                        unusual draft for the festivities, and the great capital was decked and
                        scented like a bride.</p>
                    <p>Now, on the eve of the Pharaoh&apos;s coming, the preparations were
                        complete. The city was full of ex- citement and pleasant expectancy. Only
                        once before during the six years of Meneptah&apos;s reign had such
                        enthusiasm prevailed. When the Rebu horde de- scended upon Egypt, Meneptah
                        had sent his generals <pb id="VAA3882-174" n="166"/> out to meet the
                        invader, but he, himself, had remained under cover in Memphis because he
                        said the stars were unpropitious. And this was the son of Rameses II, than
                        whom, if the historians and the singer Pentaur say true, there was never a
                        more puissant monarch! But when the marauder was overthrown and routed, and
                        his generals turned toward Memphis with their captives in chains, Meneptah
                        hastened to meet them, decked his chariot with war trophies and entered his
                        capital in triumph. He was hailed with exultant acclaim.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Hail, mighty Pharaoh! who smites with his glance and annihilates
                        with his spear. He overthrew com- panies alone, and with his lions he routed
                        armies. His enemies crumbled before him like men of clay, for he breathed
                        hot coals in his wrath and flames in his vengeance.&quot; And the
                        enthusiasm that inspired the S eulogy was sincere. Meneptah was none the
                        less loved because Memphis understood him. The Pha- raoh was the apple of
                        her eye and she worshiped him stubbornly.</p>
                    <p>Now he was returning from a bloodless campaign- one that neither required nor
                        brought forth any gen- eralship-but it was a victory and had been personally
                        conducted by Meneptah, so Memphis was preparing to fall into paroxysms of
                        delight, little short of hys- teria.</p>
                    <p>An hour after sunrise on the day of the Pharaoh&apos;s coming a gorgeous
                        regatta assembled off the wharves of Memphis. It was a flotilla of the rank
                        and wealth of the capital, with that of On, Bubastis, Busiris, and even
                        Mendes and Tanis. The boats were high-riding, graceful and finished at head
                        and stern with sheaves <pb id="VAA3882-175" n="167"/> of carved lotus. Hull
                        and superstructure were painted in gorgeous colors with a preponderance of
                        ivory and gold. Masts, rigging and oars were wrapped with lotus, roses and
                        mimosa. Sails and canopies were brilliant with dyes and undulant with
                        fringes. Troops of tiny boys, innocent of raiment, were posted about the
                        sides of the vessels holding festoons. Oarsmen wore chaplets on the head or
                        gar- lands around the loins, and half-clad slave-girls were scattered about
                        with fans of dyed plumes. Bridges of boats had been hastily run out between
                        the vessels, and over these the embarking voyagers or visitors passed in a
                        stream. On shore was a great multitude and every advantageous point of
                        survey was occupied. And here were catastrophes and riots, panics and
                        love-making, gambling and gossip and all the other things that mark the
                        assembly of a crowd. But these incidents drew the attention of the populace
                        only momentarily from the revel of the nobility on the Nile. For there were
                        laughter and songs, strumming of the lyre, shouts, polite contention and the
                        drone of general conversation among such numbers that the sound was of great
                        volume.</p>
                    <p>At the head of the pageant were the boats of the nomarch and the courtiers to
                        Meneptah who remained in Memphis. Near the forefront of these was the
                        pleasure-boat of Mentu.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes dropped from its deck to the walk ris- ing and falling at its side,
                        and made his way through the crowd in search of a vessel bearing a winged
                        sun and the oval containing the symbols of On. As he passed the prow of a
                        tall pleasure-boat he was caught in a rope of flowers let down from above
                        and looped <pb id="VAA3882-176" n="168"/> about him with a dexterous hand.
                        He turned in the pretty fetters and looked up. Above him was a row of a
                        dozen little girl-faces, set like apple-blossoms along the side of the
                        vessel. The youngest was not over twelve years of age, the oldest, fourteen.
                        Each rosy countenance was rippled with laughter, but the sound was lost in
                        the great turmoil about them. In the center of the group, a pair of hands
                        put forth under the chin of an older girl, held the ends of the garland with
                        a determined grip. Her eyes were gray, her hair was chestnut, her face very
                        fair. Kenkenes recognized her with a sudden warmth about his heart. The
                        others were strangers to him. A glance at the plate on the side of the boat
                        showed him that this was the one he sought. Most willingly he obeyed the
                        insistent sum- mons of the garland and permitted himself to be drawn to the
                        barge. There, the same hands showed him the ladder against the side, and a
                        dozen pretty arms were extended to haul him aboard as he climbed.</p>
                    <p>But the instant he planted foot on the deck the lovely rout retreated to
                        shelter at the side of a smiling woman seated in the shadow of fans. Only
                        his fair- faced captor stood her ground.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hail, Hapi,&quot;<ref id="ref_R" target="note_R">*</ref> she
                        cried, doing obeisance. &quot;Pity the desert.&quot; She flung wide
                        her hands. With the exception of the youths at the oars there was no other
                        man on the boat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ye may call me forth,&quot; Kenkenes replied, &quot;but how
                        shall ye return me to my banks? Hither, sweet On,&quot; he continued,
                        catching the hand of the fair-faced girl, &quot;submit first to
                        submergence.&quot; She took his kisses <note id="note_R" place="foot"
                            anchored="yes"><ref target="ref_R">*</ref>The inundation, more properly
                            Nilus-the river-god.</note>
                        <pb id="VAA3882-177" n="169"/> willingly. &quot;This for Seti, thy
                        lover; this for Hotep, thy brother, and this for me who am both in one. How
                        thou art grown, Io!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But she hath not denied thee the babyhood privi- leges for all
                        that, Kenkenes,&quot; the smiling woman said.</p>
                    <p> &quot;It is an excellent example of submission she hath set, Lady
                        Senci,&quot; he replied, advancing toward the young girls about her.
                        &quot;Let us see if it prevail.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But the troop scattered with little cries of dismay.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; he observed, as he bent over Senci&apos;s hand,
                        &quot;never were two maids alike, and I shall not strive&apos; to
                        make them so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy father hath most graciously kept his word in sending us a
                        protector,&quot; Senci continued. &quot;My nose- gay of beauties
                        drooped last night when they arrived from On with my brother sick, aboard.
                        They feared they must stop with me in Memphis for want of a
                        man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was the first word I heard from my father this morning and the
                        last when I left him even now: lo&apos;ss father hath failed her through
                        sickness, so do thou look after the Lady Senci—and the gods give thee grace
                        for once to do a thing well!&apos; &quot;</p>
                    <p>The lady smiled and patted his arm. &quot;He did not fear; he knew whom
                        he chose. But behold our gallant escort—the nomarch ahead, beside us the new
                        cup- bearer and behind us all the rank of the north.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, and when we cast off thou mayest look for the new murket on
                        thy right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The lady blushed. &quot;I have not seen thy father yet, this
                        morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So? His robes must fit poorly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At that moment a gang-plank was run across from <pb id="VAA3882-178" n="170"
                        /> the broad flat stern of the nomarch&apos;s boat to the prow of
                        Senci&apos;s, a carpet was spread on it, and Ta-meri, with little
                        shrieks and tottering steps, came across it. Ken- kenes put out his arms to
                        her and lifted her down when she arrived.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wonder brought me,&quot; she cried. &quot;I dreamed I saw
                        thee kiss a maiden thrice and I came to see if it were true.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;O most honest vision! It is true and this is she,&quot;
                        Kenkenes answered, indicating Io.</p>
                    <p>Ta-meri flung up her hands and gazed at the blush- ing girl with wide
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Enough,&quot; she said at last. &quot;It is indeed a
                        marvel. Never have I seen such a thing before, and never shall I see it
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And if that be true, fie and for shame, Kenkenes,&quot; Senci
                        chid laughingly.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Ta-meri always shuts her eyes,&quot; the sculptor de- fended
                        himself stoutly. The nomarch&apos;s daughter caught his meaning first
                        and covered her face with her hands. The chorus of laughter did not drown
                        her protests.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kenkenes, thou art a mortal plague!&quot; she ex- claimed
                        behind her defense.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Truce,&quot; he said. &quot;Thou didst accuse me and I did
                        defend myself. We are even.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but am I also even with Ta-meri?&quot; Io asked shyly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now,&quot; Senci cried, &quot;which of ye will say
                        &apos;aye&apos; or &apos;nay&apos; to that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ta-meri retreated protesting to the prow again, but the gang-plank had been
                        withdrawn. An army of slaves were breaking up the bridges of boats. The <pb
                            id="VAA3882-179" n="171"/> oars of the nomarch&apos;s barge rose and
                        fell and the vessel bore away. Ta-meri cried out again when she saw it
                        depart but she made no effort to stay it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come back, Ta-meri,&quot; Io called. &quot;I shall not
                        press thee for an accounting.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The lanes of water between the boats cleared, the scented sails filled, the
                        bristling fringes of oars dipped and flashed, a great shout arose from the
                        populace on shore and the shining pageant moved away toward Thebes. The
                        barge of Nechutes swung into position on the left of Senci—the oars on
                        Mentu&apos;s boat rose and halted and the vessel drifted till it was
                        alongside her right. Kenkenes put his arm about Io, who stood beside him and
                        whispered exultantly or irrever- ently concerning the vigilance of the
                        cup-bearer and the murket.</p>
                    <p> &quot;And,&quot; he continued oracularly, &quot;there will be a
                        third attending us when we return, if thou hast been coy with the gentle
                        Seti during his long absence.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I have sent him messages faithfully and in no little point
                        have I failed him in constancy. But I can not see why he should love me, who
                        am to the court-ladies as a thrush to peafowls. He writes me such praise of
                        Ta-user.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, Io! Art thou so little versed in the ways of men that thou
                        dost wonder why we love or how we love or whom we love? The very fact that
                        thou art different from Seti&apos;s surroundings is like to make him
                        love thee best.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not jealous; only he hath so much to tell of
                        Ta-user.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Aye, since she is like to become his sister, it is not strange.
                        But what says he of her?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-180" n="172"/>
                    <p>Io thrust her hand into the mist of gauzes over her bosom and with a soft
                        flush on her cheeks drew forth a small, flattened roll of linen. Kenkenes
                        made a place for her on his chair and drew her down beside him. Together the
                        pair undid the scroll and Kenkenes, following the tiny pink finger, came
                        upon these words:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, thou shouldst see her, my sweet. Thou know- est she was born of
                        a prince of Egypt and a lovely Tahennu, and the mingling of our dusky blood
                        with that of a fair-haired northern people, hath wrought a marvelous beauty
                        in Ta-user. Her hair is like copper and like copper her eyes. There is no
                        brown- ness nor any flush in her skin. It is like thick cream, smooth, soft
                        and cool. And when she walks, she minds me of my grandsire&apos;s
                        leopardess, which once did stride from shadow to shadow in the palace with
                        that undulatory, unearthly grace. In nature, she is world-compelling. When
                        first she met me, she took my face between her palms and gazed into mine
                        eyes. Ai! she bewitched me, then and there. My individu- ality died within
                        me—I felt an unreasoning submission, strangely mingled with aversion. I was
                        compelled- divorced from mine own forces, which vaguely pro- tested from
                        afar. . . . And yet, thou shouldst see her meet Rameses. He makes me marvel.
                        He knows— she knows—aye, all Egypt knows why she hath come to court, and yet
                        they meet—she salutes him with be- wildering grace—he inclines his proud
                        head with never a tremor and they pass. Or, if they tarry to talk, it is an
                        awesome sight to see the determined encounter of two mighty souls—tremendous
                        charm against tremendous resistance—and Io, I know that they have sounded to
                        the deepest the depth of each other&apos;s <pb id="VAA3882-181" n="173"
                        /> strength. I long to see Ta-user conquer—and yet, again I would
                        not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thereafter followed matters which Kenkenes did not read. He rolled the letter
                        and gave it back to Io. The little girl sat expectantly watching his
                        face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I would not take Seti&apos;s boyish transports
                        seriously,&quot; he said gently. &quot;His very frankness dis-
                        claims any heart interest in Ta-user. Besides, she is as old as I—three
                        whole Nile-floods older than the prince. She thinks on him as Senci looks on
                        me—he regards her as a lad looks up to gracious womanhood. Nay, fret not,
                        thou dear jealous child.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Io&apos;s lips quivered as she looked away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is over and over—ever the same in every letter— Ta-user,
                        Ta-user, till I hate the name,&quot; she said at last.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then when thou seest him at midday up the Nile, be thou gracious to
                        some other comely young nobleman and see him wince. Naught is so good for a
                        lover as uncertainty. It is a mistake to load him with the great weight of
                        thy love. Doubt not, thou shalt carry all the burden of jealousy and pain if
                        thou dost. Divide this latter with him, and he shall be content to share
                        more of the first with thee. But thou hast condemned him without trial, Io.
                        Spare thy heart the hurt and wait.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The young face cleared and with a little sigh she settled back in the chair
                        and said no more.</p>
                    <p>It was noon when the royal flotilla was sighted. There were nineteen barges
                        approaching in the form of two crescents like a parenthesis, the horns up
                        and down the Nile, and in the center of the inclosed space was
                        Meneptah&apos;s float. Here was only the royal family, <pb
                            id="VAA3882-182" n="174"/> the king, queen, Ta-user, and the two
                        princes, who took the place of fan-bearers in attendance on their father.
                        The vessel was manned by two reliefs of twelve oarsmen from Theban
                        nobility.</p>
                    <p>If magnificence came to conduct Meneptah, it met splendor as its charge. The
                        pastoral solitude of the Middle country was routed for the moment by an
                        assemblage of the brilliance and power of all Egypt.</p>
                    <p> With a shout that made the remote hills reply again and again, the convoy
                        divided, a half retreating to either side of the Nile and the home-coming
                        fleet entered the hollow. The nomarch&apos;s boat detached itself from
                        its following and took up a position in the center, beside the royal barge.
                        The advance was de- layed only long enough for the escort to turn, take in
                        the sails—for they went against the wind now—and form an outer parenthesis.
                        Then with another shout the triumphant return began.</p>
                    <p>The other fleet absorbed the attention of each voya- ger. Every barge had a
                        new-comer alongside and near enough to talk across the water. Therefore a
                        great babel and confusion arose in which rational conversation became
                        impossible. Then vessels essayed to approach nearer one another and the
                        formation be- gan to break. The right oars of one boat and the left of
                        another would be withdrawn and the vessels lashed together. Then they were
                        permitted to drift, with some poling to keep them in the proper direction.
                        When this proceeding was impracticable because of the construction of the
                        barges, one boat would take another in tow until the occupants of one had
                        joined those of the other by a gang-plank laid from prow to stern. By sunset
                        the merrymaking had developed into indis- <pb id="VAA3882-183" n="175"/>
                        criminate boarding. Only the vessels of the king and the nomarch and the
                        barge of Senci were not involved in the uproarious revel that followed. The
                        fates were amiable and no mishaps occurred in spite of the reck- lessness of
                        the pastime. Men and women alike took part in the play, and the general
                        temper of the merry- makers was good-natured and innocent.</p>
                    <p>The dusk fell and the shadows of night were made seductive by the dim lamps
                        that began to burn from mast-top and prow. On the barge of Senci only a
                        single and subdued light was swung from a bronze tripod in the bow, and the
                        fourteen charges of the young sculptor, wearied with the long day&apos;s
                        excite- ment, were disposed in graceful abandon under its glow. Senci sat
                        with Ta-meri&apos;s head in her lap, and three or four drowsy little
                        girls were tumbled about her feet. Only Io was wide awake, and even her
                        sweet face wore a pensive air. Kenkenes had retired to the stern, where,
                        under the high up-standing end, stood a long wooden bench. The young
                        sculptor had flung himself on this, and with the whole of the boat and its
                        freight within range of his vision, he listened to the riot about him.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly the sound of cautiously wielded oars attracted his attention. In the
                        end of the boat was a hawser-hole, painted and shaped like the eye of
                        Osiris. Kenkenes turned about on his couch and watched through this
                        aperture.</p>
                    <p>A barge, judiciously darkened, emerged into the circle of faint radiance
                        about Senci&apos;s boat. There were probably a dozen Theban nobles of
                        various ages grouped in attitudes of hushed expectancy in the bow. One
                        robust peer, with a boat-hook in his hand, leaned <pb id="VAA3882-184"
                            n="176"/> over the prow. Another, barely older than fourteen, had
                        mounted the side of the boat, and steadying him- self by the shoulder of a
                        young lord, gazed ahead at the group in the bow of Senci&apos;s
                        boat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By the horns of Isis,&quot; he whispered in disgust,
                        &quot;the most of them are babes!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The robust noble turned his head and jeered good- naturedly under his
                        breath.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mark the infant sneering at the buds. But be of cheer. One is
                        there, ripe enough to sate your green appetite.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay! do you distribute them now? Let me make my choice,
                        then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But a general chorus of whispered protests arose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold, not so fast. The fan-bearer first. &apos;Twas he who hit
                        upon the plan.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The nose of the pursuing boat crept alongside the stern of the one pursued,
                        and the oars rested in obedience to a whispered order. The diagonal current
                        which moved out from the Arabian shore, and the backward wash of water from
                        the oars of the forward boat, heaved the head of the nobles&apos; barge
                        toward its object. The robust courtier leaned forward and made fast to his
                        captive with the hook. A sigh of approval and excitement ran through the
                        group.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Gods! how they will scatter!&quot; the young lord tit- tered
                        nervously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, now, there must be no such thing,&quot; the robust noble
                        said, addressing them all. &quot;Mind you, we but come as guests. It
                        shall be left to the ladies to say how we shall abide with them. Show me a
                        light.&quot; The instant brilliance that followed proved that a hood had
                        been lifted from a lamp. One of the men <pb id="VAA3882-185" n="177"/> held
                        a cloak between it and the group on Senci&apos;s boat. Kenkenes raised
                        himself. The lamp discovered to his angry eyes the face of Har-hat.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Now, hold this hook for me while I get aboard,&quot; the
                        fan-bearer chuckled.</p>
                    <p>With a single step the young sculptor crossed to the side of the barge and
                        wrenched the hook from the hands of the man that held it. For a moment he
                        poised it above him, struggling with a mighty desire to bring it down on the
                        head of the startled fan-bearer. The youthful lord dropped from his point of
                        vantage and half of the group retreated precipitately. Har-hat drew back
                        slowly and raised himself, as Kenkenes lowered the weapon. For a space the
                        two regarded each other savagely. The contemplation endured only the
                        smallest part of a moment, but it was eloquent of the bitterest mutual
                        antagonism. There was no re- laxing in the rigid lines of hte young
                        sculptor&apos;s figure, but the fan-bearer recovered himself
                        immediately.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Forestalled!&quot; he laughed. &quot;Retreat! We would not
                        steal another man&apos;s bliss though it be fourteen times his
                        share!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The oars fell and the boat darted back into the night, the affable sound of
                        Har-hat&apos;s raillery receding into silence with it.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes flung the boat-hook into the Nile and re- turned to his bench,
                        puzzled at the inordinate passion of hate in his heart for the
                        fan-bearer.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the first watch the flotilla drifted into Memphis. Bonfires so
                        vast as to suggest conflagra- tions made the long water-front as brilliant
                        as day. Far up the slope toward the city the red light discovered a great
                        multitude, densely packed and cheering tu- <pb id="VAA3882-186" n="178"/>
                        multuously. Amid the uproar one by one the barges approached and discharged
                        their occupants along the wharves. Soldiery in companies drove a roadway
                        through the mass from time to time, by which the arrivals might enter
                        Memphis, though few of these departed at once. When the Lady
                        Senci&apos;s barge drew up, Mentu forced his way through the increasing
                        crowd to meet and assist its occupants to alight. Kenkenes, still on deck,
                        was handing his charges down the stairway one by one, when he saw Io, who
                        stood at the very end of the line, lean over the side, her face aglow with
                        joy. Kenkenes guessed the cause of her delight and, deserting his post, went
                        to her side. Below stood Seti, on &apos;tiptoe, his hands upstretched
                        against the tall hull.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, I can not reach thee,&quot; he was crying.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes caught up the trembling, blushing, repent- ant girl and lowered her
                        plump into the prince&apos;s eager arms.</p>
                    <p>When Kenkenes saw her an hour later, he lifted her out of her curricle before
                        the portals of Senci&apos;s house.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did I tell thee?&quot; he said softly.</p>
                    <p>But the little girl clung to his arms and leaned against him with a sob.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O Kenkenes,&quot; she whispered, &quot;he came but to drag
                        me away to look upon her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didst go?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; she answered fiercely,</p>
                    <p>After a silence Kenkenes spoke again:</p>
                    <p>&quot;He does not love her, Io. Believe me. I doubt not the sorceress
                        hath bewitched him, but he would not rush after a whilom sweetheart to have
                        her look upon a new one, Rather would he strive to cover up <pb
                            id="VAA3882-187" n="179"/> his faithlessness. But he hath been untrue to
                        thee in this-that he shares a thought with the witch when his whole mind
                        should be full of thee. Bide thy time till he emerges from the spell, then
                        make him writhe. Meantime, save thy tears.&apos; Never was a man worth
                        one of them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He kissed her again and set her inside Senci&apos;s house.</p>
                    <p>But one remained now of the procession he had escorted from the river. This
                        was the Lady Ta-meri&apos;s litter, and his own chariot stood ahead of
                        it. She had lifted the curtains and was piling the opposite seat with
                        cushions in a manner unmistakably inviting. He hesitated a moment. Should he
                        dismiss his charioteer and journey to the nomarch&apos;s mansion in the
                        com- panionable luxury of the litter? But even while he debated with
                        himself, he passed her with a soft word and stepped into his chariot.</p>

                    <p>Meneptah having come and the old. regime of life resumed, Memphis subsided
                        into her normal state of dignity. Mentu remained in his house preparing for
                        his investiture with the office of murket. His hours were spent in study,
                        and the coming and going of Ken- kenes crossed his consciousness as swiftly
                        as the shadows wavered under his young palms. His son might work for hours
                        near him on mysterious draw- ings, but so deep was the great artist in the
                        writings of the old murkets that he did not think to ask him what he did. It
                        might not have won his attention even had he seen the young man burn the
                        sheets of papyrus thereafter, and grow restless and dissatisfied. He
                        remarked, however, that Kenkenes was absent during the noon-meal, but when
                        the sundown repast was served and the young man was in his place, Mentu had
                        forgotten that he had not been there at midday.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes had visited his niche in the Arabian desert. On his way to the
                        statue he came to the line of rocks where he had hidden himself to get
                        Athor&apos;s likeness, and looked down into the quarry opposite him. He
                        was astonished to see at the ledge, just below, a great water-cart with
                        three humped oxen attached. The water-bearers were grouped about it and a
                        Hebrew <pb id="VAA3882-189" n="181"/> youth was drawing off the watef in
                        skins and jars. The children received their burdens from his hands and
                        passed up the wooden incline to the scaffold. There Kenkenes saw that the
                        incline had been extended to the level of the platform, and the children
                        were able to deliver the hides directly into the hands of the laborers. Then
                        it occurred to Kenkenes that there was not a woman in sight about the
                        quarries. While he wondered, Rachel emerged from the windings of the valley
                        into the open space below.</p>
                    <p>She carried a band of linen and a small box of horn in her hand. When the
                        young bearers saw her, one of them, who had been rubbing his eye, came to
                        her. She set her box upon an outstanding edge of stone and devoted herself
                        to him. Drawing his head back until it rested against her bosom, with tender
                        hands she dressed the injured optic with balm from the box.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes from his aery watched her, noting with a softening countenance the
                        almost maternal love that beautified her face. Now and then she spoke sooth-
                        ingly as the boy flinched, but her words were so softly said that the
                        sculptor did not catch them. The eye dressed, she covered it with the
                        bandage and the pair separated. It was with some regret that Kenkenes saw
                        her turn to leave the spot. But at that moment the taskmaster rode into the
                        open space. She made a sign of salutation and paused at a word from him.
                        Kenkenes fancied that her face had sobered and he looked down on the cowled
                        head and shoulders of the overseer, wrathfully wondering if the Egyptian had
                        played the master so harshly that Rachel dreaded him. Presently the man
                        dismounted; and though his back was turned toward Kenkenes, the young
                        sculptor <pb id="VAA3882-190" n="182"/> knew by his stature that he was not
                        the soldier who had first governed the quarries. The young man watched him
                        excitedly but there was no display of tyranny or even authority in the
                        taskmaster&apos;s manner. They talked, and by the motion of the
                        man&apos;s hand Kenkenes fancied that he described something grow- ing
                        near the Nile. Presently they walked together toward the outlet of the
                        valley. The taskmaster leaped down the ledge and, turning, put up his arms
                        and lifted Rachel down. It was plain that something more than courtesy
                        inspired the act, for the man&apos;s hands fell reluctantly. Kenkenes
                        faced sharply about and proceeded up the hill to his statue with a queer
                        discomfort tugging at his heart.</p>
                    <p>That night in his effort to bring forth the coveted expression in his
                        drawings of Athor, Kenkenes all but satisfied himself.</p>
                    <p>The next day, without any apparent cause, he went back to the niche in the
                        desert, stayed without purpose, and departed when no tangible reason urged
                        him. When the day declined he climbed down the front of the hill and crossed
                        the narrow field toward his boat, which was buried in the rank vegetation of
                        the water&apos;s edge. At the Nile he noted, a little distance up the
                        river, a familiar figure among the reeds. For a mo- ment he hesitated and
                        then rambled through the riot- ous growth in that direction. As he drew
                        near, Rachel raised herself from a search in a thicket of herbs, her arms
                        full of them and her face a little flushed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Idler!&quot; said Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay,&quot; she answered with a smile, &quot;I am at work—
                        learned work.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-191" n="183"/>
                    <p>&quot;Gathering witch-weeds for an incantation, sor-
                        ceress?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so. I am hunting herbs to make simples for the
                        sick.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth? Then never before now have I craved for an illness that
                        I might select my leech.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again she smiled and made a sheaf of the herbs, preparatory to binding it.
                        The bundle was unruly, and several of the plants dropped. She bent to pick
                        them up and others fell. Kenkenes came to her rescue and gathered them all
                        into his large grasp.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, while I hold it,&quot; he suggested.</p>
                    <p>With the most gracious self-possession she smoothed out the fiber, put it
                        twice, thrice about the sheaf and knotted it, her fingers, cool and moist
                        after their con- tact with the marsh sedge, touching the sculptor&apos;s
                        more than once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There! I thank thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are there any sick in the camp?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Only those who have been blinded by the stone- dust. But I prepare
                        for sickness during health.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A wise provision. Would we might prepare for sorrow during
                        contentment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We may lay up comfort for us against the coming of
                        misfortune.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In choosing friends,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>His mind went back to the scene of that morning., Did she speak of the
                        taskmaster?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast found it so?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast said.&quot; She added no more, though the sculptor
                        was eager for an example.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-192" n="184"/>
                    <p>&quot;How goes it with the statue?&quot; she asked, seeing that he
                        did not move out of her path.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Slowly,&quot; he answered. &quot;But it shall hasten to
                        completeness when I once begin.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What wilt thou do with it when it is done? De- stroy
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shook his head with a smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Leave it there to betray thee to the vengeance of the priesthood
                        one day?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have no fear of discovery.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but fear or unfear never yet warded off mis-
                        fortune,&quot; she said gravely. &quot;It is better to entertain
                        causeless concern than unwise confidence.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He eagerly accepted this establishment of equality between them, and overshot
                        his mark.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Advise me, Rachel. What should I do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gazed at him for a moment distrustfully, won- dering if he mocked her and
                        asking herself if she had not deserved it in assuming comradeship with
                        him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, it is not my place, my master,&quot; she said. &quot;I
                        did forget.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He put his hand on hers with considerable determi- nation in his manner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let us make an end to this eternal emphasis of different rank. I
                        would forget it, Rachel. Wilt thou not permit me? I am thy friend and
                        nothing harsher —above all things, not thy master.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Never before had he spoken so to her. She ven- tured to look at him at last.
                        His face was grave and a little passionate and his eyes demanded an
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, I shall gladly be thy friend,&quot; she answered;
                        &quot;but never hast thou been so much of a master as in the <pb
                            id="VAA3882-193" n="185"/> denial that thou art.&quot; The first
                        gleam of girlish mis- chief danced in her blue eyes. The young sculptor
                        noted it with gladness. He took the free hand and pressed it, and when she
                        turned toward the roadway through the wheat he turned with her and hand in
                        hand they went. As they neared it he spoke again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Again would I ask, when wilt thou advise me con- cerning the
                        statue? Here is my boat. Let us turn it into a high seat of council and I
                        will sit at thy feet and learn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, if I sit I shall linger too long, and there is a
                        taskmaster—albeit a gentle one—waiting with other things for me to
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes kicked the turf and frowned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It sounds barbarous—this talk of master upon thy lips, Rachel. Thou
                        art out of thy place,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am no more worthy of freedom than my people,&quot; she
                        replied with dignity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy people! They should be lawgivers and ad- visers among
                        Egypt&apos;s high places, rather than brick- makers and quarry-slaves,
                        if thou art a typical Israel- ite.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Aye!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;and thou hast given tongue
                        to the same estimate of Israel, which hath wrought consternation among the
                        powers of Mizraim. And for that reason are we enslaved. Think of it, thou
                        who art unafraid to think. Think of a people in bondage because of its
                        numbers, its sturdiness and its wisdom. Thou who art in rebellion against
                        ancient law dost feel somewhat of Israel&apos;s hurt. Behold, am I not
                        also oppressed because I may think to the upsetting of idol- atry and the
                        overthrow of mine oppressors? Thou <pb id="VAA3882-194" n="186"/> and I are
                        fellows in bondage; but mark me! I am nearer freedom than thou. The Pharaohs
                        began too late. Ye may not dam the Nile at flood-tide.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her face was full of triumph and her voice of prophecy. She seemed to declare
                        with authority the freedom of her people. Kenkenes did not speak im-
                        mediately. His thoughts were undergoing a change. The pity he had felt that
                        night a month agone for her sanguine anticipation of freedom seemed useless
                        and wasted. Her confidence was no longer fatuous. He admitted in entirety
                        the truth of her last words. If all Israel—nay, if but part, if but its
                        leaders were as able and determined as she, did Meneptah guess his peril?
                        Was not Egypt most ominously menaced? He remembered that he had been amused
                        at his father&apos;s perturbation over the Israelitish unrest, but he
                        vindi- cated Mentu then and there. Furthermore, if all Israel were like unto
                        her, what heinous injustice had been perpetrated upon an able people? He
                        found himself hoping that they would assert themselves and enter freedom,
                        whether it be in Canaan or in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If ever Israel come to her own,&quot; he said impulsive- ly,
                        &quot;I pray thee, Rachel, remember me to her powers as her partizan in
                        her darker days. And take this into account when thou comest to judge Egypt.
                        The half of the nation know not thy people, even as I have been ignorant;
                        and Osiris pity the hand that would oppress them if all Egypt is made
                        acquainted with them as I have been in these past days. Art thou indeed
                        typical of thy race?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou not been among us often enough to dis- cover?&quot;
                        she parried smilingly.</p>
                    <p>He shook his head. &quot;Nay, I have known but one <pb id="VAA3882-195"
                            n="187"/> Israelite, and she keeps me perpetually aghast at
                        Egypt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel&apos;s eyes fell.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We did speak of the statue,&quot; she began.</p>
                    <p> &quot;O, aye! I meant to tell thee how I had fortified myself against
                        mischance. I can not break up the statue; sooner would I assail sweet flesh
                        with a sledge; but when it is done I shall bury it in the sands. It will
                        wrench me sorely to do even that. During the carving I feel most secure, for
                        Memphis and Masaarah think I come hither to look after the removal of
                        stones, since I am a sculptor. But if an Egyptian should come upon it by
                        mischance before it is complete, I have left no trace of myself upon it.
                        Most of all I trust to the generosity of the Hathors, who have abetted me so
                        openly thus far.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel heard him thoughtfully.</p>
                    <p> &quot;What a pity it is that thou must follow after the pattern of God
                        and sate thy love of beauty by stealth under ban and in fear. Till what time
                        Mizraim sets this law of sculpture aside she may not boast her wis- dom
                        flawless. It is past understanding why she ex- acts obedience to this law
                        most diligently, which fath- ers these ill-favored images of her gods, when
                        their habitations are most splendidly and most beautifully built. She robeth
                        herself in fine linen, decketh herself with jewels, anointeth her hair and
                        maketh her eyes lovely with kohl, and lo! when she would picture her- self
                        she setteth her shoulders awry and slighteth the grace of her joints and the
                        softness of her flesh. O, that thy brave spirit had arisen long ago, ere the
                        per- version had become a heritage, dear to the Egyptian sculptor as his
                        bones! But now, artist though he be, <pb id="VAA3882-196" n="188"/> his eye
                        is so befilmed by ancient use that he sees no monstrousness in his work. So
                        thou hast nation-wide, nation-old, nation-defended custom to fight. And
                        alas! thou art but one, Kenkenes, and I fear for thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For once the young sculptor&apos;s ready speech failed him. He drew near
                        her, his eyes shining, his lips parted, drinking every word as if it were
                        authoritative privilege for him to indulge his love of beauty without limit
                        and openly. Here was that which he had sought in vain from those nearest to
                        him—that which he had ceased to believe was to be found in Egypt—comfort,
                        sympathy, perfect understanding. What if it came from the lips of an
                        hereditary slave of the Pharaoh— a toiler in the quarries, an infidel, an
                        alien nomad? If an alien, a slave, an unbeliever thought so deeply, felt so
                        acutely and responded so discerningly to such delicate requirements—the
                        slave, the nomad for him!</p>
                    <p> &quot;Rachel,&quot; he began almost helplessly, &quot;I am
                        beyond extrication in debt to thee—thou golden, thou unde- cipherable
                        mystery!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She flushed to her very brows and her eyes fell quickly.</p>
                    <p> &quot;I have appealed to all sources from which I might justly expect
                        sympathy—to men of reason, of power, of mine own kin, and to women of
                        heart—and not once have I found in them the broad and kindly un- derstanding
                        which thou hast displayed for me out of the goodness of thy beautiful heart.
                        Behold! thou hast given speech to my own hidden longings, sum- marized my
                        difficulties, foreshadowed my misfortunes, deplored them—aye, of a truth,
                        heaved my very sighs for me!&quot; His voice fell and grew reverent.
                        &quot;I would call thee an immortal, but there is a better title <pb
                            id="VAA3882-197" n="189"/> for thee-woman-a true woman-and thou dost
                        even uplift the name.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For the first time in the history of their acquaint- ance she laughed, not
                        mirthfully, but low and very hap- pily, and the fleeting glimpse she gave
                        him of her eyes showed them radiant and glad. He caught her hands, the
                        bundle of herbs fell, and drawing her near him, he lifted the pink palms to
                        his lips and pressed them there.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; she said, recovering herself and withdraw- ing her
                        hands, &quot;I am not an Egyptian but a Hebrew, unbiased by the
                        prejudices of thy nation. It is not strange that I can understand thy
                        rebellion, which is but a rift in thine Egyptian make-up through which
                        reason shows. Any alien could comfort thee as well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And thou hast no more sympathy for me than any alien would
                        have?&quot; he asked, somewhat piqued.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is there any other sympathizing alien with whom I may compare and
                        learn?&quot; she asked with a smile.</p>
                    <p>She took up her bundle of herbs again and seemed to be preparing to leave
                        him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How dost thou know these things,&quot; he asked hur- riedly;
                        &quot;all these things-sculpture, religion, history?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was not born a slave,&quot; she answered simply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, cast out that word. I would never hear thee speak it,
                        Rachel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then, I was born out of servitude. My great grandsire was exempted
                        by Seti when Israel went into bondage. His children and all his house were
                        given to profit by the covenant. But the name grew wealthy and powerful to
                        the third generation. My father was Maai the Compassionate, who loved his
                        brethren bet- ter than himself. Them he helped. Rameses the Great forgot his
                        father&apos;s promise when he found he <pb id="VAA3882-198" n="190"/>
                        had need of my father&apos;s treasure—&quot; she paused and
                        continued as if the recital hurt her. &quot;There were ten —four of my
                        mother&apos;s house, six of my father&apos;s. To the mines and the
                        brick-fields they were sent, and in a little space I was all that was
                        left.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Horrified and conscience-stricken, Kenkenes made as if to speak, but she went
                        on hurriedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My mother&apos;s nurse, Deborah, who went with us into
                        servitude, is learned, having been taught by my mother, and I have been her
                        pupil.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And there is not one of thy blood—not one guard- ian kinsman left
                        to thee?&quot; Kenkenes asked slowly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Up to this moment, during every interview with Rachel, Kenkenes had forsworn
                        some little prejudice, or sacrificed some of his blithe self-esteem. But the
                        tragic narrative swept all these supports from him and left him solitary to
                        face the charge of indirect complic- ity in murder. He was an Egyptian—a
                        loyal sup- porter of the government and its policies; he had profited by
                        Israel&apos;s toil, and if he succeeded to his father&apos;s office,
                        Israel would serve him directly in his labor for the Pharaoh to be. He had
                        known that Israel was oppressed, that Israel died of hard labor, and he had
                        pitied it, as the humane soul in him had felt for the overworked draft-oxen
                        or the sacrifices that were led bleating to the altars. Perhaps he had even
                        cas- ually decried the policy that sent women into the brick- fields and did
                        men to death in a year in the mines. But his own conscience had not been
                        hurt, nor had he taken the misdeed home to himself.</p>
                    <p>Now his sensations were vastly different. He felt all the guilt of his
                        nation, and he had nothing to offer <pb id="VAA3882-199" n="191"/> as amends
                        but his own humiliation. Of this he had an overwhelming plenitude and his
                        eloquent face showed it. With an effort he raised his head and spoke.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Rachel, if my humiliation will satisfy thee even a little as
                        vengeance upon Egypt, do thou shame me into the dust if thou
                        wilt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not understand thee,&quot; she said with dignity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Believe me. I would help thee in some wise, and alas! there is no
                        other way by deed or word that I could prove my sorrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p> Tears leaped into her eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay! Nay!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Thou dost wrong me,
                        Kenkenes. What wickedness were mine to make the one contrite, guiltless
                        heart in Egypt suffer for all the unrepentant and the wrong-doers of the
                        land!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Once again he took her hand and kissed it, because the act was more eloquent
                        than words at that moment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is near sunset,&quot; she said softly, &quot;give me
                        leave to depart.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Farewell, and the divine Mother attend thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She bowed and left him.</p>
                    <p>That night in the dim work-room Kenkenes brought forth upon papyrus a face of
                        Athor, so full of love and yearning that he knew his own heart had given his
                        fingers direction and inspiration. He sought no fur- ther.</p>
                    <p>To-morrow in the niche in the desert he would carve the want of his own soul
                        in the countenance of the goddess.</p>

                    <p>It was Kenkenes&apos; first love and so was most raptur- ous, but it did
                        not cast a glamour over the stern per- plexities that it entailed. He knew
                        the suspense that is immemorial among lovers, and further to trouble him he
                        had the harsh obstacle of different society. Rachel was a quarry-slave, a
                        member of the lowest rank in the Egyptian scale of classes. She was an
                        Israelite, an infidel and a reviler of the gods.</p>
                    <p>He was a descendant of kings, a devout Osirian and welcomed in
                        Egypt&apos;s high places.</p>
                    <p>Never could extremes have been greater. But Ken- kenes would not have given
                        any of these obstacles a moment&apos;s consideration had not the weight
                        of their neglect fallen on the shoulders of Rachel. If he had been a
                        sovereign he could have taken her freely, and purple-wearing Egypt would
                        have kissed her sandal; but he occupied a place that could provide with
                        honor only him who was born to it.</p>
                    <p>To lift Rachel to that position would be to expose her to the affronts of an
                        undemocratic society. On the other hand he might sacrifice name and station
                        and go down to her; but he was not to be judged harshly because he hesitated
                        at this step.</p>
                    <p>Rachel had given him no sign of preference beyond <pb id="VAA3882-201"
                            n="193"/> a pretty fellowship. In the beginning this realization had
                        hurt him, but as he tossed night after night, troubled beyond expression, he
                        remembered this thing with some melancholy comfort. It was a sorry solu-
                        tion of his problem to feel that he was unloved, and even while he
                        recognized its efficacy, he prayed that it might not be so.</p>
                    <p>His heavy heart did not retard the progress of his statue or make its beauty
                        indifferent. The more he suffered the greater the passion in the face. He
                        la- bored daily and tirelessly.</p>
                    <p>But day by day he looked, unseen, on his love in the valley, and the oftener
                        he looked the more irresolute he grew. The conflict between his heart and
                        his reason was gradually shifting in favor of his love.</p>
                    <p>His longing, as it continued to crave, grew from hunger to starving, and
                        though his reason pointed to disastrous results, his heart justified itself
                        in the blind cry, &quot;Rachel, Rachel!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had endured a month before his fortitude suc- cumbed entirely. Once near
                        sunset, as Rachel was proceeding toward the camp from some helpful mis- sion
                        to the quarries, she caught the fragments of a song, so distantly and
                        absently sung that she could not locate it. There were singers among the
                        Israelites, but they sang with wild exultation and more care for the sense
                        than the melody. They had cultivated the chant and forgotten the lyric,
                        because they had more heart for prophecy than passion. Rachel had revered
                        her people&apos;s song, but there was something in this half- heard
                        music that touched her youth and her love of life. She stopped to hear it
                        well.</p>
                    <p>It had all the power and profundity of the male <pb id="VAA3882-202" n="194"
                        /> voice, but it was as subdued, as flawless and sympa- thetic as a distant,
                        deep-toned bell. There was not even a breath of effort in it, nor an
                        insincere expres- sion, and it pursued a theme of little range and much
                        simplicity. The singer sang as spontaneously as a bird sings. She did not
                        catch the words, but something in the fervor of the music told her it was a
                        song of love —and a song of love unsatisfied. There was a pathos in it that
                        touched the fountain of her tears and awoke to willingness that impulse in
                        her womanhood that longs to comfort.</p>
                    <p>As she stood in an attitude of rapt attention, Ken- kenes rounded a curve in
                        the valley just ahead of her. The song died suddenly on his lips and the
                        color deep- ened in his cheeks.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fie!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Here thou art, O Athor,
                        catching me in the imperfection of my practice. Now will the keen edge of
                        their perfect beauty be dulled upon thine ear when I come to lift my tuneful
                        devo- tions to thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And it was thou singing?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p> &quot;It was I—and Pentaur; mine the voice; Pentaur&apos;s the
                        song.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Together ye have wrought an eloquent harmony, but such a voice as
                        thine would gild the pale effort of the poorest words,&quot; she said
                        earnestly. &quot;What dost thou with thy voice?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Once I won me a pretty compliment with it,&quot; he said
                        softly, bending his head to look at her. She flushed and her eyes fell.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, it is but my pastime and at the command of my
                        friends,&quot; he continued. &quot;See. This is what has made me
                        sing.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-203" n="195"/>
                    <p>He unslung his wallet and took out of it a statuette of creamy chalk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thus far has the Athor of the hills progressed.&quot; He put it
                        into her hands for examination. The face was complete, the minute features
                        as perfect as life, the plaits of long hair and all the figure exquisitely
                        copied and shaped. The pedestal was yet in rough block. Rachel inspected it,
                        wondering. Finally she looked up at him with praise in her eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dost thou forgive me?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is for me to ask thy forgiveness,&quot; she answered.
                        &quot;So we be equally indebted and therefore not in debt.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Not so. I know the joy of creating uncramped, and the joy of
                        copying such a model far outweighs any small delight thy little vanity may
                        have experienced. Thy vanity? Hast thou any vanity?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I trust not,&quot; she replied laughingly.
                        &quot;Vanity is self-esteem run to seed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sage! Let me make haste to carve the pedestal that I may know how
                        low. to do obeisance to wisdom. Hold it so, I pray thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took the statue and set it on a flat cornice jutting from the stone wall.
                        Rachel obediently steadied it. He selected from his tools a knife with a
                        rounded point of wonderful keenness and smoothed away the chalk in bulk.
                        They stood close together, the sculptor bend- ing from his commanding height
                        to work. From time to time he shifted his position, touching her hand often
                        and saying little.</p>
                    <p>The pedestal given shape, he began its elaboration. Pattern after pattern of
                        graceful foliation emerged till the design assumed the intricate complexity
                        of the Egyptic style.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-204" n="196"/>
                    <p>Rachel watched with absorbed interest, her head un- consciously settling to
                        one side in critical contempla- tion. Kenkenes, pressing the blade firmly
                        upon the chalk, felt her cheek touch his shoulder for a fraction of a
                        second; his fingers lost their steadiness and direc- tion, but not their
                        strength; the blade slipped, and the fierce edge struck the white hand that
                        held the stat- uette.</p>
                    <p>With a cry he dropped the knife, flung one arm about her and drew her very
                        close to him. The image toppled down and was broken on the rock below, but
                        he saw only the fine scarlet thread on the soft flesh.</p>
                    <p>Again and again he pressed the wounded hand to his lips, his eyes dimmed with
                        tears of compunction.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, Rachel, Rachel!&quot; he exclaimed in a sudden burst of
                        passionate contrition. &quot;Must even the most loving hand in Egypt be
                        lifted against thee?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The great content on the glorified face against his breast was all the
                        expression of pardon that he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My love! My Rachel!&quot; he whispered. &quot;Ah, ye
                        generous gods! indulge me still further. Let this, your richest gift, be
                        mine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The gods!</p>
                    <p>Stunned and only realizing that she must undo his clasp, she freed herself
                        and retreated a little space from him.</p>
                    <p>And then she remembered.</p>
                    <p>Slowly and relentlessly it came home to her that this was one of the
                        abominable idolaters, and she had for- sworn such for ever. These very arms
                        that had held her so shelteringly had been lifted in supplication to the
                        idols, and the lips, whose kiss she had awaited, would swear to love her, by
                        an image. The pitiless <pb id="VAA3882-205" n="197"/> truth, once admitted,
                        smote her cruelly. She covered her face with her hands.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes, amazed and deeply moved, went to her immediately.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What have I said?&quot; he begged. &quot;What have I
                        done?&quot;</p>
                    <p>What had he done, indeed? But to have spoken, though to explain, would have
                        meant capitulation. She wavered a moment, and then turning away, fled up the
                        valley toward the camp—not from him, but from herself.</p>

                        <hi rend="sc">THE ADVICE OF HOTEP</hi></head>
                    <p>If Mentu, looking up from the old murkets, noted that the face of his son was
                        weary and sad, he laid it to the sudden heat of the spring; for now it was
                        the middle of March and Ra had grown ardent and the marshes malarious. The
                        old housekeeper, to whom the great artist mentioned his son&apos;s
                        indisposition, glanced sharply at the young master, touched his hand when
                        she served him at table, and felt his forehead when she pretended to smooth
                        his hair. And having made her furtive examination, the astute old servant
                        told the great artist that the young master was not ill. If she had further
                        information to impart, Mentu did not give her the opportunity, for had she
                        not said that Kenkenes was well? So he fell to his work again.</p>
                    <p>Senci noted it, and sorrowful Io, but they, like Mentu, ascribed it to the
                        miasmas and said nothing to the young man about himself.</p>
                    <p>But Hotep was a penetrative man, and more hidden things than his
                        friend&apos;s ailment had been an open secret to his keen eye. He did
                        not care to know which one of the butterflies was the fluttering object of
                        Kenkenes&apos; bounteous love, for Hotep knew that those high-born
                        Memphian women, who were openly partial <pb id="VAA3882-207" n="199"/> to
                        the handsome young sculptor, loved him for his comeliness and his silken
                        tongue alone. It would take a profounder soul than any they had displayed to
                        understand and sympathize with the restive genius hidden under the smooth
                        exterior they saw.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, with some impatience, Hotep conceded that his friend was in love,
                        and presumably throwing himself away. So the scribe purposed, even though
                        the attempt were inevitably fruitless, to win Kenkenes out of his dream.</p>
                    <p>One faint dawn he entered the temple to pray for his own cause at the shrine
                        of the lovers&apos; goddess.</p>
                    <p>In the half-night of the vast interior, at the foot of the sumptuous pedestal
                        of Athor, he distinguished another supplicant, kneeling. But there was a
                        hope- lessness in the droop of the bowed head and a tenseness in the
                        interlaced fingers of the clasped hands, which proved that Athor&apos;s
                        answer had not been propitious.</p>
                    <p>Hotep knew at once who besought the goddess. Set- ting his offering of silver
                        and crystal on the altar, the scribe departed with silent step. But without,
                        he ground his teeth and execrated the giver of pain to Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>In mid-afternoon of the same day Hotep&apos;s chariot drew up at the
                        portals of Mentu&apos;s house, and the scribe in his most splendid
                        raiment was conducted to Kenkenes. The young sculptor was alone.</p>
                    <p> &quot;What was it, a palsy or the sun which kept thee at home this
                        day?&quot; was Hotep&apos;s greeting. &quot;Nine is a mystic
                        number and is fruitful of much gain. Eight times within a month have I come
                        for thee. The ninth did supply thee. Blessed be the number.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes smiled. &quot;But there are seven Hathors, <pb id="VAA3882-208"
                            n="200"/> and five days in the epact—and the Radiant Three. To me it
                        seemeth there are many good numbers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep plucked his sleeve.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, I will show thee the best of all—One, the One.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes arose. &quot;Let me robe myself befittingly, then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not too effectively,&quot; the scribe cried after him.
                        &quot;I would not have thee blight my chances with the full blaze of thy
                        beauty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Kenkenes returned Hotep looked at him with another thought than had been
                        uppermost in his mind since he had noted his friend&apos;s dejection.
                        This time he was impatient with Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And such a man as this will permit a woman to break his
                        heart!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then was the young sculptor taken to the palace of the Pharaoh. On its roof,
                        in the great square shadow of its double towers, he was presented to a
                        dainty little lady, whose black eyes grew large and luminous at the coming
                        of the scribe. She was Masanath, the young- est and only unwedded child of
                        Har-hat, the king&apos;s adviser. Her oval face had a uniform rose-leaf
                        flush, her little nose was distinctly aquiline, her little mouth warm and
                        ripe. Her teeth were dazzlingly white, and, like a baby&apos;s, notched
                        on the edges with minute serra- tions. But with all her tininess, she
                        planted her sandal with decision and scrutinized whosoever addressed her in
                        a way that was eloquent of a force and perception larger by far than the
                        lady they characterized.</p>
                    <p>And this was the love of Hotep. Kenkenes smiled. The top of her pretty head
                        was not nearly on a level with his shoulders, and the small hand she
                        extended <pb id="VAA3882-209" n="201"/> had the determined grip with which a
                        baby seizes a proffered finger. A vision of the golden Israelite rose beside
                        her and the smile vanished.</p>
                    <p>The day was warm and the courtiers in search of a breeze were scattered about
                        the palace-top in pictur- esque groups. Masanath occupied a diphros, or dou-
                        ble chair, and a female attendant, standing behind her, stirred the warm air
                        with a perfumed fan. The lady was on the point of sharing her seat with one
                        of her guests, when Har-hat, who had been lounging by him- self on the
                        parapet, sauntered over to his daughter&apos;s side.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My father,&quot; she said, &quot;the son of Mentu, the
                        first friend of the noble Hotep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes had noticed, with a chill, the approach of the fan-bearer, and,
                        angry with himself for his unrea- soning perturbation, strove to greet him
                        composedly. But he could not force himself into graciousness. The formal
                        obeisance might have been made appropriately to his bitterest enemy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The son of Mentu and I have met before,&quot; the fan- bearer
                        declared laughingly. &quot;But I scarce should have recognized him in
                        this man of peace had not his stature been impressed upon me in that hour
                        when first I met him.&quot; The fan-bearer paused to enjoy the wonder of
                        his daughter and the scribe, and the hardening face of Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But for the agility the gods have seen fit to leave me in mine
                        advancing years,&quot; he continued, &quot;this self- same courteous
                        noble would have brained me with a boat-hook on an occasion of much
                        merrymaking, a month agone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He sat down on the arm of Masanath&apos;s chair and <pb id="VAA3882-210"
                            n="202"/> shouted with laughter. With a great effort Kenkenes controlled
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall I give the story in full?&quot; he asked with an odd
                        quiet in his voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay! Nay!&quot; Har-hat protested; &quot;I have told the
                        worst I would have said concerning that defeat of mine.&apos; Again he
                        laughed and returned to the young man&apos;s identity once more.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Aye, I might have known that thou wast somewhat of kin to Mentu.
                        Ye are as much alike as two owlets —same candid face.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He sauntered away, leaving an awkward silence be- hind him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sit beside me?&quot; asked Masanath, drawing the folds of her
                        white robes aside to make room for the scribe. But Hotep did not seem to
                        hear. Instead, he wandered away for another chair, became interested in a
                        group of long-eyed beauties near by and apparently forgot Masanath. Kenkenes
                        did not permit any lapse be- tween the invitation and its acceptance. He
                        dropped into the place made for Hotep, as if the offer had been extended to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;From Bubastis to Memphis, from Bast to Ptah,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;Dost thou miss the generous levels of the Delta in our crevice
                        between the hills?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head. &quot;Memphis is the lure of all Egypt, and he who
                        hath been transplanted to her would flout the favor of the gods, did he make
                        homesick moan for his native city.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;And thou hast warmer regard for the stir of Mem- phis than the
                        quiet of the north?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is no quiet in the north now.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;So?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-211" n="203"/>
                    <p>&quot;Nay; hast thou not heard of the Israelitish unrest?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Aye, I had heard—but—but hath it become of any
                        import?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is the peril of Egypt that she does not realize her menace in
                        these Hebrews,&quot; the lady answered. &quot;The north knows it,
                        but it has sprung into life so re- cently, and from such miserable soil,
                        that even my father, who has been away from the Deka but a few months, does
                        not appreciate the magnitude of the dis- affection.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast lived among them, Lady Masanath. What thinkest thou of
                        these people?&quot; Kenkenes asked after a little silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of the mass I can not speak confidently,&quot; she an- swered
                        modestly. &quot;They are proud—they pass the Egyptian in pride; they
                        have kept their blood singular- ly pure for such long residence among us;
                        they are stubborn, querulous and unready. But above all they are a contented
                        race if but the oppression were lifted from their shoulders. They are an
                        untilled soil—none knows what they might produce, but the confidence of
                        their leader, who is a wondrous man, bespeaks them a capable people. To my
                        mind they are mistreated beyond their deserts. I would have the powers of
                        Egypt use them better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it known in the north what Mesu&apos;s purpose is? The
                        Israelites among us talk of their own kingdom, and I wonder if the Hebrew
                        means to set up a nation within us, or assail the throne of the Pharaohs, or
                        go forth and settle in another country.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The lady shrugged her shoulders. &quot;The Hebrews talk in similitudes.
                        The prospect of freedom so uplifts them that they chant their purposes to
                        you, and bewil- <pb id="VAA3882-212" n="204"/> der you with quaint words and
                        hidden meanings. But these three facts, my Lord, are apparent and most po-
                        tent in results when combined; they are oppressed be- yond endurance; they
                        are many; they are captained by a mystic. They have but to choose to rebel,
                        and it would tax the martial strength of Egypt to quiet them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The magisterial dignity of the little lady was most delightful. The young
                        sculptor&apos;s sensations were di- vided between interest in the grave
                        subject she dis- cussed and pleasure in her manner. Happening to glance in
                        the direction of the scribe, he found the gray eye of his friend fixed upon
                        him from the group of beauties. Presently Hotep rambled back with an eb- ony
                        stool and sat a little aloof in thoughtful silence until the visit was
                        over.</p>
                    <p>When Kenkenes alighted at the door of his father&apos;s house some time
                        later, Hotep leaned over the wheel of the chariot and put his hand on the
                        sculptor&apos;s shoul- der.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou hast met Har-hat and, by his own words, thou hast had some
                        unpleasant commerce with him. What he did to thee I know not, but I shall
                        let thee into mine own quarrel with him. He lays the curb of silence on my
                        lips and enforces the indifference in my mien. If I revolt the penalty is
                        humiliation and disas- ter for Masanath and for me. I love her, but I dare
                        not let her dream it. The fan-bearer hath greater things in store for her
                        than a scribe can promise. I am thy brother in hatred of him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The next dawn, even before sunrise, Hotep found Kenkenes once again in the
                        temple before the shrine of <pb id="VAA3882-213" n="205"/> Athor. But this
                        time the scribe knelt silently beside his friend.</p>
                    <p>When they emerged into the sunless solemnity of the grove he turned to
                        Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p> &quot;With the licensed forwardness of an old friend, I would ask what
                        thou hast to crave of the lovers&apos; god- dess, O thou
                        loveless?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Favor and pardon,&quot; Kenkenes answered.</p>
                    <p> &quot;So? But already have I reached the limit. Not even a friend may
                        ask an accounting of a man&apos;s mis- deeds.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes smiled. &quot;Ask me,&quot; he said, &quot;and spare me
                        the effort of voluntary confession.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then, what hast thou done?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come and look upon mine offense. Thine eyes will serve thee better
                        than my tongue.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The pair were in costume hardly fitted for the dust of the roadway, but
                        Memphis was not astir. They went across the city toward the river and at the
                        land- ings found an early-rising boatman, who let them his bari.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes took the oars and moved out into the mid- dle of the swiftest
                        current of the Nile. There he headed down-stream and permitted the boat to
                        drift.</p>
                    <p>The clear heavens, blue and pellucid as a sapphire, were still cool, but from
                        the lower slope down the east a radiance began to crawl upward. The peaks of
                        the Libyan desert grew wan.</p>
                    <p>The young men did not resume their talk. The dawn in Egypt was a solemn hour.
                        Kenkenes raised his eyes to the heights of the west. On the shore a group
                        approached the Nile edge, and Hotep guessed by <pb id="VAA3882-214" n="206"
                        /> the cluster of fans and standards that it was the Pha- raoh at his
                        morning devotions to Nilus. The white points on the hilltops reddened and
                        caught fire.</p>
                    <p>Softly and absently Kenkenes began to sing a hymn to the sunrise. Hotep
                        rested his cheek on one hand and listened. More solemn, more appealing the
                        notes grew, fuller and stronger, until the normal power of the rich voice
                        was reached. The liquid echo on the water gave it a mellow embellishment,
                        and Hotep saw the central figure of the group on shore lift his hand for
                        silence among the courtiers.</p>
                    <p>But Kenkenes sang on unconscious even of his near- est auditor. After the
                        nature of humanity he was nearer to his gods in trouble than in
                        tranquillity.</p>
                    <p>The white fronts of Memphis receded slowly, for neither took up the oars.
                        Hotep hesitated to break the silence that fell after the end of the hymn.
                        The shadow on the singer&apos;s face proved that the heart would have
                        flinched at any effort to soothe it. It was the young sculptor&apos;s
                        privilege to speak first.</p>
                    <p>After a long silence, Kenkenes roused himself.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Look&apos;to the course of the bari, Hotep, and chide it with
                        an oar if it means to beach us. I doubt me much if I am fit to control it
                        with the wine of this wind on my brain.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep took up the oars and rowed strongly. &quot;Thine offense does not
                        sit heavily on thy conscience,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p> &quot;I have made my peace with Athor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hath she given thee her word?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, no need., For I did not offend her. Rather hath she abetted
                        me—urged me in my trespass. She persuaded me to become vagrant with her, and
                        I fol- <pb id="VAA3882-215" n="207"/> lowed the divine runaway into the
                        desert. I doubt not I was chosen because I was as lawless as her needs
                        required. Athor is beautiful and would prove herself so to her devotees. And
                        to me was the lovely labor ap- pointed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep looked at him mystified.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By the gods,&quot; he said at last, &quot;thou hadst better
                        get in out of this wind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes laughed genuinely. &quot;My babble will take meaning ere long.
                        If thou questionest me, I must an- swer, but I am determined not to betray
                        my secret yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go we to On?&quot; Hotep asked plaintively, after a long
                        interval of industry for him and dream for Ken- kenes. The young sculptor
                        sat up and looked at the opposite shore. &quot;Nay,&quot; he cried,
                        &quot;we are long past the place where we should have landed. Yonder is
                        the Marsh of the Discontented Soul. Let me row back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned and pulled rapidly toward the eastern shore. Away to the south,
                        behind them, were the quar- ries of Masaarah. But they were still a
                        considerable distance above Toora, a second village of quarry-work- ers, now
                        entirely deserted. The pitted face of the mountain behind the town was
                        without life, for, as has been seen, Meneptah was not a building monarch.
                        Di- rectly opposite them the abrupt wall of the Arabian hills pushed down
                        near to the Nile and the intervening space was a flat sandy stretch, ending
                        in a reedy marsh at the water&apos;s edge. The line of cultivation ended
                        far to the south and north of it, though the soil was as ara- ble as any
                        bordering the Nile. A great number of marsh geese and a few stilted waders
                        flew up or plunged into the water with discordant cries and flap- <pb
                            id="VAA3882-216" n="208"/> ping of wings as the presence of the young
                        men dis- turbed the solitude. The sedge was wind-mown, and there were
                        numberless prints of bird claws, but no mark of boat-keel or human foot. The
                        place should have been a favorite haunt of fowlers, but it was lone- ly and
                        overshadowed with a sense of absolute deser- tion.</p>
                    <p> &quot;But,&quot; Hotep began suddenly, &quot;thou hast spoken of
                        offense and pardon, and now thou boastest that Athor abetted
                        thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why is this called the Marsh of the Discontented
                        Soul?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The scribe smiled patiently. &quot;Of a truth, dost thou not
                        know?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As the immortals hear me, I do not. I have never asked and the
                        chronicles do not speak of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay; the story is four hundred years old, and the chroniclers do
                        not tell it because it is out of the scope of history, I doubt not. But it
                        has become tradition throughout Egypt to shun the spot, though few know why
                        they must. A curse is laid upon the place. An unfaithful wife whom the
                        priests denied repose with her ancestors is entombed yonder.&quot; He
                        pointed to- ward an angle between an outstanding buttress and the limestone
                        wall. &quot;Her soul haunts him who comes here with the plea that her
                        mummy be removed to On, where she dwelt in life, and laid with the respected
                        dead, in the necropolis.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I trust the un- happy soul will
                        not trouble us. We came here by way of misadventure-not to disturb her. But
                        how capne it they did not entomb her nearer On?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;She betrayed one great man and t6tpted another. <pb
                            id="VAA3882-217" n="209"/> She offended against the lofty. Therefore,
                        her punish- ment was the more heavy-her isolation in death like to
                        banishment in life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So; if she had slighted a paraschite and tempted a beer brewer, her
                        fate would have been less harsh. O, the justness of justice!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The morning was well advanced when they reached the niche on the
                        hillside—Hotep, wondering; Ken- kenes, silent and expectant.</p>
                    <p>The sculptor led the way into the presence of Athor, and stepped aside. The
                        scribe halted and gazed with- out sound or movement—petrified with
                        amazement.</p>
                    <p>Before him, in hue and quiescence was a statue in stone—in all other
                        respects, a human being. The fig- ure was of white magnesium limestone, and
                        stood upon rock yet unhewn.</p>
                    <p>The ritual had been trampled into the dust.</p>
                    <p>The eye of the most unlearned Egyptian could detect the sacrilege at a single
                        glance.</p>
                    <p>It was the image of a girl, draped in an overlong robe, fastened over each
                        shoulder by a fibula, orna- mented with a round medallion. Through the vest-
                        ments, intentionally simple, there was testimony of the exquisite lines of
                        the figure they clothed.</p>
                    <p>The sole observance of hieratic symbol were the horns of Athor set in the
                        hair.</p>
                    <p>The figure was posed as if in the act of a forward movement. The knee was
                        slightly bent in an attitude of supplication. The face was upturned, the
                        eyes lifted, the arms extended to their fullest, forward and upward, the
                        fingers curved as if ready to receive. The hair was separated into-two heavy
                        plaits, which fell below the waist down the back.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-218" n="210"/>
                    <p>One sandaled foot was advanced, slightly; the other hidden by the hem of the
                        robe.</p>
                    <p>Every physical feature visible upon the living form so disposed and draped
                        had been carved upon this grace in stone. Egypt had never fashioned anything
                        so perfect. Indeed, she would not have called it sculp- ture.</p>
                    <p>The glyptic art of Greece had been paralleled hun- dreds of years before it
                        was born.</p>
                    <p>On the face there was the light of overpowering love together with the
                        intangible pride so marked on the representations of profane deities. But
                        the most manifest emotions were the great yearning and en- treaty. They were
                        marked in the attitude of the head thrown back, in the outstretched arms and
                        in the bent knee. That there was more hopeful expectancy than despairing
                        insistence, was proved by the curve of the ready fingers and the uncertain
                        smile on the lips. It was Athor, eternally young, eternally in love,
                        eternally unsatisfied, receiving the setting sun as she had done since the
                        world began. None of the rapturous impa- tience and uncertainty of the
                        moment had been lost since the first sunset after chaos. And yet, with all
                        the pulse and fervor, here was womanhood, immacu- late and ineffable.</p>
                    <p>Never did face so command men to worship.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Holy Amen!&quot; the scribe exclaimed, his voice barely audible
                        in its earnestness. &quot;What consummate loveli- ness! But what—what
                        unspeakable impiety!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou seen Athor? She is before thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Athor! The golden goddess in the image of a mortal! Kenkenes, the
                        wrath of the priests awaits <pb id="VAA3882-219" n="211"/> thee and
                        thereafter the doom of the insulted Pan- theon!&quot; The scribe
                        shuddered and plucked at his friend&apos;s robe as if to drag him away
                        from the sight of his own creation.</p>
                    <p>Firmly fixed were the young artist&apos;s convictions to resist the
                        impelling force of Hotep&apos;s consternation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, nay, Hotep,&quot; he answered soothingly. &quot;The
                        wrath of the gods for an offense thus flagrant is ex- ceedingly slow, if it
                        is to fall. Lo! they have propi- tiated me at great length if they mean to
                        accomplish mine undoing at last. Thus far, and the statue is well- nigh
                        complete, I have met no form of obstacle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Hotep shook his head in profound apprehen- sion. He looked at the statue
                        furtively and murmured:</p>
                    <p>&quot;O Kenkenes, what madness made thee trifle with the
                        gods?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have I not said? The goddess herself lured me. Is she not the
                        embodied essence of Beauty? The rit- ual insults her. Ah, look at the
                        statue, Hotep. How could Athor be wroth with the sculptor who called such a
                        face as that, a likeness of her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It startles me,&quot; the scribe declared. &quot;It is
                        super- naturally human. That is not art, but creation. O apostate, thine
                        offense is of two-fold seriousness. Thou hast stolen the function of the
                        divine Mother and made a living thing!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes laughed with sheer joy at his comrade&apos;s genuine praise. The
                        more dismayed Hotep might be, the more sincere his compliment. But the
                        scribe, plunged into a stupor of concern lest the authorities discover the
                        sacrilege, went on helplessly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What wilt thou do with it when it is done?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-220" n="212"/>
                    <p> &quot;I have left no mark of myself upon it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but the priesthood can scent out a blasphemer as a hound
                        scents a jackal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou wilt not betray me, Hotep; I shall not pub- lish myself, and
                        the other-the only other who pos- sesses my secret-the Israelite, who was my
                        model, is fidelity&apos;s self. I would trust her with my
                        soul.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;An Israelite! Thy nation&apos;s most active foe at this
                        hour!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is no enemy to me, Hotep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Slowly the scribe&apos;s eyes traveled from the face of Athor to the face
                        of Kenkenes. The young sculptor turned away and leaned against the great
                        cube that walled one side of the niche. He was not prepared to meet his
                        friend&apos;s discerning eyes. Hotep surveyed him critically. A
                        momentous surmise forced itself upon him. He went to Kenkenes and, laying an
                        affec- tionate arm across his shoulder, leaned not lightly thereon.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou hast said, O my Kenkenes, that I should un- derstand thy
                        meaning when thou spakest mysteriously a while agone. May I not know, now?
                        Thou didst plead offense to Athor and didst boast her pardon. Later thou
                        calledst her thy confederate. And earliest of all, thou didst confess to
                        asking favor of her. How may all these things be?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look thou,&quot; Kenkenes began at once. &quot;On one hand,
                        I have my new belief concerning sculpture—on the other, the beliefs of my
                        fathers. I practise the first and make propitiation for the second. No harm
                        hath overtaken me. Am I not pardoned? Further- more, Athor is beauty, and
                        beauty guided my hand in creating this statue. Therefore, Athor being
                        beauty, <pb id="VAA3882-221" n="213"/> Athor was my confederate. Is it not
                        lucid, O Son of Wisdom?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep laughed. &quot;Nay, thou wilt not prosper, Ken- kenes. Thou servest
                        two masters. But there is one thing still unexplained—the favor of
                        Athor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is not mine to boast. I have but craved it,&quot; Kenkenes
                        replied hesitatingly.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Where doth she live?&quot; Hotep asked, by way of
                        experiment.</p>
                    <p> &quot;In the quarries below.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was no more doubt in the mind of Hotep. Here was a duty, plain before
                        him, and his dearest friend to counsel. His must be tender wisdom and
                        persuasive authority. Not a drop of the scribe&apos;s blood was
                        democratic. He could not understand love be- tween different ranks of
                        society, and, as a result, doubted if it could exist. Kenkenes must be
                        awakened while it was time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do thou hear me, O my Kenkenes,&quot; he said after some
                        silence. &quot;If I overstep the liberty of a friend, remind me, but
                        remember thou-whatsoever I shall say will be said through love for thee, not
                        to chide thee. No man shapeth his career for himself alqne, nor does death
                        end his deeds. He continues to act through his children and his
                        children&apos;s children to the unlimited extent of time. Seest thou
                        not, O Ken- kenes, that the ancestor is terribly responsible? What more
                        heavy punishment could be meted to the original sinner, than to set him in
                        eternal contemplation of the hideous fruitfulness of his initial sin!</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have said sin, because sin, only, is offense in the eyes of the
                        gods. But sin and error are one in the unpardoning eye of nature. Thus, if
                        thou dost err, <pb id="VAA3882-222" n="214"/> though in all innocence,
                        though the gods absolve thee, thou wilt reap the bitter harvest of thy
                        misguided sowing, one day—thou or thy children after thee. The doom is
                        spoken, and however tardy, must fall—and the offense is never expiated.
                        There is nothing more relentless than consequence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If thou weddest unwisely thou dost double thy children&apos;s
                        portion of difficulty, since thou art unwise and their mother unfit. If,
                        perchance, thy only error lay in thy choice of wife, the result is still the
                        same. Let her be most worthy, and yet she may be most un- fitting. She must
                        fit thy needs as the joint fits the socket. Virtue is essential, but it is
                        not sufficient. Beauty is good—I should say needful, but certainly it is not
                        all. Love is indispensable and yet not enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should say that these three things are enough,&quot; put in
                        Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They would gain entrance into the place of the blest—the bosom of
                        Osiris—but they are not sufficient for the over-nice nobility of
                        Egypt,&quot; the scribe averred promptly. &quot;Thou must live in
                        the world and the world would pass judgment on thy wife. If thou art a true
                        husband, thou wouldst defend her, and be wroth. Yet, canst thou be happy
                        being wroth and at odds with the world?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes slipped from under the affectionate arm and busied himself with the
                        statue, marking with a sliver of limestone where his chisel must smooth way
                        a flaw. But the voice of the scribe went on steadily. &quot;The nobility
                        of Egypt will not accept an unbeliever and an Israelite. That monarch who
                        favored the son <pb id="VAA3882-223" n="215"/> of Abraham, Joseph, is dead.
                        The tolerant spirit died with-him. Another sentiment hath grown up and the
                        loveliest Hebrew could not overthrow it. Henceforward, there is eternal
                        enmity between Egypt and Israel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The sliver of stone dropped from the fingers of the artist and his eyes
                        wandered away, dreamy with thought. He remembered the story of the wrong of
                        Rachel&apos;s house, and it came home to him with over- whelming force
                        that the feud between Egypt and Israel was the barrier between him and his
                        love. He was punished for a crime his country had committed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; he exclaimed to himself. &quot;Am I not surely
                        suffering for the sins of my fathers? How cruelly sound thy reasoning is, O
                        thou placid Hotep!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The scribe saw that as the sculptor stood, the plead- ing hands of Athor all
                        but touched his shoulders. Hotep went to him and turned him away from the
                        statue. He knew he could not win his friend with the beauty of that waiting
                        face appealing to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thus far thou hast borne with me, Kenkenes—and having grown bold
                        thereby, I would go further. Re- turn with me to Memphis and come hither no
                        more. She will soon be comforted, if she is not already be- trothed. Egypt
                        needs thee—the Hathors have be- spoken good fortune for thee—and thou art
                        justified in aspiring to nothing less than the hand of a prin- cess. Come
                        back to Memphis and let her heal thee with her congruous love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, my Hotep, what a waste of words! I will go back to Memphis
                        with thee, not for thy reasoning, but for mine own—nay, hers.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-224" n="216"/>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou—did the Israelite—&quot; the scribe began in
                        amazement, and paused, ashamed of his unbecoming curiosity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye; and let us speak of it no more. Thou hast my story, my
                        confidence and my love. Keep the first and the rest shall be thine for
                        ever.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;And this?&quot; questioned Hotep, nodding toward the statue,
                        though he resolutely kept the face of Kenkenes turned from it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let it be,&quot; Kenkenes replied. Hotep hesitated,
                        dissatisfied, but feared to insist on its destruction, so he went arm in arm
                        with his friend down to the river, without a word of protest. &quot;I
                        will at him again when he is better,&quot; he told himself,
                        &quot;and we will bury the exquisite sacrilege.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was an animated group of Hebrew children at the Nile drawing water, and
                        among them was a golden-haired maiden. Hotep had but to glance at her to
                        know that he looked on the glorious model of the pale divinity on the hill
                        above. At the sound of their approach through the grain, she looked up. As
                        she caught sight of Kenkenes, she started and flushed quickly and as quickly
                        the color fled.</p>
                    <p>Since she was near the boat, Kenkenes stood close beside her for a moment
                        while he pushed the bari into the water.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gods! What a noble pair!&quot; Hotep ejaculated un- der his
                        breath. But he saw Kenkenes bend near the Israelite, as if to make his final
                        plea; a spasm of an- guish contracted her white face, and she turned her
                        head away. The incident, so eloquent to Rachel and Kenkenes, had been so
                        swift and subtile in its enact- <pb id="VAA3882-225" n="217"/> ment, that
                        only the quick eye of Hotep detected it. Again he called on the gods in
                        exclamation:.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is saner than he!&quot;</p>
                    <p>On the way back to Memphis he maintained a thoughtful silence. Since he had
                        seen Rachel, he be- gan to understand the love of Kenkenes for her.</p>

                        <hi rend="sc">THE SON OF THE MURKET</hi></head>
                    <p>March and April had passed and now it was the first of May. Five days before,
                        the ceremony of in- stallation had been held for the murket and the cup-
                        bearer and for four days thereafter the new officers passed through
                        initiatory formalities. But on the fifth day the rites of investiture had
                        been brought to an end, and Mentu and Nechutes entered on the routine of
                        service.</p>
                    <p>To Mentu fell the dignified congratulations of his own world of sedate old
                        nobles and stately women. But Nechutes was younger and well beloved by
                        youth- ful Memphis, so on the night of the fifth day, the house of Senci was
                        aglow and in her banquet-room there was much young revel in his honor.</p>
                    <p>Aromatic torches flaring in sconces lighted the friezes of lotus, the painted
                        paneling on the walls, and the clustered pillars that upheld the ceiling of
                        the chamber. The tables had been removed;. the musi- cians and tumblers
                        common to such occasions were not present, for the rout was small and
                        sufficient unto itself for entertainment.</p>
                    <p>Gathered about a central figure, which must needs be the one of highest
                        rank-and in this instance it was the crown prince-were the young guests.
                        They were <pb id="VAA3882-227" n="219"/> noblemen and gentlewomen of
                        Memphis, freed for an evening from the restraint of pretentious affairs and
                        spared the awesome repression of potentates and mon- itors.</p>
                    <p>Hotep was host and these were his guests.</p>
                    <p>First, there was Rameses, languid, cynical, sumptu- ous, and enthroned in a
                        capacious fauteuil, significantly upholstered in purple and gold.</p>
                    <p>Close beside him and similarly enthroned was Ta- user. She wore a double robe
                        of transparent linen, very fine and clinging in its texture. The over-dress
                        was simply a white gauze, striped with narrow lines of green and gold. From
                        the fillet of royalty about her forehead, an emerald depended between her
                        eyes. Her zone was a broad braid of golden cords, girdling her beneath the
                        breast, encompassing her again about the hips, and fastened at last in front
                        by a diamond-shaped buckle of clustered emeralds. Her sandals were mere
                        jeweled straps of white gazelle-hide, passing under the heel and ball of the
                        foot. She was as dar- ingly dressed as a lissome dancing-girl.</p>
                    <p>On a taboret at her right was Seti, the little prince. Although he was nearly
                        sixteen he looked to be of even tenderer years. In him, the charms of the
                        Egyptian countenance had been so emphasized, and its defects so reduced,
                        that his boyish beauty was unequaled among his countrymen.</p>
                    <p> At his feet was Io, playing at dice with Ta-meri and Nechutes. Ta-meri was
                        more than usually bril- liant, and Nechutes, flushed with her favor, was
                        playing splendidly and rejoicing beyond reason over his gains.</p>
                    <p>Opposite this group was another, the center of which was Masanath. She sat in
                        the richest seat <pb id="VAA3882-228" n="220"/> the house of Senci, It was
                        ivory tricked with gold; but small and young as the fan-bearer&apos;s
                        daughter was, there was none in that assembly who might queen it as royally
                        as she from its imperial depths. By her side was the boon companion of
                        Rameses. He was Menes, surnamed &quot;the Bland,&quot; captain of
                        the royal guard, a most amiable soldier and chiefly remarkable because, of
                        all the prince&apos;s world, he was the only one that could tell the
                        truth to Rameses and tell it without offense.</p>
                    <p>On the floor between Masanath and Menes was the son of Amon-meses, the Prince
                        Siptah. He was a typical Oriental, bronze in hue, lean of frame, brilliant
                        of eye, white of teeth, intense in temperament and fierce in&apos; his
                        loves and hates. Religion comforted him through his appetites; in his sight
                        craft was a virtue, intrigue was politics, and love was a fury. His eyes
                        never left Ta-user for long, and his every word seemed to be inspired by
                        some overweening emotion.</p>
                    <p>Aside from these there were others in the group. Some were sons and daughters
                        of royalty, cousins of the Pharaoh&apos;s sons and of Ta-user and
                        Siptah; many were children of the king&apos;s ministers, and all were
                        noble.</p>
                    <p>Senci and Hotep&apos;s older sister, the Lady Bettis, a dark-eyed matron
                        of thirty, presided in duenna-like guardianship over the rout. They sat in a
                        diphros apart from the young revelers.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes was momently expected. For the past two months he had been seen
                        every evening wherever there was high-class revel in Memphis. But he had
                        laughed perfunctorily and lapsed into preoccupation <pb id="VAA3882-229"
                            n="221"/> when none spoke to him, and his song had a sorry note in it,
                        however happy the theme. But these were things apparent only to those that
                        saw deeper than the sur- face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is Kenkenes?&quot; Menes demanded. &quot;Hath he
                        forsworn us?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw him to-day,&quot; Nechutes ventured, without raising his
                        eyes from the game, &quot;when we were fowl- ing on the Nile below the
                        city. He was alone, pulling down-stream, just this side of
                        Masaarah.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep frowned and gave over any hope that Ken- kenes would join the
                        merrymaking that night. But at that moment, Ta-meri, who sat facing the
                        entrance to the chamber, poised the dice-box in air and drew in a long
                        breath. The guests followed her eyes.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes stood in the doorway, the curtain thrust aside and above him. His
                        voluminous festal robes were deeply edged with gold, but his arms, bare to
                        the shoulder, and his strong brown neck were without their usual trappings
                        of jewels. The omission seemed intentional, as if the young man had meant to
                        contrast the ornament ,of young strength and grace with the glitter and
                        magnificence of the other guests. He had succeeded well.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps. to most of those present, the young man&apos;s presence was not
                        unusual, but Hotep was not blind to a manifest alteration in his manner.
                        There was cyni- cism in the corners of his mouth, and a hint of hurt or
                        temper was evident in the tension of his nostril and the brilliance of his
                        eyes. Hotep had no need of seers and astrologers, for his perception served
                        him in all tangible things. He knew something untoward had <pb
                            id="VAA3882-230" n="222"/> set Kenkenes to thinking about himself, and
                        guessing where the young artist had gone that evening, he sur- mised further
                        how he had been received.</p>
                    <p>And though he was sorry in his heart for his friend&apos;s unhappiness,
                        he confessed his admiration for Rachel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Late,&quot; cried Hotep, rising.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy pardon, Hotep,&quot; Kenkenes replied, advancing into the
                        chamber. &quot;I had an errand of much impor- tance to Masaarah and it
                        was fruitless. It shall trouble me no more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep lifted his brows, as though he exclaimed to himself, and made no
                        answer. Kenkenes greeted the guests with a wave of his hand and did
                        obeisance be- fore Rameses.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou speakest of Masaarah, my Kenkenes,&quot; the crown prince
                        commented after the salutation, &quot;and it suggests an inquiry I would
                        make of thee. Dost thou go on as sculptor, or wilt thou follow thy father
                        into the art of building?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Since the Pharaoh chose for my father, he shall choose for me
                        also.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, the Pharaoh did not choose,&quot; Rameses ob- jected
                        dryly. &quot;It was I.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth? Then thou shalt choose for me, O my generous
                        Prince.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Follow thy father. I would have thee for my murket. Nay, it is ever
                        so. I mold the Pharaoh and he gets the credit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And thou, the blame, when blame accrues from the molding,&quot;
                        Menes put in very distinctly, though under his breath.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But be thou of cheer, O Son of the Sun,&quot; Ken- <pb
                            id="VAA3882-231" n="223"/> kenes added. &quot;When thou art Pharaoh,
                        thou canst retaliate upon thine own heir, in the same fashion.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou givest him tardy comfort, O Son of Mentu,&quot; Siptah
                        commented with an unpleasant laugh. &quot;He will lose all recollection
                        of the grudge, waiting so long.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rameses turned his heavy eyes toward the speaker, but Kenkenes halted any
                        remark the prince might have Made.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, let it pass,&quot; he said placidly, dropping into a
                        chair. &quot;All this savors too much of the future and is out of place
                        in the happy improvidence of the present.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Let it all pass?&quot; Ta-user asked. &quot;Nay, I would
                        hold the prince to the promise he made a moment agone, when the choosing of
                        the new murket comes round again.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Do thou so, for me, then, when that time comes,&quot; Kenkenes
                        interrupted.</p>
                    <p>Ta-user laughed very softly and delivered the young artist a level look of
                        understanding from her topaz eyes. &quot;I fear thou art indeed
                        improvident,&quot; she continued, &quot;if thou leavest thy future
                        to others.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then all the world is improvident, since it be- longeth to others
                        to shape every man&apos;s future. But Hotep, the lawgiver, denies this
                        thing. He holds that every man builds for himself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Right, Hotep!&quot; Rameses exclaimed. &quot;It was such
                        belief that made a world-conqueror of my grandsire.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, thy pardon, O my Prince. Hotep&apos;s counsel will not
                        always hold,&quot; Kenkenes objected.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Give me to know wherein it faileth,&quot; the prince
                        demanded.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-232" n="224"/>
                    <p>&quot;Alas! in a thousand things. In truth a man even draws his breath by
                        the leave of others.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;By the puny god, Harpocrates!&quot; the prince cried, scoffing.
                        &quot;That is the weakest avowal I have heard in a moon!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes flushed, and Rameses, recovering from his amusement, pressed his
                        advantage.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me give thee a bit of counsel from mine own store that thou
                        mayest look with braver eyes on life. Take the world by the throat and it
                        will do thy will.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Again I dispute thee, O Rameses.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Name thy witness,&quot; the prince insisted. Kenkenes leaned on
                        his elbow toward him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Canst thou force a woman to love thee?&quot; he asked
                        simply.</p>
                    <p>Ta-user glanced at the prince and the sleepy black eyes of the heir
                        narrowed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let us get back to the issue,&quot; he said. &quot;We spoke
                        of others shaping the future of men. You may not force a woman to love you,
                        but no love or lack of love of a woman should misshape the destiny of any
                        man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is a matter of difference in temperament, my Prince,&quot;
                        Ta-user put in.</p>
                    <p> &quot;It may be, but it is the expression of mine own ideas,&quot;
                        he answered roughly.</p>
                    <p>The lashes of the princess were smitten down im- mediately and
                        Siptah&apos;s canine teeth glittered for a moment, one set upon the
                        other. Kenkenes patted his sandal impatiently and looked another way. His
                        gaze fell on Io. She had lost interest in the game. The color had receded
                        from her cheeks and now and again her lips trembled. Kenkenes looked and saw
                        that Seti&apos;s eyes were adoring Ta-user, who smiled at him. <pb
                            id="VAA3882-233" n="225"/> With a sudden rush of heat through his veins,
                        the young artist turned again to Io, and watched till he caught her eye.
                        With a look he invited her to come to him. She laid down the dice, during
                        the momentary abstraction of her playing-mates, and murmuring that she was
                        tired, came and sat at the feet of her champion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wherefore dost thou retreat, Io?&quot; Ta-user asked.
                        &quot;Art vanquished?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;At one game, aye!&quot; the girl replied vehemently.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes laid his hand on her head and said to her very softly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;If only our pride were spared, sweet Io, defeat were not so
                        hard.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The girl lifted her face to him with some question- ing in her eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Knowest thou aught of this game, in truth?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>He smiled and evaded. &quot;I have not been fairly taught.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ta-meri gathered up the stakes and Nechutes, col- lecting the dice, went to
                        find her a seat. But while he was gone, she wandered over to Kenkenes and
                        leaned on the back of his chair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me give thee a truth that seemeth to deny itself in the
                        expression,&quot; Io said, turning so that she faced the young
                        artist.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say on,&quot; he replied, bending over her.</p>
                    <p> &quot;The more indifferent the teacher in this game of love, the sooner
                        you learn,&quot; said Io. Kenkenes took the tiny hand extended toward
                        him in emphasis and kissed it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sorry truth!&quot; he said tenderly. As he leaned back in his
                        chair he became conscious of Ta-meri&apos;s presence <pb
                            id="VAA3882-234" n="226"/> and turned his head toward her. Her face was
                        so near to him that he felt the glow from her warm cheek. His gaze met hers
                        and, for a moment, dwelt.</p>
                    <p>All the attraction of her gorgeous habiliments, her warm assurance and her
                        inceptive tenderness detached themselves from the general fusion and became
                        dis- tinct. Her beauty, her fervor, her audacity, were not unusually
                        pronounced on this occasion, but the spell for Kenkenes was broken and the
                        inner workings were open to him. Different indeed was the picture that rose
                        before his mind—a picture of a fair face, won- drously and spiritually
                        beautiful; of the quick blush and sweet dignity and unapproachable
                        womanhood. His eyes fell and for a moment his lids were unsteady, but the
                        color surged back into his cheeks and his lips tightened.</p>
                    <p>He took Io&apos;s hands, which were clasped across his knee, and rising,
                        gave the chair to Ta-meri. He found a taboret for himself, and as he put it
                        down at her feet, he saw Nechutes fling himself into a chair and scowl
                        blackly at the nomarch&apos;s daughter. Kenkenes sighed and interested
                        himself in the babble that went on about him.</p>
                    <p>The first word he distinguished was the name of Har-hat, pronounced in clear
                        tones. Metres, who sat next to Kenkenes, put out his foot and trod on the
                        speaker&apos;s toes. The man was Siptah.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Choke before thou utterest that name again,&quot; the captain
                        said in a whisper, &quot;else thou wilt have Rameses abusing Har-hat
                        before his daughter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What matters it to me, his temper or her hurt?&quot; Siptah
                        snarled.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Churl!&quot; responded Menes, amiably.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-235" n="227"/>
                    <p> &quot;What is amiss between the heir and the fan- bearer?&quot;
                        Kenkenes asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everything! Rameses fairly suffocates in the pres- ence of the new
                        adviser. The Pharaoh is sadly torn between the twain. He worships Rameses
                        and, body of Osiris! how he loves Har-hat! But sometime the council chamber
                        with the trio therein will fall-the walls outward, the roof, up-mark
                        me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again, clear and with offensive emphasis, Siptah&apos;s voice was heard
                        disputing, in the general babble.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Magnify the cowardice of the Rebu if you will, but it was Har-hat
                        who made them afraid,&quot; he was saying.</p>
                    <p>The slow eyes of Rameses turned in the direction of the tacit challenge.
                        Menes&apos; black brows knitted at Siptah, but Kenkenes came to the
                        rescue. A lyre, the inevitable instrument of ancient revels, was near him
                        and he caught it up, sweeping his fingers strongly across the strings.</p>
                    <p>A momentary silence fell, broken at once by the ap- plause of the
                        peace-loving, who cried, &quot;Sing for us, Kenkenes!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shook his head, smiling. &quot;I did but test the har- mony of the
                        strings; harmony is grateful to mine ear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Menes&apos; lips twitched. &quot;If harmony is here,&quot; he
                        said with meaning, &quot;you will find it in the
                        instrument.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again, a voice from the general conversation broke in-this time from
                        Rameses.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Kenkenes hath outlasted an army of other singers. I knew him as
                        such when mine uncles yet lived and my father was many moves from the
                        throne. It-was while we dwelt unroyally here in Memphis. They made thee sing
                        in the temple, Kenkenes. Dost thou remember?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-236" n="228"/>
                    <p>&quot;Aye,&quot; Ta-user took it up. &quot;They made thee sing in
                        the temple and it went sore against thee, Kenkenes. Most of the upper
                        classes in the college here were hoarse or treble by turns, and the priests
                        required thee by force from thy tutors because thou couldst sing. Thou wast
                        a stubborn lad, as pretty as a mimosa and as surly as a caged lion. I can
                        see thee now chanting, with a voice like a lark, and frowning like a very
                        demon from Amenti!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The princess laughed musically at her own narra- tion and received the
                        applause of the others with a serene countenance. She had repaid Kenkenes
                        for his implied championship of her cause earlier in the even- ing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Art still as reluctant, Kenkenes?&quot; the Lady Senci called
                        to him.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes looked at the lyre and did not answer at once. There was no song in
                        his heart and a moody silence seemed more like to possess his lips. His
                        audi- ience, too, was not in the temper for song. He took in the expression
                        of the guests with a single compre- hensive glance. Siptah&apos;s hands
                        were clenched and his face was blackened with a frown. Ta-user&apos;s
                        silken brows were lifted, and even the pallid countenance of the prince was
                        set and his eyes were fixed on nothing. Seti was entangled by the
                        princess&apos; witchery and he saw no one else. Io, blanched and
                        miserable, forgot- ten by Seti, forgot all others. In his heart Kenkenes
                        knew that Nechutes was unhappy and Hotep and Masanath; and even if there
                        were those in the banquet- room who had no overweening sorrow, the evident
                        discontent of the troubled oppressed them.</p>
                    <p>Far from finding inspiration for song in the faces <pb id="VAA3882-237"
                            n="229"/> of the guests, Kenkenes felt an impulse to rush out of the
                        atmosphere of unrest and unhappiness into the solitary night, where no
                        intrusion of another&apos;s sorrow could dispute the great triumph of
                        his own grief. The bitter soul in him longed to laugh at the idea of sing-
                        ing.</p>
                    <p>The hesitation between Senci&apos;s invitation and his answer was not
                        noticeable. He put the instrument out of his reach, tossing it on a cushion
                        a little distance away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so reluctant,&quot; he said, turning his face toward the
                        lady, &quot;as unready. I have exhausted my trove of songs for this
                        self-same company,—wherefore they will not listen to reiteration, which is
                        ever insipid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Senci wisely accepted his excuse, and pressed him no further. One or two of
                        the more observant mem- bers of the company looked at him, with comprehen-
                        sion in their eyes. Seldom, indeed, had Kenkenes re- fused to sing, and his
                        reluctance corroborated their suspicions that all was not well with the
                        young artist.</p>
                    <p>The irrepressible Menes observed to lo in one of his characteristic
                        undertones, but so that all the com- pany heard it: &quot;What makes us
                        surly to-night? Look at Kenkenes; I think he is in love! What aileth thee,
                        sweet Io? Hast lost much to that gambling pair— Ta-meri and Nechutes? And
                        behold thy fellows! What a sulky lot! I am the most cheerful spirit among
                        us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Boast not,&quot; she responded; &quot;it is not a virtue in
                        you. You would be blithe in Amenti, for one can not get mournful music out
                        of a timbrel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The soldier&apos;s eyes opened, and he caught at her, but she eluded him
                        and growled prettily under her breath.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-238" n="230"/>
                    <p>&quot;Come, Bast,&quot; he cried, making after her. &quot;Kit,
                        kit, kit!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She sprang away with a little shriek and Kenkenes, throwing out his arm,
                        caught her and drew her close.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Menes is malevolent—&quot; he began.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Aye, malevolent as Mesu!&quot; she panted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What!&quot; the soldier cried. &quot;Has the Hebrew sor-
                        cerer already become a bugbear to the children?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If he become not a bugbear to all Egypt, we may thank the
                        gods,&quot; Siptah put in.</p>
                    <p>Rameses laughed scornfully, but Ta-user and Seti spoke simultaneously:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Siptah speaks truly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yea, Menes,&quot; the heir scoffed; &quot;he hath already
                        become a bugbear to the infants. Hear them confess it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Siptah buried his clenched hand in a cushion on the floor near him.</p>
                    <p> &quot;O thou paternal Prince,&quot; he said, &quot;repeat us a
                        prayer of exorcism as a father should, and rid us of our
                        fears.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And. pursuant of the custom bewailed an hour agone, we shall return
                        thanks to the Pharaoh, for the things thou dost achieve, O our
                        Rameses,&quot; Menes added.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If there are any prayers said,&quot; the prince replied,
                        &quot;the Hebrews will say them. Mine exorcism will be harsher than
                        formulas.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The rest of the company ceased their undertone and listened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wilt thou tell us again what thou hast said, O Prince?&quot;
                        Kenkenes asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mine exorcism of the Hebrew sorcerer, Mesu, will <pb
                            id="VAA3882-239" n="231"/> be harsher than formulas. I shall not beseech
                        the Israelites and-it will avail them naught to beseech me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art ominous, Light of Egypt,&quot; Kenkenes commented
                        quietly. &quot;Wilt thou open thy heart fur- ther and give us thy
                        meaning?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast lived out of the world, O Son of Mentu? The exorcism will
                        begin ere long. In this I give thee the history of Israel for the next few
                        years and close it. I shall not fall heir to the Hebrews when I come to wear
                        the crown of Egypt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are they to be sent forth?&quot; Kenkenes asked in a low
                        tone.</p>
                    <p>Rameses laughed shortly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art not versed in the innuendoes of court- talk, my Kenkenes.
                        Nay, they die in Egypt and fer- tilize the soil.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It will raise a Set-given uproar, Rameses,&quot; Menes broke in
                        with meek conviction; &quot;and as thou hast said —to the king, the
                        credit—to his advisers, the blame.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay; the process is longer and more natural,&quot; the prince
                        replied carelessly. &quot;It is but the same method of the mines. Who
                        can call death by hard labor, mur- der?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The full brutality of the prince&apos;s meaning struck home. Kenkenes
                        gripped the arm of Ta-meri&apos;s chair with such power that the sinews
                        stood up rigid and white above the back of the brown hand. Luckily, all of
                        the guests were contemplating Rameses with more or less horror. They did not
                        see the color recede from the young artist&apos;s face or his eyes
                        ignite dangerously.</p>
                    <p>Masanath sat up very straight and leveled a pair of eyes shining with
                        accusation at the prince.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth, was thine the fiat?&quot; she demanded.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-240" n="232"/>
                    <p>&quot;Even so, thou lovely magistrate,&quot; he answered with an
                        amused smile. &quot;Was it not a masterful one?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep delivered her a warning glance, but she did not heed it. Austere Ma,
                        the Defender of Truth, could have been as easily crushed.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Masterful!&quot; she cried. &quot;Nay! Menes, lend me thy
                        word. Of all Set-given, pitiless, atrocious edicts, that is the cruelest!
                        Shame on thee!&quot;</p>
                    <p>At her first words, Rameses raised himself from his attitude of languor into
                        an upright and intensely alert position. The company ceased to breathe, but
                        Ken- kenes heaved a soundless sigh of relief. Masanath had uttered his
                        denunciations for him.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the prince&apos;s eyes began to sparkle, a rich stain grew in
                        his cheeks and when she made an end he was the picture of animated delight.
                        For the first time in his life he had been defied and condemned. But his
                        gaze did not disturb Masanath. Her eyes dared him to resent her censure. The
                        prince had no such purpose in mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O by Besa! here is what I have sought for so long,&quot; he
                        exclaimed, at last. &quot;Hither! thou treasure, thou dear, defiant
                        little shrew! Thou art more to me than all the wealth of Pithom. Hither, I
                        tell thee!&quot;</p>
                    <p>But she did not move. The company was breathing with considerable relief by
                        this time, but not a few of them were casting furtive glances at
                        Ta-user.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hither!&quot; Rameses commanded, stamping his foot.
                        &quot;Nay, I had forgot she defies my power. Behold, then, I come to
                        thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath anticipated his intent, and rising with much dignity, she put the
                        ivory throne between her and the prince. Cool and self-possessed she
                        gathered <pb id="VAA3882-241" n="233"/> up her lotuses, as fresh after an
                        evening in her hand as they were when the slaves gathered them from the
                        Nile; found her fan and made other serene prepara- tions to depart. Rameses,
                        fended from her by the chair, stood before her and watched with a smile in
                        his eyes.</p>
                    <p>Presently he waved his hand to the other guests.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Arise; the princess is going,&quot; he commanded.</p>
                    <p>In the stir and rustle, laughter and talk of the guests, getting up at the
                        prince&apos;s sign—or it was cus- tomary to permit the highest of rank
                        to dismiss a com- pany—Masanath slipped from among them and at- tempted to
                        leave unnoticed. But Rameses was before her and had taken possession of her
                        hand before she could elude him. As Kenkenes passed them on his way to the
                        door her soft shoulders were squared; she had drawn herself as far away from
                        the prince as she might and was otherwise evincing her discomfort ex-
                        travagantly.</p>
                    <p>Before them was Hotep, outwardly undisturbed, smiling and complacent. At one
                        side was Ta-user, at the other Seti, and Io hung on Hotep&apos;s
                        arm.</p>
                    <p>The young artist walked past them hurriedly, moved to leave all the ferment
                        and agitation behind him. If he had thought to forget his sorrows among the
                        light- hearted revel of those that did not sorrow, he misdi- rected his
                        search.</p>
                    <p>At the doors the Lady Senci met him and drew him over to the diphros, now
                        vacated by Bettis.</p>
                    <p>And there she took his face between her hands and kissed him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hail! thou son of the murket!&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Having much, I am given more,&quot; he responded.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-242" n="234"/>
                    <p>&quot;Behold the prodigality of good fortune. The Ha- thors exalt me in
                        the world and add thereto a kiss from the Lady Senci.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was impelled truly,&quot; she confessed, &quot;but by
                        thine own face as well as by the Hathors. Kenkenes, if I did not know thee,
                        I should say thou wast pretending —thou, to whom pretense is
                        impossible.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He did not answer, for there was no desire in his heart to tell his secret;
                        his experience with Hotep had warned him. Yet the unusual winsomeness of his
                        father&apos;s noble love was hard to resist.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy manner this evening betrays thee as striving to hide one spirit
                        and show another,&quot; she continued, seeing he made no response.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast said,&quot; he admitted at last; &quot;and I have
                        not succeeded. That is a sorry incapacity, for the world has small patience
                        with a man who can not make his face lie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bitter! Thou!&quot; she chid.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have I not spoken truly?&quot; he persisted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, but why rebel? No man but hides a secret sorrow, and this
                        would be a tearful world did every one weep when he felt like
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I am most overwhelmingly constrained to weep, so I shall stay
                        out of the world and vex it not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him with startled eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Art thou so troubled, then?&quot; she asked in a low- ered
                        tone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Doubly troubled—and hopelessly,&quot; he replied, his eyes away
                        from her.</p>
                    <p>She came nearer and, putting up her hands, laid them on his shoulders.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are so young, Kenkenes-so young, and youth <pb id="VAA3882-243"
                            n="235"/> is like to make much of the little first sorrows. Fur-
                        thermore, these are troublous days. Saw you not the temper of the assembly
                        to-night? Egypt is a-quiver with irritation, Every little ripple in the
                        smooth cur- rent of life seems magnified—each man seeketh provo- cation to
                        vent his causeless exasperation. And when such ferment worketh in the
                        gathering of the young, it is portentous. It bodeth evil! You are but caught
                        in the fever, my Kenkenes, and your little vexations are inflamed until they
                        hurt, of a truth. Get to your rest, and to-morrow her smile will be more
                        propitious.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes looked at the uplifted face and noted the laugh in the eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a tattling face is mine,&quot; he said. &quot;Is her
                        name written there also?&quot; He drew his fingers across his
                        forehead.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No need; I have been young and many are the young that have wooed
                        and wed beneath mine eyes. I know the signs.&quot; She nodded sagely and
                        continued after a little pause:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall not pry further into your sorrow, Ken- kenes; but you are
                        good and handsome, and winsome, and wealthy, and young, and it is a stony
                        heart that could hold out long against you. I would wager my mummy that the
                        maiden is this instant well-nigh ready to cast herself at your feet, save
                        that your very excel- lence deters her. Go, now, and let your dreams be
                        sweeter than these last waking hours have been.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again she kissed him and let him go.</p>
                    <p>In the corridor without, he received his mantle and kerchief from a servant
                        and continued toward the. outer portals. But before he reached them, Ta-meri
                        stepped out of a cross-corridor and halted. Never be- <pb id="VAA3882-244"
                            n="236"/> fore did her eyes so shine or her smile so flash within the
                        cloud of gauzes that mantled and covered her. Kenkenes wondered for a moment
                        if he must explain the change in his countenance to her also. But the beauty
                        had herself in mind at that moment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kenkenes, thou hast given me no opportunity to wish thee well, as
                        the son of the murket.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, but in this nook thy good wishes will be none the less sincere
                        nor my delight any less apparent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Most heartily I give thee joy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes kissed her hand. &quot;And wilt thou say that to Nechutes and
                        put him in the highest heaven?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Already have I wished him well,&quot; she responded, pretending
                        to pout, &quot;but he repaid me poorly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay! What did he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Begged me to become his wife.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And having given him the span, thou didst yield him the cubit also
                        when he asked it?&quot; he surmised.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, not yet. But—shall I?&quot; she lifted her face and looked
                        at himn, smiling and bewitchingly beautiful. Her eyes dared him; her lips
                        invited him; all her charms rose up and besought him. For a moment, Kenkenes
                        was startled. If he had believed that Ta-meri loved him never so slightly,
                        his sensations would have been most distressing. But he knew and was glad to
                        know that he awakened nothing deeper than a superficial partiaty, which
                        lasted only as long as he was in her sight to please her eye. In spite of
                        his consternation, he could think intelligently enough to surmise what had
                        inspired her words. The Lady Senci had guessed the nature of his trouble;
                        even Menes had hinted a suspicion of the truth in a banter- ing way. What
                        would prevent the beauty from seeing <pb id="VAA3882-245" n="237"/> it also
                        and pre-empting to herself the honors of his disheartenment? But he was in
                        no mood for a co- quettish tilt with her. His sober face was not more
                        serious than his tone when he made answer:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do not play with him, Ta-meri. He is worthy and loves thee most
                        tenderly. Thou lovest him. Be kind to thine own heart and put him to the
                        rack no more. Thou art sure of him and I doubt not it pleases thee to tanta-
                        lize thyself a little while; but Nechutes, who must en- dure the
                        lover&apos;s doubts, is suffering cruelly. Thou art a good child,
                        Ta-meri; how canst thou hurt him so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He paused, for her eyes, growing remorseful, had wandered away from him. He
                        knew he had reasoned well. The guests in the banquet-room began to emerge,
                        talking and laughing. The voice of Nechutes was not heard among them.
                        Kenkenes glanced toward the group and saw the cup-bearer a trifle in
                        advance, his sullen face averted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He comes yonder,&quot; Kenkenes added in a whisper,
                        &quot;poor, moody boy! Go back to him and take him all the happiness I
                        would to the gods I knew. Farewell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He pressed her hand and continued toward the door.</p>
                    <p>Once again he was hailed, this time by Rameses. He halted, stifling a groan,
                        and returned to the prince. Nechutes and Ta-meri had disappeared.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One other thing, I would tell thee, Kenkenes,&quot; the prince
                        said, &quot;and then thou mayest go. The Pharaoh heard a song to the
                        sunrise on the Nile some time ago and I identified the voice for him. He
                        would have thee sing for him, Kenkenes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Pharaoh&apos;s wish is law,&quot; was the slow
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it was not a command,&quot; Rameses replied affa- bly, for
                        he was still holding Masanath&apos;s hand and there- <pb
                            id="VAA3882-246" n="238"/> fore in high good humor with himself.
                        &quot;In truth he said the choice should be thine whether thou wilt or
                        not. He would not insist that a nobleman become his minstrel. But more of
                        this later; the gods go with thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes bowed and escaped.</p>
                    <p>In his room a few moments later, he lighted his lamp of scented oils and
                        contemplated the comforts about him. His conscience pointed a condemning
                        finger at him. Here was luxury to the point of use- lessness for himself;
                        across the Nile was the desolate quarry-camp for his love. In Memphis he had
                        robed himself in fine linen and reveled, had eaten with princes and slept
                        sumptuously—in his strength and his manhood and unearned idleness. And she,
                        but a tender girl, had toiled for the quarry-workers and fasted and now
                        faced death in the hideous extermina- tion purposed for her race.</p>
                    <p>He ground his teeth and prayed for the dawn.</p>
                    <p>He forgot that he had come away from the Arabian hills because she repelled
                        him; he remembered his scruples concerning their social inequality, only to
                        revile himself; Hotep&apos;s caution was more than ever a waste of words
                        to him. He forgot everything ex- cept that he was here in comfort, she,
                        there in want and in peril, and he had not rescued her.</p>
                    <p>He did not sleep. He tossed and counted the hours.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sing for the Pharaoh!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;aye, I will
                        sing till the throat of me cracks—not for the reward of his good will alone,
                        but for Rachel&apos;s liberty. That first, and the unraveling of this
                        puzzle thereafter.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Since the day Kenkenes had wounded her hand with the knife, Rachel had seen
                        him but twice in many weeks.</p>
                    <p>One mid-morning, the oxen were unyoked from the water-cart and led ambling up
                        to the pit where a monolith, too huge to be moved by men alone, had been
                        taken forth and was to be transferred to the Nile. The bearers carried water
                        directly from the river during this time, and it was given Rachel to govern
                        them in the departure from the routine.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly she became aware that some one ap- proached through the grain, and
                        when she raised her head, she looked up into the face of Kenkenes. It was
                        Kenkenes, indeed, but Kenkenes in robes of rustling linen and trappings of
                        gold. Never had she seen so stately an Egyptian, nor any so entitled to the
                        name of nobleman. In quick succession she experienced the moving sensations
                        of surprise, pride in him, and de- pression. The last fell on her with the
                        instant rec- ollection of duty, when his face bent appealingly over hers.
                        Trembling, she turned away from him, and when she looked again, he was
                        returning to Memphis.</p>
                    <p>Now, her days had ceased to be the dreamy lapses <pb id="VAA3882-248" n="240"
                        /> of time in which she lived and walked. The glamour that had made the
                        quarries sufferable had passed; all the realization of her enslavement, with
                        the accom- panying shame, came to her, and her hope for Israel was lost in
                        the destruction of her personal happiness.</p>
                    <p>Still, the longing to look on Kenkenes once again made the dawns more
                        welcome, the days longer and the sunsets more disheartening. Vainly she
                        summoned pride to her aid; vainly she exhorted herself to con- sistency.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How long,&quot; she would say, &quot;since thou didst re-
                        ject the good Atsu because he is an idolater and an Egyptian? How long since
                        thou wast full of wrath against the chosen people who wedded Egyptians and
                        became of them? And now, who is it that is full of sighs and strange
                        conduct? Who is it that hath for- gotten the idols and the abominations and
                        the bondage of her people and mourneth after one of the oppress- ors? And
                        how will it be with thee when the chosen people go forth, or the carving is
                        complete and the Egyptian cometh no more; or how will it be when he taketh
                        one of the long-eyed maidens of his kind to wife?&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the face of all this, her intuition rose up and bore witness that the
                        Egyptian loved her, and was no less unhappy than she.</p>
                    <p>So time came and went and weeks passed and he came not again. Late, one
                        sunset, while there yet was daylight, she left the camp merely that she
                        might wander down the valley to the same spot where, at the same hour, she
                        had met Kenkenes on that last occasion of talk between them.</p>
                    <p>Moving slowly down the shadows, she saw a figure <pb id="VAA3882-249" n="241"
                        /> approaching. The stature of the new-comer identi- fied him. The head was
                        up, the step slow, the bearing expectant. In the one scant lapse between two
                        throbs of her heart, Rachel knew her lover, remembered all the power of his
                        attraction, and realized that her joy and love could carry her beyond her
                        fortitude and resolution.</p>
                    <p>Just ahead of her, not farther than three paces, a long fragment of rock had
                        fallen from above and leaned against the wall. There was an ample space
                        formed by its slant against the cliff and almost before she knew it, she had
                        crept into this crevice. Cower- ing in the dusk, she clutched at her
                        loud-beating heart and listened intently.</p>
                    <p>There was no sound of his steps on the rough road- way of the valley and
                        though she watched eagerly from her hiding-place, she did not see him pass.
                        After a long time she emerged. He was gone.</p>
                    <p>When she looked in the dust she found that his footprints turned not far from
                        her hiding-place and led toward the Nile.</p>
                    <p>She knew then that he had seen her when she had caught sight of him, and
                        failing to meet her as he had expected, had guessed she had hidden from
                        him.</p>
                    <p>This was the sunset of the night of the revel at Senci&apos;s house. It
                        was this incident that had made Kenkenes late at the festivities, and
                        cynical when he came.</p>
                    <p>On her way back to the camp Rachel met Atsu, mounted and attended by a
                        scribe, the taskmaster&apos;s secretary. The two officials were on their
                        way to Memphis to worship in the great temple and to spend a night among
                        free-born men. Once every month, <pb id="VAA3882-250" n="242"/> no oftener,
                        did Atsu return to his own rank in the city. Recognizing Rachel, he drew up
                        his horse; the scribe rode on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast been in search of the Nile wind, Rachel? The valley holds the
                        day-heat like an oven,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I did not go so far: The darkness came too
                        quickly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Endure it a while. I shall move the people into the large valley
                        where they may have the north breeze and the water-smell after sunset, now
                        that the summer is near. I am glad I met thee. Deborah tells me the water
                        for the camp-cooking is turbid, and I doubt not the children draw it from
                        some point below the wharf where the drawing for the quarry-supply stirs up
                        the ooze. Do thou go with the children in the morning when they are sent for
                        the camp supply, and get it above the wharf.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hear,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods attend thee,&quot; he said, riding away,</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be thy visit pleasant,&quot; she responded, and turned again up
                        the valley.</p>
                    <p>The taskmaster was forgotten at her second step, and her contrition and
                        humiliation came back with a rush. There was little sleep for her that
                        night, so heavy was her heart.</p>
                    <p>The next morning Rachel obeyed Atsu and followed the children to the Nile.
                        Crossing the field, absorbed in her trouble, she did not hear the beat of
                        hoofs or the grind of wheels until she was face to face with the attendants
                        of a company of charioteers. The troop of water-carriers had scattered out
                        of the road-way and each little bronzed Israelite was bending with his <pb
                            id="VAA3882-251" n="243"/> right hand upon his left knee in token of
                        profound respect. Rachel hastily joined them.</p>
                    <p>When she looked again the retinue of servants had passed. After them came a
                        gilded chariot with a sumptuous Egyptian within. By the annulets over his
                        temples and the fringed ribbons pendent therefrom; the Israelite knew him to
                        be royal.</p>
                    <p>Behind, a second chariot was driven by a single occupant, who wore the badges
                        of princehood also.</p>
                    <p>The third was a chariot of ebony drawn by two prancing coal-black horses
                        whose leathers and hous- ings shone and jingled. Rachel&apos;s eyes met
                        those of the driver and the life-current froze in her veins. Har- hat,
                        fan-bearer to the Phiaraoh, late governor of Bubas- tis, drew up his horses
                        and calmly surveyed her. The action halted the chariots of a dozen courtiers
                        follow- ing him. One by one they came to a stand-still and each man peered
                        around his predecessor until the fan- bearer became conscious of the pawing
                        horses behind him. He drove out of line and alighted. With an apol- ogetic
                        wave of his hand, he motioned the procession to proceed and busied himself
                        with the harness as if he had found a breakage. Those that had passed were
                        by this time some distance ahead and, missing the grind of wheels in their
                        wake, looked back. The fan-bearer beckoned to one of the attendants who had
                        gone be- fore, and the man returned.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the procession moved on and the nobles glanced first at the
                        fan-bearer, and next, at the Israel- ite. But Athor in the niche on the
                        hillside was not more white and stony than its living model in the valley.
                        There was no retreat. The fan-bearer stood <pb id="VAA3882-252" n="244"/>
                        between her and the Nile, his servant between her and the quarries. She felt
                        the sickening numbness that stupefies one who realizes a terrible strait,
                        from which there is neither succor nor escape.</p>
                    <p>The procession passed and the servant, halting, bowed to his master. He was
                        short and fat, thick of neck and long of arm—a most unusual Egyptian.
                        Har-hat tossed him the reins and, walking around his horses, approached
                        Rachel. The smallest Hebrew— too small to be awed and yet old enough to
                        realize that the beloved Rachel was in danger, dropped the hide he bore, and
                        flinging himself before her, clasped her with his arms, and turned a defiant
                        face at Har-hat over his shoulder. The fan-bearer paused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is the very same,&quot; he said laughingly. &quot;The
                        hard life of the quarries hath not robbed thee in the least of thy radiance.
                        But by the gambling god, Toth, thou didst take a risk! Dost dream what thou
                        didst miss through a malevolent caprice of the Hathors? Five months ago I
                        would have taken thee out of bond- age into luxury but for an industrious
                        taskmaster and the unfortunate interference of a royal message. But the
                        Seven Sisters repent, and I find thee again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel had fixed her eyes upon the white walls of Memphis shining in the
                        morning sun, and did not seem to hear him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, now, slight me not! It was the fault of the taskmaster and not
                        mine. I confess the charm of distant Memphis, but it is more glorious within
                        its walls. I am come to take thee thither. Thank me with but a look, I pray
                        thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Seeing she did not move nor answer, he tilted his head to one side and
                        surveyed her with interest.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-253" n="245"/>
                    <p>&quot;Hath much soft persuasion surfeited thee into deaf- ness?&quot;
                        The color surged up into Rachel&apos;s face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ha!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;not so! Perhaps thou art but
                        reluctant, then.&quot; He whirled upon the other children, cowering
                        behind him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is she wedded?&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <p>Frightened and trembling, they did not answer till he repeated the question
                        and stamped his foot. Then one of them shook his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is well. I need not delay till a slave-husband were disposed of
                        in the mines. Hither, Unas!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The fat servitor came forward.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know this taskmaster not, nor can I coax or press him into giving
                        her up without the cursed formality of a document of gift from the Pharaoh.
                        Get thee back to Memphis with this,&quot; he drew off a signet ring and
                        gave it to the servitor, &quot;and to the palace. There have my scribe
                        draw up a prayer to the Pharaoh, craving for me the mastership over the
                        Israelite, Rachel,—for household service.&quot; The fan-bearer laughed.
                        &quot;Forget not, this latter phrase, else the Pharaoh might fancy I
                        would take her to wife. Haste thee! and bring back Nak and Hebset with thee
                        to row the boat back, and help thee fetch her. She may have a lover who
                        might make trouble for thee alone. Get thee gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took the reins from his servitor&apos;s hands and turned again toward
                        Rachel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I go forth to hunt, and there is danger in that pastime. I may not
                        return. It would be most fitting to bid me a tender farewell, but thou art
                        cruel. Never- theless, I shall care for myself most diligently this day, and
                        return to thee in Memphis by nightfall. Fare- <pb id="VAA3882-254" n="246"/>
                        well!&quot; He sprang into his chariot and, urging his horses, pursued
                        the far-away procession at a gallop.</p>
                    <p>Unas was already at the Nile-side, preparing to return to Memphis. To Rachel
                        it seemed as if she had been set free for a moment, that her efforts to
                        escape and her inevitable capture might amuse her tormentor. And after the
                        manner of the miserable captive so beset, she seized upon the momentary
                        release and sought to fly. The three little Hebrews clung to her—the one
                        that had answered Har-hat weeping bitterly and remorsefully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,. weep not,&quot; she said in a hurried whisper.
                        &quot;It would have ended just the same. Heard ye not what he said
                        concerning a husband? But let me go! Let Rachel hide ere the serving men
                        return!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She undid their arms and ran back toward the quar- ries. For a moment the
                        children hesitated and then they pursued her, crying in an undertone as they
                        ran. Past the stone-pits, up the winding valley she fled until she reached
                        the encampment and her own tent. The women saw her come and old Deborah, who
                        was preparing vegetables for the noonday meal, left the fires and hastened
                        to the shelter. There, Rachel, choking with terror and tears, gave the story
                        of the morning.</p>
                    <p>Deborah made no interruption and after the dis- jointed and unhappy recital
                        was complete, she sat for some moments, motionless and silent. Then she
                        arose and made as if to leave the tent, but Rachel caught at her hand in
                        affright.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, be not so frightened,&quot; the old woman said soothingly.
                        &quot;I go to look for Atsu. He will come in a little
                        while.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-255" n="247"/>
                    <p>With that, she went forth. After a time—more than two hours, in truth, but
                        infinitely longer to Rachel, the voice of the taskmaster was heard without,
                        talking with Deborah. He was permitting no curb to the ex- pression of his
                        rage.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods rend his heart to ribbons!&quot; he panted after a
                        tempest of anathema. &quot;Curse the insatiate brute! Is there not
                        enough of Egypt&apos;s women who are willingly loose that he must
                        destroy the purest spirit on earth? He shall not have her, if I take his
                        life to save her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a moment&apos;s savage rumination, he broke out again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He has us on the hip! We shall be put to it to hide her away from
                        him now. Do thou go to her— nay, I will go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel heard him enter the tent and walk across the matting on the floor. She
                        flung her arm over her face and huddled closer to the linen-covered heap of
                        straw against which she had thrown herself. Even the eyes of the taskmaster
                        were intolerable, in her shame. Atsu plunged into the heart of his subject
                        at once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is no escape in the choosing of the tens, now, Rachel. I have
                        said that I would not vex thee again with my love. Once I offered thee
                        marriage as refuge. My love and the shelter of my name are thine to take or
                        leave. I will urge thee no more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He paused for a space and, as she made no answer, he went on as though she
                        had rejected him explicitly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I shall hide thee somewhere in Egypt. The ruse is not secure,
                        but it may serve.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She sat up and put the hair back from her face.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-256" n="248"/>
                    <p>&quot;Thou good Atsu,&quot; she said in a voice subdued with much
                        weeping. &quot;Wilt thou add more to mine already hopeless indebtedness
                        to thee? Art thou blind to the ill-use thou invitest upon thine own head in
                        thy care. for me? Let me imperil thee no more. Is there no other
                        way?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shook his head. Slowly her face fell, and she sighed for very heaviness of
                        spirit. Atsu stooped and took her hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Make ready and let us leave this place,&quot; he said kindly,
                        &quot;and thou canst decide in the securer precincts of Memphis what
                        thou wilt do. Lose no time,&quot; He turned away and, signing to Deborah
                        to follow him, left the tent.</p>
                    <p>Rachel arose and began her preparations to depart. The formidable blockade in
                        the way to safety seemed to clear and her heart leaped at the anticipation
                        of freedom or stopped at the suggestion of failure. She hastened slowly, for
                        her excitement made most of her movements vain. Her hands trembled and held
                        things insecurely she forgot the place of many of her be- longings, in that
                        humble, orderly house. Alternately praying and fearing, she stopped now and
                        then to be sure that the sounds of the camp were not those of the returning
                        servants. The simple apparel gathered together, she collected the remaining
                        mementoes of her family,—saved with so much pain and guarded with such
                        diligence by old Deborah. These were trinkets of gold and ivory, bits of
                        frail gauzes in which a wondrous perfume lingered, and a scroll of sheep-
                        skin bearing the records of the house. And after all these had been found
                        and gathered together, she fur- <pb id="VAA3882-257" n="249"/> tively put
                        the straw aside and drew forth the collar of golden rings.</p>
                    <p>With the first glint of light on the red metal, the hope and animation in her
                        heart went out. What of Kenkenes? No thought came to her new, but the most
                        unhappy. The obligations which she would have gladly laid on him had fallen
                        to Atsu. She dared not confess to him her love, and she could not give him
                        gratitude. He had entered her life like a bewildering radiance, but it was
                        Atsu who had saved her and emancipated her and would save her again.</p>
                    <p>She thrust the collar into her bosom with a sob and went on mechanically with
                        her preparations. But dur- ing one of her movements the coins clinked
                        musically. She clutched them, and they rang again, softly. They reproached
                        her, and in that irresistible way,—gently. They made a sound even as she
                        breathed. As she walked they chafed. They took weight and crushed her
                        breast. And with every sound from them, she felt Kenkenes&apos; arm
                        about her, her hand lost in his, the warmth of his young cheek against hers.
                        Never so long as his gift were in her possession might she hope to put these
                        memories from her, and she could not cherish them hopefully now. Desperate
                        grief stirred her into action. She went quickly to the door of the tent and
                        there met Deborah.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is not mine,&quot; she said, holding up the neck- lace.
                        &quot;It belongs to the young nobleman who brought me back to camp that
                        night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Leave it with the tribe and it shall be given him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, he may not return to camp. I know where he comes and I can
                        leave it there. It is not far—only a little way.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-258" n="250"/>
                    <p>Deborah stood in her path.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will he be there?&quot; she demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, that I can pledge thee.&quot; She slipped past her
                        guardian, out of the tent and sped up the valley, determined that
                        Deborah&apos;s prohibition, however just, should not stay her.</p>
                    <p>The old Israelite turned to look after her, and her eyes fell on Atsu, his
                        face black with rage, his arms folded, talking with a fat, wildly
                        gesticulating servitor. At that moment the courier caught sight of Rachel
                        flying up the valley and, flinging a document at Atsu&apos;s feet,
                        started to pursue. Atsu halted him with an iron hand, and Deborah paused to
                        see no more. With a prayer she ran up the valley the way Rachel had
                        taken.</p>

                    <p>In the early morning of the next day after the rout at Senci&apos;s,
                        Kenkenes wandered restlessly about the inner court of his father&apos;s
                        house. He had slept but little the preceding night, and now, dizzy and
                        irritable, the freshness of the morning did not invigorate him and the
                        haunting perplexities were with him still.</p>
                    <p>There was no need of haste to the Arabian hills and yet he could not wait
                        patiently in Memphis for an appropriate hour to visit Masaarah. He paced
                        hither and thither, flung himself on the benches in the shade, only to rise
                        and resume his uneasy walk. Anubis was omnipresent and particularly
                        ungovern- able. If his young master were in motion he vibrated and
                        oscillated like a shuttle. If Kenkenes sat, he paced the tessellated
                        pavement slowly and with a foot-fall lighter than a bird&apos;s. The
                        sculptor eyed him under- standingly, and finally arose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, Anubis! Tit, tit, tit!&quot; he called, backing toward
                        the work-room. Anubis bounded after him, but as Kenkenes paused just over
                        the threshold, the ape also halted. His master retreated to the rear of the
                        room still calling, but to the ape there was some- thing portentously
                        familiar in this proceeding. It <pb id="VAA3882-260" n="252"/> hinted of
                        imprisonment. Turning as though pursued, he disappeared up an acacia tree
                        from which he could not be dislodged. With a vexed exclamation, Ken- kenes
                        passed out of the court into the house, slamming the swinging door so
                        sharply that it sprang open again after him. As the old portress put back
                        the outer doors leading into the street, that her young master might go
                        forth, a shadow quick as thought slipped out after him. The old portress
                        clapped her hands with a shrill command but the shadow was gone.</p>
                    <p>Once more in his work-day dress, his wallet of tools and provisions across
                        his shoulder, the young sculptor passed toward the Nile, moody and unhappy
                        but determined. At the river-side he hired the shallow bari that had given
                        him faithful service for so long, and receiving the oars from Sepet, the
                        boatman, pre- pared to push-away. At that moment, Anubis, tremu- lous but
                        unrepentant, bounded in beside him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anubis!&quot; Kenkenes exclaimed. &quot;Of a truth I be-
                        lieve thou art possessed of the arts of magic. Now, if thou art lost in the
                        hills and devoured by a wolf, upon thine own head be it. Pull in that paw,
                        before thou becomest a foolish sacrifice to the sacred crocodile. I wonder
                        thy self-respect does not keep thee from coming when thou art
                        unwelcome.&quot; And sub- siding into silence, the sculptor turned
                        toward Ma- saarah.</p>
                    <p>He made a landing below the stone wharf, for there a two-oared bari was
                        already drawn up, and the tangle of herbage was a safe hiding-place for his
                        own boat. He looked toward the quarry and hesitated. He had no heart yet to
                        face her, who had laid his cruelest sorrow on him. He would continue his
                        work on Athor <pb id="VAA3882-261" n="253"/> until he had gathered assurance
                        from that unforbidding face.</p>
                    <p>His light foot made no sound and he entered the niche silently. Kneeling on
                        the chipped stone at the base of the statue, her face against the drapings,
                        her arms clasping its knees, was Rachel. In one hand was the collar of
                        rings. She had not heard the sculp- tor&apos;s approach.</p>
                    <p>For an instant his surprise transfixed him. Had she repented? A great wave of
                        compassion and ten- derness swept over him and he drew her face away between
                        his palms. With a terrified start, the girl turned a swift glance upward.
                        When she recognized Kenkenes her tearful face colored vividly. Her posture
                        was such that she could not rise, and with in- finite gentleness he lifted
                        her to her feet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it, Rachel? Art thou in trouble?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Joy and maidenly confusion took away her voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Alas,&quot; he went on sadly. &quot;Am I so fallen from thy
                        favor, shut out and denied thy confidence?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, nay,&quot; she protested. &quot;Think not so harshly
                        of me. I am—I came—&quot; she faltered and paused. He did not help or
                        spare her. He had come to learn why she had done this thing, why she had
                        said that, and why she had repulsed him without explanation, when there was
                        unmistakable preference for him in her unstudied acts. He held his peace and
                        waited for her to proceed. Meanwhile Rachel suffered cruelly. She had no
                        thought in her mind concerning her con- duct toward him. It was the shameful
                        event of the morning, which must be told to explain her presence before
                        Athor, that made her cover her crimson face at last. Kenkenes silenced the
                        protests of his gal- <pb id="VAA3882-262" n="254"/> lantry, and drawing her
                        hands away, lifted her face on the tips of his fingers and waited.</p>
                    <p>While they stood thus, Deborah, exhausted and pray- ing, staggered into the
                        inclosure.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rachel!&quot; she panted. &quot;The serving-men—thou art
                        pursued!&quot; The fat courier, purple of countenance and breathing
                        hard, appeared in the opening. Rachel shrank against Kenkenes and Deborah
                        dropped on her knees between the pair and the servitor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Out of the way, hag!&quot; the man puffed. &quot;Let me at
                        yon slave. Out!&quot; He struck at Deborah with a short mace but
                        Kenkenes caught his arm and thrust him aside.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go, go back to the camp,&quot; he said to the old woman.
                        &quot;No harm shall befall Rachel.&quot; Raising her, he put her
                        behind him, and advanced toward the courier.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou words with me?&quot; he said coolly. &quot;What
                        wilt thou?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The girl. Give her up!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but thou art peremptory. What wilt thou with
                        her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;For the harem of the Pharaoh&apos;s chief adviser,&quot;
                        the man retorted.</p>
                    <p>The blood in Kenkenes&apos; veins seemed to become molten; flashes of
                        fierce light blinded him and his sinews hardened into iron. He bounded
                        forward and his fingers buried themselves in soft and heated flesh.</p>
                    <p>The first glimmer of reason through his murderous insanity was the
                        consciousness of a rain of blows upon his head and shoulders, and a
                        blackening face settling back to the earth before him.</p>
                    <p>He released his grip on the throat of the strangling servitor and flung off
                        his other assailants. For a <pb id="VAA3882-263" n="255"/> moment, stunned
                        by the hard usage at the hands of the reinforcing men, he staggered, and
                        seemed about to succumb. The men pursued him to finish their work, but as he
                        eluded them, it seemed that a third person—a woman all in white with
                        extended arms— came into their view.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes saw the foremost, a tall Nubian in a striped tunic, stop in his
                        tracks, and the second, smaller and lighter but a Nubian also, following
                        immediately behind, bumped against his fellow.</p>
                    <p>Mouths agape, eyes staring, they stood and mar- veled. The strange presence,
                        they discovered at once, was neither a human being nor an apparition. It was
                        stone—a statue.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sacrilege!&quot; the first exploded. &quot;A—a—by Amen, it
                        is the slave herself!&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the little pause, Kenkenes recovered himself, but he knew that he gave
                        Rachel to her fate, if the pair overcame him. He caught her hand and with
                        the whispered word, &quot;Run!&quot; fled with her toward the front
                        of the cliff facing the Nile. It was a desperate chance for escape but he
                        seized it.</p>
                    <p>Immediately they were pursued and at the brink of the hill, overtaken. The
                        stake was too large for the young artist to risk its loss by adhering to the
                        un- written rules of combat. He released Rachel, whirled about, and as the
                        foremost descended on him, ducked, seized the man about the middle, and
                        pitched him head-first down into the valley. The second, the tall Nubian
                        that wore the striped tunic, halted, dis- mayed, and Kenkenes, catching
                        Rachel&apos;s hand, pre- pared to descend. But she checked him with a
                        cry. &quot;Look!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-264" n="256"/>
                    <p>His eyes followed her outstretched arm. At regular intervals along the Nile,
                        the distant figures of men were seen posted. Escape was cut off. He mounted
                        to the top of the cliff and led Rachel out of view from the river. The
                        second man retreated, and raged from afar. The sculptor turned up the
                        shingly slope toward the sun-white ridge of higher hills inland. Here, he
                        would hide with Rachel, till his strength returned and the ache left his
                        head clear to plan a safe escape. The Nubian called on all the gods to
                        annihilate them and started in pursuit. The sculptor did not pause, and,
                        emboldened by the indifference of the man he dogged, the pursuer drew near
                        and made menacing demonstra- tions. Kenkenes had no desire to be followed.
                        He bade Rachel wait for him and approached the Nubian.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now,&quot; he began coolly, &quot;thou art unwelcome, like-
                        wise, insolent. Also art thou a fool, but it is an arch- idiot indeed that
                        lacketh caution. This maiden is be- loved of all the Israelites. Thou art
                        one man, and alone. It would not be safe for thee to attempt to take her
                        without help even across that little space between Ma- saarah and the Nile.
                        I should harass thee with others within call. Do thou save thyself and send
                        the chief adviser after her. I would treat with him also.&quot; The
                        Nubian backed away and Kenkenes followed him relentlessly until the man,
                        overcome with trepida- tion, took to his heels and fled.</p>
                    <p>Even then, Kenkenes did not lessen his vigilance. He caught up Anubis, who
                        had bounded beside him during the entire time, and running back to Rachel,
                        turned into the limestone wastes.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes had risked his suggestions to the single Nubian, and their effect
                        upon him gave the young <pb id="VAA3882-265" n="257"/> sculptor some hope
                        that the pursuing force had been limited to these three. Though the men
                        along the Nile were not within call, they would prevent flight into Memphis,
                        and the camp of the Israelites, if not similarly picketed, would offer
                        security only for the moment. Why had not the Hebrews protected her in the
                        beginning? He would get to a place of perfect safety first and learn all
                        concerning this matter.</p>
                    <p>After an hour&apos;s cautious dodging from shelter to shelter, through
                        the masses of rocks, they toiled up the great ridge of hills deep into the
                        desert. Rachel would have gone on and on, but Kenkenes drew her into the
                        shadow of a great rock and stopped to listen. The oppressive silence was
                        unbroken. Far and near only gray wastes of hills heaved in heated solitude
                        about them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sit here in the shadow and rest,&quot; he said, turning to the
                        weary girl beside him. &quot;I shall keep watch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He cleared a space for her among the debris at the base of the great fragment
                        and pressed her down in the place he had made. Next he undid his belt and
                        fastened Anubis to a boulder, too heavy for the ape to move. The animal
                        resented the confinement, and Kenkenes, tying him by force, found in the
                        forepaws the collar of golden rings. With a murmur of satisfaction, the
                        young man reclaimed the necklace and thrust it into the bosom of his
                        dress.</p>
                    <p>When he arose the day grew dark before him, and he was obliged to steady
                        himself against the rock till the vertigo passed. His assailants had hurt
                        him more than he had thought. But he took up his vigil and maintained it
                        faithfully till all sense of danger had vanished.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-266" n="258"/>
                    <p>Rachel, who had been watching his face, touched his hand at last, and bade
                        him rest. The invitation was welcome and with a sigh he sank down beside
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lie down,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Thou hast been most
                        cruelly misused. And all for me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Obediently, he slipped from a sitting to a recumbent posture. She put out her
                        arm, and supporting him, seemed about to take his head into her lap.
                        Instead, she slipped the mantle from the strap that bound it across his
                        shoulders, and rolling it swiftly, made a pillow of it for his head.</p>
                    <p>The wallet that had hung by the same strap over his shoulder, attracted her
                        attention and she guessed that it had been used as a carrier for provision.
                        She laid it open and took out the water-bottle. The pith- stopper had held,
                        during all the violent motion, and the dull surface of the porous and
                        ever-cooling pottery was cold and wet.</p>
                    <p>She put the bottle to his lips and, after he had drunk, bathed his bruises
                        most tenderly.</p>
                    <p>Succumbing to the gentle influence of her fingers, he put up his hands to
                        take them, but they moved out of his reach in the most natural manner
                        possible. He could not feel that she had purposely avoided his touch, but he
                        made no further attempt when the soothing fingers returned. Finally he
                        raised himself on his elbow and supported his head in his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now am I new again,&quot; he said; &quot;once more ready to
                        help thee. Let us take counsel together and get into safety and
                        comfort.&quot; He paused a moment till his se- rious words would not
                        follow with unseeming prompt- ness upon his light tone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know thy trouble, Rachel,&quot; he began again sober- <pb
                            id="VAA3882-267" n="259"/> ly. &quot;There is no need that thou
                        shouldst hurt thyself by the telling. But there are details which would be
                        helpful in aiding thee if I had them in mind. Thou knowest better than I.
                        Wilt thou aid me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her golden head drooped till her face was bowed upon her hands. After a
                        little silence she answered him, her voice low with shame.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This man sought to take me before, at Pa-Ramesu, but Atsu learned
                        of it in time and sent me to Masaarah. This morning I met him
                        again—&quot; She paused, and Kenkenes aided her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, I can guess—poor affronted child!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Atsu meant to escape with me again, but the ser- vants of the
                        nobleman came before we could get away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes knew by her choice of words that she did not know the name of her
                        persecutor, and he did not tell her what it was. He could not bear the name
                        of Har-hat on her lips. She went on, after a little silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I came—&quot; she began, coloring deeply, &quot;to leave
                        thy collar with the statue—I did not expect to find thee
                        there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>How little it takes to dispirit a lover! How could he know that any thought
                        had led her to do that thing save an impulse actuated by indifference or
                        real dis- like? His hope was immediately reduced to the lowest ebb. The
                        mention of the taskmaster&apos;s name brought forward the probability of
                        a rival.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can take thee back to Atsu,&quot; he said slowly.
                        &quot;These menials will not remain in the hills after sunset, and under
                        cover of night I can slip thee, by strategy, past any sentries they may have
                        set and get thee to Atsu. I, by my sacrilege, and he by his insubordination,
                            <pb id="VAA3882-268" n="260"/> are both under ban of the law, but danger
                        with him will be sweeter danger than peril with me, I doubt
                        not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him, and the hurt that began to show on her face gave place to
                        puzzlement.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Is it not so?&quot; he asked with a bitter smile.
                        &quot;The companionship of one&apos;s beloved works wonders out of
                        heavy straits!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But—. Dost thou—? Atsu is naught to me,&quot; she cried, her
                        grave face brightening.</p>
                    <p>The blood surged back to his cheeks and the life into his eyes. He leaned
                        toward her, ready to ask for more enlightenment concerning her conduct, when
                        she went on dreamily: &quot;But he is wondrous kind and hath made the
                        camp bright with his humanity. Israel lov- eth Atsu.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes turned again to the perplexity in hand.</p>
                    <p> &quot;I came this morning to ask thy permission to give thee thy
                        freedom. I doubt not Israel of Masaarah, hidden in a niche in the hills,
                        does not dream that it is the plan of the Pharaoh—nay, the heir to the crown
                        of Egypt by the mouth of the Pharaoh—to exterminate the Hebrews.&quot;
                        Rachel recoiled from him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What sayest thou?&quot; she exclaimed, her voice sharp with
                        terror.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, forgive me!&quot; he said penitently. &quot;So intent
                        was I on thy rescue that I forgot to soften my words. Let it be. It is said;
                        I would it were not true.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her affright was only momentary, for her faith re- stored her ere his last
                        words were spoken.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It will not come to pass,&quot; she declared. &quot;Jehovah
                        will not suffer it. Thou shalt see—and let the Pharaoh beware!&quot; Her
                        words were vehement and she offered <pb id="VAA3882-269" n="261"/> no
                        argument. She saw no need of it, since her belief, merely expressed, had the
                        force of fact with her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am committed to the cause of Israel—that thou knowest,
                        Rachel,&quot; Kenkenes made answer. After an- other silence he took up
                        the thread of his talk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If thy danger from this man were set aside I should not return thee
                        to the camp, even if there were no doom spoken upon Israel. I would have
                        thee free; I would have thee in luxury, sheltered in my father&apos;s
                        house— I would—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost paint a picture that mocks me now, O Kenkenes,&quot;
                        she broke in on his growing fervor. &quot;Doubly am I enslaved, and the
                        safety of Masaarah and Memphis is no more for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou hast said,&quot; he answered in a subdued voice.
                        &quot;It was given me last night to win favor with the Pharaoh for thy
                        sake, but the need of that favor fell before it was won. But I despair not.
                        What is thy pleasure, Rachel? Shall I take thee to Atsu, or wilt thou stay
                        with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This nobleman will know of a surety that Atsu is my friend, but he
                        must guess the other Egyptian who hath helped me. If I go to Atsu I take
                        certain danger to him; if I stay with thee the peril must wander ere it
                        overtakes, us. But I would not burden either. Is there no other
                        way?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shook his head. &quot;It lies between me and Atsu to care for you, and
                        the peril for you and for us is equal. My name is as good as published, for
                        I am gifted with adength of limb beyond my fellows. I was found be- fore the
                        statue and they, describing me to the priests, will prove to the priests,
                        who know my calling, that <pb id="VAA3882-270" n="262"/> the son of Mentu
                        has committed sacrilege. And the priesthood would not wait till dawn to take
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will stay with thee, Kenkenes,&quot; she said simply. He
                        became conscious of the collar on his breast and drew it forth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;With this,&quot; he began, assuming a lightness, &quot;I
                        fear I gave thee offense one day and thou hast held it against me. Now let
                        me heal that wound and sweeten thy regard for me with this same offending
                        trinket. Wilt thou take it as a peace-offering from my hands and wear it
                        always?&quot; She bent toward him and, with worshiping hands, he put
                        aside the loosened braids and clasped the necklace about her throat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There are ten rings,&quot; he continued. &quot;Let them be
                        named thus,&quot; telling them off with his fingers. &quot;This
                        first of all—Hope—it shall be thy stay; this —Faith—it shall comfort thee;
                        this—Good Works- it shall publish thee; this—sacrifice—it shall win thee
                        many victories; this—Chastity—it shall be thy name; the next—Wisdom—it shall
                        guide thee; after it— Steadfastness—it shall keep thee in all these things;
                        Truth—it shall brood upon thy lips; Beauty—it shall not perish; this, the
                        last, is Love, of which there is naught to be said. It speaketh for
                        itself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Their eyes met at his last words and for a moment dwelt. Then Rachel looked
                        away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are the fastenings secure?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Firm as the virtues in a good woman&apos;s soul.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They will hold. I would not lose one of them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A long silence fell. The curious activity of desert- life, interrupted for
                        the time by the presence of the fugitives, resumed its tenor and droned on
                        about them. <pb id="VAA3882-271" n="263"/> The rasping grasshopper, the
                        darting lizard, the scorpion creeping among the rocks, a high-flying bird, a
                        small, skulking, wild beast put sound and movement in the desolation of the
                        region. The horizon was marked by undulating hills-to the west; to the east,
                        by sharper peaks. The scant growth was blackened or partly covered with
                        sand, and it. fringed the distant uplands like a stubbly beard. The little
                        ravines were darkened with hot shadows, but the bald slopes pre- sented
                        areas, shining with infinitesimal particles of quartz and mica, to a savage
                        sun and an almost unen- durable sky. From somewhere to the barren north the
                        wind came like a breath of flame, ash-laden and dry- ing. There was nothing
                        of the cool, damp river breeze in this. They were in the hideous heart of
                        the desert to whom death was monotony, resisting foreign life, an
                        insult.</p>
                    <p>The two in the shortening shadow of the great rock were glad of the
                        water-bottle. The necessity of com- fortable shelter for Rachel began to
                        appeal urgently to Kenkenes. He put aside his dreams and thought aloud.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What cover may I offer thy dear head this night?&quot; he
                        began. &quot;We may not return to the camp, for there of a surety they
                        lie in wait for us. Toora is deserted and so tempting a spot for fugitives
                        that it will be searched immediately. Not a hovel this side of the Nile but
                        will be visited, I would take thee to my father—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; she said firmly. &quot;I will take affliction to
                        none other. Already have I undone two of the best of Egypt. I will carry the
                        distress no further.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a silence he began again. </p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-272" n="264"/>
                    <p>&quot;How far wilt thou trust in me, Rachel?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She raised her face and looked at him with serious eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In all things needful which thou wilt require of me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And thou canst sleep this night in an open boat?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She nodded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To-morrow, then,&quot; he continued, taking her hand,
                        &quot;we shall reach Nehapehu, where I can hide thee with some of the
                        peasantry on my father&apos;s lands. And there thou canst abide until I
                        go to Tape and return.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou must know,&quot; he continued, explaining, &quot;the
                        Athor of the hills is not my first sacrilege. Once I committed a worse. My
                        father was the royal sculptor to Rameses and is now Meneptah&apos;s
                        murket.&quot; Rachel glanced at him shyly and sought to withdraw her
                        hand, for she recognized the loftiness of the title. But he retained his
                        clasp. &quot;He is a mighty genius. He planned and executed Ipsambul.
                        For that, which is the greatest monument to Rameses, the Incompara- ble
                        Pharaoh loved him, and while the king lived my father was overwhelmed with
                        his favors. Nor did the royal sculptor&apos;s good fortune wane, as is
                        the common fate of favorites, for the great king planned that my
                        father&apos;s house should be honored even after his death though the
                        dynasties change. So Rameses gave him a signet of lapis lazuli, and its
                        inscription commanded him who sat at any time thereafter on the throne of
                        Egypt to honor the prayer of its bearer in the un- speakable name of the
                        Holy One.</p>
                    <p>&quot;After the death of Rameses,&quot; the narrator went on,
                        &quot;we went to Tape, my father and I, to inscribe the hatchments and
                        carve the scene of the Judgment of the <pb id="VAA3882-273" n="265"/> Dead
                        in the tomb of the great king. Now, I am my father&apos;s only child and
                        have been taught his craft. I have beeh an apt pupil, and he had no fear in
                        trusting me with the execution of the fresco. I had long been in rebellion,
                        practising in secret my lawless ideas, and I was seized with an
                        uncontrollable aversion to mar- ring those holy walls with the conventional
                        ugliness commanded by the ritual. I assembled my ideas and dared. I worked
                        rapidly and well. The work was done before my father discovered
                        it.&quot; Kenkenes paused and laughed a little.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Suffice it to say the fresco was erased. And the solemnity of the
                        crypt was hardly restored before my father found that his sacred signet,
                        which he always wore, was gone. Nay, nay, I might not search for it more
                        than the fruitless once, for he declared, and of a truth believed firmly,
                        that the great king had re- claimed his gift. I did not and never have I
                        believed it. Now I need the signet and I shall go after it on the strength
                        of that belief.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Having found it, I shall appeal to Meneptah for thy liberty and
                        safety and whatever boon thou wouldst have and for myself. What thinkest
                        thou? Shall I go on?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel smiled and looked up at him gratefully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will go with thee, Kenkenes,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Her ready confidence and the easiness of his name on her lips filled him with
                        joy. &quot;Ah! ye ungentle Ha- thors!&quot; he mourned to himself,
                        &quot;why may I not tell her how much I love her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>But the white hand which he pressed against his breast asked its release with
                        gentle reluctance, and he set it free.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-274" n="266"/>
                    <p>Once again the silence fell and was not frequently broken thereafter.</p>
                    <p>There was no invitation in her manner, and he could not speak what he
                        would.</p>
                    <p>The sun dropped behind the Libyan hills and the heights filled with shadow.
                        At length he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lifting her to her feet, the ape attending them, he went toward the Nile,
                        hand in hand with Rachel, his love all untold.</p>

                    <p>The sudden night had just fallen, and there was an incomplete moon in the
                        west. But already the desert was full of feeble shadows and silver
                        interspaces, and all that tense silence of evening upon unpeopled locali-
                        ties.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes stood upon the top of a huge monolith, listening. Below, with only
                        her face in the faint moon- light, was Rachel, looking up to him. Anubis,
                        op- pressed by the voiceless expectancy of the two young people, crouched at
                        his master&apos;s feet. For a while there was only the ringing turmoil
                        of his own quick- ened blood in the young man&apos;s ears. But
                        presently, up from the southern slope, rose the sound he had heard some
                        minutes before—a long, quavering note, ending in a high eery wail.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes was familiar with the screams of wild beasts, and he knew the
                        irreconcilable differences be- tween them and the human voice. Instantly he
                        sent back across the hollow a strong reply that the startled echoes repeated
                        again and again. Almost immediately the first cry was repeated, but a
                        desperate power had entered into it. Kenkenes dropped from his point of
                        vantage.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-276" n="268"/>
                    <p>&quot;Some one calleth, of a surety,&quot; he said, &quot;and by
                        the voice, it is a woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is Deborah come up from the camp to seek for me!&quot;
                        Rachel exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I doubt not. But the gods are surely with her, to fend the beasts
                        from her in this savage place. It is well we came this way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With all the haste possible on the rough slope, they descended. The ground
                        was familiar to Kenkenes, for the niche was near the foot of the
                        declivity.</p>
                    <p>Half-way down he called again, and the answer came up from the hiding-place
                        of Athor. In another moment they were within and beside the prostrate form
                        of the old Israelite. Rachel dropped on her knees, crying, out in her
                        solicitude. Her words were in the soft language of her own people and
                        unintelligible to Kenkenes, but her voice trembled with concern. The old
                        woman answered soothingly and at some length. The narrative was frequently
                        broken by low exclama- tions from Rachel, and at its end the girl turned to
                        Kenkenes with a sob of anger.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Lord God break them in pieces and His fury be upon
                        them!&quot; she cried. &quot;They set upon her and beat her and left
                        her to the jackals!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Set consume them!&quot; Kenkenes responded wrath- fully.
                        &quot;How came they upon you? Did you not re- turn to
                        camp?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay, the mother heart in me would not suffer me to desert Rachel.
                        I stayed without this place, and ye outstripped me when ye fled. After a
                        time the fat servitor, rousing out of his swoon, came forth from here, and
                        another, who had been lurking in the rocks, joined him, and the pair, in
                        searching for you, dis- <pb id="VAA3882-277" n="269"/> covered me and beat
                        me with maces, leaving me for dead.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a grim silence, broken only by the low weeping of Rachel, Kenkenes bade
                        her continue.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The search they made for you was not thorough, for one was ill and
                        both were afraid. But they came upon the statue again, and the sight of it
                        mocked them, so they overthrew it and broke it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes drew a sharp breath and glanced at the place where Athor should have
                        been. Except for themselves, the niche was evidently vacant. The old woman
                        continued:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then they descended into the camp of Israel. After a time I heard
                        the sound of voices as if there were many men in the hills, and the heart of
                        me was afraid. With much pain and travail I crept into this place, and here
                        sounds come but faintly. But I heard suf- ficient to know that there were
                        many who sought dili- gently, but whether they were our own people or the
                        minions of thine enemy, Rachel, I could not with safety
                        discover.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Said they aught concerning their intents—this pair, who set upon
                        you?&quot; Kenkenes asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, aye, they blustered, and if they bring half of their threats to
                        pass, it will go ill with thee, Egyptian. They will set the priests upon
                        thee immediately; the hills will be searched; the Nile will be picketed. It
                        behooves thee to have a care for thyself. As for Ra- chel, I know not what
                        will become of her. She is penned out in the desert, for the camp is to be
                        watched, and they boast that the hunt will end only with her
                        capture.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let them look to it that it does not end with the <pb
                            id="VAA3882-278" n="270"/> choking of the swine who inspired it! I long
                        to put him beyond the cure of leeches.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He made no answer to Deborah&apos;s words concerning Rachel&apos;s
                        plight. Deborah had disarranged his plans. He could not take the old woman,
                        grievously wound- ed, on the long journey to Nehapehu, and, indeed, had she
                        been well, his small boat might not hold together with a burden of three for
                        a distance of half a hundred miles. For a moment his perplexity baffled his
                        in- genuity.</p>
                    <p>It occurred to him that he might cross to the Mem- phian shore and procure a
                        larger boat; but what would protect his helpless charges during the hours of
                        ab- sence, or in case he were taken? He realized that he dare not run a
                        risk; his every movement must be safe and sure. He could not ask the wounded
                        Israelite to return to the camp now, seeing that she had suffered
                        mistreatment at the hands of Har-hat&apos;s servants and deserted
                        not.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If there were but a grotto in the rocks—a cave or a tomb—&quot;
                        he stopped and smote his hands together. &quot;By Apis! I have it—the
                        Tomb of the Discontented Soul!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned to the two women, who had talked softly together in Hebrew, and
                        spoke lightly in his relief.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We have shelter for this night—safer than any other place in all
                        Egypt. Trouble no more concerning that. Let me hide my sacrilege and rob
                        them of in- disputable evidence against me, and then we shall get to our
                        refuge.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He lifted Deborah in his arms, and bearing her out into the open, left her
                        with Rachel.</p>
                    <p>Then he reentered the shadowy niche. The night <pb id="VAA3882-279" n="271"/>
                        was not too dark to show the interior. Athor, a torso, broken in twain,
                        headless, armless, was prostrate. It had been pushed over against the great
                        cube that sheltered it and the fall against the hard limestone had ruined
                        it. Kenkenes clenched his hands and choked back the angry tears. To the
                        artist the destruction partook of the heinousness of murder, of the pathos
                        of death. He set about concealing the wreck with all speed, for he wished to
                        be merciful to his eyes.</p>
                    <p>He collected the fragmentary members, and carry- ing them down the slope a
                        little way, dug a grave for them in the sand. To the trench he rolled the
                        trunk on the tamarisk cylinders, and buried all that was left of Athor the
                        Golden. Over the grave he laid a flat stratum of rock that the wind might
                        not uncover the ruin.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the niche, he took up the matting with its weight of chipped
                        stone, and went down through the dark to the line of rocks opposite the
                        quarries. There he permitted the rubble to slide with a mixture of earth,
                        like a natural displacement, into the talus, of a similar nature, at the
                        base of the cliff. The mat- ting he shook and laid aside. It would serve for
                        a bed in the tomb that night.</p>
                    <p>Then he destroyed the north wall. In the four months of its existence the
                        sand had banked against it more than half its height. Each stone removed in
                        the dismantling was carried away to a new place, until the whole
                        fortification was, as once it had been, scattered up and down the slope. The
                        light, dry sand he pitched with his wooden shovel against the great cube
                        until it all lay where the wind would have piled it had no sec- ond wall
                        stood in its way. By dawn the strong breeze <pb id="VAA3882-280" n="272"/>
                        from the north would cover every footprint and shovel-mark to a level once
                        more. He went again to the line of rocks and threw the shovel with a sure
                        aim and a strong arm into the quarries across the valley. To-morrow it would
                        seem that an Israelite had for- gotten one of his tools.</p>
                    <p>The work was done.</p>
                    <p>With an ache in his heart, Kenkenes returned to Deborah and Rachel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The shelter for us is in the cliff to the north, near
                        Toora,&quot; he began immediately. &quot;It is a tomb, but others
                        before us have partaken of the dead&apos;s hospital- ity.&quot;<ref
                            id="ref_S" target="note_S">*</ref></p>
                    <p>&quot;How am I to reach it?&quot; Deborah asked. &quot;Is the
                        place far?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A good hour&apos;s journey, but we go by water. Still, we must
                        walk to the Nile.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;That I can not do,&quot; the old woman declared.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay, but I can carry you,&quot; Kenkenes replied, bending over
                        her. She shrank away from him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast forgotten,&quot; she protested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so,&quot; he insisted stoutly. Taking her up, he settled
                        her on one strong arm against his breast. The free hand he extended to
                        Rachel, who had taken the matting, and together they went laboriously down
                        the steep front of the hill. They proceeded cautiously, watching before and
                        behind them lest they be sur- prised.</p>
                    <p>He had covered his boat well with the tangle of <note id="note_S"
                            place="foot" anchored="yes"><ref target="ref_S">*</ref>The tombs of the
                            Orient in ancient times were common places of refuge for fugitives,

                        <pb id="VAA3882-281" n="273"/> sedge and marsh-vines, and after a long space
                        of search, he found it.</p>
                    <p>Once again he lifted Deborah and laid her in the bottom of the boat. With its
                        triple burden, the bari sank low in the water, but Kenkenes wielded the oars
                        carefully. The faint moonlight showed him the way. Now and then a red
                        glimmer across the grain marked the location of a farmer&apos;s hut, but
                        there was no other sign of life. Even at the Memphian shore there was little
                        activity.</p>
                    <p>When the line of cultivation ended Kenkenes knew he was in the precincts of
                        the Marsh of the Discon- tented Soul. He rowed across what he believed to be
                        one-half of its width and drew into the reeds. The sound and movement awoke
                        many creatures, which hurried away in the dark, and something slid off into
                        the river with a splash. The lapping of the ripples sounded like a drinking
                        beast. Kenkenes put a bold foot on the soggy sand and stepped out. Rachel
                        fol- lowed him with bated breath. Anubis unceremonious- ly mounted his
                        shoulder. He dragged the bari far up on the shore, once more lifted Deborah
                        and started up the warm sand.</p>
                    <p>At the base of the limestone cliff he deposited his burden and brought
                        together a little heap of dried reeds and flag blades. This he fired after
                        many fail- ures by striking together his chisel and a stone. Rachel hid the
                        blaze from the Nile while he made and lighted a torch of twisted reeds and
                        stamped out the fire. In the feeble moonlight he discerned a stairway of
                        rough- hewn steps leading into a cavity in the wall. The southern side of
                        the ascent was sheltered by an out- standing buttress of rock.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-282" n="274"/>
                    <p>He put the torch into Rachel&apos;s hand, and, taking up Deborah, climbed
                        a dozen steps to a dark opening half- closed by a fallen door. Pushing the
                        obstruction aside with his foot, he entered. When they were all within he
                        closed the entrance and unrolled the reeds. There was a helter-skelter of
                        mice past them and a rustle of retiring insects. The torch blazed brightly
                        and showed him a squat copper lamp on the floor of the outer chamber. The
                        vessel contained sandy dregs of oil and a dirty floss of cotton. With an
                        exclamation of surprise Kenkenes lighted the wick, and after a lit- tle
                        sputtering, it burned smokily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, now, how came a lamp in this tomb?&quot; he asked without
                        expecting an answer.</p>
                    <p>The chamber was low-roofed and small—the whole interior rough with
                        chisel-marks. To the eyes of the sculptor, accustomed to the gorgeous
                        frescoes in the tombs of the Memphian necropolis, the walls looked bare and
                        pitiful. There were several prayers in the ancient hieroglyphics, but no
                        ancestral records or biographical paintings. Several strips of linen were
                        scattered over the floor, with the customary litter of dried leaves, dust,
                        refuse brought by rodents, cobwebs and the cast-off chrysalides of insects.,
                        In one corner was a bronze jar. Kenkenes examined it and found it contained
                        cocoanut-oil for burning.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth this is intervention of the gods,&quot; he
                        commented, a little dazed, but filling his lamp never- theless.</p>
                    <p>Ahead of him was a black opening leading into the second chamber. He stooped,
                        and entering, held the lamp above his head. He cried out, and Rachel came to
                        his side.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-283" n="275"/>
                    <p>In the center of the room was a stone sarcophagus of the early, broad,
                        flat-topped pattern. In one corner was a two-seated bari, in another a
                        mattress of wo- ven reeds. Leaning against the sarcophagus was a wooden rack
                        containing several earthenware am- phorae; on the floor about it was a
                        touseled litter of waxed outer cerements torn from mummies. All these things
                        they observed later. Now their wide eyes were fixed on the top of the
                        coffin. At one time there had been a dozen linen sacks set there, but the
                        mice and insects had gnawed most of them away. The bottoms and lower halves
                        yet remained, forming calyxes, out of which tumbled heaps of gold and silver
                        rings, zones, bracelets, collars and masks from sarcophagi— all of gold;
                        images of Isis in lapis lazuli and amethyst; scarabs in garnets and
                        hematite, Khem in obsidian, Bast in carnelian, Besa in serpentine, signets
                        in jas- per, and ropes of diamonds which had been Babylo- nian gems of
                        spoil.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The plunder of Khafra and Sigur, by my mummy!&quot; Kenkenes
                        ejaculated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will they return?&quot; Rachel asked, in a voice full of
                        fear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are gathered to Amenti for their misdeeds many months
                        agone,&quot; he explained. &quot;See how thickly the dust lies here
                        without a print upon it. They were tomb-robbers. None of the authorities
                        could discover their hiding-place, and lo! here it is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He walked round the sarcophagus and found at the head, on the floor, several
                        bronze cases sealed with pitch. He opened one of them with some difficulty.
                        Flat packages wrapped with linen lay within.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dried gazelle-meat,—and I venture there is wine in <pb
                            id="VAA3882-284" n="276"/> those amphorse. They lived here, I am
                        convinced, and fed upon the food offerings they filched from the tombs. Was
                        there ever such intrepid lawlessness?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here is a snare and net,&quot; Rachel reported.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did they not profit by superstition? As long as They were here they
                        were safe. They did not fear the spirit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The spirit?&quot; Deborah, still in the outer chamber, repeated
                        with interest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The spirit of this tomb,&quot; Kenfenes explained, re- turning
                        to her. In a few words he told her the story as Hotep had told it to
                        him.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Canst thou discover the name?&quot; she asked when he had
                        finished.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The sarcophagus is plain. There is no inscription within yonder
                        crypt, for I have this moment looked. But let me examine this writing here
                        by the door.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a while he spoke again. &quot;The name is not given. It says only
                        this:</p>
                    <p rend="center">&apos;The Spouse to Potiphar,<lb/> Captain of the Royal
                        Guard to<lb/> Apepa, Child of the Sun,<lb/> In the Twelfth Year of Whose
                        Luminous Reign<lb/> She Died.<lb/> Rejected by the Forty-two at On, because
                        of<lb/> Unchastity,<lb/> She Lies Here,<lb/> Until Admitted to the Divine
                        Pardon of Osiris.&apos; &quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, I know,&quot; Deborah responded. &quot;It is history
                        to the glory of a son of Abraham. Him, who brought our people here, she
                        would have tempted, but he would <pb id="VAA3882-285" n="277"/> have none of
                        her. Therefore she bore false witness against him and he was thrust into
                        prison.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But the God of Israel does not suffer for ever His chosen to be
                        unjustly served, and he was finally exalted over Upper and Lower Mizraim.
                        And honor and long life and a perfumed memory are his, and she—lo! she hath
                        done one good thing. Her house hath become a shelter for the oppressed and
                        for that may she find peace at last.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes looked at the old woman with admiring eyes. The quaint speech of the
                        Hebrews had always fascinated him, but now it had become melody in his ears.
                        In this, the first moment of mental idleness since midday, he had time to
                        think on Deborah. He knew that he had seen her before, and now he remembered
                        that it was she who had transfixed him with a look on an occasion when
                        Israel had first come to Masaarah.</p>
                    <p>But he did not remind her of the incident. Instead, he set about
                        counteracting any effect that might fol- low should her memory, unaided,
                        recall the occurrence. He had put her down on the matting, and the running
                        spiders and slower insects worried her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A murrain on the bugs,&quot; he said. &quot;We shall have a
                        creepy night of it. Let us bottle this treasure and lay the mattress out of
                        their reach on the sarcophagus. Endure them a while, Deborah, till we make
                        thee a refuge.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He set the lamp in the opening from the outer into the inner crypt and
                        entered the second chamber. Ra- chel followed him, and the old Israelite
                        watched them with brilliant eyes.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes swept the jewels as if they had been al- monds into an empty amphora
                        and returned it to the <pb id="VAA3882-286" n="278"/> rack. The mattress he
                        laid upon the broad top of the sarcophagus.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A line of oil run around the coffin will keep the insects
                        away,&quot; Rachel ventured. Kenkenes returned to the outer chamber for
                        the jar of oil, but Rachel took it from him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me be thy handmaid,&quot; she said softly.</p>
                    <p>He did not protest, and she reentered the crypt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Luckily the mattress is large enough for the two of you,&quot;
                        Kenkenes observed to Deborah, &quot;but it will be hard
                        sleeping.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Hebrews are not spoiled with couches of down,&quot; she
                        replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There are enough of the wrappings in yonder to take off the
                        hardness, but even with the matting over them they will be gruesome things
                        to sleep upon. They would bewitch your dreams. But mayhap ye will not suffer
                        from one night&apos;s discomfort.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where go we to-morrow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes did not answer immediately. Another plan for Rachel&apos;s
                        security had been growing in his mind, and his heart leaped at the prospect
                        of its acceptance by her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is a large boat here, and we might go to On,&quot; he
                        began at last. &quot;There is one way possible to save Rachel from this
                        man as long as I live, and I would she were to be persuaded into accepting
                        the con- ditions.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Name them and let me judge.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He hesitated for proper words and his cheeks flushed. Deborah looked at him
                        with comprehension in her gaze.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rachel is not blind to my love for her, and thou, <pb
                            id="VAA3882-287" n="279"/> too, art discerning. Yet I would declare
                        myself. I love Rachel, and I would take her to wife. Then, not even the
                        Pharaoh could take her from me by law.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Deborah raised herself with difficulty, and after peer- ing into the inner
                        chamber to see where Rachel was, approached him softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou lovest Rachel. Aye, that is a tale I have heard oftener than I
                        have fingers to count upon. From the first men of her tribe I have heard it,
                        from the best of Egypt and the worst. But she kept her heart and stayed by
                        my side. Now thou comest, young, comely, gifted with fair speech and full of
                        fervor. Thou lovest as she would be loved, and her heart goes out to thee,
                        even as thou wouldst have it—in love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes&apos; face glowed and his fine eyes shone with joy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But mark thou!&quot; she continued passively. &quot;If thou
                        wouldst save her, think upon some other way, for thou mayest not wed her.
                        Jehovah planteth the faith of Abraham anew in Israel. In Rachel and in
                        Rachel&apos;s house it died not during the hundred years of the bond-
                        age. Therefore the name is godly. Of her, what would thy heart say? Hath she
                        not beauty, hath she not wisdom, hath she not great winsomeness? There is
                        none like her in these days among all the children of Abraham. To her Israel
                        looketh for example, for, since she compelleth by her grace, those who
                        behold her will consider whatever she doeth as good. Great is the reward of
                        him who can direct and directeth aright, but shall he not appear abominable
                        in the sight of the Lord if he useth his power to lead astray? Lo! if she
                        wed thee, to her people it will seem that she would say: &apos;Behold,
                        this man is fair in my sight, and <pb id="VAA3882-288" n="280"/> it is good
                        for the chosen of the Lord to take the idola- ter into his bosom.&apos;
                        There is a multitude in Israel, which, like sheep, follow blindly as they
                        are led. Great will be the labor to engrave the worship of the Lord God in
                        their hearts, when all the powers of Israel shall strive to do that thing
                        for them. How shall there be any success if Moses and the appointed of the
                        Lord bid them worship, while the husband or wife that dwelleth in their tent
                        saith &apos;Worship not&apos;? To these, Rachel&apos;s marriage
                        with thee would be justification and incentive to incline toward idolaters
                        and idols. Then there are the wise and discerning who know that Ra- chel
                        hath turned away from the best among her people. How, then, shall she be
                        fallen in their sight if she wed with an idolater?</p>
                    <p>&quot;She knoweth all these things and she keepeth a firm hold upon
                        herself, but she hath not said these things to thee lest her strength fail
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And thus was the mystery explained to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou bowest down to a beetle,&quot; she went on with- out
                        pausing. &quot;Thou worshipest a cat; thou offerest up sacrifice to an
                        image and conservest abominable and heathen rites. Thou art an idolater, and
                        as such thou art not for Rachel. And yet, this further: if thou canst become
                        a worshiper of the true God, thou shalt take her. Never have I seen an
                        Egyptian won over to the faith of Abraham, but there approacheth a time of
                        wonders and I shall not marvel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>To Egypt its faith was paramount. Israel in its palmiest days was not more
                        vigilantly, jealously fanat- ical than Egypt. Every worshiper was a zealot;
                        every ecclesiast an inquisitor. Church and State were inseparably united;
                        law was fused with religion; sci- <pb id="VAA3882-289" n="281"/> ence and
                        the arts were governed by hieratic canons. The individual ate, slept and
                        labored in the name of the gods, and national matters proceeded as the Pan-
                        theon directed by the ecclesiastical mouthpiece.</p>
                    <p>Life was an ephemeral preface to the interminable and actual existence of
                        immortality. Temporal things were transient and only of probationary value.
                        The tomb was the ultimate and hoped-for, infinite abiding- place.</p>
                    <p>To the ideal Osirian his faith was the essential fiber in the fabric of his
                        existence, to withdraw which meant physical and spiritual destruction. The
                        forfeiture of his faith for Rachel, therefore, appealed to Kenkenes as a
                        demand upon his blood for his breath&apos;s sake. His plight was
                        piteous; never were alternatives so appar- ently impossible.</p>
                    <p>At first there was no coherent thought in the young man&apos;s mind. His
                        consciousness seemed to be full of rebellion, longing and amazement. Never
                        in his life had he been refused anything he greatly desired, when he had
                        justice on his side. Now he was rejected, not for a shortcoming, but,
                        according to his religious lights, for a virtue instead. His gaze searched
                        the vis- ible portion of the other chamber and found Rachel. In the
                        half-light he saw that she had cast herself down against the sarcophagus,
                        face toward the stone, her whole attitude one of weary depression.</p>
                    <p>Piteous as was the sight, there was comfort in it for him. Rachel loved him
                        so much that she was bowed with the conflict between her love and her duty.
                        His manhood reasserted itself. Love in youth bears hope with it in the face
                        of the most hopeless hindrances. With the blood of the Orient in his veins
                        and the fire <pb id="VAA3882-290" n="282"/> of youth to heighten its ardor,
                        he was not to be wholly and for ever cast down. Furthermore, there was Ra-
                        chel to be comforted.</p>
                    <p>He turned to Deborah.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let it pass, then. Deny me not the joy of loving her, nor her the
                        small content of loving me. If there should be change, let it be in thy
                        prohibitions, not in our love. Enough. Art thou weary? Wouldst thou
                        sleep?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; she answered bluntly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I would take counsel with thee. Thou know- est the end of
                        Israel?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know the purpose of the Pharaoh, but there is no end to
                        Israel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not yet, perchance,&quot; he said calmly, &quot;or never.
                        But we shall not put trust in auguries. The oppression of the people is
                        already begun at Pa-Ramesu and the brick-fields. Ye shall not return to
                        those dire hard- ships. Ye can not return to Masaarah. In Memphis I offer my
                        father&apos;s house, but Rachel refuses it. In Nehapehu there is safety
                        among the peasantry on the market&apos;s lands. My father lost an
                        all-powerful signet in the tomb of the Incomparable Pharaoh at Tape, and did
                        not&quot; search for it because he believed that Rameses had taken it
                        away from him. The king will honor it and grant whatever petition I make to
                        him. If ye are unafraid to abide in this tomb for the few remaining hours of
                        this night I shall take you to Nehapehu at dawn. There ye can abide till I
                        go to Tape and re- turn. What sayest thou?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old woman looked at him quietly for a mo- ment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is this place safe?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-291" n="283"/>
                    <p>&quot;The forty-two demons of Amenti could not drive an Egyptian into
                        this tomb.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How comes it that thou art not afraid?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have no belief in spirits.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nor have we. Why need we go hence? We shall abide here till thou
                        shalt return.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In this place!&quot; Kenkenes exclaimed, recoiling.
                        &quot;Nay! I shall be gone sixteen days at least.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We shall not fear to live in a tomb, we who have defied untombed
                        death daily. We shall remain here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This hole-this cave of death!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We have shelter, and by thine own words none will molest us here.
                        We are not spoiled with soft living, nor would we take peril to any. Without
                        are fowls, herbs, roots, water-within, security, meat and wine. We shall not
                        fear the dead whom, living, Joseph rebuked. We shall be content and well
                        housed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But thou art wounded,&quot; he essayed.</p>
                    <p>She scouted his words with heroic scorn. &quot;Nay, let us have no more.
                        If thou, canst accomplish this thing for Rachel, do it with a light heart,
                        for we shall be safe. If thou art successful, Israel will rise up and call
                        thee blessed; if thou failest, the sons of Abraham will still remember thee
                        with respect.&quot;</p>
                    <p>No humility, no cringing gratitude in this. Queen Hatasu, talking with her
                        favorite general, could not have commended him in a more queenly way.</p>
                    <p>To Kenkenes it seemed that their positions had been reversed. He craved to
                        serve them and they suffered him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall go then to-night,&quot; he said simply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, bide with us to-night, for thou art weary. There is no need
                        for such haste.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-292" n="284"/>
                    <p>He opened his lips to protest, his objections mani- festing themselves in his
                        manner. But she waved them aside.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast the marks of hard usage upon thee,&quot; she said;
                        &quot;thou hast slaved for us since midday, and now the night is far
                        spent. Thine eyes are heavy for sleep, thy face is weary. And before thee is
                        a task which will require thy keenest wit, thy steadiest hand. Thou owest it
                        to Rachel and to thyself to go forth with the eye of a hawk and the strength
                        of a young lion.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Because of Rachel&apos;s name in her argument he yield- ed and turned
                        immediately to the subject of their lone- some residence in the haunted
                        tomb. &quot;If aught befall me,&quot; he said, &quot;for I am in
                        the unknowable hands of the Hathors, disguise thyself and Rachel. If thou
                        art skilled in altering thou canst find pigment among the roots of the Nile.
                        Dye her hair and stain her face, take the boat and go to my
                        father&apos;s house in Memphis. He is Mentu, the murket to the Pharaoh—a
                        patriot and a friend to the kings. He knows not the Hebrew but he is
                        generous, hospitable and kind to the op- pressed of whatever blood. Tell him
                        Rachel&apos;s trouble and of me. I am his only child, and my name on thy
                        lips will win thee the best of his board, the shelter of his roof, the
                        protection of his right arm. Wait for me, however, in this place till a
                        month hath elapsed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Keep the amphorae filled with water, fresh every day, and preserve
                        a stock of food within the tomb always to stand you in good stead if
                        Rachel&apos;s enemy discover her hiding-place and besiege
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His eyes ignited and his face grew white.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Starve within this cave,&quot; he went on intensely, ap-
                        proaching her, &quot;but deliver her not into his hands, I <pb
                            id="VAA3882-293" n="285"/> charge thee, for the welfare of thy immortal
                        soul. If thou art beset and there is no escape, before she shall live for
                        the despoiler—take her life!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Deborah scanned him narrowly, and when he made an end she opened her lips as
                        though to speak. But something deterred her, and she moved away from
                        him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, spread the matting, Rachel,&quot; she said. &quot;The
                        master will stay with us to-night.,&quot;</p>
                    <p>Obediently the girl came, still white of face, but composed. She made a
                        pallet of one roll of the mat- ting, generously sprinkled the floor about it
                        with oil to keep away the insects, put the lamp behind the amphora rack,
                        hung her scarf over the frame that the light might not shine in her
                        guest&apos;s eyes, and set the door a little aside to let the cool night
                        air enter from the river. Having completed her service, she bade him a soft
                        good-night and disappeared into the inner crypt, where Deborah had gone
                        before her.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes immediately flung himself upon the pallet because Rachel&apos;s
                        hands had made it, and in a moment became acutely conscious of all the ache
                        of body and the pain of soul the day had brought him. The first deprived him
                        of comfort, the second of his peace, and there was the smell of dawn on the
                        breeze before he fell asleep.</p>
                    <p>After sunset the next day Deborah roused him. He awoke restored in strength
                        and hungry. The old Israelite had prepared some of the gazelle-meat for him,
                        and this, with a draft of wine from an amphora, refreshed him at once.
                        Provisions had been put in his wallet, and a double handful of golden rings,
                        with several jewels, much treasure in small bulk, had been wrapped in a
                        strip of linen and was ready for him. <pb id="VAA3882-294" n="286"/> By the
                        time all preparations were complete the night had come.</p>
                    <p>He bade Deborah farewell and took Rachel&apos;s hand. It was cold and
                        trembled pitifully. Without a word he pressed it and gave it back. He had
                        reached the entrance, when it seemed that a suppressed sound smote on his
                        ears, and he stopped. Deborah, her face grown stern and hard, had moved a
                        step or two for- ward and stood regarding Rachel sharply. Neither saw
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you speak, Rachel?&quot; Kenkenes asked. He fan- cied that
                        her arms had faflen quickly as he turned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, except to bid thee take care of thyself, Ken- kenes,&quot;
                        she faltered, &quot;more for thine own sake than for mine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He returned and, on his knee, pressed her hand to his-lips.</p>
                    <p>&quot;God&apos;s face light thee and His peace attend thee,&quot;
                        she continued. The blessing was full of wondrous ten- derness and music. He
                        knew how her face looked above him; how the free hand all but rested on his
                        head, and for a moment his fortitude seemed about to desert him. But she
                        whispered:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Farewell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And he arose and went forth.</p>

                    <p>The moon was ampler and its light stronger. The Nile was a vast and faintly
                        silvered expanse, rough- ened with countless ripples blown opposite the
                        direc- tion of the current. The north wind had risen and swept through the
                        crevice between the hills with more than usual strength, adding its reedy
                        music to the sound of the swiftly flowing waters.</p>
                    <p>After launching his bari, Kenkenes gazed a moment, and then, with a prayer to
                        Ptah for aid, struck out for the south, rowing with powerful strokes.</p>
                    <p>At the western shore lighted barges swayed at their moorings or journeyed
                        slowly, but the Nile was wide, and the craft, blinded by their own
                        brilliance, had no thought of what might be hugging the Arabian shore. Yet
                        Kenkenes, with the inordinate apprehension of the fugitive, lurked in the
                        shadows, dashed across open spaces and imagined in every drifting, drowsy
                        fisher&apos;s raft a pursuing party. He prayed for the well-remem- bered
                        end of the white dike, where the Nile curved about the southernmost limits
                        of the capital. The day had not yet broken when he passed the last flambeau
                        burning at the juncture of the dike with the city wall. He rowed on steadily
                        for Memphis, and immediate danger was at last behind him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-296" n="288"/>
                    <p>The towers of the city had sunk below the northern horizon when, opposite a
                        poor little shrine for cow- herds on the shore, a brazen gong sounded
                        musically for the sunrise prayers. The Libyan hilltops were, at that
                        instant, illuminated by the sun, and Kenkenes, in obedience to lifelong
                        training, rested his oars and bent his head. When he pulled on again he did
                        not realize that he had been, with the stubbornness- of habit, maintaining
                        the breach between him and Rachel. There was no thought in his mind to give
                        over his faith.</p>
                    <p>At noon, weary with heat, hunger and heavy labor, he drew up at Hak-heb, on
                        the western side of the Nile, fifty miles above Memphis. The town was the
                        com- mercial center for the pastoral districts of the poste- rior Arsinoeite
                        nome—Nehapehu. Here were brought for shipment the wine, wheat and cattle of
                        the fertile pocket in the Libyan desert. Being at a season of commercial
                        inactivity, when the farmers were await- ing the harvest, the sunburnt
                        wharves were almost de- serted.</p>
                    <p>Few saw Kenkenes arrive. Most of the inhabitants were taking the midday rest,
                        and every moored boat was manned by a sleeping crew. He made a landing and
                        went up through the sand and dust of the hot street to the only inn. Here he
                        ate and slept till night had come again. Refreshed and invigorated, he con-
                        tinued his journey. At noon the next day he stopped to sleep at another town
                        and to buy a lamp, materials for making fire, ropes and a plummet of bronze
                        suf- ficiently heavy to anchor his boat. He was entering a long stretch of
                        distance wherein there was no in- habited town, and he was making ready to
                        sleep in the <pb id="VAA3882-297" n="289"/> bari. Then he began to travel by
                        day, for he was too far from Memphis to fear pursuit, and rest in an open
                        boat under a blazing sun would be impossible.</p>
                    <p>The third evening he paused opposite a ruined city on the eastern bank of the
                        Nile. Hunters not infre- quently went inland at this point for large game,
                        and although the place was in a state of partial demolish- ment, Kenkenes
                        hoped that there might be an inn. He tied his boat to a stake and entered
                            Khu-aten,<ref id="ref_T" target="note_T">*</ref> the destroyed capital
                        of Amenophis IV, self-styled Khu- n-Aten.</p>
                    <p>Here under a noble king, who loved beauty and had it not, the barbarous rites
                        of the Egyptian religion were overthrown and sensuous and esthetic
                        ceremonies were established and made obligatory all over the king- dom. In
                        his blind groping after the One God, the king had directed worship to the
                        most fitting symbol of Him—the sun.</p>
                    <p>He appeased the luminous divinity by offerings of flowers, regaled it with
                        simmerings from censers, be- sought it with the tremulous harp and had it
                        pictured with grace and vested with charm. And since the power of the
                        national faith was all-permeating, its reconstruc- tion was far-reaching in
                        effect. Egypt was swept into a tremendous and beautiful heresy by a homely
                        king, whose word was law.</p>
                    <p>But at his death the reaction was vast and vindic- tive. The orthodox faith
                        reasserted itself with a vio- lence that carried every monument to the
                        apostasy and the very name of the apostate into dust. Now the remainin
                        houses of Khu-aten were the homes of the <note id="note_T" place="foot"
                            anchored="yes"><ref target="ref_T">*</ref>Khu-aten—Tel-el-Amarna.</note>
                        <pb id="VAA3882-298" n="290"/> fishers—its ruins the habitation of criminals
                        and refu- gees.</p>
                    <p>The hand of the insulted zealot, of the envious suc- cessor, of the invader
                        and conqueror, had done what the reluctant hand of nature might not have ac-
                        complished in a millennium. The ruins showed them- selves, stretching afar
                        toward and across the eastern sky, in ragged and indefinable lines. The
                        oblique rays of the newly risen moon slanted a light that was weird and
                        ghostly because it fell across a ruin. Kenkenes climbed over a chaos of
                        prostrate columns, fallen arch- itraves and broken colossi, and the sounds
                        of his ad- vance stirred the rat, the huge spider, the snake and the hiding
                        beast from the dark debris. Here and there were solitary walls standing out
                        of heaps of wreck- age, which had been palaces, and frequent arid open
                        spaces marked the site of groves. In complex rami- fications throughout the
                        city sandy troughs were still distinguishable, where canals had been, and in
                        places of peculiarly complete destruction the strips of uneven- pavement
                        showed the location of temples.</p>
                    <p>There was not a house at which Kenkenes dared to ask hospitality. Those that
                        lived so precariously would have little conscience about stripping him of
                        his possessions.</p>
                    <p>He retraced his steps to the wharves and drew away, prepared to spend the
                        night in his boat.</p>
                    <p>After leaving Khu-aten, the Nile wound through wild country, the hills
                        approaching its course so closely as to suggest the confines of a gorge. The
                        nar- row strip of level land on the eastern side lay under a receding shadow
                        cast by the hills, but the river and the western shore were in the broad
                        brilliance of the <pb id="VAA3882-299" n="291"/> moon. The night promised to
                        be one of exceeding brightness and Kenkenes shared the resulting wake-
                        fulness of the wild life on land.</p>
                    <p>The half of his up-journey was done and the con- flict of hope and doubt
                        marshaled feasible argument for and against the success of his mission. In
                        some manner the destruction of Khu-aten offered, in its example of
                        Egypt&apos;s fury against progress, a parallel to his own straits.</p>
                    <p>In his boyhood he had heard the Pharaoh Khu-n- Aten anathematized by the
                        shaven priests, and in the depths of his heart he had been startled to find
                        no sym- pathy for their rage against the artist-king.</p>
                    <p>Ritual-bound Egypt had resented liberty of worship —a liberalism that lacked
                        naught in zeal or piety, but added grace to the Osirian faith. In his
                        beauty-wor- ship, Kenkenes was not narrow. He would not con- fine it to
                        glyptic art, nor indeed to art alone—all the uses of life might be bettered
                        by it. His appreciation of Khu-n-Aten&apos;s ambition had been passive
                        before, but when his own spirit experienced the same fire and the same
                        reproach, his sympathy became hearty parti- zanship.</p>
                    <p>His mind wandered back again to the ruin. How fiercely Egypt had resented the
                        schism of a Pharaoh, a demi-god, the Vicar of Osiris! The words of Rachel
                        came back to him like an inspiration:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast nation-wide, nation-old, nation-defended prejudice to
                        overcome, and thou art but one, Ken- kenes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But one, indeed, and only a nobleman. Could he hope to change Egypt when a
                        king might not? Be- hold, how he was suffering for a single and simple <pb
                            id="VAA3882-300" n="292"/> breach of the law. At the thought he paused
                        and asked himself:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Am I suffering for the sacrilege?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The admission would entail a terrifying complexity.</p>
                    <p>If he were suffering punishment for the statue, what punishment had been his
                        for the sacrilegious execu- tion of the Judgment of the Dead in the tomb of
                        Rameses II? What, other than the reclamation of the signet by the
                        Incomparable Pharaoh, even as Mentu had said?, If the hypothesis held, he
                        had com- mitted sacrilege, he had offended the gods, and might not the
                        accumulated penalty be—O unspeakable—the loss of Rachel?</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if the signet were still in the tomb, Rameses had not
                        reclaimed it—Rameses had not been offended. The ritual condemned his act,
                        but if Rameses in the realm of inexorable justice and super- nal wisdom did
                        not, how should he reconcile the threats of the ritual and the evident
                        passiveness of the royal soul? If he found the signet and achieved his ends,
                        aside from Its civil power over him, what weight would the canonical
                        thunderings have to his inner heart?</p>
                    <p>Once again he paused. The deductions of his free reasoning led him upon
                        perilous ground. They made innuendoes concerning the stability of the other
                        arti- cles of hieratical law. He was startled and afraid of his own
                        arguments.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay, by the gods,&quot; he muttered to himself, &quot;it
                        is not safe to reason with religion.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But every stroke of his oar was active persistence in his heresy.</p>
                    <p>He believed he should find the signet.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-301" n="293"/>
                    <p>Thereafter he could turn a deaf ear to any renegade ideas such an event might
                        suggest.</p>
                    <p>It was an unlucky chance that befell the theological institutions of Egypt as
                        far as this devotee was con- cerned, that Kenkenes had landed at the capital
                        of the hated Pharaoh.</p>
                    <p>But he shook himself and tried to fix his attention on the night. The stars
                        were few—the multitude ob- literated by the moon, the luminaries abashed
                        thereby. The light fell through a high haze of dust and was therefore
                        wondrously refracted and diffused. The hills made high lifted horizons,
                        undulating toward the east, serrated toward the west. In the sag between
                        there was no human companionship abroad.</p>
                    <p>Throughout great lengths of shore-line the tuneless stridulation of frogs,
                        the guttural cries of water-birds and the general movement in the sedge
                        indicated a serene content among small life. But sometimes he would find
                        silence on one bank for a goodly stretch where there was neither
                        marsh-chorus nor cadences of insects. The hush would be profound and an af-
                        frighted air of suspense was apparent. And there at the river-brink the
                        author of this breathless dismay, some lithe flesh-eater, would stride,
                        shadow-like, through the high reeds to drink. Now and then the woman- like
                        scream of the wildcat, or the harsh staccato laugh of the hyena would
                        startle the marshes into silence. Sometimes retiring shapes would halt and
                        gaze with emberous eyes at the boat moving in midstream.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes admitted with a grim smile that the great powers of the world and
                        the wild were against him. But Rachel&apos;s face came to him as
                        comfort—the mem- ory of it when it was tender and yielding—and with <pb
                            id="VAA3882-302" n="294"/> a lover&apos;s buoyancy he forgot his
                        sorrows in remember- ing that she loved him. He dropped the anchor and,
                        lying down in the bottom of his boat,&apos; dreamed hap- pily into the
                        dawn.</p>
                    <p>During the day he landed for supplies at a misera- ble town of
                        pottery-makers, leaving his boat at the crazy wharves.</p>
                    <p>When he returned the bari was gone. A negro, the only one near the river who
                        was awake, told him that a dhow, laden with clay, in making a landing had
                        struck the bari, staved in its side, upset it and sent it adrift.</p>
                    <p>The mischance did not trouble Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>After some effort he aroused a crew of oarsmen, procured a boat, and
                        continued at once to Thebes.</p>

                    <p>At sunset on the day after the festivities at the Lady Senci&apos;s,
                        Hotep deserted his palace duties and came to the house of Mentu. He had in
                        mind to try again to persuade his friend from his folly, for the scribe was
                        certain that Kenkenes was once more re- turning to his sacrilege and the
                        Israelite.</p>
                    <p>The old housekeeper informed him that the young master was not at home,
                        though he was expected even now.</p>
                    <p>Hotep waited in. the house of his aunt, neighbor to the murket, and about the
                        middle of the first watch asked again for Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>Nay, the young master had not returned. But would not the noble Hotep enter
                        and await him?</p>
                    <p>The scribe, however, returned to the palace, and put off his visit until the
                        next day.</p>
                    <p>The following noon a page brought him a message from his aunt, the Lady
                        Senci. It was short and dis- tressed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kenkenes has not returned, Hotep, and since he is known to have
                        gone upon the Nile, we fear that dis- aster has overtaken him. Come and help
                        the unhappy murket. His household is so dismayed that it is use- less. Come,
                        and come quickly.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-304" n="296"/>
                    <p>The probability of the young artist&apos;s death in the Nile immediately
                        took second place in the scribe&apos;s mind. Kenkenes had displayed to
                        Hotep the effect of Rameses&apos; savage boast to exterminate the
                        Hebrews. It was that incident which had convinced the scribe that the
                        Arabian hills would claim the artist on the morrow. He had not stopped to
                        surmise the ex- tremes to which Kenkenes would go, but his mysteri- ous
                        disappearance seemed to suggest that the lover had gone to the Israelitish
                        camp to remain.</p>
                    <p>He made ready and repaired to the house of the murket. Mentu met him in the
                        chamber of guests. By the dress of the great artist it would seem that he
                        had returned at that moment from the streets.</p>
                    <p>Hotep sat down beside him, and with tact and well- chosen words told his
                        story and summarized his narra- tion with a mild statement of his
                        suspicions.</p>
                    <p>There was no outbreak on the part of Mentu. But his broad chest heaved once,
                        as though it had thrown off a great weight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But Kenkenes has been a dutiful son,&quot; he said after a
                        silence. &quot;I can not think he would use me so cruelly —no word of
                        his intent or his whereabouts.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The objection was plausible.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then, let us go to Masaarah and discover of a surety,&quot; the
                        scribe suggested.</p>
                    <p>When Atsu emerged from the mouth of the little valley into the quarries some
                        time after the midday meal, he was confronted by the murket and the royal
                        scribe. Neither of the men was unknown to him.</p>
                    <p>Hotep halted him.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Was there a guest with the fair-haired Israelite maiden last
                        night?&quot; the scribe asked.</p>

                    <p>Atsu&apos;s face, pinched and darker than usual, blazed wrathfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have ye also joined yourselves with Har-hat to run that
                        hard-pressed child to earth?&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Do ye call
                        yourselves men?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods forbid!&quot; Hotep protested. &quot;We do not
                        concern ourselves with the maiden. It is the man who may be with her that we
                        seek.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The taskmaster made an angry gesture, and Hotep interrupted again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not question her decorum, and the man of whom I speak is of
                        spotless character. He is lost and we seek him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can not help you; my wits are taxed in another
                        search.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep&apos;s face showed light at the taskmaster&apos;s words.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is she also gone?&quot; he asked mildly. &quot;Then let me
                        give you my word, that the discovery of one will also find the
                        other.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Atsu gazed with growing hope at the scribe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How is he favored?&quot; he asked at last.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is tall, half a palm taller than his fellows; comely of
                        countenance; young; in manner, amiable and courteous—.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Atsu interrupted him with a wave of his hand. &quot;I saw him once—good
                        three months agone, but not since.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The reply baffled Hotep for a moment. He realized that to find Kenkenes he
                        must begin a search for Rachel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good Atsu, he whom we seek is a friend to the maiden. He is much
                        beloved by me—by us. Whom- <pb id="VAA3882-306" n="298"/> soever he
                        befriendeth we shall befriend. Wilt thou tell us when and from whom the
                        maiden fled?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Atsu had become willing by this time. This amia- ble young noble might be
                        able to lift the suspense that burdened his unhappy heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Har-hat—Set make a cinder of his heart!—asked her at the hands of
                        the Pharaoh for his harem—&quot; Mentu interrupted him with a growling
                        imprecation and Hotep&apos;s fair face darkened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesterday morning he sent three men to me,&quot; the taskmaster
                        continued, &quot;with the document of gift from the Son of Ptah, but she
                        saw them in time and fled into the desert. At that hour there were only
                        women in the camp, and the three men made short work of me when I would have
                        held them till she escaped. In three hours, two of them returned—one, sick
                        from hard usage, and the third, they said, had been pitched over the
                        cliff-front into the valley of the Nile. They had not captured her and they
                        were too much enraged to explain why they had not. During their absence I
                        emptied the quarries of Israelites and posted them along the Nile to halt
                        the Egyptians, if they came to the river with Rachel. But we let them return
                        to Memphis empty-handed, and thereafter searched the hills till sunset. The
                        maiden&apos;s foster-mother, it seems, fled with her, but neither of
                        them, nor any trace of them, was to be found.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does it not appear to thee,&quot; Hotep asked, after a little
                        silence, &quot;that the same hand which so forcibly persuaded the
                        Egyptians to abandon the pursuit may have led the maiden to a place of
                        safety? My surmises have been right in general, O noble Mentu, but not in
                        detail,&quot; he continued, turning to the murket. &quot;There <pb
                            id="VAA3882-307" n="299"/> is, however, the element of danger now to
                        take the place of the gracelessness we would have laid to him. Thou knowest
                        Har-hat, my Lord.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He thanked the dark-faced taskmaster. &quot;Have no concern for the
                        maiden. She is safe, I doubt not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took Mentu&apos;s arm and passing up through the Israelitish camp,
                        climbed the slope behind it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is my duty and thine to hide this lovely folly up here, ere
                        these searching minions of Har-hat or frantic Israelites come upon
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The scribe&apos;s sense of direction and location was keen. It was one of
                        the goodly endowments of the savage and the beast which the gods had added
                        to the powers of this man of splendid intellect. He doubled back through the
                        great rocks, his steps a little rapid and never hesitating, as though his
                        destination were in full view. Mentu followed him, silent and moodily
                        thoughtful. At last Hotep stopped.</p>
                    <p>Before them was a narrow aisle leading down from the summit of the hill. It
                        was hemmed in on each side by tumbled masses of stone. The aisle termi-
                        nated at its lower end in a long white drift of sand against a great cube.
                        Instinct and reason told Hotep that here had been the hiding-place of Athor,
                        but there was no sign that human foot had ever entered the spot. After a
                        space of puzzlement, Hotep smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He hath made way with the sacrilege himself,&quot; he said with
                        relief in his voice; &quot;I had not credited him with so much
                        foresight. Nay, now, if the runaway will but come home, we will forgive
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mentu said nothing. Indeed, since Hotep had told him of the recent doings of
                        Kenkenes, the murket had had little to say. He had felt in his lifetime most
                        of <pb id="VAA3882-308" n="300"/> the sorrows that can overtake a man of his
                        position and attainments-but he had never known the chagrin of a wayward
                        child. The fear that he was to know that humiliation, now, made his heart
                        heavy beyond words.</p>
                    <p>As they turned away the sound of voices smote upon their ears.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Near this spot, it must be, my Lord,&quot; one said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Find the sacrilege, lout. We seek not the neigh- borhood of
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep caught the murket&apos;s arm and drew him out of the aisle into
                        hiding behind another great stone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is the place; this is the place,&quot; the first voice
                        declared, and his statement was seconded by another and as positive a
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>There was the sound of the new-comers emerging into the aisle, and
                        immediately the first speaker ex- clainrd in a tone full of astonishment and
                        disappoint- ment:</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, aye; I see!&quot; the master assented with an irri- tating
                        laugh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Har-hat!&quot; Hotep whispered.</p>
                    <p>Another of the party broke in impatiently: &quot;Make an end to this
                        chase. Saw you any sacrilege, or was. it a phantom of your stupid
                        dreams?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Asar-Mut,&quot; Mentu said under his breath.</p>
                    <p>The first voice and its second protested in chorus.</p>
                    <p>&quot;As the gods hear me, I saw it!&quot; the first went on.
                        &quot;It was a statue most sacrilegiously wrought and the man stood
                        before it. It was cunningly hidden between two walls, and there is no spot
                        on the desert that looks so much like the place as this. And yet, no wall—no
                        statue—no sign of—&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-309" n="301"/>
                    <p>&quot;How did you find it yesterday?&quot; the fan-bearer asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We followed the hag, and she, the girl. The pair of them were in
                        sight of each other, as they ran.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did they find it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Magic! Magic!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There were three of you and one man overthrew you all?&quot;
                        the high priest commented suspiciously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Holy Father!&quot; the servant protested wildly, &quot;he
                        was a giant-a monster for bigness. Besides, there were but two of us, after
                        he had all but throttled me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Har-hat laughed again. &quot;Aye, and after he pitched Nak over the
                        cliff, there was but one. But tell me this: was he noble or a
                        churl?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He wore the circlet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mentu&apos;s long fingers bent as if he longed for a throat between
                        them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The craven invented his giant to salve his valor,&quot; the
                        priest said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It may be,&quot; the fan-bearer replied musingly, &quot;but
                        thy nephew, holy Father, is conspicuously tall and well-muscled. Likewise,
                        he is a sculptor. Further- more, the two slaves came home badly abused. Unas
                        has some proof for his tale—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kenkenes is the soul of fidelity,&quot; the high priest
                        retorted warmly. &quot;He has had unnumbered oppor- tunities to betray
                        the gods and he has ever been stead- fast.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I did not impugn him. The similarity merely appealed to me.
                        Let us get down into the valley and question that villain Atsu. I would know
                        what be- came of the girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mine interests are solely with the ecclesiastical fea- <pb
                            id="VAA3882-310" n="302"/> tures of the offense, my Lord,&quot;
                        Asar-Mut replied. &quot;I would get back to Memphis.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bear us company a little longer, holy Father. The taskmaster may
                        tell us somewhat of this blaspheming sculptor-giant.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When the last sound of the departing men died away, Mentu turned across the
                        hill toward the Nile- front of the cliff.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I will go back to Memphis first,&quot; he said grimly.
                        &quot;Mayhap Kenkenes hath returned. If Asar- Mut should question him,
                        he would not evade nor equivocate, so I shall send him away that he may not
                        meet his uncle. I would not have him lie, but he shall not accomplish his
                        own undoing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But days of seeking followed, growing frantic as time went on, and there was
                        no trace of the lost artist. Even his pet ape did not return. Asar-Mut ques-
                        tioned Mentu closely concerning the fidelity of Ken- kenes to the faith and
                        the ritual.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I ask after his soul,&quot; he explained. But he gained no
                        evidence from Mentu.</p>
                    <p>On the fourteenth day after the disappearance of the young sculptor, Sepet,
                        the boatman that had hired his bari to Kenkenes, found the boat among the
                        wharf piling. It was overturned, its bottom ripped out, one side crushed as
                        if a river-horse had played with it. In the small compartment at the tiller
                        were provisions for a light lunch; a wallet, empty; a rope and a plum- met
                        of bronze used to moor a boat in midstream while the sportsman fished; the
                        light woolen mantle worn as often for protection against the sun as against
                        the cold, and other things to prove that Kenkenes had met with disaster.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-311" n="303"/>
                    <p>The fate of the young man seemed to be explained. The great house of Mentu
                        was darkened; the servants went unkempt and the artist wore a blue scarf
                        knotted about his hips. The high priest dismissed the subject of the
                        sacrilege from his mind, now that his nephew was dead. The people of Memphis
                        who knew Ken- kenes mourned with Mentu; the festivities were dull without
                        him, and there were some, like Io and the Lady Senci, who went into
                        retirement and were not to be comforted.</p>
                    <p>But Har-hat presented jeweled housings to Apis for the prospering of his
                        search after Rachel, and set about assisting the god with all his might. He
                        sent couriers, armed with a description and warrant for the arrest of
                        Kenkenes and the Israelite, into all the large cities of Egypt. He ransacked
                        Pa-Ramesu and the brick-fields, Silsilis, Syene, where there were quarries,
                        and especially Thebes, which was large and remote, a tempting place for
                        fugitives.</p>
                    <p>When he heard the news of the young sculptor&apos;s death, he actually
                        sent a message of condolence to Mentu, much to the tearful and unspeakable
                        rage of the heart-broken murket. Yet, with all the limitless re- sources
                        placed at the command of a bearer of the king&apos;s fan, Har-hat
                        continued to search for the young artist, until word came to him from Thebes
                        several days later.</p>
                    <p>His next move was to bring to the notice of the Pharaoh that the taskmaster
                        Atsu was pampering the Israelites of Masaarah and defeating the ends of the
                        government. Furthermore, the overseer had treated with contempt the personal
                        commands of the fan- bearer. So Atsu was removed entirely from over the <pb
                            id="VAA3882-312" n="304"/> Hebrews, reduced to the rank of a common
                        soldier, and returned to the nome from which he came, in the coif and tunic
                        of a cavalryman.</p>
                    <p>Thus it was that Har-hat avenged himself for the loss of Rachel, put all aid
                        out of her reach, and kept up an unceasing pursuit of her.</p>

                    <p>It was far into the tenth night that Kenkenes ar- rived in Thebes. On the
                        sixteenth day Rachel would begin to expect him, and he could not hope to
                        reach Memphis by that time. She should not wait an hour longer than
                        necessary. He would get the signet that night and return by the swiftest
                        boat obtainable in Thebes. The dawn should find him on the way to
                        Memphis.</p>
                    <p>He entered the streets of the Libyan suburb of the holy city, and passed
                        through it to the scattering houses, set outside the thickly-settled
                        portion, and nearer to the necropolis. At the portals of the most
                        pretentious of these houses he knocked and was ad- mitted.</p>
                    <p>He was met presently in the chamber of guests by an old man, gray-haired and
                        bent. This was the keeper of the tomb of Rameses the Great.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am the son of Mentu,&quot; he said, &quot;thy friend, and
                        the friend of the Incomparable Pharaoh. Perchance thou dost remember
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I remember Mentu,&quot; the old man replied, after a space that
                        might have been spent in rumination, or in collecting his faculties to
                        speak.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-314" n="306"/>
                    <p>&quot;He decorated the. tomb of Rameses,&quot; the young man
                        continued.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, I remember. I watched him often at the work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou knowest how the great king loved him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man bent his head in assent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He was given a signet by Rameses, and on the jewel was testimony of
                        royal favor which should out- live the Pharaoh and Mentu
                        himself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so. A precious talisman, and a rare one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was lost.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay! Lost! Alas, that is losing the favor of Osiris. What a
                        calamity!&quot; The old man shook his head and his gray brows
                        knitted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But the place in which it was lost is small, and I would search for
                        it again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is wise. The gods aid them who surrender not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>By this time the old man&apos;s face had become inquir- ing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is need for the signet now—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The noble Mentu, in trouble?&quot; the old man queried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The son of the noble Mentu is in trouble—the purity of an innocent
                        one at stake, and the foiling of a villain to accomplish,&quot; Kenkenes
                        answered earnestly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A sore need. Is it— Wouldst thou have me aid thee?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast said. I come to thee to crave thy per- mission to search
                        again for the signet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but I give it freely. Yet I do not under- stand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The signet was lost in the tomb of the Incompara- ble Pharaoh. May
                        I not visit the crypt?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-315" n="307"/>
                    <p>The old man thought a moment. &quot;Aye, thou,canst search. If thou wilt
                        come for me to-morrow—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I would go this very night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The keeper&apos;s face sobered and he shook his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Deny me not, I pray thee,&quot; Kenkenes entreated earnestly.
                        &quot;Thou, who hast lived so many years, hast at some time weighed the
                        value of a single moment. In the waste or use of the scant space between two
                        breaths have lives been lost, souls smirched, the unlimited his- tory of the
                        future turned. And never was a greater stake upon the saving of time than in
                        this strait- which is the peril of spotless womanhood.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man rubbed his head. &quot;Aye, I know, I know. Thy haste is
                        justifiable, but—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can go alone. There is no need that thou shouldst waste an hour
                        of thy needed sleep for me. I pledge thee I shall conduct myself without
                        thee as I should beneath thine eye. Most reverently will I enter, most
                        reverently search, most reverently depart, and none need ever know I went
                        alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The ancient keeper weakened at the earnestness of the young man.</p>
                    <p> &quot;And thou wilt permit no eye to see thee enter or come forth from
                        the valley?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Most cautious will I be—most secret and dis- creet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Canst thou open the gates?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have not forgotten from the daily practice that was mine for many
                        weeks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then go, and let no man know of this. Amen give thee
                        success.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes thanked him gratefully and went at once.</p>
                    <p>The moon was in its third quarter, but it was near <pb id="VAA3882-316"
                            n="308"/> midnight and the valley of the Nile between the dis- tant
                        highlands to the east and west was in soft light.</p>
                    <p>On the eastern side of the river there was only a feeble glimmer from a
                        window where some chanting leech stood by a bedside, or where a feast was
                        still on. But under the luster of the waning moon Thebes lost its outlines
                        and became a city of marbles and shadows and undefined limits.</p>
                    <p>On the western side the vision was interrupted by a lofty, sharp-toothed
                        range, tipped with a few scat- tered stars of the first magnitude. In the
                        plain at its base were the palaces of Amenophis III, of Rameses II, and
                        their temples, the temples of the Tothmes, and far to the south the majestic
                        colossi of Amenophis III towered up through the silver light, the faces, in
                        their own shadow, turned in eternal contemplation of the sunrise. Grouped
                        about the great edifices were the booths of funeral stuffs and the stalls of
                        caterers to the populace of the Libyan suburb of Thebes. But these were
                        hidden in the dark shadows which the great structures threw. The moon
                        blotted out the profane things of the holy city and discovered only its
                        splendors to the sky.</p>
                    <p>At the northwest limits of the suburb, the hills ap- proached the Nile,
                        leaving only a narrow strip a few hundred yards wide between their fronts
                        and the water. Here the steep ramparts were divided by a tortuous cleft,
                        which wound back with many cross- fissures deep into the desert. The ravine
                        was simply a chasm, with perpendicular sides of naked rock.</p>
                    <p>At its upper end, it was blocked by a wall of un- scalable heights. Nowhere
                        in its length was it wider than a hundred yards, and across the mouth a
                        gate- <pb id="VAA3882-317" n="309"/> way wide enough for three chariots
                        abreast had been built of red granite.</p>
                    <p>This was the valley of the Tombs of the Kings.</p>
                    <p>In chambers hewn in solid rock, the monarchs of the eighteenth and nineteenth
                        dynasties were en- tombed. All along the walls of the gorge, nature had
                        secured the sacred resting-place of the sovereigns against trespass from the
                        end and sides of the chasm, and Egypt had dutifully strengthened the one
                        weak point in the fortification—the entrance—by the gate- way of granite.
                        But there was no vigilance of guards. Whosoever knew how to open the gates
                        might enter the valley., The secret of the bolts was known only among the
                        members of the royal family and the court. To Kenkenes, whose craft as a
                        sculptor had taught him the intricate devices used in closing tombs, the
                        opening of these gates was simple. Even the mighty portals of Khufu and
                        Menka-ra would yield respon- sive to his intelligent touch.</p>
                    <p>He let himself into the valley and, closing the valves behind him, went up
                        the tortuous gorge, darkened by the shadows of its walls. He continued past
                        the mouth of the valley&apos;s southern arm wherein were entombed the
                        kings of the eighteenth dynasty. Here, in this open space, he could see the
                        circling bats, which be- fore he could only hear above his head. Somewhere
                        among the rocks up the moonlit hollow an owl hooted. But the tombs he sought
                        were in the upper end of the main ravine.</p>
                    <p>Here lay Rameses I, the founder of that illustrious dynasty—the nineteenth.
                        Near-by was his son, Seti I, and next to him the splendid tyrant, Rameses
                        the Great, the Incomparable Pharaoh.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-318" n="310"/>
                    <p>By the time Kenkenes had reached the spot, all lightness in his heart had
                        gone out like the extinguish- ing of a candle, and the weight of suspense,
                        the fear of failure, fell on him as suddenly. He approached the elaborate
                        facade of the solemn portals, climbed the pairs of steps, and paused at each
                        of the many land- ings with a prayer for the success of his mission, not for
                        the repose of the royal soul, after the custom of other visitors. With
                        trembling hands he pushed the doors, rough with inscriptions, and the great
                        stone valves swung ponderously inward, the bronze pins making no sound as
                        they turned in the sockets. Ken- kenes entered and closed the portals behind
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Instantly all sound of the outside world was cut off —the sound of the wind,
                        the chafing of the sands on the hills above, the movement and cries of
                        night-birds, beasts and insects. Absolute stillness and original night
                        surrounded him.</p>
                    <p>With all speed he lighted his lamp, but the flaring flame illuminated only a
                        little space in the brooding, hovering blackness about him.</p>
                    <p>The atmosphere was stagnant and heavily burdened with old aromatic scent, and
                        the silence seemed to have accumulated in the years. Even the soft whetting
                        of his sandal, as he walked, made echoes that shouted at him. The little
                        blaze fizzed and sputtered noisily and each throb of his heart sounded like
                        a knock on the portal.</p>
                    <p>He did not pause. The darkness might cloud and tinge and swallow up his light
                        as turbid water ab- sorbs the clear; the silence might resent the violation.
                        This was the habitation of a royal soul in perpetual vigil over its corpse
                        and vested with all the powers <pb id="VAA3882-319" n="311"/> and austere
                        propensities of a thing supernatural. But not once did the impulse come to
                        him to fly. Rachel&apos;s face attended him like a lamp.</p>
                    <p>He moved forward, his path only discovered to him step by step as the light
                        advanced, the sumptuous frescoes done by the hand of his father emerging,
                        one detail at a time. The solemn figures fixed accusing eyes upon him from
                        every frieze; the passive coun- tenance of the monarch himself confronted
                        him from every wall. One wondrous chamber after another he traversed, for
                        the tomb penetrated the very core of the mountain.</p>
                    <p>The innermost crypt contained the altars. This was the sanctuary, the holy of
                        holies, never entered ex- cept by a hierarch.</p>
                    <p>When Kenkenes reached the final threshold he paused. Thus far, his presence
                        had been merely a midnight intrusion. If he entered the sanctuary his coming
                        would be violation. He thought of the dis- tress of Rachel and dared.</p>
                    <p>The first alabaster altar glistened suddenly out of the night like a bank of
                        snow. Kenkenes&apos; sandal grated on the sandy dust that lay thick on
                        the floor. Not even the keeper had entered this crypt to remove the
                        accumulated dust of six years.</p>
                    <p>Under this floor of solid granite was the pit con- taining the sarcophagi of
                        the dead monarch, of his favorite son and destined heir, Shaemus, and his
                        well- beloved queen, Neferari Thermuthis. The opening into the pit had been
                        sealed when Rameses had de- scended to emerge no more. The chamber over it
                        was brilliant with frescoing and covered with inscrip- tions. There were
                        three magnificent altars of alabas- <pb id="VAA3882-320" n="312"/> ter and
                        over each was an oval containing the name of one of the three sleepers in
                        the pit below.</p>
                    <p>In this chapel the signet had been lost.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes set his light on the floor and began his search. The first time he
                        searched the floor, he laid the lack of success to his excited work. The
                        second time, the perspiration began to trickle down his tem- ples.
                        Thereafter he sought, lengthwise and crosswise, calling on the gods for aid,
                        but there was no glint of the jewel.</p>
                    <p>At last, sick with despair, he sat down to collect himself. Suddenly across
                        the heavy silence there smote a sound. In a place closer to the beating
                        heart of the world, the movement might have escaped him. Now, though it was
                        but the rustle of sweeping robes, it seemed to sough like the wind among,
                        the clashing blades of palm-leaves.</p>
                    <p>For a moment Kenkenes sat, transfixed, and in that moment the sound came
                        nearer. He remembered the injunction of the old keeper. Human or
                        supernatural, the new-comer must not find him there. He leaped behind the
                        altar of Shaemus, extinguishing the light as he did so. He flung the corner
                        of his kamis over the reeking wick that the odor might not escape, but his
                        fear in that direction was materially lessened when he saw that the stranger
                        bore a fuming torch.</p>
                    <p>On one end of the short pole of the torch was a knot of flaming pitch, on the
                        other was a bronze ring fitted with sprawling claws. The stranger set the
                        light on the floor and the device kept the torch upright. He crossed the
                        room and stood at the altar of Neferari Thermuthis.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-321" n="313"/>
                    <p>By the deeply fringed and voluminous draperies, and by the venerable beard,
                        rippling and streaked with gray, the young sculptor took the stranger to be
                        an Israelite. As Kenkenes looked upon him, he was minded of his father, the
                        magnificent Mentu. There was the bearing of the courtier, with the same won-
                        drous stature, the same massive frame. But the deli- cate features of the
                        Egyptian, the long, slim fingers, the narrow foot, were absent. In this
                        man&apos;s coun- tenance there was majesty instead of grace; in his
                        figure, might, instead of elegance. The expression had need of only a little
                        emphasis in either direction to become benign or terrible. Kenkenes caught a
                        single glance of the eyes under the gray shelter of the heavy brows. Once,
                        the young man had seen hanging from Meneptah&apos;s neck the rarest
                        jewel in the royal treasure. The wise men had called it an opal. It shot
                        lights as beautiful and awful as the intensest flame. And something in the
                        eyes of this mighty man brought back to Kenkenes the memory of the fires of
                        that won- drous gem.</p>
                    <p>The stranger stood in profound meditation, his splendid head gradually
                        sinking until it rested on his breast. The arms hung by the sides. The
                        attitude suggested a sorrow healed by the long years until it was no more a
                        pain, but a memory so subdu- ing that it depressed. At last the great man
                        sank to his knees, with a movement quite in keeping with his grandeur and
                        his mood, and bowed his head on his arms.</p>
                    <p>Pressed down with awe, Kenkenes followed his ex- ample, and although he
                        seemed to kneel on some <pb id="VAA3882-322" n="314"/> rough chisel mark in
                        the floor, he did not shift his position. The discomfort seemed appropriate
                        as peni- tence on that holy occasion.</p>
                    <p>After a long time the stranger arose, took up the torch and quitted the
                        chamber. He went away more slowly than he had come, with reluctant step and
                        averted face.</p>
                    <p>When night and profound silence were restored in the crypt, Kenkenes regained
                        his feet and, examining the irritated knee, found the offending object
                        clinging to the impression it had made in the flesh. The shape of the trifle
                        sent a wild hope through his brain. Grop- ing through the dark, he found his
                        lamp and lighted it with trembling hands.</p>
                    <p>He held the lapis-lazuli signet!</p>
                    <p>He did not move. He only grasped the scarab tightly and panted. The sudden
                        change from intense suspense to intense relief had deprived him of the power
                        of expression. Only his physical make-up man- ifested its rebellion against
                        the shock.</p>
                    <p>As the tumult in his heart subsided, his mind began to confront him with
                        happy fancies. Rachel was al- ready free. In that moment of exuberance he
                        thrust aside, as monstrous, the bar of different faith.. He be- lieved he
                        could overcome it by the very compelling power of his love and the
                        righteousness of his cause. He spent no time picturing the method of his
                        triumph over it. Beyond that obstacle were tender pictures of home-making,
                        love and life, which so filled him with emotion that, in a sudden ebullition
                        of boyish grati- tude, he pressed the all-potent signet to his lips.</p>
                    <p>Then, his cheeks reddening with a little shame at his impulsiveness, he
                        examined the scarab.&apos; The cord <pb id="VAA3882-323" n="315"/> by
                        which it had been suspended passed through a small gold ring between the
                        claws of the beetle. This had worn very thin and some slight wrench had
                        broken it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he exclaimed aloud. &quot;It is even as I had
                        thought. But let me not seem to boast when I tell my father of it. It will
                        be victory enough for me to display the jewel, and abashment enough for him
                        to know he was wrong.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He ceased to speak, but the echoes talked on after him. He shivered, caught
                        up his light and raced through the sumptuous tomb into the world again.</p>
                    <p>It was near dawn and the skies were pallid. He was hungry and weary but most
                        impatient to be gone. He would repair to Thebes and break his fast. There-
                        Safter he would procure the swiftest boat on the Nile and take his rest
                        while speeding toward Memphis. The inn of the necropolis was like an immense
                        dwelling, except that the courts were stable-yards. The doors, opening off
                        the porch, were always open and a light burned by night within the chamber.
                        So long and so murkily had it burnt, that the chamber Kenkenes entered was
                        smoky and redolent of it. Aside from a high, bench-like table, running half
                        the length of the rear wall, there was nothing else in the room. Kenkenes
                        rapped on the table. In a little time an Egyptian emerged from under the
                        counter, on the other side. Understanding at last that the guest wished to
                        be fed, he staggered sleepily through a door and, presently reappearing,
                        signed Kenkenes to enter.</p>
                    <p>The room into which the young sculptor was con- ducted was too large to be
                        lighted by the two lamps, hung from hooks, one at each end of the chamber.
                        Down either side, hidden in the shadows, were long <pb id="VAA3882-324"
                            n="316"/> benches, and from the huddled heap that occupied the full
                        length of each, it was to be surmised that men were sleeping on them. Above
                        them the slatted blinds had been withdrawn from the small windows and the
                        morning breeze was blowing strongly through the chamber. At the upper end
                        was another table, similar to the one in the outer room, except for a nap-
                        kin in the middle with a bottle of water set upon it. An Egyptian woman
                        stood beside this table and gave the young man a wooden stool.</p>
                    <p>As Kenkenes walked toward the seat a stronger blast of wind puffed out the
                        light above his head. The woman climbed up to take the lamp down and set it
                        on the table while she relighted it. The skirt of her dress caught on the
                        top of the stool she had mounted and pulled it over on the wooden floor with
                        a sharp sound.</p>
                    <p>One of the sleepers stirred at the noise and turned over. Presently he sat
                        up.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes righted the stool and sat down on it, the light shining in his face.
                        He saw the guest in the shadow shake off the light covering and walk swiftly
                        through the door into the outer chamber.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the silent woman served her guest with cold baked water-fowl,
                        endives, cucumbers, wheat bread and grapes, and a weak white wine. Kenkenes
                        ate deliberately, and consumed all that was set before him. When he had made
                        an end, he paid his reckoning to the woman and returned into the outer
                        chamber.</p>
                    <p>At the doors, he was confronted by four members of the city constabulary and
                        a Nubian in a striped tunic.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Seize him!&quot; the Nubian cried. Instantly the four <pb
                            id="VAA3882-325" n="317"/> men flung themselves upon Kenkenes and
                        pinioned his arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, by the gods,&quot; he exclaimed angrily. &quot;What
                        mean you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Parley not with him,&quot; the Nubian said in excite- ment.
                        &quot;Get him in bonds stronger than the grip of hands. He is muscled
                        like a bull.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The young sculptor looked at the Nubian. He had seen him before—had had
                        unpleasant dealings with him. And then he remembered, so suddenly and so
                        fiercely that his captors felt the sinews creep in his arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Set spare thee and thine infamous master to me!&quot; he
                        exclaimed violently.</p>
                    <p>The Nubian retreated a little, for Kenkenes had strained toward him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Get him into the four walls of a cell,&quot; the Nubian urged
                        the guards. &quot;I may not lose him again, as I value my
                        head.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The guards started out of the doors and Kenkenes went with them, unresisting,
                        but not passively. All the thoughts were his that can come to a man, on
                        whose freedom depend another&apos;s life and happiness. Added to these
                        was an all-consuming hate of her ene- my and his, new-fed by this latest
                        offense from Har- hat. With difficulty he kept the tumult of his emotions
                        from manifesting themselves to his captors. They feared that his calm was
                        ominous, and held him tightly.</p>
                    <p>The necropolis was not astir and the streets were wind-haunted. The tread of
                        the six men set dogs to barking, and only now and then was a face shown at
                        the doorways. For this Kenkenes thanked his gods, <pb id="VAA3882-326"
                            n="318"/> for he was proud, and the eye of the humblest slave upon him
                        in his humiliating plight would have hurt him more keenly than blows.</p>
                    <p>The prison was a square building of rough stone, flat-roofed, three stories
                        in height. The red walls were broken at regular intervals by crevices,
                        barred with bronze. There was but one entrance.</p>
                    <p>Herein were confined all the malefactors of the great city of the gods, and
                        since the population of Thebes might have comprised something over half a
                        million inhabitants, the dwellers of that grim and impregna- ble prison were
                        not few in number.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes was led through the doors, down a low- roofed, narrow, stone-walled
                        corridor to the room of the governor of police.</p>
                    <p>This was a hall, with a lofty ceiling, highly colored and supported by
                        loteform pillars of brilliant stone. Toth, the ibis-headed,,and the Goddess
                        Ma, crowned with plumes, her wings forward drooping, were painted on the
                        walls. A long table, massive, plain and solid like a sarcophagus, stood in
                        the center of the room. A confused litter of curled sheets of papyrus, and
                        long strips of unrolled linen scrolls were distrib- uted carelessly over the
                        polished surface. At one side were eight plates of stone—the tables of law,
                        codified and blessed by Toth.</p>
                    <p>The governor of police was absent, but his vice, who was jailer and scribe in
                        one, sat in a chair behind the great table.</p>
                    <p>When the party entered, he sat up, undid a new scroll, wetted the reed pen in
                        the pigment, and was ready.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Name?&quot; he began, preparing to write.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-327" n="319"/>
                    <p>&quot;That, thou knowest,&quot; Kenkenes retorted. The Nu- bian bowed
                        respectfully and approaching, whispered to the scribe. The official ran over
                        some of the scrolls and having found the one he sought, proceeded to make
                        his entries from the information contained therein.</p>
                    <p>When the man had finished Kenkenes nodded to- ward the eight volumes of the
                        law.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If thou art as acquainted with the laws of Egypt as thine office
                        requires, thou knowest that no free-born Egyptian may be kept ignorant of
                        the charge that ac- complished his arrest. Wherefore am I
                        taken?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;For sacrilege and slave-stealing,&quot; the scribe replied
                        calmly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;At the complaint of Har-hat, bearer of the king&apos;s
                        fan,&quot; Kenkenes added.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Until such time as stronger proof of thy misdeeds may be brought
                        against thee,&quot; the scribe continued.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so. In plainer words, I shall be held till I confess what he
                        would have me tell, or until I decay in this tomb. Let me give thee my word,
                        I shall do neither. Unhand me. I shall not attempt to escape.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At a sign from the scribe the four men released him and took up a position at
                        the doors. Kenkenes opened his wallet and displayed the signet. The scribe
                        took it and read the inscription. There was no doubting the young
                        man&apos;s right to the jewel for here was the name of Mentu, even as
                        the chief adviser had given it in identifying the prisoner. The official
                        frowned and stroked his chin.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This petitions the Pharaoh,&quot; he said at last. &quot;I
                        can not pass upon it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-328" n="320"/>
                    <p>&quot;Send me to my cell, then, and do thou follow,&quot; Kenkenes
                        said. &quot;I have somewhat to tell thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take him to his cell,&quot; the official said to the men as he
                        returned the signet to the prisoner. &quot;I shall attend
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes was led into a corridor, wide enough for three walking side by side.
                        There was no light therein, but the foremost of the four stooped before what
                        seemed a section of solid wall and after a little fumb- ling, a massive door
                        swung inward.</p>
                    <p>The chamber into which it led was wide enough for a pallet of straw laid
                        lengthwise, with passage room between it and the opposite wall. The foot of
                        the bed was within two feet of the door. Between the stones, in the opposite
                        end near the ceiling, was a crevice, little wider than two palms. This
                        noted, the interior of the cell has been described.</p>
                    <p>The jailer entered after him, and let the door fall shut.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have but to crave a messenger of thee—a swift and a sure one—one
                        who can hold his peace and hath pride in his calling. I can offer all he
                        demands. And this, further. Keep his going a secret, for I am beset and I
                        would not have my rescue by the Pharaoh thwarted.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can send thee a messenger,&quot; the jailer answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ere midday,&quot; Kenkenes added.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hear,&quot; the passive official assented.</p>
                    <p>The solid section of wall swung shut behind him and the great bolts shot into
                        place.</p>

                    <p>Some time later the bar rattled down again, and the jailer stood without, a
                        scribe at his side. At a sign from the jailer, the latter made as though to
                        enter, but Kenkenes stopped him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have need of your materials only,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;but the fee shall be yours nevertheless.&quot; The man set his
                        case on the floor and Kenkenes put a ring of silver in the outstretched
                        palm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fail me not in a faithful messenger,&quot; the prisoner
                        repeated to the jailer. The official nodded, and the door was closed
                        again.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes sat on the floor beside the case, laid the cover back and taking out
                        materials, wrote thus:</p>
                    <p>&quot;To my friend, the noble Hotep, greeting:</p>
                    <p>&quot;This from Kenkenes, whom ill-fortune can not wholly possess, while
                        he may call thee his friend.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I speak to thee out of the prison at Tape, where I am held for
                        stealing a bondmaiden and for executing a statue against the canons of the
                        sculptor&apos;s ritual. The accumulated penalty for these offenses is
                        great- my plight is most serious.</p>
                    <p> &quot;The pitying gods have left me one chance for escape. If I fail I
                        shall molder here, for my counsel <pb id="VAA3882-330" n="322"/> is mine and
                        the demons of Amenti shall not rend it from me.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The tale is short and miserable. But for the ne- cessity I would
                        not repeat it, for it publishes the hu- miliation of sweet innocence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Suffice it to say that the offended is she of whom we talked one
                        day on the hill back of Masaarah; the offender is Har-hat who hath buried me
                        here in Tape.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One morning he saw her at the quarries and, taken with her beauty,
                        asked her at the hands of the Pharaoh, for the hatefullest bondage pure
                        maidenhood ever knew.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She fled from the minions he sent to take her, and came to me in
                        that spot on the hillside where thou and I did talk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There the minions found us, and by the evidence they looked upon, I
                        am further charged with sacrilege.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost remember the all-powerful signet, which my father had
                        from the Incomparable Pharaoh. He lost it in the tomb of the king, three
                        years ago, aban- doning the search for it before I was assured that it was
                        not to be found.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So strong was my faith that the signet was in the tomb, that when
                        this disaster overtook her, I came to Tape at once to look again for the
                        treasure. I found it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But by some unknowable mischance mine enemy discovered my
                        whereabouts and a third minion, who escaped my wrath before the statue that
                        morning, appeared in the city and caused me to be delivered up to the
                        authorities on the charges already named.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is hidden, and I have provided for her protec- tion, as well as
                        I may, against the wishes of the strong- est man in the land. For her
                        immediate welfare I am <pb id="VAA3882-331" n="323"/> not greatly troubled.
                        But,,alas! I would be with her —thou knowest, O my Hotep, the hunger and
                        heart- ache of such separation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If the Pharaoh honor not the signet herein inclosed, tell my father
                        of my plight, let me know the decision of the king, and then I shall trust
                        to the Hathors for liberty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of this contingency, I would not speak at length. It may be
                        tempting the caprice of the Seven Sisters to presuppose such misfortune.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let not my father intervene for me. He shall not endanger himself
                        further than I have already asked of him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But remember thou this injunction most surely.&apos; That it
                        shall be last and therefore freshest in thy mem- ory, I put this at the end
                        of the letter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Put the petition herein inclosed into the Pharaoh&apos;s hands!
                        For my life&apos;s sake let it not come into the possession of any
                        other.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall write no more. My scant eloquence must be saved for the
                        king.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gods! but it is good to have faith in a friend. I salute thee. <hi
                            rend="right">KENKENES.&quot;</hi></p>
                    <p>The letter to Hotep complete, Kenkenes took up another roll and wrote thus to
                        Meneptah:</p>
                    <p> &quot;To Meneptah, Beloved of Ptah, Ambassador of Amen, Vicar of Ra,
                        Lord over Upper and Lower Egypt, greeting:&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this point he paused. His power of expression, aghast at the magnitude of
                        the stake laid on its suc- <pb id="VAA3882-332" n="324"/> cessful use,
                        became panic-stricken and fled from him. He feared that words could not be
                        chosen which would justify his sacrilege or prove his claims to Rachel
                        greater than Har-hat&apos;s. Meneptah would be hedged about with
                        prejudice against his first cause, and de- terred by the prior right of
                        Har-hat, in the second. The last man that talked with the king molded him.
                        Flattery alone might prevail against coercion. It was the one hope.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes seized his pen and wrote:</p>
                    <p>&quot;This from thy subject, Kenkenes, the son of Mentu, thy murket.</p>
                    <p> &quot;I give thee a true story, O Defender of Women.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is a maiden whose kinsmen died of hard labor in the service
                        of Egypt. Not one was left to care for her. Of all her house, she alone
                        remains. They died in ignominy. Shall the last remnant of the unhappy family
                        be stamped out in dishonor?</p>
                    <p>&quot;If one came before thee seeking to insult innocence, and another
                        begging leave to protect it, thou wouldst choose for him who would keep pure
                        the undefiled. Have I not said, O my King?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Before thee, even now is such a choice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Already thou hast given over the mastership of Rachel, daughter of
                        Maai the Israelite, to thy fan- bearer, Har-hat. By the lips of his own
                        servants, I am informed that he would have put her in his harem.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She fled from him and I hid her away, for I could not bear to
                        deliver her up to the despoiler.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I love her—she loveth me. Wilt thou not give her to me to wife?</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-333" n="325"/>
                    <p>&quot;Thine illustrious sire bespeaketh thy favor, btit o Atienti. Behold
                        his signet and its injunction.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Furthermore, I confess to sacrilege against Athor, in carving a
                        statue which ignored the sculptor&apos;s ritual. For this, and for
                        hiding the Israelite, am I imprisoned in the city stronghold of Tape.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would be free to return to my love and comfort her, but if it
                        shall overtax thy generosity to release me, I pray thee announce my sentence
                        and let me begin to count the hours till I shall come forth again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Israelite hath a nurse, a feeble and sick old woman, Deborah by
                        name, whom the minions of Har- hat abused. She can be of no further use in
                        servitude, and I would have thee set her free to bear company to her love,
                        the white-souled Rachel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But if these last prayers imperil the first by strain upon thy
                        indulgence, O Beloved of Ptah, do thou set them aside, and grant only the
                        safety of the oppressed maiden.</p>
                    <p>&quot;These to thy hand, by the hand of the scribe, Hotep.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="right">&quot;KENKENES.&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The letter complete, he summoned the messenger.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How swift art thou?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So swift that my service is desired beyond mine opportunities to
                        accept,&quot; was the answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How is it that thou art ready to serve me? Thou seest my
                        plight.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The jailer spoke of thee as petitioning the Pharaoh. The king is in
                        the north where I have not been in all the reign of Meneptah. Thou offerest
                        me a pleasure and the fee shall be in proportion to the length of the
                        journey.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-334" n="326"/>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but thou art a genius. Thou dost move me to imitate the
                        Hathors, since they add fortune to the already fortunate. Mark me. I will
                        give thee thy fee now. If thou dost return me a letter showing that thou
                        hast carried the message with all faith and speed, I shall give thee another
                        fee on thy home-com- ing. What thinkest thou?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The man smiled and nodded. &quot;Naught but the darts of Amenti shall
                        delay me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes gave him the message, and a handful of rings. The man expressed his
                        thanks, after which he went forth, and the door was barred.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes stood for a while, motionless before the tightly fitted portal of
                        stone. Then through the high crevice that was his window the sounds of life
                        outside smote upon his ear. The noise of the city seemed to become all
                        revel. Some one under the walls laughed —the hearty, raucous laugh of the
                        care-free boor.</p>
                    <p>He turned about and flung himself face down in the straw of his pallet.</p>
                    <p>He had begun to wait.</p>

                    <p>By the twentieth of May, the court of Meneptah was ready to proceed to
                        Tanis.</p>
                    <p>The next week the Pharaoh would depart. To-night he received noble Memphis
                        for a final revel.</p>
                    <p>His palace was aglow, from its tremendous portals to the airy hypostyle upon
                        its roof and from far-reach- ing wing to wing, with countless colored
                        lights. From every architrave and cornice depended garlands and draperies,
                        and tinted banners waved unseen in the dark. The great loteform pillars
                        supporting the porch were festooned with lotus flowers, and the approaches
                        were strewn with palm-leaves.</p>
                    <p>The guests came in chariots with but a single atten- dant or in litters
                        accompanied by a gorgeous retinue and much authority. Charioteers swore
                        full-mouthed oaths and smote slaves; horses reared and plunged and bearers
                        hurried back through the dark with empty chairs. Meanwhile the pacing
                        sentries made frank criticism and gazed at each alighting new-comer with
                        eyes of connoisseurs.</p>
                    <p>When the portals opened, a broad shaft of light shot into the night, a
                        multitude of attendants was seen bowing; gusts of reedy music and babble and
                        the smell <pb id="VAA3882-336" n="328"/> of wilting flowers and Puntish
                        incense swept into the outer air.</p>
                    <p>Within, the great feast began and proceeded to com- pleteness. The tables
                        were removed and the stage of the revel was far advanced. The levels of
                        scented vapor from the aromatic torches undulated midway between the ceiling
                        and the floor and belted the fres- coes upon the paneled walls. Far up the
                        vaulted hall, the Pharaoh and his queen, in royal isolation, were growing
                        weary.</p>
                    <p>The lions chained to their lofty dais slept. The guardian nobles that stood
                        about the royal pair leaned heavily upon their arms.</p>
                    <p>Out in the sanded strip across the tessellated floor, tumblers were
                        glistening with perspiration from their vaguely noticed efforts. Apart from
                        the guests the painted musicians squatted close together and made the air
                        vibrant with the softly monotonous strumming of their instruments.</p>
                    <p>The company, which was large, had fallen into easy attitudes; an exciting
                        game of drafts, or a story- teller, or a beauty, attracting groups here and
                        there over the hall.</p>
                    <p>Before one table, whereon the scattered pawns of a game yet lay, Rameses
                        lounged in a deep chair, a semi- recumbent figure in marble and obsidian.
                        Beside him, where she had seated herself at his command, was Masanath.</p>
                    <p>There was Seti at Ta-user&apos;s. side, but Io was not at the feast. She
                        mourned for Kenkenes. Ta-meri was there, the bride of a week to Nechutes,
                        who hovered about her without eye or ear for any other of the company.
                        Siptah, Menes, Har-hat, all of the group <pb id="VAA3882-337" n="329"/> save
                        Hotep and Kenkenes, were present and near enough to be of the crown
                        prince&apos;s party, yet scattered sufficiently to talk among
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>The game of drafts, prolonged from one to many, had ended disastrously for
                        the prince in spite of his most gallant efforts to win. Masanath, against
                        whom he had played, finally thrust the pawns away and refused to play
                        further with him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost make sport for the Hathors, O Prince,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;Have respect for thyself and indulge their caprice no
                        more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou not heard that we may compel the gods?&quot; he
                        asked. &quot;Perhaps I do but indulge them, of a truth. But let me set
                        mine own will against fate and there shall be no more losing for
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is a precarious game. Perchance there is as strong a will as
                        thine, compelling the Hathors contrar- ily to thine own desires. What, then,
                        O Rameses?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;By the gambling god, Toth, I shall try it!&quot; he ex-
                        claimed. &quot;The opportunity is before me even now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took her hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I catch thy meaning, Beloved of Isis! Thou didst challenge me long
                        ago, and long ago I took it up. Thus far have we fenced behind shields. Down
                        with the bull-hide, now, and bare the heart!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost forget thyself,&quot; she retorted, wrenching her
                        hand from him. &quot;The eyes of thy guests are upon thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laughed. .&quot;The prince&apos;s doings become the fashion. Let
                        me be seen and there shall be no woman&apos;s hand unpossessed in this
                        chamber.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou shalt set no fashion by me. Neither shalt thou rend the
                        Hathors between thy wishes and mine, <pb id="VAA3882-338" n="330"/>
                        Furthermore, if thou dost forget thy princely dignity, thy power will not
                        prevent me if I would remind thee of thy lapse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;War!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Now, by the battling hosts
                        of Set, never have I met a foe so worthy the overcom- ing. Listen! Dost thou
                        know that I have sorrows? Dost thou remember that I may have sleepless
                        nights and unhappy days—discontents, heartaches and op- pressions? I am not
                        less human because. I am royal, but because I am royal I am more unhappy.
                        Sorry indeed is a prince&apos;s lot! Wherefore? Because he is sated with
                        submission; because he hath drunk satiety to its very dregs; because he hath
                        leen denied the heal- ing hunger of appetite, ambition, conquest. How hath
                        my nfiserable heart longed to aspire—to conquer! I have starved for
                        something beyond my reach. But lo! in thee I have found what I sought. Thou
                        hast defied me, rebuffed me, thwarted me till the surfeited soul in me hath
                        grown fat upon resistance. Now shall the longing to conquer that racketh me
                        be fed! Go on in thy rebellion, Masanath! Gods! but thou art a foe worthy
                        the subduing! I would not have thee give up to me now. I would earn, thee by
                        defeats, losses and many scars. And thy kiss of submission, in some far day,
                        will give me more joy than the instant capitulation of many
                        empires.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast provided thyself with lifelong warfare, and triumph to
                        thine enemy at the end,&quot; She answered serenely.</p>
                    <p>Her reply seemed to awaken a train of thought in the prince. He did not
                        respond immediately. He leaned his elbows on his knees, and clasping his
                        hands <pb id="VAA3882-339" n="331"/> before him, thought a while. In the
                        silence the talk of the others was audible.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The festivities of Memphis have lost two, since they lost
                        one,&quot; Menes mused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give us thy meaning,&quot; Nechutes asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast seen Hotep in Memphian revels since Ken- kenes died?&quot;
                        the captain asked, by way of answer.</p>
                    <p>Nechutes shook his head. &quot;The gods have dealt heavily with
                        Mentu,&quot; he said after a little silence. &quot;Not even the body
                        of his son returned to him for burial!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Har-hat, who had been perched on the arm of Ta- meri&apos;s chair, broke
                        in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mayhap the young man is not dead,&quot; he surmised.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All the Memphian nome hath been searched, my Lord,&quot; Menes
                        protested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, but these flighty geniuses are not to be meas- ured by doings
                        of other men. Perhaps he hath gone to teach the singing girls at Abydos or
                        Tape.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, my Lord!&quot; protested Ta-meri, horrified.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, now,&quot; Har-hat responded, bending over her.
                        &quot;I but give his friends hope. To prove my sincerity I will wager my
                        biggest diamond against thy three brightest smiles that thou wilt hear of
                        Kenkenes again, alive and dreamy as ever, led into this strange absence by
                        some moonshine caprice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would give more than my biggest diamond to believe
                        thee,&quot; Nechutes muttered, turning away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wilt thou wager?&quot; the fan-bearer demanded with
                        animation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay!&quot; was the cup-bearer&apos;s blunt reply. Har-hat
                        shrugged his shoulders and lapsed into silence. Rame- <pb id="VAA3882-340"
                            n="332"/> ses leaned toward Masanath again. The expressiofi on his face
                        during the talk and the tone he chose now showed that he had not heard, not
                        was even conscious of the silence that had fallen. His words were low-
                        spoken, but each of his companions heard.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In warfare it is common for a foe to hedge his adversary about so
                        that fight he must. Thou art a woman and cunning, and lest thou join thyself
                        to an- other and elude me ere the battle is on, I would better treat thee to
                        a strategy. I shall wed thee first and woo thee afterward.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ta-user leaned across the table, and sweeping the pawns away with her arms,
                        said, with a smile: &quot;Quarreling over a game of drafts! Which is in
                        distress—in need of allies?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come thou and be my mercenary, Ta-user,&quot; Masa- nath said
                        with impulsive gratitude. &quot;Rameses hath lost and demands
                        restitution beyond reason.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Har-hat had risen the instant the words had passed the prince&apos;s lips
                        and left the group. He did not wish to let his face be seen. A dash of dark
                        color grew in the heir&apos;s pallid cheeks, partly because he knew he
                        had been heard, partly because he was angry at the princess&apos;
                        interruption.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Strange,&quot; mused Menes once again, &quot;that the
                        phrases of war mark the babble of even the maidens these days. And half the
                        revels end in quarrels. Though I be young in war experience, I would say the
                        omens point to conflict in which Egypt shall be em- broiled.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, Menes; and perchance thou wilt be measur- ing swords with a
                        Hebrew ere the summer is old,&quot; Siptah said, speaking for the first
                        time.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-341" n="333"/>
                    <p>&quot;Matching thy good saber-metal with a trowel or a Shay-fork,
                        Menes,&quot; Rameses sneered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold, thou doughty pride of the battling gods!&quot; Menes
                        cried laughingly to Rameses. &quot;For once, I scout thy prophecies. The
                        Hebrews are stirred up beyond any settling, save thou dost put them all to
                        the sword, and that is a task that I would go to Tuat to escape. Thou wilt
                        not work the Israelite to death. I can tell thee that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast caught the infectious terror of the infant- scaring, bugbear
                        Hebrew?&quot; Rameses asked.</p>
                    <p>Menes leaned against the nearest knee and smiled lazily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If the gray-beard sorcerer did meet me in open field, protected
                        only with bull-hide and armed with a spear, I would fight him till he said
                        &apos;enough&apos;; but who wants to go against an incantation that
                        would mow down an army at the muttering? Not I; yea, Rameses, I am a craven
                        in battle with a sorcerer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If he means to blast us, wherefore hath he not spoken the
                        cabalistic word ere this?&quot; the prince de- manded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He had no personal provocation until late,&quot; the captain
                        replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hath the taskmaster set him to making brick?&quot; the prince
                        laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay; but the priesthood plotted against his head, and he is
                        angry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rameses raised himself and looked fixedly at the soldier. Again Menes
                        laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Spare me, my Prince! It is no longer a state secret. It is out and
                        over all Egypt. Why it came not to thine <pb id="VAA3882-342" n="334"/> ears
                        I know not. Perchance every one is afraid to gossip to thee save mine
                        unabashed self.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Waster of the air!&quot; Rameses exclaimed. &quot;What
                        meanest thou?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seems that the older priests have a hieratic grudge against the
                        Israelite, and when he returned into Egypt they set themselves, with much
                        bustle, import- ance and method to silence him. Hither and thither they sent
                        for advice, permission and aid, till all the wheels of the hierarchy were in
                        motion, and the air quivered with portent and intent. Vain ado! Superflu-
                        ous preparation! The very letter which gave them explicit and formal
                        permission to begin to get ready to commence to put away the Hebrew, fell—by
                        the mischievous Hathors!—fell into the hands of the vic- tim
                        himself!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rameses fell back into his chair, his lips twitching once or twice, a
                        manifestation of his genuine amuse- ment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;As it follows, the Israelite is angry. So the witch- pot hath been
                        put on, and in council with a toad and a cat and an owl, he thinketh up some
                        especial sending to curse us with,&quot; the captain concluded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A proper ending,&quot; Rameses declared after a little.
                        &quot;Let men kill each other openly, if they will, but the methods of
                        the ambushed assassin should recoil upon himself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this point it was seen that the Pharaoh and his queen were preparing to
                        leave the hall. All the com- pany arose, and after the royal pair had passed
                        out the guests began to depart. Rameses left his party and, joining Har-hat,
                        led the fan-bearer away from the company.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-343" n="335"/>
                    <p>&quot;It seems that thou, with others, heardest my words with
                        Masanath,&quot; the prince began at once. &quot;It is well, for it
                        saves me further speech now. I want thy daugh- ter as my
                        queen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Har-hat seemed to ponder a little before he an- swered. &quot;Masanath
                        does not love thee,&quot; he said at last.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but she shall.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That granted, there are further reasons why ye should not
                        wed,&quot; the fan-bearer resumed after an- other pause.
                        &quot;Masanath would come between Egypt and Egypt&apos;s welfare.
                        Thou knowest what thy mar- riage with the Princess Ta-user is expected to
                        accom- plish. At this hour the nation is in need of unity that she may
                        safely do battle with her alien foes. If thou slightest Ta-user thou wilt
                        add to the disaffection of Amon-meses and his party. Furthermore, thine
                        august sire would not be pleased with thee nor with Masa- nath, nor with me.
                        It is not my place to show thee thy duty, Rameses, but of a surety it is my
                        place to refuse to join thee in thy neglecting of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rameses contemplated the fan-bearer narrowly for a moment. &quot;Come,
                        thou hast a game,&quot; he said finally. &quot;Out with it! Name thy
                        stake.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, thou art most discourteous, my Prince,&quot; the fan- bearer
                        remonstrated, turning away. But Rameses planted himself in his path.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stay!&quot; he said grimly. &quot;Dost thou believe me so
                        blind as to think thee sincere? Thou canst use thy smooth pretenses upon the
                        Pharaoh, but I understand thee, Har-hat. Declare thyself and vex me no fur-
                        ther with thy subtleties,&quot; Har-hat measured the prince&apos;s
                        patience before he answered.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-344" n="336"/>
                    <p>&quot;When thou canst use me courteously, Rameses,&quot; he said with
                        dignity, &quot;I shall talk with thee again. Meanwhile do not build on
                        wedding with Masanath. I shall mate her with him who hath respect for her
                        father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For a moment Rameses stood in doubt. Could it be that this soulless man had
                        scruples against giving him Masanath? But Har-hat, allowed a chance to leave
                        the prince if he would, had not moved. Rameses un- derstood the act. The
                        fan-bearer was awaiting a pro- pitious opportunity to name his price
                        gracefully. The momentary warmth of respect died in the prince&apos;s
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Out with it,&quot; he insisted more calmly. &quot;What is
                        it? Power, wealth or a wife? These three things I have to give thee. Take
                        thy choice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would have thee use me respectfully, reverently,&quot;
                        Har-hat retorted warmly. &quot;I would have thee speak favorably of me;
                        I would have thee do me no injus- tice by deed or word, nor peril my
                        standing with the king! This I demand of thee—I will not buy
                        it!&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;To be plain,&quot; Rameses continued placidly, &quot;thou
                        wouldst insure to thyself the position of fan-bearer. Say on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am fan-bearer to the king,&quot; Har-hat continued with a
                        show of increasing heat, &quot;and I would fill mine office. If thou art
                        to be his adviser in my stead, do thou take up the plumes, and I will return
                        to Bubas- tis.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Once again I shall interpret. I am to keep silence in the council
                        chamber and resign to thee the mold- ing of my plastic father. It is well,
                        for I am not pleased with ruling before I wear the crown. But <pb
                            id="VAA3882-345" n="337"/> mark me! Thou shalt not advise me when I rule
                        over Egypt. So take heed to my father&apos;s health and see that his
                        life is prolonged, for with its end shall end thine advisership. What
                        more?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So thou observest these things I am satisfied.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Gods! but thou art moderate. Masanath is worth more than that. Do
                        I take her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She does not love thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The prince waved his hand and repeated his ques- tion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall speak with her,&quot; Har-hat responded, &quot;and
                        give thee her word.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For a moment the prince contemplated the fan- bearer, then he turned without
                        a word and strode out of the chamber. In a corridor near his own apart-
                        ments he overtook the daughter of Har-hat. Her woman was with her.</p>
                    <p>The prince stepped before them.</p>
                    <p>The attendant crouched and fled somewhere out of sight. Masanath drew herself
                        to the fullest of her few inches and waited for Rameses to speak.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, Masanath,&quot; he said, &quot;thou canst reach the
                        limit of thy power to be ungracious and but fix me the firmer in my love for
                        thee. I am come to tell thee that I have won thee from thy
                        father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast not won me from myself,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,-but I shall.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost overestimate thyself,&quot; she retorted. Catching up
                        the fan and chaplet that her woman had let fall she made as though to run
                        past him. But he put himself in her way, and with shining eyes, caught her
                        in his arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There, there! my sweet. I shall do thee no hurt,&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA3882-346" n="338"/> he laughed, quieting her struggles with an
                        iron em- brace.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art hurting me beyond any cure now,&quot; she panted
                        wrathfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is thy fault. Have I not said I am sated with submission? If
                        thou wouldst unlock mine arms, kiss me and tell me thou wilt be my
                        queen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me go,&quot; she exclaimed, choking with emotion.
                        &quot;Better for thee to tell me &apos;yes&apos;; thou wilt save
                        thy father a lie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him speechless.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have said. To-morrow he will tell me that thou hast promised to
                        wed me—whether thou sayest it or not. Spare him the falsehood, Masanath, and
                        me a heartache.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wilt thou slander my father to me?&quot; she demanded.
                        &quot;Art thou a knave as well as a tyrant?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I have spoken truly. Sad indeed were thy fate, my Masanath,
                        did the gods mate thee with a knave, having fathered thee with a villain. So
                        I am come to know of a truth what is thy will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I can tell thee most truly. Sooner would I sit upon the peak of
                        a pyramid all my life than upon a throne with thee; sooner would I be
                        crowned with fire than wear the asp of a queen to thee. My father may wed me
                        to thee, but I will never love thee, nor say it, nor pretend it. Thou wilt
                        not win a wife if thou dost take a queen by violence. Release
                        me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost rivet mine arms about thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stiffened herself and savagely submitted to her imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>Rameses laughed and, bending her head back, kissed <pb id="VAA3882-347"
                            n="339"/> her repeatedly and with much tenderness. She strug- gled
                        madly, but he held her fast.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is but the beginning,&quot; he said in a low voice,
                        &quot;and I have won. The end shall be the same. I am a lovable lover,
                        am I not, Masanath? Am I not good to look upon? Dost thou know a more
                        princely prince, and is my father more of a king than I shall be? Where do I
                        fail thee in thy little ideals? Am I harsh? Aye, but I am a king. Am I
                        rough-spoken? Aye, be- cause most of the world deserve it. Thou hast never
                        felt the sting of my tongue, and never shalt thou unless thou breakest my
                        heart. I have much to give thee; not any other monarch hath so much as I to
                        give his queen. And yet I ask only thy love in return.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was earnest wooing, which contained noth- ing that she might flout. So
                        she strained away from him and sulked. Again he laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Khem and Athor and Besa have combed my heart and created a being of
                        the desires they found therein O, thou art mine, for the gods ordained it
                        so.&quot; Again he kissed her, holding her in spite of her efforts to
                        get away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There! carry thy hate of me only to the edge of sleep and dream
                        sweetly of me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He released her and continued down the hall.</p>
                    <p>As he turned out of the smaller passage into the larger corridor, Ta-user
                        stepped forth from the shadow of a pillar. The huge column dwarfed her into
                        tini- ness. The hall was but dimly lighted by a single lamp and that flared
                        above her head.</p>
                    <p>Rameses paused, for she stood in his path.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not yet gone to thy rest?&quot; he asked,</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-348" n="340"/>
                    <p>&quot;Rest!&quot; she said scornfully. &quot;Gone to a night-long
                        frenzy of relentless consciousness—weary tossing, wasted prayers. I have not
                        rested since I left the Hak- heb.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her voice sounded hollow in the great empty hall.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So? Thou art ready for the care of the physicians by this, then, O
                        my Sister.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not thy sister.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What! Hast quarreled with the gentle Seti?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rameses, do not mock me. Seti does not even stir my pulses. He
                        could not rob me of my peace.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What temperate love! Mine makes my temples crack and fills mine
                        hours with sweet distress.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ta-user looked at him for a moment, then raising her hands, caught the folds
                        of his robe over his breast.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rameses, how far wilt thou go in this trifling with the Lady
                        Masanath?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To the marrying priests.&quot; Without looking at her, he
                        loosed her hands, swung them idly and let them go.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She does not love thee,&quot; she said after a little
                        silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy news is old. She told me that not a moment since.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ta-user drew a freer breath. &quot;Thou wilt not wed her,
                        then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That I will. I have vowed it. Go, Ta-user, the hour is late. Have
                        thy woman stir a potion for thee, and sleep. I would to mine own dreams.
                        They yield me what the day denies.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stay, Rameses,&quot; she urged, catching at his robes once
                        more. &quot;I would have thee know something. But am I to tell thee in
                        words what I would have thee <pb id="VAA3882-349" n="341"/> know? Surely I
                        have not let slip a single chance to show thee by token. Art thou stubborn
                        or blind, that thou dost not pity me and spare me the avowal?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rameses looked down at her upturned face without a softening line on his
                        pallid countenance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ta-user,&quot; he said deliberately, &quot;had I been mum-
                        mied and entombed I should have known thind intent. I marvel that thou
                        couldst think I had not seen. Now, hast thou not guessed my mind by this?
                        Have I not been sufficiently explicit? Must I, too, lay bare my heart in
                        words?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not speak for a moment. Then she said eagerly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let not thy jealousy trouble thee concerning Seti —he is naught to
                        me—I love him not—a boy, no more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Seti!&quot; he exclaimed contemptuously. &quot;I have no
                        feeling against Seti save for his unfealty to the little child who loves
                        him,—whose heart thou hast most de- liberately broken.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so,&quot; she declared vehemently. &quot;I can not help
                        the boy&apos;s attachment to me. She is a child, as thou hast said, and
                        is easily comforted. Not so with ma- turer hearts like mine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She put her arms about his neck, and flinging her head back, gazed at him
                        with a heavy eye.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, wilt thou put me aside for Masanath? What is her little dark
                        beauty compared to mine? How can she, who is not even a Stately subject,-be
                        a stately queen? Wilt thou set the crown upon her unregal head, invest her
                        with the royal robes, and yield thy homage to a scowl and a bitter word? And
                        me, in whom there is no drop of unroyal blood, in whom <pb id="VAA3882-350"
                            n="342"/> there is all the passion of the southlands and all the
                        fidelity of the north, thou wilt humiliate. The gods made me for
                        thee—schooled me for thy needs and shifted the nation&apos;s history so
                        that thou shouldst have need of me. Look upon me, Rameses. Why wilt thou
                        thrust me aside?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was not dealing with Seti, or Siptah, or any other whom she had
                        bewitched. There was no spell in the topaz eyes for Rameses. If her sorcery
                        affected him at all, it won no more than a cursory interest in her next
                        move.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The night is too short to recount my reasons,&quot; he replied
                        calmly, as he put her arms away. &quot;But I might point out the
                        snarling cur, Siptah, for one, and a few other comely lords of
                        Egypt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What hast. thou done in thy life?&quot; she cried. &quot;I
                        am no more wicked than thou; thou hast found delight in others beside whom I
                        am all innocence.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It may be. Who knows but there is somewhat of the vulture-nostril
                        in man, tickled with a vague taint? But, even then, the sense is fleeting,
                        more or less as the natures of men vary. A man hath his better mo- ments,
                        and how shall they be entirely pure in the pres- ence of shame? Nay, I would
                        not mate and live for ever with mine own sins.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then as thou dost permit her spotlessness to cover her hate, let my
                        love for thee hide my sins. From the first I have loved thee unasked. She is
                        all unwon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast said it. She is unwon. But doth the lion prey upon the
                        carcass? Nay. His kill must be fresh and slain by his own might. Thou didst
                        stultify thyself by thine instant acquiescence. Come, let us <pb
                            id="VAA3882-351" n="343"/> make an end to this. The more said the more
                        thou shalt have of which to accuse thyself hereafter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But she dropped before him, her white robes cum- bering his path, her arms
                        clasping his knees.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What more have I to do of which to accuse my- self, O Rameses?
                        Egypt knows why I came to court. Egypt will know why I shall leave it. What
                        have I not offered and what hast thou given me? Where shall I find that
                        refuge from the pitying smile of the nation? Spare my
                        womanhood—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, fie upon thy pretense, Ta-user! Art thou not shrewd enough to
                        know how well I understand thee? Thou dost not love me. No woman who loves
                        pleads beyond the first rebuff. Love is full of dudgeon. Thou dost betray
                        thyself in thy very insistence. Thou beg- gest for the crown I shall wear,
                        and if I were over- thrown to-morrow thou wouldst kneel likewise to mine
                        enemy. Thou hast no womanhood to lose in Egypt&apos;s sight. As thy
                        caprice turned from Siptah to me, let it return thee to Siptah once again.
                        And if thy heart doth in truth wince with jealousy, think on
                        Io.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He undid her arms, flung her from him and disap- peared into the dark.</p>

                    <p>Masanath, suffocating with wrath and rebellion and overpowered with an
                        exaggerated appreciation of her shame, tumbled down in the shadows of the
                        narrow passage and wrapped her mantle around her head.</p>
                    <p>When she had wept till the creamy linen over her small face was wet and her
                        throat hurt under the strain of angry sobs, and until she was sure that
                        Rameses was gone, she picked herself up and went cautiously to the end of
                        the passage to reconnoiter.</p>
                    <p>The prince stood under the single lamp in the great corridor, between her and
                        the refuge of her chamber. Another was close to him, her hands upon his
                        shoul- ders.</p>
                    <p>Masanath retired into the dusk and waited. When she looked again the hands
                        were clasped about the prince&apos;s neck. Back into the shadows she
                        shrank, pressing her tiny palms together in a wild prayer for
                        Ta-user&apos;s triumph. After an interval she looked again in time to
                        see Rameses undo the arms about his knees and fling the princess from him.
                        Cold with dismay and shaking with her sudden descent from hope to de- spair,
                        Masanath watched him disappear into the dark.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O most ill-timed, iron continence!&quot; she wailed un- der her
                        breath. But the change which had come over <pb id="VAA3882-353" n="345"/>
                        Ta-user interested her immediately. Fascinated, she forgot to hide again,
                        but the light of the single lamp did not penetrate to her position.</p>
                    <p>The princess kept the posture of abandoned humilia- tion, into which Rameses
                        had flung her, until the heir&apos;s footsteps died away up the
                        corridor. Then she raised herself and faced the direction the prince had
                        taken. Her lithe body bent a little, her rigid arms were thrust back of her,
                        and the hands were clenched hard. Her head was forced forward, the long neck
                        curved sinu- ously like a vulture&apos;s. She began to speak in a whis-
                        per that hissed as though she breathed through her words. Masanath felt her
                        flesh crawl and her soft hair take on life. Not all the words of the
                        sorceress were intelligible. At first only her ejaculations were dis-
                        tinct.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Puny knave!&quot; Masanath heard. &quot;Well for thee I do
                        not love thee, else thou shouldst sleep this night in the reeking cave of a
                        paraschite, with the whine of feeding flies about thee for dreams. Well for
                        me that I do not love thee, for thine instant death would rob me of the long
                        revenge that I would liefer have! Share thy crown with me! When Ta-user hath
                        done with thee thou shalt have no crown to share! Turned from Siptah for
                        thee! How thou wilt marvel when thou learnest that I never turned from
                        Siptah nor wooed thee with a single glance but for Siptah&apos;s sake.
                        Go on! Sleep well! Have no regrets, for thy doom was spoken long before this
                        night&apos;s haughty work. Rather do I thank thee for thy scorn. It robs
                        me of qualms and adds instead a dark delight in that which I shall
                        do!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She turned toward Masanath, walking swiftly. The <pb id="VAA3882-354" n="346"
                        /> fan-bearer&apos;s daughter, stricken with panic, fled, nor paused
                        until she had passed far beyond the chamber of Ta-user.</p>
                    <p>Cowering in a friendly niche, she waited until the princess had disappeared,
                        and then only after a long time was she sufficiently reassured to reach her
                        own apartments.</p>
                    <p>It was the next day&apos;s noon before Masanath saw her father. Then he
                        came with light step as she sat in her room. Approaching from behind her, he
                        took her face between his hands, and tilting it back, kissed her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I give thee joy, Masanath. Thou hast melted the iron
                        prince.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She rose and faced him. &quot;Did Rameses tell thee I loved
                        him?&quot; she demanded, a faint hope stirring in her heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, far from it. He told me, and laughed as he said it, that if
                        thy soft heart had any passion for him it was hate.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Said he that? Nay, now, my father, thou seest I can not marry
                        him.&quot; There was relief in her voice, and she drew near to the
                        fan-bearer and invited his arms. He sat down instead, and drawing up a stool
                        with his foot, bade her sit at his feet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Listen! It is a whim of the Hathors to conceal one&apos;s own
                        feelings from him at times, that he may ac- complish his own undoing, being
                        blind. Much is at stake on thy love for the prince. Awake, Masanath! Thou
                        dost love him; thou wilt wed him—and it shall go well with-all others whom
                        thou lovest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wouldst use me for a price, my father—wouldst barter thy daughter
                        for something?&quot; she asked in a tone low with apprehension.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-355" n="347"/>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, what inelegant words,&quot; he chid. &quot;Thou dost
                        miscall my purpose. Look, my daughter. Have I not served thee with hand and
                        heart all thy life, asking nothing, sacrificing much? I, for one, have a
                        debt against thee, and thou canst pay it in thy marriage to Rameses. Dost
                        thou not love me enough to make me secure with the prince, and so, secure in
                        mine adviser- ship to the king?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath arose slowly, as if her movements kept pace with the progress of her
                        realizations. Thus far she had been a loving and a believing child. The ge-
                        nial knavishness of her father had never appeared as such to her. In her
                        sight he was cheery, great and lovable. Most of all she had flattered
                        herself that he loved her better than life, and that his nights were
                        sleepless in planning for her happiness. Now, a terri- fying lapse in his
                        care, or a more terrifying display of his real character, appalled her.</p>
                    <p>He had placed his demand in the most irresistible form, by calling upon her
                        dutifulness. Being obedient, she felt constrained to submit, but being
                        spirited, with her heart already bestowed, she resisted.</p>
                    <p>She floundered wildly for testimony that would jus- tify her rebellion in his
                        sight. The memory of Ta- user&apos;s threats came to her as unexpected
                        and unbidden as all inspirations come.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Shall I hold thee in thy position at the expense of
                        Egypt&apos;s peace, if not at the expense of-the dynasty?&quot; she
                        cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By the heaven-bearing shoulders of Buto!&quot; he re- sponded
                        laughingly, &quot;thou dost put a high estimate on the results of thine
                        acts. Add thereto, if not at the <pb id="VAA3882-356" n="348"/> expense of
                        the Pantheon,&apos; and thou shalt have all heaven and earth at thy
                        mercy.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay, my father, hear me! Thou knowest Ta- user—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, aye, I know Ta-user-all Egypt knows her- more particularly,
                        Rameses.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost not fathom the evil in her—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Her fangs are drawn, daughter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hear me, father. Last night, after Rameses—after he—after he left
                        me, he met Ta-user. And the talk between them was of such nature that she
                        knelt to him and he flung her off. They were between me and mine apartments,
                        and I could not but know of it. When he left her she made such threats that
                        it were treason for me to give them voice again. What she asked of him I
                        surmise. It could not have been other than a prayer to him, to fulfil what
                        was expected of him concerning her. Thou knowest the breach between the
                        Pharaoh and his brother, Amon-meses, is but feebly bridged till Rameses
                        shall heal the wound in marriage with Ta- user. His failure, added to the
                        vehement contempt he displayed for her last night, shall make that breach
                        ten times as deep and ever receding, so there can be no healing of
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Har-hat flung his head back and laughed-heartily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou timid child! frightened with the ravings of a discarded
                        wanton. She and her following of churls can do nothing against the Son of
                        Ptah. The moles in the necropolis are richer than they. None of loyal Egypt
                        will espouse their cause, and without money how shall they get them
                        mercenaries? Nay, why vex thee with matters of state? All that is required
                        of thee is thy heart for Rameses, no more.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-357" n="349"/>
                    <p> &quot;Judge not for Rameses, I pray thee,&quot; she insisted, coming
                        near him. &quot;Knowing that I love him rot, per- chance he might be
                        gentler with Ta-user did he see his peril.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again Har-hat laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not blind, O little reluctant,&quot; he said. &quot;I
                        know the secret spring of thy concern for Egypt—for Ta-user—for Rameses. I
                        have not told thee all the stake upon thy love for the prince. Does it not
                        seem that since a maiden will not love one winsome man there must be another
                        already installed in her heart?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She drew back, changing color.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How little of the court-lady thou art, Masanath,&quot; he Croke
                        off, looking at her face. &quot;Thy sensations are too near the surface.
                        Thou must teach thy face to dissemble. It was this very eloquence of
                        countenance that betrayed thy foolish preferences. Mind thee, I know it to
                        be but a maiden fancy which, discouraged, dies. But have a care lest it
                        bring disaster upon him whom thou hast put in jeopardy of the fierce power
                        of the prince.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath&apos;s eyes widened with terror. The fan- bearer continued:
                        &quot;I have but to mention the name of Hotep—&quot;</p>
                    <p>She clutched at her heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah?&quot; he observed with mild interrogation in the word.
                        &quot;How foolish thy caprice! Hotep does not thank thee. His marble
                        spirit hath set its loves upon ink-pots and papyri and such pulseless
                        things. How I should reproach myself if I must undo him—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, bring no disaster on the head of the noble Hotep,&quot;
                        she begged. &quot;He—I—there is naught be- tween us.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-358" n="350"/>
                    <p>&quot;It is even as I had thought. I shall tell Rameses and send him to
                        thee,&quot; he said, moving away.</p>
                    <p>With a bound she was between him and the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If he ask tell him there is naught between me and the royal scribe,
                        but send him not hither,&quot; she com- manded with vehemence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If thou art rebellious, Masanath, I must chasten
                        thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Threaten me not!&quot; she cried, thoroughly aroused,
                        &quot;or by the Mother of Heaven, I shall demand audience with Meneptah
                        and tell him what thou wouldst do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bluster!&quot; he answered with an irritating laugh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast won the sanction of the Pharaoh for this betrothal?&quot;
                        she demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Meneptah&apos;s will is clay in my hands,&quot; he replied
                        contemptuously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Vex me further and I shall tell him that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He caught her arm, and though the fierce grasp pinched her, she knew by that
                        she had gained a point.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And further,&quot; she continued, gathering courage at each
                        word, &quot;I shall ask him why thou shouldst be so anxious to keep the
                        breach between him and his brother and defeat his aims at
                        peace.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His face blazed and he shook her, but she went on in wild triumph.
                        &quot;I have a confederate in Rameses. He loves thee not. And I have but
                        to hint and ruin thee beyond the restoring power of the marriages of a
                        thousand daughters!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Har-hat&apos;s forte had been polished insult, but when the evil in him
                        would have expressed itself in its own , brutal manner he was helpless.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hotep—Hotep—&quot; he snarled.</p>
                    <p>The name was potent. Again she recoiled.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-359" n="351"/>
                    <p>&quot;I shall yield him up to Rameses,&quot; he went on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And in that very hour thou dost, in that same hour will I charge
                        thee with treason before the throne of Meneptah!&quot; she returned
                        recklessly.</p>
                    <p>The pair gazed at each other, breathless with tem- per.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wilt thou wed Rameses?&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So thou wilt avoid the name of Hotep in the pres- ence of Rameses
                        and wilt shield him as if his safety were to bring thee gain,&quot; she
                        replied, thrusting skil- fully, &quot;I will wed the prince in one year.
                        Further- more, in that time I shall be free to go where and when I please,
                        to dwell where I please and to be vexed with the sight of thee or that royal
                        monster no more than is my desire. Say, wilt thou accept?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had twitted her about her frank face. He could not tell now but that she
                        was fearless and had meas- ured her strength. He did not know that within
                        she trembled and felt that her threats were empty. But, being guilty in his
                        soul, and facing righteousness, Har- hat succumbed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have it thy way, then, vixen,&quot; he exclaimed;
                        &quot;but, remember, I hold a heavy hand above thy head and
                        Hotep&apos;s!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He strode out of her presence, and when she was sure he was gone, she fell on
                        her face and wept miser- ably.</p>

                    <p>At Tanis, the next day after the arrival of Menep- tah, there came a
                        messenger from Thebes to Hotep, and the royal scribe retired to his
                        apartments to read the letter.</p>
                    <p>And after he had read he was glad that he had secluded himself, for his
                        demonstrations of relief at the news the message imparted were most
                        extravagant and unrestrained. For the moment he permitted no reminder of
                        Kenkenes&apos; present plight to subdue his joy in the realization that
                        his friend was not dead.</p>
                    <p>Having exulted, he read the letter again, and then he summoned all his
                        shrewdness to his aid.</p>
                    <p>He would wait till the confusion of the court&apos;s set- tling itself
                        had subsided before he presented the pe- tition to Meneptah. Furthermore, he
                        would relieve his underlings and write the king&apos;s communications
                        with his own hand till he knew that the reply to Ken- kenes had been sent.
                        Har-hat should be watched vigilantly.</p>
                    <p>But order and routine were not restored in the pal- ace of Meneptah. The
                        unrest that precedes a national crisis had developed into irritability and
                        pugnacity.</p>
                    <p>Tanis was within hearing of the plaints of Israel, and the atmosphere
                        quivered with omen and portent. <pb id="VAA3882-361" n="353"/> Moses
                        appeared in this place and that, each time nearer the temporary capital, and
                        wherever he came he left rejoicing or-shuddering behind him.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the fan-bearer laughed his way into the throne. Meneptah&apos;s
                        weakness for him grew into stub- born worship. The old and trusted ministers
                        of the monarch took offense and sealed their lips; the new held their peace
                        for trepidation. The queen, hereto- fore meek and self-effacing, laid aside
                        her spindle one day and, meeting her lord at the door of the council
                        chamber, protested in the name of his dynasty and his realm.</p>
                    <p>But the king was beyond help, and the queen, angry and hurt, bade him keep
                        Har-hat out of her sight, and returned to her women. Thereafter even Menep-
                        tah saw her rarely.</p>
                    <p>The rise of the fan-bearer was achieved in an in- credibly short time. It
                        proved conclusively that until this period an influence against Har-hat had
                        been at work upon Meneptah, and seeing that Rameses had subsided, having
                        cause to propitiate the father of the woman he would wed, the courtiers
                        began to blame the prince and talk of him to one another.</p>
                    <p>He seemed lost in a dream. In the council chamber he lounged in his chair
                        with his eyes upon nothing and apparently hearing nothing. But the slow
                        shifting of the spark in his sleepy eyes indicated to those who ob- served
                        closely that he heard but kept his own counsel. If Meneptah spoke to hint he
                        but seconded Har-hat&apos;s suggestions. But once again the observant
                        ones noted that the fan-bearer did not advise at wide variance with any of
                        the prince&apos;s known ideas. Thus far the most caviling could not see
                        that Har-hat&apos;s favoritism <pb id="VAA3882-362" n="354"/> had led to
                        any misrule, but the field of possibilities opened by his complete dominance
                        over the Pharaoh was crowded with disaster, individual and national.</p>
                    <p>The betrothal of Rameses to Har-hat&apos;s daughter gave further material
                        for contention. It seemed to in- dicate that the fan-bearer had builded for
                        himself for two reigns.</p>
                    <p>Hotep&apos;s situation was most poignantly unhappy. He was fixed under
                        the same roof with the man that had taken his love by piracy; he must greet
                        him affably and reverently every day; he must live in daily&apos; con-
                        templation of the time when he must meet Masanath also as his sovereign—the
                        wife of the prince, whom he must serve till death. Hardest of all, he must
                        wear a serene countenance and cover his sorrow most surely, for his own sake
                        and for Masanath&apos;s.</p>
                    <p>Ta-user still remained at court. Seti, in a fume of boyish indignation at
                        Rameses, attended her like a shadow. Among the courtiers there were others
                        who were not alive to the true nature of the princess and who joined Seti in
                        his resentment against the heir. Amon-meses and Siptah, snarling and
                        malevolent, had left the court abruptly on the morning of its de- parture
                        for Tanis. The Hak-heb received them once again, and an ominous calm settled
                        over that little pocket of fertility in the desert—Nehapehu.</p>
                    <p>Thus the court was torn with factions; old internal dissensions made
                        themselves evident again, but the vast murmur in Goshen was heard above the
                        strife.</p>
                    <p>All this had come to pass in the short spade of a month. When half of that
                        time had elapsed, Hotep, fearing to delay the petition of Kenkenes longer,
                        lest conditions should become worse rather than better, met <pb
                            id="VAA3882-363" n="355"/> the Pharaoh in the hall one day and gave him
                        the writing. Earnestly the scribe impressed Meneptah with the importance of
                        the petition and begged him to acquaint himself in an hour of solitude with
                        its contents and the identity of the supplicant.</p>
                    <p>Meneptah promised and continued to his apart- ments. There Har-hat came in a
                        few moments, and Meneptah, after his custom, gave over to him the state
                        communications of the day, and after some little hesita- tion, tossed the
                        petition of Kenkenes among them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou canst attend to this matter as well, good Har-hat. Why should
                        I take up the private concerns of my subjects when I am already burdened
                        with heavy cares? But do thou look to this petition faithfully. It may be
                        important, and I know not from whom it is. I promised Hotep it should be
                        given honest attention.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For seven days thereafter every letter sent by the king was written by Hotep.
                        At the end of that time he met Meneptah again, and bending low before him,
                        asked pardon for his insistence, and begged to know what disposition the Son
                        of Ptah had made of the petition of his friend. He was irritably informed
                        that the matter had been given over to the fan-bearer for attention, since
                        the Pharaoh had been too oppressed with heavier matters to read the
                        letter.</p>
                    <p>The state of the scribe&apos;s mind, after receiving the in- formation,
                        was indescribable.</p>
                    <p>He controlled himself before Meneptah, but he suf- fered no curb upon his
                        feelings when he had returned to his own apartments. After a long time he
                        succeeded in choking his anger, disgust and grief, realizing that each
                        moment must be turned to account rather than wasted in railing.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-364" n="356"/>
                    <p>He viewed the situation with enforced calm.</p>
                    <p>Har-hat was in full possession of the facts. He had the signet and was
                        absolute master of Meneptah. The Hathors had surrendered Kenkenes wholly
                        into the hands of his enemy. Furthermore, the fate of the Israelite seemed
                        to be sealed. At the thought Hotep gnashed his teeth.</p>
                    <p>In his sympathy for his friend&apos;s strait, the scribe gave over his
                        objections to Rachel. Kenkenes had suffered for her, and, if he would, he
                        should have her.</p>
                    <p>Between the king and persuasion was Har-hat, vi- tally interested in the
                        defeat of any movement toward the aid of Kenkenes. The one hope for the
                        sculptor was the winning over of the Pharaoh, and only one could do it. And
                        that was Rameses, who was be- trothed to the love of Hotep, and against her
                        will. Nothing could have appeared more distasteful to the scribe than the
                        necessity of prayer to the man for whom he cherished a hate that threatened
                        to make a cinder of his vitals. But the more he rebelled the more his
                        conscience urged him.</p>
                    <p>He flung himself on his couch and writhed; he reviled the Hathors, abused
                        Kenkenes for the folly of sacrilege which had brought on him such misfor-
                        tune; he execrated Meneptah, anathematized Har-hat and called down the
                        fiercest maledictions on the head of Rameses. Having relieved himself, he
                        arose and, summoning his servant, had his disordered hair dressed, fresh
                        robes brought for him, and a glass of wine for refreshment. On the way to
                        the palace-top he met Ta-user, walking slowly away from the stair- case.
                        Rameses, solitary and luxurious, was stretched <pb id="VAA3882-365" n="357"
                        /> upon a cushioned divan in the shadow of a canopy over the hypostyle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods keep thee, Son of the Sun,&quot; Hotep said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So it is thou, Hotep. Nay, but I am glad to see thee. Methought
                        Ta-user meant to visit me just now. Is there a taboret near?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, but I shall not sit, my Prince.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Go to! It makes me weary to see thee stand. Sit, I tell
                        thee!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep drew up the taboret and sat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I come to thee with news and a petition,&quot; he began.
                        &quot;It is more fitting that I should kneel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perchance. But exertion offends mine eyes in such delicious hours
                        as these, and I will forego the homage for the sake of mine own sinews. Out
                        with thy tid- ings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost remember thy friend and mine, that gen- tle genius,
                        Kenkenes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not like to forget him so long as a bird sings or the Nile
                        ripples make music. Osiris pillow him most softly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is not dead, my Prince.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay!&quot; Rameses cried, sitting up. &quot;The knave
                        should be bastinadoed for the tears he wrung from us!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou wouldst deny my petition. I am come to implore thee to
                        intercede for him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rameses bade him proceed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art acquainted with the nature of Kenkenes, O Prince. He is a
                        visionary—an idealist, and so firmly rooted are his beliefs that they are to
                        his life as natural as the color of his eyes. He is a beauty-worshiper.
                        Athor possesses him utterly, and her loveliness blinds <pb id="VAA3882-366"
                            n="358"/> him to all other things, particularly to his own welfare and
                        safety.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In the beginning he fell in love, and a soul like his in love is
                        most unreasoning, immoderate and terribly faithful. The maiden is
                        beautiful—I saw her—most divinely beautiful. She is wise, for I saw that
                        also. She is good, for I felt it, unreasoning, and when a man hath a woman
                        intuition, a god hath spoken the truth to his heart. But she is a slave—an
                        Israelite.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;An Israelite!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep bowed his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By the gods of my fathers, I ought not to marvel! Nay, now, is that
                        not like the boy? An Israelite! And half the noble maids of Memphis mad for
                        him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is not for thee and me to judge, O Rameses,&quot; Hotep
                        interrupted. &quot;The gods blew another breath in him than animates our
                        souls. For thee and me such conduct would be the fancies of madmen; for Ken-
                        kenes it is but living up to the alien spirit with which the gods endowed
                        him. It might be torture for him to wed according to our
                        lights.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perchance thou art right. Go on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seems that Har-hat looked upon the girl, and taken by her
                        beauty, asked her at the Pharaoh&apos;s hands for his
                        harem.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, the—! Why does he not marry honorably?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is not for me to divine,&quot; Hotep went on calmly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The fan-bearer sent his men to take her, but she fled from them to
                        Kenkenes, and he protected her—hid her away—where, none but Kenkenes and the
                        maiden know. Har-hat is most desirous of owning her, but Kenkenes keeps his
                        counsel. Therefore, Har-hat over- <pb id="VAA3882-367" n="359"/> took him in
                        Tape, where he went to get a signet be- longing to his father, and
                        imprisoned him till what time he should divulge the hiding-place of the
                        Israel- ite.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never was there a true villain till Har-hat was born! What poor
                        feeble shadows have trodden the world for knaves before the fan-bearer came.
                        Go on. Hath he put him to torture yet?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, from the beginning, though not by the basti- nado. He rends
                        him with suspense and all the doubts and fears for his love that can haunt
                        him in his cell. But I have more to tell. There was a signet, an all- potent
                        signet, which belonged to the noble Mentu—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, I remember,&quot; Rameses broke in. &quot;My grand-
                        sire gave it to the murket in recognition of his great work, Ipsambul. It
                        commands royal favor in the name of Osiris. That should help the dreamer out
                        of his difficulty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, it should, my Prince, but it did not. Kenkenes sent it to the
                        Pharaoh, with a petition for his own free- dom, but the cares of state were
                        so pressing that the Son of Ptah gave the letter, unopened, to Har-hat for
                        attention.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rameses laughed harshly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kenkenes would better content himself. The Ha- thors are against
                        him,&quot; he cried. &quot;Was there ever such consummate
                        misfortune? What more?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it not enough, O Rameses?&quot; Hotep answered sternly.
                        &quot;He hath suffered sufficiently. Now is it time for them, who
                        profess to love him, to bestir themselves in his behalf. Thou knowest how
                        near the fan-bearer is to the Pharaoh. Perstasion can not reach the king <pb
                            id="VAA3882-368" n="360"/> that worketh against Har-hat. Thou alone art
                        as po- tent with the Son of Ptah. Wilt thou not prove thy love for Kenkenes
                        and aid him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rameses did not answer immediately. Thoughtfully he leaned his elbow on his
                        knee and stroked his fore- head with his hand.. His black brows knitted
                        finally.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My hands are tied, Hotep,&quot; he began bluntly. &quot;I
                        permit the sway of this knave over my father because I am constrained. Till
                        he begins to achieve confusion or bring about bad government I must let him
                        alone. There is no love between us. We have no quarrel, but I despise him
                        for that very spirit in him which makes him do such things as thou hast even
                        told me. If his offense had been against Egypt or the king or myself, I
                        could balk him. But this is a matter of personal in- terest to him, which
                        would be open and flagrant inter- ference—&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep broke in earnestly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Surely so small a matter of courtesy—if such it may be
                        called—should not stand between thee and this most pressing
                        need.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, thou hast said—if it were only a small matter of courtesy. But
                        the breach of that same small cour- tesy entails great disaster for me. Thou
                        knowest, O my Hotep, that I am betrothed to the daughter of Har-
                        hat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With great effort Hotep kept a placid face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Lady Masanath&apos; would abet him who would aid
                        Kenkenes,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so. But hear me, I pray thee, Hotep. This most rapacious
                        miscreant would hold his favor with the king. He knew I loved nMasanath, and
                        he held her out of my reach till I should consent to coun- <pb
                            id="VAA3882-369" n="361"/> tenance his advisership to my father. I
                        consented— and should I lapse, I lose Masanath.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep was on his feet by this. time, his face turned away. Rameses could not
                        guess what a tempest raged in his heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But be thou assured,&quot; the prince continued grimly,
                        &quot;that only so long as Masanath is not yet mine, shall I endure him.
                        After that he shall fall as never knave fell or so deserved to fall before.
                        Aye,—but stay, Hotep. I have not done. I have some small grain of hope for
                        this unfortunate friend of ours. The mar- riage hath been delayed. I shall
                        press my suit, and wed Masanath sooner, if she will, and Kenkenes need not
                        decay in prison—&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep did not stay longer. He bowed and departed without a word.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Out upon the man, I offered all I could,&quot; Rameses
                        muttered, but immediately he arose and hurried to the well of the
                        stairway.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hotep!&quot; he called. The scribe, half-way down, turned and
                        looked up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Return to me in an hour. Give me time to ponder and I may more
                        profitably help thee,&quot; the prince com- manded. Hotep bowed and went
                        on.</p>
                    <p>The hour was barely long enough for the smarting soul of the scribe to soothe
                        itself. Deep, indeed, his love for Kenkenes that he returned at all.
                        Masanath&apos;s name, spoken so familiarly, so boastingly, by the prince
                        was fresh outrage to his already affronted heart. It mattered not that
                        Rameses did not know. His talk of marriage with Masanath was exultation,
                        neverthe- less. Once again, Hotep flung himself on his couch and wrestled
                        with his spirit.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-370" n="362"/>
                    <p>At the end of the hour, he went once again to Ra- meses. He was calm and
                        composed, but he niade no apology for his abrupt departure, when last he was
                        there. Perhaps, however, he gained in the respect of Rameses by that lapse.
                        The blunt prince was more patient with the sincere than with the
                        diplomatic.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast said,&quot; the prince began immediately,
                        &quot;that Har-hat hath imprisoned Kenkenes till what time he shall
                        divulge the hiding-place of the Israelite?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep bowed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The fan-bearer charges him with slave-stealing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And sacrilege,&quot; the scribe added. The prince opened his
                        eyes. &quot;Aye, Kenkenes carried his beauty- love into blasphemy. He
                        executed a statue of Athor, in defiance of the sculptor&apos;s ritual.
                        For this also, Har- hat holds a heavy hand over him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A murrain on the lawless dreamer!&quot; Rameses mut- tered.
                        &quot;Is there anything more?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep shook his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He deserves his ill-luck. Mark me, now. He will not go mad with a
                        year&apos;s imprisonment, and he will profit by it. Furthermore, he can
                        not be persuaded into betraying the Israelite, if he knows how long and how
                        much he will have to endure. Once sentenced, Har-hat can add nothing more
                        thereto. Has he con- fessed?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To me, he did. I know not what he said to the Pharaoh. But the
                        Goddess Ma broodeth on the lips of Kenkenes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rameses nodded, and clapped his hands. The at- tendant that appeared he
                        ordered to bring the scribe&apos;s writing-case and implements. When the
                        servant re- <pb id="VAA3882-371" n="363"/> turned, Hotep, at a sign from
                        Rameses, prepared to write.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Write thus to the jailer at Tape:</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;By order of the crown prince, Rameses, the pris- oner,
                        Kenkenes, held for slave-stealing and sacrilege, is sentenced to
                        imprisonment for one year—&apos; &quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep lifted his pen, and looked his rebellion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Write!&apos; the prince exclaimed. &quot;I do him a kind-
                        ness, with a lesson added. Were it in my power to free him I would not—till
                        he had learned that the law is inexorable and the power of its ministers
                        supreme. Go on-&apos;at such labor as the prisoner may elect. No further
                        punishment may be added thereto.&apos; Affix my seal and send this
                        without fail. Thou canst write whatever thou wilt to Kenkenes. For the
                        Israelite, I shall not concern myself. The nearer friends to Kenkenes may
                        look to her. Mine shall be the care only to see that they are not harassed
                        by the fan- bearer. In this, I fulfil the law. Let Har-hat help
                        himself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He dropped back on his divari and Hotep slowly collected his writing
                        materials and made ready to de- part. Having finished, he lingered a
                        little.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A word further, O Rameses. Kenkenes is proud. He would liefer die
                        than suffer the humiliation of public shame. Memphis believes him dead. None
                        but thyself, Har-hat, the noble Mentu and I know of his plight. Har-hat hath
                        no call to tell it. Mentu will not; I shall not. Wilt thou keep his secret
                        also, my Prince?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Far be it from me to humiliate him publicly. Let him have a care,
                        hereafter, that he does not humiliate himself.&quot; </p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-372" n="364"/>
                    <p>&quot;I thank thee, O Rameses.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Saluting the prince, Hotep departed.</p>
                    <p>That night he wrote to Kenkenes and to Mentu, and the two messengers departed
                        ere midnight.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile Kenkenes seldom saw a human face. Food and water in red clay
                        vessels, bearing the seal of Thebes, were set inside his door by disembodied
                        hands. At intervals he saw the keeper, always attended by the inevitable
                        scribe, but the visit was a matter of inspection and rarely was the prisoner
                        addressed.</p>
                    <p>Though he grew to expect these visits, each time the bar rattled down he
                        trembled with the hope that the jailer brought him freedom. Each successive
                        disap- pointment was as acute as the last, made more poi- gnant by the
                        torturing certainty that his hopes were vain. The effect of one was not at
                        all counteracted by the other.</p>
                    <p>Some time after dawn the sun thrust a golden bar, full of motes, across the
                        door, a foot above his head. In a space the beam was withdrawn. The heat and
                        dust of the midday came, instead. Gnats wove their mazes in the narrow
                        casement that opened on the out- side world, and now and then the twitter of
                        birds sounded very close to it. Kenkenes knew how they flashed as they flew
                        in the sun. They were prodigal of freedom. At nightfall, if he stood at full
                        height against the door, he could see a thread of cooling sky with a single
                        star in its center.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-374" n="366"/>
                    <p>This was all his knowledge of the world.</p>
                    <p>Hour after hour he paced the narrow length of the cell, till the
                        circumscribed round made him dizzy. If he flung himself on his straw pallet,
                        he did not rest. The mind has no charity for the body. If there is to be no
                        mental repose it is vain to hope for physical. When the inactivity of his
                        uneasy pallet became intol- erable, he resumed his pace.</p>
                    <p>He expected the return of his messenger in twenty days after the
                        man&apos;s departure. At the expiration of that time his suspense and
                        apprehension became more and more desperate at the passing of each new day.
                        In rapid succession he accepted and rejected the thought that the messenger
                        had played him false, had been assassinated and robbed; that Meneptah had
                        re- called the signet, or had added the penalty of suspense to his
                        indorsement of Har-hat&apos;s fiat of imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>When the climax of his sensations was reached, his self-sufficiency collapsed
                        and he entered into ceaseless supplication of the gods. He vowed costly
                        sacrifices to them, adding promises of self-abnegation which be- came more
                        comprehensive as his distress increased. At the end of a month he had
                        consecrated everything at his command. Then he subsided into a numb en-
                        durance till what time his prayers should be answered.</p>
                    <p>Eight days later, about mid-afternoon, while he lay on his pallet, the door
                        was flung open and his messen- ger stood without. With a cry, Kenkenes
                        leaped to his feet and wrenched the scroll from the man&apos;s hand.
                        With unsteady fingers he ripped off the linen cover and read.</p>
                    <p>The letter was from Hotep, conveying such informa- tion regarding his
                        imprisonment as we already know. <pb id="VAA3882-375" n="367"/> It was
                        couched in the gentlest terms, and contained that essence of hope which
                        loving spirits can extract from the most desperate situation, for
                        another&apos;s sake. But for all the kindly intent of the scribe, his
                        news was none the less unhappy. The dreaded had oome to pass, and the war
                        between hope and fear was at an end. Kenkenes read the missive calmly, and
                        paid the messenger according to his promise. The jailer, who had come with
                        the man, read the sentence and bade the prisoner make his choice of
                        labor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anything, so it will but give me a glimpse of the
                        horizon,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou wilt pay dearly for thy sky,&quot; the keeper cau- tioned
                        him. &quot;The softest labor is within doors.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give me my wish according to the command of the
                        prince.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The jailer shrugged his shoulders. &quot;As thou wilt. Make ready to
                        follow the canal-workers, to-morrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When the door fell shut again, Kenkenes returned to his pallet and re-read
                        the scroll.</p>
                    <p>A year&apos;s imprisonment! The sentence defined was the sum of daily
                        shame, sorrow, homesickness and misanthropy. Shame in the proud man admits
                        of no degrees of intensity. If it exist at all, it is superlative. To this
                        was added the loss of Rachel. How little it would take to satisfy him, now
                        that she was wholly denied to his eyes! Only to look down on her again,
                        unseen, from his aery in the rocks over the valley!</p>
                    <p>Hotep had offered him hope, based on circumstan- tial evidence and fact.
                        Har-hat could not add to his sentence. That was the only indisputable cheer
                        he could give. But would Rameses stay the chief ad- viser&apos;s hand,
                        seeing that the winning of Masanath <pb id="VAA3882-376" n="368"/> depended
                        on the prince&apos;s neutrality, as Hotep had ex- plained? If Rachel
                        fled to Mentu, as Kenkenes had bidden her, could the murket protect her,
                        even at his own peril? Might not the heavy hand of the powerful favorite
                        fall also on the head&apos; of the king&apos;s architect? Wherein
                        was the murket more immune than his son? Rachel&apos;s destruction
                        seemed to be decreed by the Ha- thors.</p>
                    <p>Such was his thought, and he raised himself to curse the Seven Sisters, and
                        growing reckless, he in- cluded the unhelpful gods in his maledictions. The
                        blasphemy comforted him strangely, and he persisted till his heated brain
                        was cooled.</p>
                    <p>At dawn the next day he laid aside his fillet of gold, his trappings and
                        noble dress, and donning the kilt or shenti of the prisoners, was handcuffed
                        to another malefactor and taken forth to the sun-white plain between Thebes
                        Diospolis and the Arabian hills, to labor in the canals of the nome.</p>
                    <p>Here, looking continually upon crime, brutality and misery, he asked himself
                        the divine motive in creating man, and having found no answer, he began to
                        ques- tion man&apos;s debt to the gods.</p>
                    <p>He was going the way of all the weak in faith. He had pleaded with his
                        deities, and they had not heard him. He asked himself what he had done to
                        deserve their disfavor. The sacrilege of Athor was too slight an offense—if
                        offense it were—and here again he paused, set his teeth and swore that he
                        had done no wrong and the god or man that accused him was im- potent, unjust
                        and ignorant. Once again he asked himself what he had done to deserve
                        ill-use at the hands of the Pantheon. They had turned a deaf ear <pb
                            id="VAA3882-377" n="369"/> to him, and why should he render them further
                        hom- age? The doctrine of divine Love, displayed through chastisement, was
                        not in the Osirian creed.</p>
                    <p>His eyes grew bold through rebellion and he at- tacked the wild
                        inconsistencies of the faith with the destructive instrument of reason. Each
                        deduction led him on, fascinated, in his apostasy. Each crumbling tenet
                        started another toward ruin. Finding no sound obstacle to stay him, he fell
                        with avidity to rending the Pantheon.</p>
                    <p>But he found no cheer nor any hope that day when he told himself bitterly,
                        &quot;There is no God.&quot;</p>

                    <p>The court was gone and Masanath was making the most of each day of her
                        freedom. Memphis was in a state of apathy, worn out by revel and emptied of
                        her luminaries. Ta-meri, intoxicated with the impor- tance of her position
                        as lady-in-waiting to the queen, had departed with her husband, the
                        cup-bearer. Jo had returned to her home in On, with an ache in her brave
                        little heart that outweighed even Masanath&apos;s for heaviness. The
                        last of Seti&apos;s lover-like behavior toward her dated back to a time
                        before the court had gone to Thebes—long, long ago.</p>
                    <p>Ta-user, also, had gone, but the fan-bearer&apos;s daugh- ter did not
                        regret her. The other ladies who re- mained in Memphis, frightened at the
                        loftiness of Masanath&apos;s future, were uneasy in her presence and
                        seemed more inclined to bend the knee before her than to continue the
                        girlish companionship that had once been between them.</p>
                    <p>So she must entertain herself, if she were enter- tained at all.</p>
                    <p>For a time after the departure of Meneptah, Masa- nath had given herself up
                        to tears and gloom. When she had worn out her grief, the elastic spirit of
                        youth <pb id="VAA3882-379" n="371"/> reasserted itself and once again she
                        was as cheerful as she felt it becoming to be under the circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The fan-bearer had taken a house for his daughter&apos;s use, during her
                        year of solitary residence, and her own servants, a lady-in-waiting, the
                        devoted Nari, Pepi, a courier and upper servant, lean, brown and taciturn,
                        and several slaves, both black and white, had been left with her. The older
                        daughter of the fan-bearer lived with her husband in Pelusium. Her home
                        could have been an asylum for the younger, but Masanath was determined to
                        know one year of absolute inde- pendence before she entered the long bondage
                        of queenship.</p>
                    <p>It was now the middle of June, the height of Egyp- tian summer. In a little
                        space the marshes, which had been, for eight months, favorite haunts of
                        fowlers, would be submerged, for the inundation was not far away.</p>
                    <p>Masanath would hunt for wild-duck and marsh-hen, while there was yet
                        time.</p>
                    <p>It was an hour after sunrise. Her raft, built of papyrus, was boat-shaped and
                        graceful as a swan. Pepi was at the long-handled sweep in the stern. Ma-
                        sanath sat in the middle, which was heaped with nets, throw-sticks, and bows
                        and arrows. A pair of decoy birds, tame and unfettered, stood near her,
                        craning their small heads, puzzled at the movement of the boat which was
                        undecipherable since they were motionless. Nari sat in the prow, her hands
                        folded, her face quite expressionless. The service of the day was out of the
                        routine, but as a good servant, she was capable of adapting herself to the
                        change.</p>
                    <p>The little craft darted away from the painted land- <pb id="VAA3882-380"
                            n="372"/> ing for pleasure boats, and reaching midstream, was turned
                        toward the north. The current caught it and swept it along like a leaf.</p>
                    <p>As they passed the stone wharf at Masaarah, Nari looked toward the quarries
                        with a show of interest on her face. She even caught her breath to speak.
                        Ma- sanath noted her animation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it, Nari?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Naught but a bit of gossip that came to mine ears, last night, and
                        the sight of Masaarah urged me to tell it again. It is said the Hebrews of
                        these quarries rose against the new driver and drove him out of the camp,
                        crying, &apos;Return us our Atsu, return us our
                        Atsu.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What folly!&quot; Masanath exclaimed. &quot;If they had
                        been the host which crowds Goshen to her bounds, it might serve. But this
                        handful in rebellion against Egypt! The military of the Memphian nome will
                        crush them as if they had been so many ants.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; the serving-woman admitted. &quot;The sol-
                        dier I had it from, said that the city commandant would move against them by
                        noon this day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods help them!&quot; Pepi put in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy prayer is too late, Pepi,&quot; Masanath answered.
                        &quot;The gods should have cautioned them ere they took the step. And
                        yet,&quot; she continued, musing, &quot;straits may become so sore
                        that aught but endurance is wel- come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her servants looked at her and at each other, under- standing.</p>
                    <p>Nari went on:</p>
                    <p>&quot;But the soldier told me further that the Israelites had spent the
                        night chanting and dancing before their <pb id="VAA3882-381" n="373"/> God,
                        and it seems from this spot that the quarries are empty. They do not fear,
                        boasting their God&apos;s care.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath shook her head. &quot;He must look to them at once, ere the
                        soldiery fall upon them. His time for aid is short,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>A silence fell, and the raft passed below Masaarah. Again Nari spoke, proving
                        that she had heard and thought upon the last words of her mistress.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are not the gods omnipotent and everywhere?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, so hast thou been taught, Nari.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Our gods, and the gods of every nation like them?&quot; the
                        serving-woman persisted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods of Egypt are so, and each nation boasts its gods equally
                        potent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mayhap the Hebrews&apos; God will help them,&quot; Nari
                        ventured.</p>
                    <p>Masanath was silent for a moment. &quot;He hath de- serted them for
                        long,&quot; she said at last, &quot;but they are hard-pressed.
                        Mayhap their loud supplications will reach Him in His retreat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They boast that He hath returned.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let Him prove Himself,&quot; Masanath insisted stoutly.</p>
                    <p>When next she spoke there was no hint of the past serious talk in her
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A pest on the ban,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Look at the
                        Marsh of the Discontented Soul. It fairly swarms with teal and coot, and see
                        the snipe on the sand.&quot; She stood up and watched the sandy strip
                        they were near- ing. They were a goodly distance out from the shore, but
                        Pepi poled nearer midstream. &quot;The pity of it,&quot; she sighed;
                        &quot;but I doubt not the place swarms with crocodile,
                        also.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-382" n="374"/>
                    <p>She sat down again, and looked at the decoy birds. Their timidity had
                        increased into actual fear. Masa- nath reached a soothing hand toward one of
                        them and it fled. The motion of the poling-arm of Pepi frightened it again,
                        and with a flirt of its wings it retreated toward Masanath.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stop a moment, Pepi,&quot; she said. &quot;Let me quiet
                        this frightened thing. I can not fathom its terror.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The unquiet soul, my Lady,&quot; Nari whispered, in awe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Strange that the gods gifted the creatures with keener sight than
                        men,&quot; Masanath answered, some- what disturbed. She moved toward the
                        bird, talking softly, but the persuasion was as useless as if the decoy had
                        been a wild thing. At the nearer approach of the small hand it took wings
                        and flew. The mate followed, unhesitating. The shining distance toward the
                        west swallowed them up.</p>
                    <p>The trio on the raft looked at one another.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, now, saw ye the like before?&quot; Masanath exclaimed, the
                        tone of her voice divided between as- tonishment and irritation at the loss
                        of her pets.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let us leave this vicinity,&quot; Pepi said, suiting the action
                        to the word, &quot;it is unholy.&quot; He seized the sweep and drove
                        the raft about, poling with wide strokes. At that moment, a cry, which was
                        more of a hoarse whisper, broke from his lips.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Body of Osiris! The river! the river!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath leaned on one hand and looked over the side of the raft. With a
                        bound and a shivering cry, Nari was cowering beside her, the little craft
                        tossing on the waves at the force of the leap. Instantly, Pepi was at her
                        other side, on his knees, praying and shak- <pb id="VAA3882-383" n="375"/>
                        ing. And together the trio huddled, but only one, Masanath, was brave enough
                        to watch what was hap- pening.</p>
                    <p>From the bottom of the Nile a turbid convection was taking place, as if the
                        river silt had been stirred up, but the turning current was assuming a dull
                        red tinge. The action had been rapid. Already the stain had predominated,
                        streaks of clear water, only here and there, clarifying the opaque coloring.
                        The boat rode half its depth in red, the paddle dripped red, the splashes of
                        water within on the bottom were red, the sun shone broadly into the
                        mirroring red, a sliding, reeking red! A lavender foam broke its bubbles
                        against the drifting raft and a tepid, invisible vapor, like a moist breath,
                        exhaled from the ensanguined surface.</p>
                    <p>Schools of fish, struggling and leaping, filled the space immediately above
                        the water, and cumbered the raft with a writhing mass. Numberless crocodiles
                        bounded into the air, braying, snorting, rending one an- other and churning
                        the river into froth by their hide- ous battle. Dwellers of the deep water
                        drifted into the upper tide—monsters of the muck at the Nile bot- tom,
                        turtles, huge crawfish, water-newts, spotted snakes, curious bleached
                        creatures that had never seen the day, great drifts of insects, with frogs,
                        tad- poles—everything of aquatic animate life, came up dead or dying
                        terribly. Along either bank water- buffalo and wallowing swine, which had
                        been in the pools near the river, clambered ponderously, snorting at every
                        step.</p>
                    <p>Vessels were putting about and flying for the shore. From the prow of one
                        tall boat, with distended sails, a <pb id="VAA3882-384" n="376"/> figure was
                        seen to spring high and disappear under the red torrent. Rioting crews of
                        river-men fought for first landing at the accessible places on the banks.
                        Memphis shrieked and the pastures became compounds of wild beasts that
                        deafened heaven with their savage bellowing.</p>
                    <p>Pepi and Nari had no thought of saving themselves. It was Masanath who must
                        save them. They clung to her, dragging her down with their arms when she
                        attempted to rise. Bereft of reason, they made the liquid echoes of the
                        river ring with wild cries of mortal terror.</p>
                    <p>Masanath had sufficient instinct left to urge her to fly. With a mighty
                        effort she shook off her servants and sprang to the sweep. Instantly they
                        made to fol- low her, but she threatened them with a hunting- stick. The
                        combined weight of the three in the stern would have swamped the frail
                        boat.</p>
                    <p>Seizing the sweep she poled with superhuman strength toward the nearest
                        shore—the Marsh of the Discontented Soul. If she remembered the spirit, she
                        forgot her fear of it. Any terror was acceptable other than isolation on
                        this mile-wide torrent of blood.</p>
                    <p>The raft grounded, and as a viscous wash of red lapped across it, she leaped
                        forth, landing with both feet in the horror. She floundered out and crying
                        to her servants to follow her, fled like a mad thing up the sandy stretch
                        toward the distant wall of rock.</p>
                    <p>The boat, lightened of her weight, received a back- ward thrust as she
                        leaped, and drifted out of the reeds. The heavy current caught it and swept
                        it across the smitten river to the Memphian shore. It bore two insensible
                        figures.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-385" n="377"/>
                    <p>Masanath ran, thinking only to leave fhe ghastly flood behind. Her wet
                        over-dress flapped about her ankles. It, too, was stained, and she tore if
                        off as she ran. Ahead of her was a sagging limestone wall, with no gap, but
                        Masanath, hardly sane, would have dashed herself against it, if hands had
                        not detained her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Blood! Blood!&quot; she shrieked. &quot;Holy Ptah save
                        us!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Peace!&quot; some one made answer. &quot;God is with
                        us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The voice was calm and reassuring, the hands firm. Here, then, was one who
                        was strong and unafraid, and therefore, a safe refuge. No longer called upon
                        to care for herself, Masanath fell into the arms of the brave unknown and
                        ceased to remember.</p>
                    <p>Consciousness returned to her slowly and incom- pletely. Horror had dazed
                        her, and her surroundings, but faintly discovered in an all-enveloping
                        gloom, were not conducive to mental repose and clearness. She became aware,
                        first, that she was somewhere hidden from the sunshine and beyond reach of
                        the strange odor from the Nile.</p>
                    <p>Next she realized that she was sheltered in a cave; that slender lines of
                        white daylight sifted through the interstices of a door; that a lamp was
                        burning some- where behind a screen; that a hairy thing sat in a cor- ner
                        and looked at her with half-human eyes, and that, as she shrank at the
                        sight, the warm support under her head moved and a fair face, framed with
                        golden hair, bent over her.</p>
                    <p>Then her eyes, becoming clearer as her recollec- tion returned, wandered away
                        toward the walls of her shelter. They had been hewn by hands. There was an
                        opening in one side, leading into another and a <pb id="VAA3882-386" n="378"
                        /> darker crypt. Was not this a tomb? She was in the Tomb of the
                        Discontented Soul! Terrified, she strug- gled to gain her feet and fly, but
                        the awful memory of the plague without returned to her overwhelmingly.
                        Gentle hands restrained her, and the same voice that had sought to soothe
                        her before, continued its soft comforting now.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art safe and sheltered,&quot; she heard. &quot;No evil
                        shall befall thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Was this the spirit of the tomb? If so, it was most lovely and kindly. But a
                        solemn voice issued out of the dark cell beyond. This was the spirit, of a
                        surety. She cowered against her fair-haired protector and shuddered. But the
                        maiden answered the voice in a strange tongue. Masanath would have known it
                        to be Hebrew, had she been composed. But now it was mystic, cabalistic.</p>
                    <p>Presently the maiden addressed her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Deborah asks after thee, Lady. How shall I tell her thou findest
                        thyself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I can not tell,&quot; Masanath answered. &quot;What has
                        happened? Is it true or did I go mad?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Israelite smoothed her hair. &quot;It is a plague,&quot; she
                        said.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Then the hand of Amenti is on us,&quot; the Egyptian
                        shuddered. &quot;Whither shall we flee?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ye can not flee from the One God,&quot; the voice from the
                        crypt said grimly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but what have I done to vex the gods?&quot; Ma- sanath
                        insisted. &quot;O let me go hence. Where are my servants?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is better for thee to bide here,&quot; the voice went <pb
                            id="VAA3882-387" n="379"/> on relentlessly. &quot;For outside the
                        sheltering neighbor- hood of the chosen people, the hand of the outraged God
                        shall overtake Egypt and scorch her throat with thirst and make her veins
                        congeal for want of water.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath gained her feet, crying out wildly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;My servants! Where are they? Let me forth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Israelite put an assuring arm about her. &quot;Thou wilt not dare to
                        face the Nile again,&quot; she warned. &quot;Stay with
                        us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To starve! To perish of thirst! To die of pes- tilence! The gods
                        have left us. We are undone!&quot; &quot;Aye, the gods have left
                        you,&quot; the voice continued harshly. &quot;Ye are given over to
                        the vengeance of the God of Abraham. Howl, Egypt! Rend thyself and cover thy
                        head with ashes. Thy destruction is but begun. For a hundred years thou hast
                        oppressed Is- rael. Now is the hour of the children of God!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath wrung her hands, but the voice went on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;As the Nile flows, so hath the blood of Israel been wasted by the
                        hand of Egypt. Now shall the God of Abraham drain her veins, even so, drop
                        for drop. For the despoiling of Israel shall her pastures and stables be
                        filled with stricken beasts—for the heavy hand of the Pharaohs shall the
                        heavens thunder and scourges fall. And the wrath of God shall cool not till
                        Egypt is a waste, shorn of her corn and her vineyards and her riches, and
                        foul with dead men.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Nothing could have been more vindictive than this disembodied voice. Masanath
                        thrust her fingers through her hair, and drawing her elbows forward,
                        sheltered her face with them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When have I offended against the Hebrew?&quot; she <pb
                            id="VAA3882-388" n="380"/> cried, sick with terror. &quot;Why should
                        your awful God destroy the innocent and the friend of Israel among the
                        people of Egypt?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel, who had stood beside her, with an increas- ing cloud on her face, now
                        spoke in Hebrew. There was mild protest in her tones.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The plague will pass,&quot; the voice from the inner crypt
                        continued. &quot;Seven days will it endure, no more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Deborah is mystic,&quot; Rachel added softly, &quot;and is
                        gifted with prophetic eyes. Much hath she suffered at Egypt&apos;s
                        hands, and her tongue grows harsh when she speaks of the
                        oppression.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but let me go,&quot; Masanath begged. &quot;Where are
                        my servants? Came they hot after me when I fled?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;None followed thee, Lady, and thy raft went adrift.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me out of this hideous place, then, for I must seek them. They
                        may be dead.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her tone was imperious, and. Rachel, silently obedi- ent, led her to the
                        entrance and pushed aside the door. Instantly the terrible turmoil over
                        Egypt smote upon Ber ears; next she saw the Nile, moving slowly, black where
                        its clear surfaces had been green, scarlet and froth-ridden where the sun
                        had shone upon transpar- ent ripples and white foam; after that, the strange
                        odor came to her, recalling the smell of the altars, but now magnified till
                        it was overpoweringly strong. She sickened and turned away.</p>
                    <p>Setting the door in place, Rachel led her back into a corner of the outer
                        chamber and laid her down on the matting there.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-389" n="381"/>
                    <p>&quot;The Lord God will care for thy servants. Fret thyself no further,
                        but be content here until the hor- ror shall pass. I shall attend thee, so
                        thou shalt not miss their ministrations.&quot; The Israelite spoke with
                        gentle authority, smoothing the dark hair of her guest. Command in the form
                        of persuasion is doubly effec- tive, since it induces while it compels.
                        Masanath was most amenable to this manner of entreaty, since it dis- armed
                        her pride while it governed her impulses. Thus, though her inclination urged
                        against it, she ate when the Israelite brought her a bit of cold fowl and a
                        beaker of wine at midday and again at sunset. And at night, she slept
                        because the Israelite told her she was safe and bade her close her eyes.</p>
                    <p>But once she awoke. The lamp burned behind a wooden amphora rack and the
                        interior of the stone chamber was not dark. The voice in the inner cham- ber
                        was still and the human-eyed beast in the corner was now only a small hairy
                        roll. In the silence she would have been dismayed, but close beside her sat
                        the Israelite. One hand toyed absently with the golden rings of a collar
                        about her throat. The face was averted, the hair unplaited and falling in a
                        shower of bright ripples over the bosom and d6wn the back. The beauty of the
                        picture impressed itself on Masa- nath, in spite of her drowsiness. But as
                        well as the beauty, the dejection in the droop of the head, the unhappiness
                        on the face, were apparent even in the dusk. Here was sorrow—the kind of
                        sorrow that eveh the benign night might not subdue. Masanath was well
                        acquainted with such vigils as the golden Is- raelite seemed to be
                        keeping.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-390" n="382"/>
                    <p>Her love-lorn heart vas stirred. She spoke to Rachel softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come hither and lie down by me,&quot; she said. &quot;I am
                        afraid and thou art unhappy. Give me some of thy courage and I will sorrow
                        with thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Israelite smiled sadly and obeyed.</p>
                    <p>It was dawn when the fan-bearer&apos;s daughter awoke again.</p>
                    <p>The door had been set aside, and on the rock threshold a squat copper lamp
                        was sending up periodic eruptions of dense white vapor. Rachel was feeding
                        the ember of the cotton wick with bits of chopped root. The breeze from the
                        river blew the fumes back into the cave, filling the dark recesses with a
                        fresh and pungent odor.</p>
                    <p>Masanath, wondering and remembering, raised her head to look through the
                        opening. Day was broad over Egypt, and the turmoil had subsided. The silence
                        was heavy. But the Nile was still a wallowing tor- rent of red.</p>
                    <p>She sank back and drew the wide sleeves of her dress over her face. Rachel
                        put the lamp aside, set the door in place and came to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art better for thy long sleep,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;Now, if thou canst bear, as well, with the meager food this house
                        affords, the plague will not vex thee sorely.&quot; Then, in obedience
                        to the Israelite&apos;s offer, Masanath sat up and suffered Rachel to
                        dress her hair and bathe her tiny hands and face with a solution of weak
                        white wine.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The water which we had stored with us is also corrupted. I fear we
                        shall thirst, if we have but wine to wet our lips,&quot; Rachel
                        explained.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-391" n="383"/>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost not tell me that ye abide in this place?&quot; the
                        fan-bearer&apos;s daughter asked, taking the piece of fowl and hard
                        bread which Rachel offered her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so,&quot; Rachel responded after a little silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Holy Isis! guests of a spirit! What a ghastly hos- pice for women!
                        How came ye here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>For a moment there was silence, so marked that Masanath ceased her dainty
                        feeding and drew back a little.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are ye lepers?&quot; she asked in a frightened voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, we are fugitives,&quot; Rachel answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fugitives! What strait brought you to seek such asylum as
                        this?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again a speaking pause.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who art thou, Lady?&quot; Rachel asked, at last.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am Masanath, daughter of Har-hat, fan-bearer to the
                        Pharaoh.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And thou art a friend of the oppressed?&quot; the Israel- ite
                        continued.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is my boast before the gods,&quot; the Egyptian an- swered
                        with dignity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am Rachel, of Israel, daughter of Maai; and I have fled from
                        shame. In all Egypt, this is the one and only refuge for such as I. If my
                        hiding-place were published, no help could save me from the de- spoiler. My
                        one protector is she who lies within. She is my foster-mother, old and ill
                        from abuse at the hands of brutal servants. Thou hast my
                        story.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As Rachel ceased, Deborah called from within.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is more,&quot; she said. &quot;Come hither. I am
                        moved to tell thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath obeyed with hesitation and, pausing in the doorway of the inner
                        chamber, heard the story of <pb id="VAA3882-392" n="384"/> the Israelites.
                        Great was her perplexity and her sor- row when she heard the name of
                        Kenkenes spoken calmly and without grief. They did not know he was dead! She
                        held her peace till the story was done. How much more would her heart have
                        been tortured could the old woman have given her the name of the offending
                        noble! Instead, all unsuspecting, she heard the story of Har-hat&apos;s
                        wrong-doing with now and then an exclamation of indignation, condemning him
                        heartily in her soul.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The time for the Egyptian&apos;s return is long past, but he
                        will come soon,&quot; Deborah concluded.</p>
                    <p>Masanath slowly turned her head and looked at Rachel. This, then, was the
                        love of that dear, dead artist, for whom Memphis mourned and had ceased to
                        wait. How doubly grievous his loss, for Rachel was undone thereby! How
                        heart-breaking to see her wait for him who would come no more! Masanath
                        choked back her tears and said, when she was com- posed again:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ye need not molder in this cave. I can hide you in
                        Memphis.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, we will await him here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But the Nile will be upon your refuge in three weeks. Ye would
                        starve if ye drowned not,&quot; the Egyp- tian protested earnestly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It may be we shall not wait so long,&quot; Rachel put in.</p>
                    <p>Masanath looked at her while she thought busily. &quot;If I tell it, I
                        break a heart. But if they bide here, they die. None other will come to them
                        by chance or on purpose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would not risk it,&quot; she answered. Returning to <pb
                            id="VAA3882-393" n="385"/> the pallet of matting she finished her
                        breakfast in silence. After a little sigh she glanced at the wine in one of
                        the small amphorae which Rachel had brought to her as a drinking-cup.
                        &quot;Mayhap the plague is past,&quot; she said, hinting,
                        &quot;and I am athirst.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel took up another jar and went forth. The hairy creature in the corner,
                        tethered to the amphora rack, slipped his collar and followed her.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the Israelite was gone, Masanath went into the inner chamber.
                        Standing by the old woman, who lay ,upon a mattress, set on the top of the
                        sar- cophagus, she said hurriedly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ye may not remain here. Kenkenes is known to me and he will not
                        return.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost not tell me he was false to us,&quot; Deborah
                        exclaimed. &quot;Nay, I will not believe it,&quot; she declared.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, he was the soul of honor, but he is dead.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dead!&quot; the old woman cried, catching at her dress.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hush! Tell her not!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, thou art right. Tell her not! But—but how did he
                        die?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;By drowning. His boat was discovered battered and overturned among
                        the wharf-piling at Memphis, some weeks agone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old woman was silent for a moment and then she shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is a resourceful youth and he may have pro- cured another boat
                        and set this one adrift to deceive his enemies. Yet, the time has been so
                        long, it may be; it may be.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;None in Memphis doubts it. His father hath given him up and his
                        house and his people are in mourning. But we may not lose this moment in
                        surmises. Wilt . <pb id="VAA3882-394" n="386"/> thou go with me into
                        Memphis—if this sending is withdrawn?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is no other choice,&quot; Deborah answered after some
                        pondering. &quot;Kenkenes offered us refuge with his father-alas! that
                        the young man should die!&quot; After shaking her head and muttering to
                        herself in her own tongue, she went on. &quot;But Rachel hesitated to
                        accept, at first from maiden shyness, though now she hath a secret fear, I
                        doubt not, that the Egyptian may have played her false. The sorry news must
                        be told her ere she would go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, keep it from her yet a while. Tell her not now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How may we?&quot; Deborah asked helplessly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Listen. I am a householder in Memphis for a year. The place is
                        secure from much visiting and only my trusted servants are there. They will
                        not tell her- none else will-thou and I shall keep discreet tongues, but if
                        the fact creep out, in the way of such things, we need not accuse ourselves
                        of killing her hope. As thou sayest, the young man may not be dead. But let
                        us not risk anything.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And furthermore,&quot; she caught up the line of her talk
                        before Deborah could answer, &quot;I may as well work good out of an
                        evil I can not escape. I am be- trothed to the heir of the crown of
                        Egypt—&quot;</p>
                    <p>Deborah flung up her hand, drawing away in her amazement.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou! A coming queen over the proud land of Mizraim—a guest in the
                        retreat of enslaved Israel!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath bent her head. &quot;Ye, in your want and distress, are not more
                        poor or wretched than I.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-395" n="387"/>
                    <p>The old Israelite&apos;s brilliant eyes glittered in the dark.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Thou art not a
                        slave—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, am I not?&quot; Masanath rejoined swiftly. &quot;A
                        slave, a chattel, doubly enthralled! But enough of this. I would have said
                        that if I wed the prince, I can ask Rachel&apos;s freedom at his
                        hands.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So thou canst,&quot; Deborah said eagerly—but before she could
                        continue, Rachel appeared at the outer open- ing, the amphora held by one
                        arm, the ape by the other. Her face was alight with a smile that seemed
                        danger- ously akin to tears.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here is water, clean and fresh, but the Nile is bank-full of the
                        plague. It was Anubis that showed me!&quot; She lowered the amphora into
                        the rack and took up the linen band the ape had slipped. &quot;Oh, it is
                        ungrateful to tie thee, Anubis,&quot; she went on, &quot;but thou
                        must not betray us, thou good creature.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was Anubis!&quot; Deborah repeated inquiringly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye. Not once did the hideous sight disturb him. He was athirst and
                        he made me a well in the sand with his paws. See how Jehovah hath sent us
                        succor by humble hands.&quot; She stroked the hairy grotesque and
                        tethered him reluctantly.</p>
                    <p>Deborah muttered under her breath. &quot;I liked the creature not, since
                        he made me think of the abomina- ble idolatries of Mizraim, but he hath
                        served the op- pressed. He shall be more endurable to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The night fell and the dawn came again and again, but holy Hapi was defiled.
                        Hour by hour the fum- ing lamp was set before the entrance, the door was put
                        a little aside, that the entering air might be puri- fied for those within.
                        When the aromatic was ex- <pb id="VAA3882-396" n="388"/> hausted, Rachel
                        sought for the root once more, among the herbs at the river-bank; for the
                        atmosphere, un- sweetened, was beyond endurance.</p>
                    <p>Never a boat appeared on the water, nor was any human being seen abroad.
                        Egypt retired to her dark- est corner and shuddered.</p>
                    <p>But after the seven days were fulfilled, the horror on the waters was gone.
                        It went as miasma is dis- pelled by thesun and wind—as pestilence is killed
                        by the frost—unseen, unprotesting. The lifting of the plague was as awesome
                        as its coming, but it was not horrible. That was the only difference. Egypt
                        re- joiced, but she trembled nevertheless and went about timidly.</p>
                    <p>The Israelite and the Egyptian carried the punt, the boat of Khafra and
                        Sigur, and launched it on the clean waters. Then they prepared themselves
                        and Deborah and Anubis for a journey, and ere they de- parted, Masanath, at
                        Rachel&apos;s bidding, wrote with a soft soapstone upon the rock over
                        the portal of the tomb, the whereabouts of its whilom dwellers:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Her, whom thou seekest, thou wilt find at the man- sion of Har-hat
                        in the city.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At sunset, Rachel, all unsuspecting, was sheltered in the house of her
                        enemy.</p>
                    <p>Masanath&apos;s servants had sought for her, frantically and without
                        system or method. Pepi and Nari had been saved by the gods. They did not
                        know where she had gone, and nothing human or divine could have driven them
                        over the Nile to search for her in the Arabian hills. And for that reason
                        likewise, they did not notify Har-hat of his daughter&apos;s loss. The
                            <pb id="VAA3882-397" n="389"/> messenger would have had to cross the
                        smitten river.</p>
                    <p>They intended to send for the fan-bearer, but they waited for the plague to
                        lift. When it was gone, Ma- sanath returned to them.</p>

                            HEART&quot;</hi></head>
                    <p>The Nile rose and fell and the seasons shifted until eight months had passed.
                        The period was inconsider- able, but its events had never been equaled in a
                        like space, or a generation, or a whole dynasty, or in all the history of
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p> When the ancient Hebrew shepherd from Midian first demanded audience with
                        Meneptah, Egypt was autocrat of the earth and mistress- of the seas. Her
                        name was Glory and Perpetual Life and her substance was all the fullness of
                        the earth and the treasures thereof. But eight months after the Hebrew shep-
                        herd had gone forth from that first audience, how had the mighty fallen! She
                        was stripped of her groves and desolated in her wheat-fields; her gardens
                        were naked, her vineyards were barren, and the vultures grew fat on the dead
                        in her pastures. About the thrice-fortified walls of her cities her gaunt
                        husband- men were camped, pensioners upon the granaries of the king. Her
                        commerce had stagnated because she had no goods to barter; her society
                        ceased to revel, for her people were called upon to preserve themselves. Her
                        arts were forgotten; only religion held its own and that from very fear.
                        Egypt was on her knees, but the gods were aghast and helpless in the face of
                            <pb id="VAA3882-399" n="391"/> the hideous power of the unsubstantial,
                        unimaged God of Israel.</p>
                    <p>Never had a monarch been forced to meet such con- ditions, but in all the
                        mighty line of Pharaohs no fee- bler king than Meneptah could have faced
                        them. In treating with the issue he had fretted and fumed, promised and
                        retracted, temporized with the Hebrew mystic or stormed at him, hesitated
                        and resolved, and reconsidered and deferred while his realm descended into
                        the depths of ruin and despair.</p>
                    <p>It would seem that the dire misfortunes would have pressed the timid monarch
                        into immediate submission. But a glance at conditions may explain the cause
                        of his obduracy.</p>
                    <p>At this period in theological chronology, human at- tributes for the first
                        time were eliminated from the character of a god. Moses depicted the first
                        purely divine deity. Omnipotence was ascribed to the gods, but Pantheism
                        being full of paradoxes, the gods were not omnipotent. Loud as were the
                        panegyrics of the devout, the devout recognized the limitations of their
                        divinities. None had ever dreamed of a deity that was actually omnipotent,
                        actually infinite. Meneptah measured the God of Israel by his own gods.
                        Further- more, the miracles did not amaze him as they appalled Egypt. He was
                        exceedingly superstitious; in his eye the most ordinary natural phenomenon
                        was a demon- stration of the occult. No matter that the advanced science of
                        his time explained rainfall, unusual heat or cold, over-fruitful or
                        unproductive years, pestilence and sudden death, eclipses, comets and
                        meteors,—he believed them to be the direct results of sorcery. Ca- lamitous
                        as the effects may have been upon other peo- <pb id="VAA3882-400" n="392"/>
                        pig, he had ever escaped harm from these sources. It was not strange that in
                        time he ceased to fear miracles, and the demonstrations of Moses were not so
                        terrify- ing, inasmuch as they did not greatly affect him.</p>
                    <p>His horses died, but Arabia was near to replenish his stables; the pests
                        annoyed him, but his servants fended them from him; the blains troubled him,
                        but his court physicians were able and gave him relief; the thunders
                        frightened him, but his fright passed with the storm. Whenever the sendings
                        became unendura- ble he had but to yield to gain a respite, and then he
                        forgot the experience in a day. Meanwhile he ate, slept and walked in the
                        same luxury he had known in happier years.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, Meneptah neither realized his peril nor was personally much
                        aggrieved by the, troublous times.</p>
                    <p>It did not occur to him that all the people of his realm were not sheltered
                        against the plagues by wealth and many servants. He could not understand why
                        Egypt should be restive under the same afflictions that he had borne with
                        fortitude. Summoning all evidence from his point of view, he was able to
                        present to him- self a case of personal persecution and ill-use. The Hebrews
                        belonged to him, and because he held them their God afflicted Egypt. Egypt
                        complained and would have him sacrifice his private property, his slaves,
                        for its sake. To the peevish king the demand was unreasonable. Yet he was
                        not extraordinary in his behavior. Unselfishness was not an attribute of
                        ancient kings.</p>
                    <p>Meneptah was a man that wished to be swayed. He craved approbation and was
                        helpless without an <pb id="VAA3882-401" n="393"/> abettor. His puny ideas
                        had to be championed-by another before they became fixed convictions. After
                        the plague&apos; of locusts, the Hebrew question reached serious
                        proportions. Har-hat had estranged most of the ministers, and in his strait
                        Meneptah felt vaguely and for the first time that he needed the acquiescence
                        of others in addition to the fap-bearer&apos;s ready concord.</p>
                    <p>One early morning, in a corridor leading from the entrance, he met Hotep. A
                        sudden impulse urged him to consult his scribe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where hast thou been?&quot; he asked, noticing Hotep&apos;s
                        street dress.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To the temple, O Son of Ptah.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What hast thou to ask of the gods that thy king can not give
                        thee?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep hesitated, and the color rushed into his cheeks. The Hathors tortured
                        him with an opportunity he dared not seize. How could he ask for
                        Masanath?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I went to pray for that which all Egyptians crave at this hour-the
                        succor of Egypt,&quot; he said, instead.</p>
                    <p>Meneptah signed his scribe to follow him to a seat near by.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why may I not require of thee the services of a higher
                        minister?&quot; he began, after he had seated him- self. &quot;Never
                        hast thou failed me, and I can not say so much of the great nobles above
                        thee. Serve me well in this, Hotep, and thou mayest take the place of some
                        one of these.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me but serve thee,&quot; the scribe returned plac- idly;
                        &quot;that is reward in itself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou knowest,&quot; the king began, plunging into the heart of
                        the question, &quot;that I yielded to these ravening wolves, Mesu and
                        Aaron. I have consented <pb id="VAA3882-402" n="394"/> to release the
                        Israelites. But other thought hath come to me in the night. Thou knowest
                        that no evil hath be- fallen the land of Goshen. Har-hat explaineth this
                        strange thing by the location of the strip. The Nile toucheth it not and
                        rains fall there. Furthermore the winds blow differently in that district,
                        and withal the hand of Rannu of the harvests hath sheltered it. It may be,
                        but to me it seemeth that the Hebrew sorcerer hath cast a protecting spell
                        over the spot. But what- ever the cause, the race of churls and their riches
                        have escaped misfortune. Thinkest thou not, good Hotep, that,-if they must
                        go, we may by right require their flocks of them to replenish the pastures
                        of Egypt?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Surely the Hathors were exploiting themselves this day. Another opportunity
                        for good and what wguld come of it? Hotep knew the man with whom he dealt.
                        Still it were a sin to slight even an unprofitable chance that seemed to
                        offer alleviation for Egypt. He would proceed cautiously and do his
                        best.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be the little lamp trimmed never so brightly, O Son of Ptah, it may
                        not help the sun. Thou art mon- arch, I am thy slave. How can I mold thee,
                        my King?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Others have swayed me, thou modest man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In that hour when thou wast swayed, O Meneptah, another than
                        thyself ruled over Egypt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meneptah looked in amazement at his scribe. He had never considered the
                        influence of Har-hat in that light, but, by the gods, it seemed strangely
                        correct. He straightened himself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be thou assured, Hotep, that I weigh right well whatever counsel
                        mine advisers offer me before I in- dorse it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-403" n="395"/>
                    <p>Hotep bowed. &quot;That I know. And for that reason do I hesitate to give
                        thee my little thoughts. It would hurt the man in me to see them thrust
                        aside.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou evadest,&quot; Meneptah contended smiling.
                        &quot;Wherefore?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because, O King, I should advise against thine in-
                        clinations.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wherefore?&quot; Meneptah demanded again, this time with some
                        asperity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We hold the Hebrews,&quot; was the undisturbed re- ply;
                        &quot;through destruction and plague we have held them. They boast the
                        calamities as sendings from:ieir God. Egypt&apos;s afflictions multiply;
                        every resort hath failed us. One is left—to free the slaves and test their
                        boast.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meneptah&apos;s face had grown deprecatory.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dost thou espouse the cause of thy nation&apos;s en-
                        emy?&quot; he asked. </p>
                    <p>&quot;I espouse the cause of the oppressed, and which, now, is more
                        oppressed—Egypt or the Hebrew?&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was different sort of persuasion from that which the king had heard
                        since Har-hat took up the fan. The scribe was compelling him by reason; the
                        man&apos;s personality was not entering at all into the ar- gument.
                        Meneptah&apos;s high brows knitted. He felt his feeble resolution filter
                        away; his inclination to hold the Hebrews stayed with him, but the power to
                        with- stand Hotep&apos;s strong argument was not in him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What wouldst thou have me do?&quot; he asked queru- lously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am but a mouthpiece for thy realm; I counsel not for myself. The
                        strait of Egypt demands that thou <pb id="VAA3882-404" n="396"/> set the
                        Hebrew free, yield his goods and his children to him, and be rid of him and
                        his plagues for ever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep spoke as if he were reciting a law from the books of the great God
                        Toth. His tone did not invite further contention. He had read the king his
                        duty, and it behooved the king to obey. A silence ensued, and by the signs
                        growing on Meneptah&apos;s face, Hotep predicted acquiescence. It can
                        not be said, however, that he noted them hopefully. Much time would elapse
                        in which much contrary persuasion was possible before Israel could depart
                        from Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Rameses came out of the dusk at the end of the cor- ridor. The king raised
                        himself eagerly arid summoned his son.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hither, my Rameses!&quot;</p>
                    <p>With suspense in his soul, Hotep saw the prince ap- proach. Rameses had never
                        expressed himself upon the Hebrew question, and the scribe knew full well
                        that neither himself nor Har-hat, nor all the ministers, nor heaven and
                        earth could militate against the coun- sel of that grim young tyrant.
                        Meneptah spoke with much appeal in his voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rameses, I need thee. Awake out of thy dream and help me. What
                        shall I do with the Hebrews?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have trusted to my father&apos;s sufficient wisdom to help
                        him in his strait, without advice of mine,&quot; was the indifferent
                        reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye; but I crave thy counsel, now, my son.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then, neither god nor devil could make me loose my grasp did I wish
                        to hold the Hebrews!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hotep sighed, inaudibly, and was moved to depart, had not lack of the
                        king&apos;s permission made him stay.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-405" n="397"/>
                    <p>&quot;But consider the losses to my realm,&quot; Meneptah made
                        perfunctory protest. The prince&apos;s full lip curled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is but a new method of warfare,&quot; he answered.
                        &quot;Instead of going forth with thy foot-soldiers and thy chariots,
                        thy javelins and thy shields, thou sufferest siege within thy borders. Wilt
                        thou fling up thy hands and open thy gates to thine enemy, while yet there
                        is plenty within the realm and men to post its walls? Let it not be written
                        down against thee, O my father, that thou didst so. Losses to
                        Egypt!&quot; the phrase was bitter with scorn. &quot;Dost thou
                        remember how many dead the Incomparable Pharaoh left in Asia? How many
                        perished of thirst in the deserts and of cold in the mountains, and of
                        pestilence in the marshes? Ran not the rivers of the Orient with Egyptian
                        blood, and where shall the souls of those empty bodies dwell which rotted
                        under the sun on the great plains of the East? The Incomparable Pharaoh cast
                        out the word &apos;surrender&apos; from his tongue. Wilt thou
                        restore it and use it first in this short-lived conflict with a mongrel race
                        of shepherds? Nay, if thou dost give over now, it shall not be an injustice
                        to thee if it come to pass that thou shalt bow to a brickmaker as thy
                        sovereign, sacri- fice to the Immaterial God and swear by the beard of
                        Abraham!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meneptah winced under the acrid reproach of his son.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It hath ever been mine intent to keep the Hebrews, but I would not
                        act unadvised,&quot; he explained apolo- getically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wherefore, then., these frequent consultations with the wolf from
                        Midian?&quot; was the quick retort. &quot;Thou <pb id="VAA3882-406"
                            n="398"/> art unskilled in the ways of war, my father. The king who
                        would conquer treats not with his enemy. Thou dost risk the respect of thy
                        realm for thee. Strengthen thy fortifications and exhaust the cunning of thy
                        be- sieger. And if he invade thy lines again with insolence and threats,
                        treat him to the sword or the halter. If thou art a warrior, prove thy
                        deserts to the name. And if Egypt backs thee not in thy stand against the
                        Hebrew, then it is not the same Egypt that followed Rameses the Great to
                        glory!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The king put up his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Enough! They shall not go; they shall not go!&quot;</p>

                    <p>One morning early in March Seti stood beside the parapet on the palace of the
                        king in Tanis. His eyes were fixed on the shimmering line of the northern
                        level, but he did not see it. Some one came with silent foot- fall and laid
                        a hand on his arm.</p>
                    <p>He turned and looked into Ta-user&apos;s eyes. His face softened and he
                        took the hand between his own.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Alas! this day thou returnest into the Hak-heb,&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>She nodded. &quot;Would I could take thee with me, but not yet, not yet.
                        Wait till thou art a little older.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He sighed and looked away again. &quot;What weighty things absorb my
                        prince?&quot; she asked. &quot;What especial labors is he
                        planning?&quot;</p>
                    <p>His face clouded. &quot;Dost thou mock me, Ta-user?&quot; he
                        returned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hadst thou no thought at all?&quot; she persisted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I merely pondered on mine own uselessness,&quot; he
                        answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fie!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, even thou must see it. I live on my father&apos;s bounty;
                        I accept my people&apos;s homage; I adore the gods. I bear no arms; I
                        neither prepare to reign nor expect to serve. I am a thing set above the
                        healthy <pb id="VAA3882-408" n="400"/> labor of the world and below the
                        cares of the exalted. I am nothing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fie! I say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Seti looked at her reproachfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast wealth,&quot; she began and paused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wherein doth that make me useful?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Much can be done with gold. Is there none in need?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;None who asks has been denied. Yet what. right have I to deal alms
                        to them from whom my riches come? If I yielded up everything, to my very
                        cloak, should I have done more than return to them what they have given me?
                        I should still be a penniless prince, more useless than ever.&quot; He
                        sat down on the broad lintel capping the parapet, but retained her hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ta-user,&quot; he continued, as she opened her lips to speak,
                        &quot;what wouldst thou have me do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would have thee be useful.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall throw away my lordly trappings,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;and become a lifter of the shadoof <ref id="ref_U" target="note_U"
                            >*</ref> this day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Seti,&quot; she said sternly, putting his hand away,
                        &quot;with thy people imperiled by the sorcery of a wizard, with thy
                        realm desolated by the plagues of his sending, canst thou, on whom I have
                        built so much, thus lightly consider thy uses and ignore the things set at
                        thy very hand to do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The prince looked at her with not a little discom- fiture showing on his
                        young face. But the interroga- tion was emphatic, and she awaited an
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have no weight with my father,&quot; he said soberly. <note

                        <pb id="VAA3882-409" n="401"/> &quot;Thou knowest that Egypt will never
                        have peace until the Hebrews depart. But I can not persuade my father to
                        release them and I can not persuade the Israelite to content himself to
                        stay. Thou dost demand much of me if thou dost demand of me the
                        impossible.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As much of contempt as it was wise to show glim- mered in her eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And thou art at thy wits&apos; end?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A little way to go. Help me, Ta-user. Bear with me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She moved closer to him and absently smoothed down the fine locks, disordered
                        by the wind. Pres- ently she lifted his face and said with sudden impul-
                        siveness :</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dost, of a truth, believe everything that is told
                        thee?&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Am I over-credulous?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art. Thou believest this Hebrew to be hon- est in his show of
                        interest in his people?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can not doubt him, Ta-user. One has but to see him to be
                        convinced.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;One has but to see him to know that he might be coaxed into
                        passiveness with that for which an Israel- ite would sell his
                        mummy-gold!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay! Nay!&quot; Seti exclaimed. &quot;Thou dost wrong him!
                        He is the soul of misdirected zeal. His is an earnestness not to be
                        frightened with death nor abated with bribes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed a cool little laugh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Deliver to him but the price he names, and the Israelitish unrest
                        will settle like a swarm of smoked bees.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ta-user, it is thou that art deceived,&quot; Seti remon- <pb
                            id="VAA3882-410" n="402"/> strated. &quot;Even the Pharaoh does not
                        hesitate to assert that Mesu is terribly upright. Not even he would dream of
                        offering the wizard Hebrew a peace-trib- ute.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Once again she laughed. &quot;Mind me, I speak rever- ently of the divine
                        Meneptah, the Shedder of Light, but I do not marvel that he is no more
                        willing to deliver over to Mesu one color of gold than
                        another.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Seti looked at her with a puzzled expression. Gaz- ing down into his eyes,
                        she said with sudden solem- nity:</p>
                    <p>&quot;My Prince, may I give my life into thy hands?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Impulsively he pressed her hand to his lips.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods overtake me with their vengeance if I guard it
                        not,&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>She drew him from his place on the parapet and led him to a seat in a corner
                        near the double towers. There she sat, and he dropped down at her feet. He
                        crossed his arms over her lap and lifted his face to her. For a moment she
                        was silent, contemplating the young countenance. What were the thoughts that
                        came to her then? Did she applaud or rebuke herself? Did she pity or despise
                        him?</p>
                    <p>Is there more of evil than of good wrought by the mind working silently?</p>
                    <p>Seti was ripe to be plucked by treachery. His was the faith that is insulted
                        by a suggestion of wari- ness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;While I dwelt obscurely in the Hak-heb,&quot; she be- gan,
                        &quot;I was much among the partizans of Amon- meses. They are friends of
                        the Pharaoh now, so wlat I tell is dead sedition. But I heard it when it
                        lived, and thou knowest the penalty invited by him who <pb id="VAA3882-411"
                            n="403"/> listens to criticism of the king. Attend me, then, for the
                        story is short.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The history of Mesu is an old tale to thee. Thy noble
                        grandsire&apos;s first queen, Neferari Thermuthis, adopted the Hebrew,
                        and when she died he shared in the allotment of her treasure. But Mesu was
                        an exile in Midian at the time, and his share was left with Shaemus, then
                        the heir, to be given over to the foster- son when he should return. But
                        Shaemus died, and all thy father&apos;s older brothers, so the gracious
                        Menep- tah came to wear the crown. To him fell the guardian- ship of the
                        Hebrew&apos;s treasure till what time he should- return out of Midian.
                        Mesu hath returned. Hath thy father delivered to him his
                        inheritance?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Seti&apos;s face flamed, but, before he could speak, she went on.
                        &quot;Not so; not one copper weight. It lies un- touched in the
                        treasury. Thine august sire does not use it, because he hath wealth more
                        than he can spend. But it is the Hebrew&apos;s, and if it were delivered
                        into his hands it would redeem Egypt. I know it. There, it is done. My life
                        is in thy hands.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The prince looked at her with wide eyes, his cheeks flushed, his lips
                        silent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wouldst thou have proof?&quot; she continued reck- lessly.
                        &quot;Seek out Hotep, who hath been keeper of the records at Pithom and
                        ask him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did he tell thee?&quot; Seti demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay; I learned it from another source, not in the palace.&quot;
                        The prince lapsed into silence, his eyes avert- ed. Ta-user regarded him
                        intently. Suddenly he raised his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dost thou know the amount of his share?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-412" n="404"/>
                    <p>&quot;It is but a moderate part of the queen&apos;s fortune, since
                        each of the king&apos;s children by his many women was
                        included.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Seti winced, for there was something dimly offensive in the calm way she
                        stated the bald fact.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is not much, as princely dowers go,&quot; she added
                        casually.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He shall have it,&quot; Seti said almost impatiently.
                        &quot;Out of mine own wealth he shall have it-not as a bribe—he would
                        not have it so—but because it is his.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She caught his hands to her breast and cried out in delight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I shall be thy lieutenant, and none shall know of it, save thee
                        and me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He smiled up at her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, there is danger in this,&quot; he said gently,
                        &quot;and I would not imperil thee. Already thou hast over- stepped
                        safety for Egypt&apos;s sake and mine. More than this I will not let
                        thee do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>An expression of panic swept over her face. He in- terpreted it as hurt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast been my guide for so long, Ta-user. Let me choose this
                        once for thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She pouted, and putting him away from her, arose and left him. He followed
                        her and took her hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A confederate thou must have,&quot; she complained;
                        &quot;and whom dost thou trust more than Ta-user?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is not a matter of trust,&quot; he explained, &quot;but
                        of thine immunity should the Hathors frown upon my plan.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It matters not,&quot; she protested. &quot;Whom wilt thou
                        trust and imperil instead of Ta-user?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-413" n="405"/>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost hurry me in my plan-making,&quot; he remonstrated
                        mildly. &quot;Mayhap I shall choose Ho- tep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She flung up her head, her face the picture of dis- may.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, nay! not Hotep! Of all thy world, not Ho- tep!&quot; she
                        exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>He lifted his brows in amazement.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Surely thou dost not question his fidelity—his power?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay! but dost thou not guess what he will do? Thou child! Abet
                        thee! Nay! he would set his foot upon thy plan and foil thee at once with
                        his politic hand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hotep will obey as I command; that thou knowest,&quot; he said
                        with dignity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou wilt not reach the point of command with him,&quot; she
                        vehemently insisted. &quot;He would catch thine intent ere thou hadst
                        stated it and would make thee aghast at thyself in a twinkling by his smooth
                        reason- ing and vivid auguries. Nay, if thou art to have thy way in this, I
                        wash my hands of it. We are as good as undone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She turned away from him, but he followed her con- tritely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I submit,&quot; he said helplessly. &quot;Advise me, but I—
                        nay, ask me not to endanger thee, Ta-user.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head and moved on. He advanced a step or two after her,
                        stopped, and wheeling about, re- sumed his place at the parapet.</p>
                    <p>After a little pause she was beside him again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall we forego this thing?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; he answered quietly. &quot;I can achieve it
                        with- <pb id="VAA3882-414" n="406"/> out help.&quot; She drew a breath
                        as if to speak but held her peace. They stood in silence side by side for a
                        while.</p>
                    <p>Presently she slipped between him and the parapet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou not called me wise in thy time?&quot; she asked.
                        &quot;I believed thee, then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I told thee a truth, but I might have added that thou art
                        over-brave,&quot; he said, catching her drift.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Listen, then, to me. Thou, in thy young credulity, seest in this
                        only justice to an enemy. I, in the wisdom of riper years and the
                        discernment bred of experience with knaves, see in it the redemption of
                        Egypt. If the heaviest penalty overtook us is it not a result worth
                        achieving at any cost? Seti, believe me; grant me my belief! It is the one
                        hope of thy father&apos;s kingdom. Shall it fail because thou wast
                        envious for my safety above Egypt&apos;s? I can aid thee to success.
                        That thou hast said. If thou failest, though thou dost attempt it alone,
                        dost thou dream that I could see thee punished without crying out,
                        &apos;It was I who urged him!&apos; If thou art undone, likewise am
                        I. If thou art to succeed, wilt thou selfishly keep thy success to
                        thyself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She slipped her arm about his neck and pressed close to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, Seti, thou dost overestimate the peril. The Hebrew will not
                        betray us, and who else will know of it? I shall make a journey into Goshen,
                        find Mesu. and bid him meet thee at a certain place. There thou shalt come
                        at a certain time with the treasure, and the feat is done. But if we
                        fail—&quot; she flung her head back and bewitched him with a heavy
                        eye—&quot;will it be hard for me to persuade the king?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Seti contemplated her with bewilderment in his face. <pb id="VAA3882-415"
                            n="407"/> The youth and innocence in his young soul revolted, but there
                        was another element that yielded and was pleased.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have it thy way, Ta-user,&quot; he said, with hesitation in his
                        words, while he continued to gaze helplessly into her compelling eyes.</p>
                    <p>She laughed and kissed him. &quot;I will see thee again soon.&quot;
                        Putting him back from her, she descended the stairway.</p>
                    <p>In the shadow at the foot she came upon two fig- ures, walking close
                        together, the taller of the two bending over the smaller. The pair started
                        apart at sight of the princess.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A blessing on thy content, Ta-meri,&quot; the princess said.
                        &quot;And upon thine, Nechutes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The cup-bearer bowed and rumbled his appreciation of her courtesy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dost thou leave us, Ta-user?&quot; his wife asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, I return to the Hak-heb. O, I am glad to go. Would I could
                        leave the same quiet here in Tanis that I hope to find in
                        Nehapehu.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, I would thou couldst. But is it not true, my Princess, that
                        one may make his own content even in the sorriest surroundings?&quot;
                        Nechutes asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For himself, even so. But the very making of one&apos;s selfish
                        content may work havoc with the peace of an- other. That I have
                        seen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye,&quot; Nechutes responded uncomfortably, wonder- ing if the
                        princess meant to confess her disappointment to them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It makes me quarrel at the Hathors. The most of us deserve the ills
                        that overtake us. But he—alas— none but the good could sing as he
                        sang!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-416" n="408"/>
                    <p>The cup-bearer dropped his indifference immedi- ately.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ha! Whom dost thou mean?&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; the princess exclaimed. &quot;Perchance I give
                        thee news.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If thou meanest Kenkenes, indeed thou dost give us news. What of
                        him? We know that he is dead. Is there anything further?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth, dost thou not know? Nay, then, far be it from me to
                        tell thee—anything.&quot; She passed round them and started to go on. In
                        a few paces, Nechutes overtook her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give us thy meaning, Ta-user,&quot; he said earnestly.
                        &quot;Kenkenes was near to me—to Ta-meri. What know- est
                        thou?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The court buzzes with it. Strange indeed that ye heard it not. It
                        is said, and of a truth well-nigh proved, that the heart of the singer broke
                        when Ta- meri chose thee, Nechutes, and that—that the disas- ter which
                        befell him may have been sought.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Nechutes seized her arm, and Ta-meri cried out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He sent Ta-meri to me,&quot; the cup-bearer said wrath- fully.
                        &quot;Thy news is—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Alas! Nechutes,&quot; the princess said sorrowfully,
                        &quot;it was sacrifice. He knew that Ta-meri loved thee and he nobly
                        surrendered, but was the hurt any less be- cause he submitted?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Nechutes released her and turned away. Ta-meri covered her face with her
                        hands and followed him. He did not pause for her, and she had to hasten her
                        steps to keep up with him. The princess looked after them for a space and
                        went on.</p>
                    <p>Straight through the corridors toward the royal <pb id="VAA3882-417" n="409"
                        /> apartments she went. Her copper eyes had taken on a luminousness that was
                        visible in the dark. There was an elasticity in her step that spoke of
                        exultation.</p>
                    <p>The Hathors were indulging her beyond reason. A soldier of the royal guard
                        paced outside the door- way of the king&apos;s apartments. Ta-user flung
                        him a smile and, passing him without a word of leave-ask- ing, smiled again
                        and disappeared through the door. Meneptah, who sat alone, raised his head
                        from the scroll he was laboriously spelling. If he had meant to resent the
                        intrusion, the impulse died within him at the charming obeisance the
                        princess made. As she rose at his sign, Har-hat entered. Ta-user came near
                        to the king, smiling triumphantly at the fan-bearer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods sped my feet,&quot; she said, &quot;and I am here
                        first. Hold thy peace, noble Har-hat. Mine is the first
                        audience.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Having reached the king&apos;s side, she dropped on her knees and folded
                        her hands on the arm of his chair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A boon, O Shedder of Light! So much thou owest me. Behold, I came
                        to thee on the hope of thy promises. What have I won therefrom? Naught save,
                        perchance, the smiles of Egypt at my disappointment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meneptah&apos;s face flushed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say on, O my kinswoman,&quot; he said, moving un-
                        comfortably.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kinswoman! And a year agone, I thought to hear, &apos;O my
                        daughter.&apos; &quot;</p>
                    <p>The color in the king&apos;s face deepened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wilt thou reproach me, Ta-user, for my son&apos;s wil-
                        fulness?&quot; was his tactless reply.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-418" n="410"/>
                    <p>Ta-user shot an amused glance at the discomfited countenance of Har-hat and
                        went on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, O my Sovereign. I do but wish to incline thine ear to me. Say
                        first thou wilt grant me my boon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her doubtfully, but she drew nearer and lifted her face to
                        his.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not ask for thy crown, or thy son, or for an army, or
                        treasure, or anything but that which thou wouldst gladly give me, because of
                        thy just and gen- erous heart.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The doubt faded out of his face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast my word, Ta-user.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And for that I thank thee.&quot; She bent her head and touched
                        her lips to the hand lying nearest her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give me ear, then,&quot; she continued. &quot;Thou hast
                        among thy ministers a noble genius, the murket, Mentu—&quot;</p>
                    <p>The king broke in with a dry smile. &quot;Wouldst have him for a
                        mate?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head till the emeralds pendent from the fillet on her forehead
                        clinked together. Nothing could have been more childlike than the pleased
                        smile on her face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, nay, he would not have me,&quot; she protested.
                        &quot;But he hath a son.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Har-hat moved forward a pace. She noted the movement and playfully waved him
                        back. &quot;Encroach not. This hour is mine.&quot;
                        Har-hat&apos;s face wore a dubious smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He hath a son,&quot; she repeated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He had a son, but he is dead,&quot; the king answered.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-419" n="411"/>
                    <p>&quot;Not so! He is in prison where thy counselor, the wicked, unfeeling,
                        jealous, rapacious Har-hat hath en- tombed him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Har-hat sprang forward as the king lifted an amazed and angry face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Back!&quot; she cried, motioning at him with her full arm.
                        &quot;It is time the Hathors overtook thee, thou in- effable
                        knave!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I protest!&quot; the fan-bearer cried, losing his tem- per.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Enough of this play,&quot; Meneptah said sternly. &quot;Go.
                        on with thy tale, Ta-user. I would know the truth of this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou wilt not learn it from the princess,&quot; Har-hat
                        exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah!&quot; Ta-user ejaculated, a world of innocence, sur- prise
                        and wounded feeling in the word.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy words do not become thee, Har-hat,&quot; Menep- tah said.
                        The fan-bearer closed his lips and gazed fixedly at the princess.</p>
                    <p>She drooped her head and went on in a voice low with hurt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods judge me if my every word is not true! Har-hat imprisoned
                        him because the gallant young man loved the maiden whom Har-hat would have
                        taken for his harem.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meneptah&apos;s face blazed. &quot;Go on,&quot; he said
                        sharply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The fan-bearer had some little right on his side, for the young man
                        had committed sacrilege in carving a statue, and had stolen the maiden away
                        and hidden her when Har-hat would have taken her. The maiden is an
                        Israelite, and her. hiding-place is known to this day <pb id="VAA3882-420"
                            n="412"/> only by herself and her unhappy lover. Now comes thy villainy,
                        O thou short of temper,&quot; she continued, looking at the
                        fan-bearer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy father, O Shedder of Light, the Incomparable Pharaoh who reigns
                        in Osiris, gave Mentu a signet—&quot;</p>
                    <p>The king interrupted. &quot;I know of that. Go on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When Kenkenes was overtaken and thrust into prison he sent this
                        signet to thee, O my Sovereign, with a petition for his release and for the
                        maiden&apos;s freedom. The writing and the signet came into Har-
                        hat&apos;s hands and he ignored them, though the signet commanded him in
                        the name of the holy One.&quot; Her voice lowered with awe and dismay at
                        his unregen- eracy. &quot;Kenkenes is still in prison.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, by the gods, Har-hat!&quot; Meneptah exclaimed angrily.
                        &quot;I would not have dreamed such baseness in thee!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The fan-bearer was stupefied with wrath and as- tonishment. Words absolutely
                        refused to come to him. Ta-user accused him with the wide eyes of fearless
                        righteousness. Presently she went on:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Already hath he languished eight months in prison. His offense
                        against the gods and against the laws of the land hath been expiated. I
                        would have thee set him free now, O Meneptah, that he may return to his love
                        and comfort her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meneptah reached for the reed pen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold!&quot; cried Har-hat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost forget thyself, good Har-hat,&quot; the princess said
                        with dignity. &quot;Thou speakest with thy sovereign.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I will be heard!&quot; he exclaimed violently.
                        &quot;Hear me! I pray thee, Son of Ptah!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-421" n="413"/>
                    <p>Meneptah removed the wetted pen and waited.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou didst give the maiden to me thyself!&quot; he be- gan
                        precipitately. &quot;Thy document of gift I have yet. He stole her, hid
                        her away, committed sacrilege and abused two of my servants nigh unto death
                        when 4hey sought for her. Hath he any more right to her than I? Art thou
                        assured that he hath an honorable pur- pose in mind for her? She is comely
                        and well inr- structed in service, and I would have put her in my
                        daughter&apos;s train, even as the Hebrew Miriam was lady- in-waiting to
                        Neferari Thermuthis. If thou dost ex- amine the records of the petitions to
                        thee thou wilt find that I asked her expressly for household service. It is
                        false that I had any other purpose in mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;As to the signet,&quot; he continued breathlessly,
                        &quot;there is no word upon it concerning the palliation of a triple
                        crime! Shall we invoke the king in the blameless name of the holy One, and
                        demand forgiveness in the name of Him who forgiveth no sin? Furthermore,
                        thou didst give the writing into my hands, and in obe- dience to thy
                        command, I acted as I thought best.&apos; My purposes have been wilfully
                        distorted!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meneptah frowned with perplexity. But while he pondered, Ta-user drew near to
                        him and said to him very softly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;If his words be true, O my Sovereign, one lovely Israelite is as
                        serviceable as another. The young man loves this maiden. Doubt it not! He is
                        a worthy off- spring of that noble sire, Mentu. If he offended, he hath
                        suffered sufficiently. Let him go, I pray thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is my word against her surmises, O Meneptah,&quot; Har-hat
                        insisted.</p>
                    <p>The king frowned more and stroked his cheek.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-422" n="414"/>
                    <p>&quot;Thine anger should be abated by this time, Har- hat,&quot; he
                        said feebly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;His rebellion is not yet broken. I have not the slave
                        yet,&quot; the fan-bearer retorted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mayhap he is ready to surrender her now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so!&quot; the princess put in. &quot;He hath endured
                        eight months. If it were eight hundred years his si- lence would be the
                        same. It is proof of my boast that he loves her. No man who would comfort
                        his flesh alone would suffer such lengths of mortification of flesh! Let him
                        go, my King, and give the clean-souled fan-bearer another Israelite for his
                        daughter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why camest thou not sooner with this to the king?&quot; Har-hat
                        demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have but this moment learned of it, and I could not leave the
                        court without one last act for the good of the oppressed,&quot; she
                        replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have it thy way, Ta-user. Come to me in an hour,&quot; Meneptah
                        began.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, write it now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art insistent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou didst promise,&quot; she whispered, her face so close to
                        his that the light from the facets of her emer- alds turned on his
                        cheek.</p>
                    <p>He took up his pen and wrote.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now promise that the signet shall go back to Mentu,&quot; she
                        continued.</p>
                    <p>&quot;As thou wilt, Ta-user,&quot; the king replied.</p>
                    <p>She caught up the roll, hesitated for a moment, and then kissed his cheek
                        deliberately and was gone.</p>
                    <p>A moment later Har-hat overtook her in the hall.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hyena!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;What is thy
                        game?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed and shook the scroll in his face.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-423" n="415"/>
                    <p>&quot;It is my turn at the pawns now. Thou didst play between me and the
                        crown. Now I shall harass thee for the joy of it. Thinkest thou I cared
                        aught for the dreamer and his loves? Bah! I heard this tale eight months
                        agone while I had naught to do but eavesdrop. Nay, it was but my one chance
                        to vex thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again she laughed and ran away to the queen&apos;s apartments.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am come to bid thee farewell,&quot; she said, kneeling before
                        the pale little woman who loved the king. The princess put up her face to be
                        kissed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not my lips!&quot; she cried warningly. &quot;They yet
                        tingle with the kiss of Meneptah, thy husband. I would not have the ecstasy
                        spoiled by another&apos;s touch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The queen flushed and kissed the cheek.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Farewell, and peace go with thee,&quot; she said quietly.</p>
                    <p>The princess retained her composure until she re- entered the hall. There she
                        flung her arms above her head and laughed silently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth, I take peace with me, and I leave dis- cord
                        behind!&quot;</p>

                    <p>Rachel stood by the parapet on the top of the Mem- phian house of Har-hat.
                        About her were no evidences of her former serfdom. She wore an ample robe of
                        white linen, with blue selvages heavily fringed. About her neck was the
                        collar of gold. The costume was distinctly Israelitish, elaborated somewhat
                        at the sug- gestion of Masanath, to whom Rachel&apos;s golden beauty was
                        a never-lessening wonder. Compared to the tiny gorgeous lady, Rachel was as
                        a tall lily to a mimosa.</p>
                    <p>Masanath was comfortably pillowed on cushions, close to the Israelite. The
                        rose-leaf flush on her little face was subdued and her dark eyes were larger
                        than usual. The physical discomforts of the plagues had overtaken her; and
                        Rachel, the only one of all the household who had passed unscathed through
                        the troublous time, had been so tender a nurse that Masa- nath recovered
                        with reluctance.</p>
                    <p>This was the Egyptian&apos;s first day on the housetop, and she was not
                        happy. The great pots of glazed earthenware, each a small garden in size,
                        were filled with baked earth. The locusts had taken her flowers. In the park
                        below the grass was gone and the palm trees were shadowless. Her chariot
                        horses had died in the stables; her pets had drooped and perished; her birds
                        were missing one morning, and Rachel said they <pb id="VAA3882-425" n="417"
                        /> had flown to Goshen, where there were grain and grasses. Furthermore, the
                        year of freedom had al- most expired and she began to anticipate
                        sorrowfully.</p>
                    <p>The period of the Israelite&apos;s residence with Masa- nath had been
                        uneventful save for those grim, momen- tous days of plague and loss. Deborah
                        had survived the removal to comfort in Memphis only a month. The brutal
                        injuries inflicted by the servants of Har-hat lhad been too severe for her
                        age-enfeebled frame to repair. So she died, blessing the two young girls who
                        had attended her, and promising peace and happiness to come. Then they laid
                        her in a new tomb cut in the rock face of the Libyan hills and wrote on her
                        sarcophagus:</p>
                    <p>&quot;She departed out of the land of Mizraim before her
                        people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And this was prophecy.</p>
                    <p>Thus was Rachel left, but for Masanath, entirely alone. None of the
                        afflictions had overtaken her. A mysterious Providence shielded her. Anubis,
                        which she formally claimed as hers, was the only one of the nu- merous dumb
                        dwellers in the fan-bearer&apos;s house that had escaped. And of him
                        there is something to be told.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after the arrival of the Israelites in Mem- phis, Anubis disappeared
                        for days.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is gone to visit the murket,&quot; Masanath ex- plained.</p>
                    <p>One noon Rachel, resting on the housetop with her hostess, saw him leisurely
                        returning, by starts of in- terest and recollection. Behind him, walking
                        cautious- ly, was a man.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-426" n="418"/>
                    <p>&quot;Anubis returneth,&quot; Rachel said, sitting up.</p>
                    <p>Masanath raised herself and looked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Imhotep<ref id="ref_V" target="note_V">*</ref> plagues mine eyes,
                        or that is the murket following him,&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>Immediately Rachel began to* tremble and, sinking back on her cushions, hid
                        her face. Masanath contin- ued to watch the approaching man.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If he comes shall I send for thee?&quot; she asked in a
                        half-whisper.</p>
                    <p>The Israelite shook her head. &quot;Only if he asks for me,&quot; she
                        answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A pest on the creature!&quot; Masanath exclaimed im- patiently
                        after a little silence. &quot;He is torturing the man I Hath he forgot
                        the place?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She leaned over the parapet and called the ape. The murket looked up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anubis is my guest, noble Mentu,&quot; she replied.
                        &quot;Wilt thou not come up with him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The murket looked at her a moment before he an- swered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I thank thee, my Lady. I left the noonday meal that I might be
                        led at the creature&apos;s will. He is restless since my son is
                        gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Every word of the murket&apos;s fell plainly on Rachel&apos;s ears.
                        The tones were those of Kenkenes, grown older. The statement came to her as
                        a call upon her knowl- edge of the young artist&apos;s whereabouts.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell him—tell him—&quot; she whispered desperately.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot; asked Masanath, turning about.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell him where Kenkenes went!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian leaned over the parapet. &quot;Fie! he is <note id="note_V"
                            place="foot" anchored="yes"><ref target="ref_V">*</ref>Imhotep—The
                            physician-god.</note>
                        <pb id="VAA3882-427" n="419"/> gone!&quot; she said. &quot;Nay, but
                        I shall catch him;&quot; and fly- ing down through the house, out into
                        the narrow pas- sage, she overtook the murket.</p>
                    <p>This is what she told Rachel when she returned:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I said to him: &apos;My Lord, I know where Kenkenes
                        went.&apos; And he said: &apos;Of a truth?&apos; in the calmest
                        way. &apos;Aye,&apos; said I. &apos;It hath come to mine ears
                        that he went to Tape.&apos; &apos;That have I known for
                        long,&apos; he answered, after he had looked at me till I wished I were
                        away. &apos;That have I known for long, and why he went and why he came
                        not back,&apos; and having said, he smoothed my hair and told me I was
                        not much like my father, and departed without another word. To my mind he
                        hath conducted himself most strangely. I doubt not he knows more than you or
                        I, Rachel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>To Masanath&apos;s dismay the Israelite flung herself face down on the
                        rugs and wept. &quot;He is not dead; he is not dead,&quot; she
                        cried.</p>
                    <p>The collapse of a composure so strong and bridled filled Masanath with
                        consternation. Had Rachel&apos;s spirit been of weaker fiber the
                        Egyptian&apos;s own forceful individuality would have longed to sustain
                        it, but when it broke in its strength she knew that here was a stress of
                        emotion too deep for her to soothe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then if he is not dead,&quot; she said, searching for something
                        to say, &quot;why weepest thou?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Alas! seest thou not, Masanath? He hath not re- turned to me; his
                        father knows his story, and if he be not dead how shall I explain his
                        absence save that he hath forgotten or repented?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so!&quot; Masanath declared. &quot;He is the soul of
                        honor, and there is a mystery in this that the gods may explain in time.
                        Comfort thee, Rachel, for there stir- <pb id="VAA3882-428" n="420"/> reth a
                        hope in me.&quot; Then with the utmost tact she told the story of the
                        finding of Kenkenes&apos; boat and the theory accepted in Memphis.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can offer thee hope,&quot; she concluded, &quot;but I can
                        not even guess what should keep him so long. Of this be assured, however, he
                        did not desert thee, Rachel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Enigmatical as it was, the incident was comforting to Rachel.</p>
                    <p>So the Nile rose and subsided, the winter came and went, and now it was near
                        the middle of March. Ma- sanath forgot Kenkenes and remembered her own sor-
                        row now that its consummation was surely approach- ing. During the hours
                        that darkened gradually Rachel was to her an ever-responsive comforter. Even
                        in the dead of night, if the weight of her care burdened her dreams so that
                        she stirred or murmured, she was in- stantly soothed till she slept again.
                        Usually the day did not harass her with oppression, but if she grew sud-
                        denly afraid, Rachel was at her side to comfort her— never urging, either to
                        rebellion or submission, but ever offering hope.</p>
                    <p>So the little Egyptian came to love the Israelite with the love that demands
                        rather than gives—the love of a child for the mother, of the benefited for
                        the bene- factor. Gradually Rachel lost sight of her own trouble in her
                        devotion to Masanath. She had no time for her own thoughts. Each passing day
                        brought the Egyp- tian&apos;s martyrdom nearer, and Rachel&apos;s
                        uses hourly in- creased.</p>
                    <p>This day Masanath, who had been ill, was unusually downcast.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It may be,&quot; she said with more cheer in her tones <pb
                            id="VAA3882-429" n="421"/> than had been in her previous remarks,
                        &quot;that I shall die before they can wed me to Rameses.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, why not say that the Lord God will interfere before that
                        time?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Evil and power have joined hands against me, and even the gods are
                        helpless against such collusion,&quot; Ma- sanath answered drearily.</p>
                    <p> &quot;The sorrows of Egypt are not yet at an end; may- hap the hand of
                        the God of Israel will overtake the prince.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy God is afflicting, not helping; He will not spare
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The hand of the Lord is lifted against Egypt. Will He bless the
                        land, then, with such a queen as thou wouldst be?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but thine is a strange God! Mark thou, I doubt Him not! But
                        ai! I should face Him for ever in sackcloth and ashes lest He smite me for
                        smiling and living my life without care.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hath an ill befallen Israel?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If thou art Israel, nay! Thou hast flourished in this dread time
                        like a palm by a deep well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So he prospereth all his chosen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath shook her head and looked away. From the stairway Nari
                        approached.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Unas hath come from Tanis, my Lady,&quot; she said with
                        suppressed excitement. Masanath sat up, trem- bling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isis grant he hath not come to take thee to mar- riage,&quot;
                        the waiting woman breathed. Rachel laid an inquiring hand on the little
                        Egyptian&apos;s arm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My father&apos;s courier,&quot; she explained.
                        &quot;Let him come <pb id="VAA3882-430" n="422"/> up,&quot; she
                        continued to Nari. The waiting woman bowed and left her.</p>
                    <p>Rachel arose and took a place on the farther side of the hypostyle, with the
                        screens of matting between her and Masanath. She was still in hiding.</p>
                    <p>The fat servitor came up presently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gracious gods have had thee under their shel- tering wings
                        during these troublous times,&quot; he said, bowing. &quot;It is
                        worth the trip from Tanis to look upon thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy words are fair, Unas. How is it with my father?&quot;
                        Masanath asked with stiff lips.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods are good to the Pharaoh. They permit the wise Har-hat to
                        continue in health to render service to his sovereign.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath, dreading the news, asked after it at once. Men have killed
                        themselves for fear of death.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast come to conduct me to court?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is the gracious will of my master.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath half rose from her seat. &quot;When?&quot; she asked almost
                        inaudibly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In twenty days; no more. I have a mission to per- form and shall go
                        hence immediately. But I shall re- turn in twenty days, never fear, my
                        Lady.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath saw that he mocked her. Her wrath was an effective counter-irritant
                        for her trouble. She was calm again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then, if thy message is delivered, go!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He backed out and descended the stairway.</p>
                    <p>When she was sure he was gone she flung herself, in a paroxysm of wild grief
                        and despair, face down on her cushions. At that moment a cold hand caught
                        her arm. She looked up and saw Rachel. All the blue had <pb id="VAA3882-431"
                            n="423"/> gone from the Israelite&apos;s eyes, leaving them black
                        with dreadful conviction. The color had receded from her cheeks and her
                        figure was rigid.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who was that man?&quot; she demanded in a voice low with
                        concentrated emotion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Unas, my father&apos;s man. What is amiss,
                        Rachel?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Israelite stood for a moment as though she per- mitted the intelligence
                        to assemble all the further facts that it entailed. Then she turned away and
                        walked swiftly toward the well of the stair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rachel! Thou—what—thou hast not answered me!&quot; Masanath
                        called.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is naught to be said. —it were best that I go to my people
                        now, since thou goest to marriage,&quot; was the unready reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou wilt return to thy people! Rachel! Nay, nay! Thou art all I
                        have. Come back! Come black!&quot; Ma- sanath cried, running after
                        her.</p>
                    <p>Rachel hesitated, trembling with a multitude of emo- tions.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It were better I should go,&quot; she insisted, trying to
                        escape Masanath&apos;s clasp. &quot;If I go now I can reach my
                        people and be hidden safely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The little Egyptian flung herself upon the Israelite, weeping.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Art thou, too, deserting me—thou, who art the last to befriend me?
                        What have I done that thou shouldst desert me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Naught! Naught! Thou dear unfortunate!&quot; was the passionate
                        reply. &quot;But I must go! I must!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou must flee from sure safety to only possible
                        security!&quot; Masanath demanded through her tears. &quot;If I must
                        wed this terrible prince, I shall put my misery <pb id="VAA3882-432" n="424"
                        /> to some use. I shall ask thy liberty at his hands and thou shalt live
                        with me for ever, my one comfort, my one support.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;But Israel departeth shortly—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou shalt not go,&quot; Masanath declared hysteri- cally.
                        &quot;I will not suffer thee! The doors shall be barred against thy
                        departure!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel turned her head away and pushed back her hair. Her plight was
                        desperate. Meanwhile Masa- nath went on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is not like thee, Rachel, to desert me! I had not dreamed thee
                        so selfish—so cruel!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sister!&quot; Rachel cried, &quot;thou torturest
                        me!&quot; On a sudden Masanath raised her head and gazed at the
                        Israelite.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What possessed thee to go?&quot; she demanded. &quot;Is it
                        Rameses who hath beset thee?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel shook her head and avoided Masanath&apos;s eye.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell me,&quot; the Egyptian insisted. &quot;There is
                        mystery in this. What had my father&apos;s man to do with thy hasty
                        resolution to depart?&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was no answer. Masanath put the Israelite back from her a little and
                        repeated her question.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can not tell thee,&quot; Rachel responded slowly.</p>
                    <p>Silence fell, and Masanath spoke at last, in a decided voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art within my house, and so under my com- mand. Thou shalt not
                        leave me! I have said!&quot; She turned to go back to her cushions.
                        Rachel followed her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I pray thee, Masanath—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold thy peace. Let us have no more of this.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-433" n="425"/>
                    <p>Rachel grew paler, and she clasped her hands as though praying for fortitude.
                        At last she broke out:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Masanath! Masanath! That man—that Unas— attended the noble who
                        halted me on the road to the Nile, that morning; he was the one sent back to
                        Mem- phis for the document of gift; he pursued me into the hills. He is the
                        servant of the man who follows me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian recoiled as though she had been struck.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Nay, nay,&quot; she cried, throwing up her hands as though to
                        ward off the conviction. &quot;Not my father! Not he! Thou art wrong,
                        Rachel!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would to the Lord God that I were, my sister! But I am not mistaken
                        in that face. He was the one that disputed with Kenkenes—was the one
                        Kenkenes choked. Never was there another man with such a voice, such a face,
                        such a figure! It is he!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath wrung her hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell it over again. Describe the noble to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;He was third in the procession and drove black
                        horses—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Holy Mother Isis! his horses were black. The first two would have
                        been the princes of the realm, the next the fan-bearer. Nay, I dare not hope
                        that it is not true. Since he would barter his own daughter for a high
                        place, he would not hesitate to take by force the daughter of another. O
                        Mother of Sorrows, hide me! my father! my father!&quot; she wailed.</p>
                    <p>Under the combined weight of her griefs, she dropped on the carpeted pavement
                        and wept without control. All of Rachel&apos;s fear and horror were
                        swept away in a wave of compunction and pity. She lifted the little Egyptian
                        back upon her cushions again and, kneeling beside her, took the bowed head
                        against her <pb id="VAA3882-434" n="426"/> heart. Her hair fell forward and
                        framed the two sor- rowing faces in a shower of gold.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lo! I have been a guest under thy roof and at thy board, a
                        pensioner upon thy cheer, and now, even while my heart was full of
                        gratitude, have I encroached upon thy happiness and broken thine
                        overburdened heart. Forgive me, Masanath. Let me not come be- tween thee and
                        thy father, sister! Let me return to my people, for Israel shortly goeth
                        forth. Doubt it not. Then shall I be out of his reach, and the Lord will not
                        lay up the sin against him. Furthermore, dost thou not remember
                        Deborah&apos;s words while the spirit of prophecy was upon her? Promised
                        she, not peace for us, and happiness and long tranquillity to follow these
                        days of sorrow? Do thou have faith, Masanath. Cease not to hope, for the
                        forces of evil have never yet triumphed wholly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but how shall that restore my pride in my father?&quot;
                        Masanath sobbed. &quot;How shall I ever think of him without the
                        bitterness of shame? What must the world think of him—of me? Now I know what
                        the murket meant. He knew, and Kenkenes knew and all— Alas! alas!&quot;
                        she broke forth in fresh grief, &quot;and Hotep knows!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel could say no more, for in this sorrow no comfort could avail.</p>
                    <p>She stroked the little Egyptian&apos;s hair and let the wounded heart
                        soothe itself.</p>
                    <p>Presently Masanath&apos;s mind wandered from the new villainy of her
                        father to the memory of the older offense and she wept afresh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If thou goest, Rachel, there is none left to comfort me,&quot;
                        she mourcnd. &quot;I am alone—desolate, and the <pb id="VAA3882-435"
                            n="427"/> powers of Egypt are arrayed against me &quot; Rachel was
                        hearing her own plight given expression. She put aside any thought of
                        herself and applied herself to Masanath&apos;s need.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, there is Hotep,&quot; she whispered. &quot;He loves
                        thee, and if there is aught in prophecy, he will com- fort thee when I am
                        gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But thou shalt not go,&quot; Masanath cried. &quot;Stay
                        with me, Rachel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy father&apos;s servant returneth in twenty days. As I have
                        said, if I go now, I can reach my people and be hidden safely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian held fast to the Israelite and wept.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, Rachel. Stay with me. Thou art all I have!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel turned her head and gazed toward the south. Across the housetops, the
                        far-off sickle of the Nile curved into a crevice between the hills and
                        disappeared. Somewhere beyond that blue and broken sky-line her last claim
                        to Egypt had been lost. Why should she stay when Kenkenes was gone?
                        Meanwhile Masanath went on pleading.</p>
                    <p>If she departed, the next day&apos;s sun might dawn upon him in Memphis,
                        searching and sorrowing because he found her not. The hour of separation
                        might be de- layed for twenty days—in that time he might come.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will stay till my people go—if they depart within twenty
                        days,&quot; Rachel made answer. &quot;But I must be gone ere thy
                        father&apos;s servant returns.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath rebelled, sobbing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, weep not. The hour is distant. In that time, since these are
                        days of miracles, thy sorrows and mine may have faded like a mist. Come, no
                        more. Let us bide the workings of the good God.&quot;</p>

                    <p>The valley in which Thebes Diospolis was situated was wide and the overflow
                        of the Nile did not reach the arable uplands near the Arabian hills. Three
                        thousand years before, Menes had established a sys- tem of irrigation which
                        had added hundreds of square miles to the agricultural area of Egypt, and
                        every mon- arch after him had unfailingly preserved the institu- tion. From
                        Syene to Pelusium the country was rami- fied with canals, and vast sums and
                        great labor were expended yearly upon their keeping.</p>
                    <p>Since the work was heavy and the demand for it constant, it became a punitive
                        part of each nome&apos;s administration. Therefore, the convicts whose
                        mis- deeds were too serious to be punished adequately by the bastinado or
                        the fine, and yet not grave enough to merit a sentence to the quarries or
                        the mines, were sent to the canals.</p>
                    <p>So here in the canals of the eastern Thebaid, was Kenkenes, a prisoner known
                        only by a number. His fellows were unjust public weighers, usurers, rioters,
                        habitual tax-evaders, broken debtors, forgers and housebreakers.</p>
                    <p>The season of toil had been unusually severe. The native convicts had more to
                        endure than the lash, the <pb id="VAA3882-437" n="429"/> bitter fare, the
                        terrible sun by day, and a bed of dust by night, for the afflictions that
                        befell all Egypt were theirs also. The strange prisoner among them suffered
                        these things and had further the drawback of his own physical strength to
                        combat. The plagues overcame the weaker convicts and decimated the number of
                        laborers, so Kenkenes was put, alone, to the work that two men had done
                        before.</p>
                    <p>However, the accumulation of toil came upon him gradually and his supple
                        frame toughened as the de- mand upon it increased. Nor was he sensible of
                        pain or great weariness, Tor his mind was far away from the sun-heated
                        desert of the eastern Thebaid. He spoke seldom, and held himself aloof from
                        his fellow prisoners. He regarded his taskmasters as if they were written
                        authority no more animate than wafered scrolls of papyrus. No one doubted
                        from the begin- ning that he was high-born, and this mark of a great fall
                        might have exposed him to abuse; but his great strength and unusual
                        deportment did not invite mis- treatment. In short, he ,was looked upon as
                        mildly mad.</p>
                    <p>When Kenkenes had rejected the gods, hope, sun- dered from faith, groped
                        wildly and desperately. In his rare moments of cheer he could not anticipate
                        freedom without trusting to something, and in his misanthropy his doubt had
                        placed no limit on its scope, questioning the honor of king or slave. In
                        these better moments he wanted to believe in something.</p>
                    <p>So constantly had his sorrows attended him that he had come to dread the
                        night, when there was neither event nor labor to interrupt their dominance
                        over his mind. He caught eagerly at any less troublous prob- <pb
                            id="VAA3882-438" n="430"/> lem that might suggest itself, for he felt
                        that he had been conquered by his plight.</p>
                    <p>As he lay by night, apart from the rest of the pris- oners, he gazed at one
                        glittering star that stood in the north. About it were scintillating
                        clusters, single stars and faint streaks of never-dissipated mists. Night
                        after night that one brilliant point had remained un- moved in its steady
                        gaze from the uppermost, but the clusters rotated about it; the single stars
                        were west- ward moving; the mists shifted. And a question be- gan to trouble
                        him: What hand had marshaled the stars? Seb,<ref id="ref_W" target="note_W"
                            >*</ref> whom Toth had supplanted? Osiris, whom Set destroyed? The young
                        man put them aside. They were feeble. Nothing so weak had created the mighty
                        hosts of heaven. So he began to weigh the question.</p>
                    <p>What hand had marshaled the stars? An accident? Since man must worship
                        something supernal, what more tremendous than the cataclysm, if such it
                        were, that evolved the stars. Had the same or a series of such events
                        brought forth the earth and man? Was the accident continuously attendant?
                        Did it spread the Nile over Egypt and call it again within its banks every
                        year? Did it clothe the fields and bring them to harvest every revolution of
                        the sun? Did it hang the moon like a sickle in the west or lift it over the
                        Arabian hills like a bubble of silver every eight and twenty days?</p>
                    <p>If it were omnipotent, infinite and omnipresent, could it be an accident? If
                        it were, why not worship it and call it God?</p>
                    <note id="note_W" place="foot" anchored="yes"><ref target="ref_W">*</ref>Seb—The
                        Egyptian Chronos.</note>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-439" n="431"/>
                    <p>The reasoning led him again in the direction of the gods, but he saw no
                        reason for a multiplicity of dei- ties. Each member of the Egyptian Pantheon
                        presided over some-special field of human interest or human environment. To
                        him, who had lived next to nature till her study had become a worship, there
                        ,were no flaws in her chronology, no shortcomings or plethora. The earth
                        responded to the skies; the waters were in harmony with the earth, the
                        harvests with all. There was unity in the control over the universe and the
                        hand that was powerful enough to swing the moon was mighty enough to flood
                        the Nile, was tender enough to nourish the harvests, was wise enough to
                        govern men. Where, then, was any need of a super- fluity of powers?</p>
                    <p>But behold, something had thrust a dread hand be- tween the tender
                        ministrations of this other Thing and the benefits to men. By this time it
                        had reached the remotenesses of Egypt that it was the God of the Hebrews.
                        The young man arrived at this alternative in his reasoning: There was a
                        minister of good and another of evil—two powers presiding over the
                        earth,—or,—the sole minister was offended and had deserted its charge, or
                        had loosed upon Egypt the evil at its command. Here Kenkenes paused. He
                        could not arrive at any conclusion on the matter or convince himself that he
                        had not reasoned well.</p>
                    <p>Night after night, he fell asleep upon his ponder- ings, but they returned to
                        him with fresh food for thought after every sunset. The reconstruction of
                        something worshipful was more , fascinating than had been the demolition of
                        the gods. It took many a night&apos;s meditation for the evolution of
                        any fixed idea <pb id="VAA3882-440" n="432"/> from the bewildering
                        convection of thought. And at last he had concluded only that there was one
                        thing— Power—Purpose, which was greater than man.</p>
                    <p>This was not a great achievement. He had simply permitted the universal,
                        indefinable claim to piety, in- herent in every reasoning thing, to assert
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>Great and sincere and beyond expression was his amazement and his joy when a
                        taskmaster called him from the canal-bed one day and informed him that he
                        was free.</p>
                    <p>The order was shown him at his request, and the name of the Princess Ta-user
                        as his champion filled him with puzzlement. State news filtered slowly down
                        even to the level he had occupied for the past eight months. He had heard
                        that it was Masanath whom the Hathors had destined to wear the crown of
                        queen to Rameses; the convicts had known of the supremacy of Har-hat. He
                        could not understand how it came that Ta-user, lately discarded, could
                        prevail upon the crown prince to persuade Meneptah, or could herself
                        persuade the king to the overthrow of the fan-bearer&apos;s wishes in
                        the matter. Furthermore, why should the princess have taken up his cause?
                        But he did not tarry while he pondered.</p>
                    <p>His raiment and his money, conscientiously pre- served for him by the
                        authorities, had been sent to him, and a little way outside the camp he
                        stepped from the lowest to his rightful rank, swifter than he had de-
                        scended from it. Covering his sun-burnt shoulders with his robes, assuming
                        the circlet once again, he went toward the distant city of Thebes, once more
                        in spirit and dress the son of the royal murket.</p>
                    <p>At the heavy-walled prison across the Nile he asked <pb id="VAA3882-441"
                            n="433"/> after the signet. It had not been returned with the writing.
                        Neither was there any word to him concern- ing his prayer to Pharaoh for the
                        liberty of Rachel. It began to dawn on him that he had been released only
                        after he had been sufficiently punished; that he had failed in the most
                        vital aims of his mission; that the signet, having been found, seemed now to
                        be lost irretrievably. For a space his relief at his freedom was
                        overshadowed by chagrin, but after a little he re- covered himself.
                        &quot;At least I am free to care for her, now,&quot; he
                        reflected.</p>
                    <p>Just as he emerged from the imposing doorway of the house of the governor of
                        police, he was jostled by a half-grown boy. To Kenkenes, it seemed that the
                        youth had been on the point of entering, but instead he apologized inaudibly
                        and walked away.</p>
                    <p>A great rush of impatience, suspense, eagerness and heart-hunger fell on the
                        young artist the instant he knew his footsteps were turned toward Memphis
                        and Rachel. The six days that must intervene be- tween the present time and
                        the moment he entered the old capital seemed insufferable. Never did a lover
                        so fume against the inexorable deliberation of time and the obstinate length
                        of distance. The preliminaries to departure seemed to accumulate and
                        lengthen—and lessen in importance. Haste consumed him. Under a momentary
                        impulse, with all seriousness he began to consider his own fleetness of foot
                        as more expedient than travel by boat. But he put the thought aside, and
                        summoning as much patience as was possible, set about with all speed
                        preparing to depart.</p>
                    <p>Thebes had not awakened from the coma of horror into which it had lapsed
                        during the great plagues. It <pb id="VAA3882-442" n="434"/> was
                        Kenkenes&apos; first visit to the city since he had left it for the
                        desert, eight months before. Now, the change in the great capital of the
                        south impressed itself upon him, in spite of his haste and his all-absorb-
                        ing thought of Memphis. The activities of life seemed to be suspended. The
                        call to prayers could be heard hourly from the great gongs of the temple at
                        Karnak, when in happier days the sound had been lost in the city&apos;s
                        noises within the very shadow of the pylons. He could hear strains of music
                        in religious processions, when the wind was fair, but he missed the acclaim
                        of the populace. Besides these sounds, silence had set- tled over Thebes.
                        Booths were closed in many in- stances; the streets, which ordinarily were
                        quiet, were now deserted; there were no carpets swinging from balconies and
                        housetops, and the citizens he saw were sober of countenance and of garb. So
                        few, indeed, he met, that he noted each passer-by as an event. Once, some
                        distance away from him, he saw again the youth whom he had met in the
                        doorway of the prison.</p>
                    <p>At a caterer&apos;s he purchased supplies for a day&apos;s journey
                        and looked about him for a carrier. Catching the boy&apos;s eye, he
                        beckoned him, but the youth turned on his heel and disappeared. The son of
                        the merchant offering himself, Kenkenes. continued rapidly toward the river
                        where he engaged a vessel to take him to Memphis.</p>
                    <p>He roused the boatmen into immediate activity by promises of reward for every
                        mile gained over the average day&apos;s journey. Their passenger and
                        cargo shipped, the men fell to their oars and the craft shot out of the
                        still waters by the landings into midstream iad turned toward the north.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-443" n="435"/>
                    <p>As they cleared, the private passage boat belonging to a nobleman swept up
                        near to them and crossing their track took the same direction several
                        hundred yards nearer the Libyan shore. Kenkenes noted that it was a bari of
                        elegant pattern, deep draft and more numerously manned than his. He noted
                        further that one of the boat&apos;s crew was the youth he had met thrice
                        in a short space at Thebes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Small wonder that he was not willing to serve me,&quot; he
                        commented to himself.</p>
                    <p>If he observed the companion boat during the next five days it was to remark
                        that since his own vessel kept sturdily alongside one of superior rowing
                        force his men were of a surety earning the promised reward. When they
                        entered the long straight stretches of the Middle country the elegant
                        stranger dropped behind and attended Kenkenes and his crew more distantly
                        thereafter.</p>
                    <p>Except for these few occasions, Kenkenes had no thought of his surroundings.
                        He stood in the prow and looked down the shimmering width of river, in the
                        direction his heart had taken long before him. And when the white cliffs
                        that proved him close to Memphis came shouldering up from the northern
                        horizon, he had forgotten the stranger in the eager, trembling anticipations
                        that possessed him.</p>

                    <p>On the morning of the eighteenth day, immediately after sunrise, Rachel came
                        to the curtains over Masa- nath&apos;s door, and put them aside.</p>
                    <p>Within, she saw her hostess yet in her bed-gown, her hair disordered and ter
                        tiny feet bare. She stood before a shrine of silver, the statue of Isis in
                        turquoise displayed therein, and an offering of pressed dates before it. But
                        there was no sign of devotion or hu- mility in the attitude of the Egyptian.
                        One plump arm was stretched toward the image and the hand was tightly
                        clenched. Neither was there any reverence in her voice.</p>
                    <p>Rachel dropped the curtain and waited. The words . came distinctly through
                        the linen hangings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou false one!<ref id="ref_X" target="note_X">*</ref> thou
                        ingrate! Is it for this that very day I have sent two fat ducks to the altar
                        in thy name? Is it that I must be separated from my beloved and wedded to
                        the man I hate, that I have prayed to thee day and night? Who hath been more
                        faithful to thee and whom hast thou served more cruelly? Mark thou! If thou
                        darest to cause this thing to come to pass, night nor day shall I rest until
                        I have found <note id="note_X" place="foot" anchored="yes"><ref
                                target="ref_X">*</ref>It was not uncommon for Egyptiahs to threaten
                            their gods.</note>
                        <pb id="VAA3882-445" n="437"/> the bones of Osiris and scattered them to the
                        four . winds of heaven! So carefully shall I hide them, so widely shall I
                        scatter them, that no help of Nepthys, Toth or Anubis shall let thee gather
                        them up again! Aye, I will do it, though I die in the doing and remain
                        unburied, I swear by Set! Remember thou!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel went softly away.</p>
                    <p>After a time she returned. She had covered her white dress with a mantle of
                        brown linen and over her head she wore a wimple of the same material. Her
                        hair had been coiled and secured with a bodkin. When she put her hand under
                        the wimple and drew it across her mouth, only her fair skin and blue eyes
                        distinguished her from any other Egyptian lady dressed for a long
                        journey.</p>
                    <p>She lifted the curtains and entered, and it was long before she came forth
                        again. Then her eyes were hidden and her head bowed, for she had bidden
                        fare- well to Masanath. She was returning to Goshen.</p>
                    <p>In the street before the house she entered her litter and with Pepi walking
                        beside her went to the Nile. And there they were joined by Anubis. He had
                        been absent for days, so his greeting was extravagant, his loyalty
                        inalienable. He entered the bari Pepi had loaded with Rachel&apos;s
                        belongings, and would not be coaxed or menaced into disembarking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, let him come,&quot; Rachel said at last. &quot;Thou
                        canst set him on the shore opposite the tomb. He will leave us willingly
                        there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So they pushed away.</p>
                    <p>Rachel wrapped her wimple about her face and re- moved it once only to gaze
                        at the quarries of Ma- saarah. They were deserted. Months before, di- <pb
                            id="VAA3882-446" n="438"/> rectly after the affliction of the Nile, the
                        Israelites had been returned to Goshen.</p>
                    <p>After the bari had passed below the stone wharf, Rachel covered herself and
                        neither spoke nor moved. Her heart was heavy beyond words.</p>
                    <p>Pepi broke the silence once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall we drop the ape first, my Lady?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rachel shook her head. Anubis was her last hold on Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>At the Marsh of the Discontented Soul, the bari nosed among the reeds and
                        grounded gently. Rachel stood for a moment gazing sadly across the stretch
                        of sand toward the abrupt wall against which it termi- nated inland. Pepi,
                        already on shore, reached a pa- tient hand toward her and awaited her
                        awakening. Anubis landed with a bound and made in a series of wide circles
                        for the cliff. His escape aroused Rachel and she stepped out of the boat.
                        After a moment&apos;s thought, she bade Pepi pull away from the shore
                        and await her at a safe distance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall stay no longer than to write my whereabouts on the tomb,
                        but thy boat here may attract the atten- tion of others on the river, and
                        hereafter they might ask what thou didst in this place. And I am not
                        afraid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The slow Egyptian obeyed reluctantly, shaking his head as he stood away from
                        shore.</p>
                    <p>With a sigh that was almost a sob, Rachel walked back over the sand toward
                        the cave that had been her only shelter once.</p>
                    <p>She did not fear it. Kenkenes had crossed this gray level of sand in the
                        night and its wet border at the <pb id="VAA3882-447" n="439"/> river had
                        borne the print of his sandal. He had made the tomb a home for her, he had
                        knelt on its rock pavement and kissed her hands in its dusk and had passed
                        its threshold, like a shadow, to return no more. And here, too, was the
                        other faithful suggestion of her lost love—the pet ape. How his fitful
                        fidelities had directed themselves to her! She caught him up as he passed
                        her. He struggled, turned in her arms, and then became passive, breathing
                        loudly.</p>
                    <p>She climbed the rough steps and sat down on the topmost one to think.</p>
                    <p>She was surrounded with old evidences of her sor- row. Nor was there any
                        cheer before her. Escape was in prospect, but it was liberty without light
                        or peace—a gray freedom without hope, purpose or fruit. Her retrospect
                        gradually brightened, never to brilliance but to a soft luminance, brightest
                        at the farthermost point and sad like the dying daylight. She summarized her
                        griefs—danger, death, suspense, shame and long hopelessness. The lonely
                        girl&apos;s stock of unhappiness took her breath away and she pushed
                        back the wimple as if to clear away the oppression.</p>
                    <p>Anubis realized his moment of freedom was short and with an instant bound he
                        was out and gone.</p>
                    <p>In no little dismay Rachel started in pursuit, but she had not moved ten
                        paces from the bottom of the steps before she paused, transfixed.</p>
                    <p>An Egyptian, not Pepi, was hauling a boat into the reeds. The craft secure,
                        he turned up the slant, walk- ing rapidly.</p>
                    <p>There was no mistaking that commanding stature. Anubis descended on him like
                        an arrow. The <pb id="VAA3882-448" n="440"/> man saw the ape, halted a
                        fraction of an instant, caught sight of Rachel, and with a cry, his arms
                        flung wide, broke into a run toward her.</p>
                    <p>The ape bounded for his shoulder, but missed and alighted at one side,
                        chattering raucously. The run- ning man did not pause.</p>
                    <p>The world revolved slowly about Rachel, and the sustaining structure of her
                        frame seemed to lose its rigidity. She put out her hands, blindly, and they
                        were caught and clasped about Kenkenes&apos; neck. And there in the
                        strong support of his tightening arms, her face hidden against the leaping
                        heart, all time and matters of the world drifted away. In their place was
                        only a vast content, featureless and full of soft dusk and warmth.</p>
                    <p>Gone were all the demure resolutions, the memory of faith or unfaith. Nothing
                        was patent to her except that this was the man she loved and he had returned
                        from the dead.</p>
                    <p>Presently she became vaguely aware that he was speaking. Though a little
                        unsteady and subdued, it was the same melody of voice that she seemed to
                        have known from the cradle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rachel! Rachel!&quot; he was saying, &quot;why didst thou
                        not go to my father as I bade thee? Nay, I do not chide thee. The joy of
                        finding thee hath healed me of the wrench when I found thee not at my
                        father&apos;s house, at dawn to-day. But tell me. Why didst thou not
                        go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I—I feared—&quot; she faltered after a silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My father? Nay, now, dost thou fear me? Not so; and my father is
                        but myself; grown old. He was only a little less mad with fear than I, when
                        he discov- ered that thou shouldst have come to him so long ago, <pb
                            id="VAA3882-449" n="441"/> and camest not. It damped his joy in having
                        me again, and I left him pale with concern. Did I not tell thee how good he
                        is?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, it was not that I feared him, but that I feared that
                        thou—&quot; And she paused and again he helped her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That I was dead? That I had played thee false? Rachel! But how
                        couldst thou know? Forgive me. Since the tenth night I left thee I have been
                        in prison.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In prison!&quot; she exclaimed, lifting her face.
                        &quot;Alas, that I did not think of it. It is mine to beg thy for-
                        giveness, Kenkenes, and on my very knees!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So thou didst think it, in truth!&quot; She hid her face again
                        and craved his pardon.</p>
                    <p>But he pressed her to him and soothed her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I do not chide thee. Had I been in thy place, I might have
                        thought the same. But it is past—gone with the horrors of this horrible
                        season—Osiris be thanked!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thanks be to the God of Israel,&quot; she demanded from her
                        shelter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And the God of Israel,&quot; he said obediently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, to the God of Israel alone,&quot; she insisted, rais- ing
                        her head.</p>
                    <p>He laughed a little and patted her hands softly to- gether.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was but the habit in me that made me name Osiris. There is no
                        god for me, but Love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So long, so long, Kenkenes, and not any change in , thee?&quot;
                        she sighed. &quot;How hath Egypt been helped of her gods, these grievous
                        days?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods and the gods, and ever the gods!&quot; he said.
                        &quot;What have we to do with them? Deborah bade me turn from them and
                        this I have done with <pb id="VAA3882-450" n="442"/> all sincerity. Much
                        have I pondered on the question and this have I concluded. Egypt&apos;s
                        holy temples have been vainly built; her worship has been wasted on the air.
                        There was and is a Creator, but, Rachel, that Power whose mind is troubled
                        with the great things is too great to behold the petty concerns of men. My
                        fortunes and thine we must direct, for though we im- plored that Power till
                        we died from the fervor of our supplications, It could not hear, whose ears
                        are filled with the murmurings of the traveling stars. Why we were created
                        and forgotten, we may not know. How may we guess the motives of anything too
                        great for us to conceive? Whatsoever befalls us results from our use at the
                        hands of men, or from the nature of our abiding-place. We must defend
                        ourselves, prosper ourselves and live for what we make of life. After that
                        we shall not know the troubles and the joys of the world, for the tombs are
                        restful and soundless. Is it not so, my Rachel?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head. &quot;Thou hast gone astray, Ken- kenes. But thou
                        wast untaught—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have reasoned, Rachel, and the Power I have found in my
                        ponderings, makes all the gods seem little. Thy God must manifest himself
                        more fearfully; he must overthrow my reasoning before I can bow to him. And
                        if, of a surety, he is greater than the Power I have made, will he need my
                        adoration or listen to my prayers? Nay, nay, my Rachel. If thou wilt have me
                        worship, let me fall on my face to thee—&quot;</p>
                    <p>She interrupted him with a quick gesture.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kenkenes, have I prayed in vain for the light to fall on
                        thee?&quot; she asked sadly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-451" n="443"/>
                    <p>He smiled and moved closer, looking down into her face as he had done when he
                        studied it as Athor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, hast thou done that, and hast thou not been heard? Thou dost
                        but fix me in mine unbelief. Did any god exist he would have heard thy
                        supplications. Come, let us make an end of this. There are sweeter themes I
                        would discuss. Where hast thou been, these many months? Not here in this
                        haunted cave?&quot;</p>
                    <p>His lightness sank her hope to the lowest ebb. A sudden hurt reached her
                        heart. His unregeneracy suggested unfaithfulness to her. Their positions had
                        been reversed. It was she that had been denied. Duty reasserted itself with
                        a chiding sting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have been a guest with Masanath—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The daughter of Har-hat!&quot; he cried, retreating a step.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The daughter of mine enemy,&quot; she went on. &quot;She
                        found me here by accident and took me to her home in Memphis. There Deborah
                        died. And there, eighteen days agone, I discovered who it was that sheltered
                        me, and now I return to my people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The fan-bearer did not find thee?&quot; he demanded at
                        once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay. Unseen, I looked upon his man. Alas! the wound to the
                        daughter-love in Masanath! On the morrow she departeth for Tanis where she
                        will wed with the Prince Rameses.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes&apos; hands fell to his sides. &quot;Nay, now! Of a surety,
                        this is the maddest caprice the Hathors ever wrought. In the house of thine
                        enemy! Well for me I did not know it! I should have died from very
                        apprehension. And all these months thou wast within sight of my
                        father&apos;s doors!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-452" n="444"/>
                    <p>&quot;I saw him once,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And discovered not thyself! How cruelly thou hast used thyself,
                        Rachel. He would have told thee, long ago, why I came not
                        back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, now I know; but, Kenkenes, I could not go,
                        fearing—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Enough. I forgot. Come, let us go hence. Mem- phis and my
                        father&apos;s house await thee now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I go to my people, even now,&quot; she answered, with
                        averted face and unready words.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes whitened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And leave me?&quot; he asked quietly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Think me not ungrateful,&quot; she said. &quot;I have said
                        no words of thanks since there is none that can ex- press a tithe of my
                        great indebtedness to thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have achieved nothing for thee. Not even have I won thy freedom.
                        I have failed. But shameless in mine undeserts, I am come to ask my reward
                        neverthe- less.&quot; He was very near to her, his face full of pur-
                        pose and intensity, his voice of great restraint.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That which once thou didst refuse to hear, thou hast known for long
                        by other proof than words,&quot; he went on. &quot;Let me say it
                        now. I love thee, Rachel.&quot; Taking her cold hands he drew her back
                        to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Once I forbore,&quot; he continued, the persuasive calm in his
                        manner heightening, &quot;because I knew it would hurt thee to say me
                        &apos;nay.&apos; I told myself that I was brave, then, when the
                        actual loss of thee was distant. But thou wilt leave me now and my fortitude
                        for thy sake is gone. I am selfish because I love thee so. The extreme is
                        reached. I can withstand no more. Dost thou love me, Rachel?&quot;</p>
                    <p>What need for him to wait for the word that gave <pb id="VAA3882-453" n="445"
                        /> assent? Was there not eloquent testimony in her every feature and in
                        every act of that hour he had been with her? But his hands trembled, holding
                        hers, till she told him &quot;aye.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then ask what thou wilt of me,&quot; he said, the re- straint
                        gone, desperation taking its place. &quot;I submit, so thou dost yield
                        thyself to me. Shall I pray thy prayers, kneel in thy shrines? Shall I go
                        with thee into slavery? Shall I learn thy tongue, turn my back on my people,
                        become one of Israel and hate Egypt? These things will I do, and more, so I
                        shall find thee all mine own when they are done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But she freed her hands to cover her face and weep. Kenkenes sighed from the
                        very heaviness of his un- happiness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou shouldst hate me, if, to win thee, I bowed in pretense to thy
                        God,&quot; he said weakly.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps his words awakened a hope or perhaps they made her desperate.
                        Whatever the sensation, she raised her head and spoke with a sudden assump-
                        tion of calm:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Naught could make me hate thee, Kenkenes, but I should know if thou
                        didst pretend. Thou art as trans- parent as air. Thou art honest,
                        guileless—too good to be lost to the Bosom that must have thrilled with joy
                        when he beheld what a beautiful soul His hands had wrought. Few of His
                        believers have conceived the greatness of Jehovah as thou hast, O my
                        Kenkenes. In that art thou proved ripe for His worship. Thou hast found His
                        might to be so limitless that thou thinkest thyself as naught in His sight.
                        In that hast thou gone astray. The mind is gross that can not heed the weak
                        and small. Shall we say that the spin- <pb id="VAA3882-454" n="446"/> ner of
                        the gossamer, the painter of the rose is not fine? Shall He forget His
                        daintiest, frailest works for His mightiest? Thou, artist and creator
                        thyself, Ken- kenes, answer for Him. Nay; not so! He, who hath an ear to the
                        lapse between an hour and an hour, hath counted His song-birds and numbered
                        His blossoms. For are they, being small, less wondrous than the heavens, His
                        handiwork? Shall He then fail to hear the voice of His sons in whom He hath
                        taken greater pains?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She paused for a moment and looked at him. His expression urged her on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does it not trouble thee when I, whom thou hast but lately known,
                        am in sorrow? How much more then does thine unhappiness vex His holy heart,
                        who fashioned thee, who blew the breath of life into thy nostrils! Wilt thou
                        deny the Hand that led thee to me, here, in this hour—that cared for me
                        during the sea- son of distress and peril? Nay, my beloved, there is no
                        greater virtue than gratitude. It is an essential in the make-up of the
                        great of heart—wilt thou put it out of thy fine nature?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again she paused, and this time he answered in a half-whisper:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost shake me in mine heresy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is but newly seated in thy credence,&quot; she said eagerly,
                        &quot;and is easy to be put aside—easier to cast off than was the
                        idolatry. Put it away in truth from thee and grieve thy Lord God no
                        more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would that I could, now, this hour. We may discipline the soul and
                        chasten the body, but how may we govern the mind and its disorderly beliefs?
                        It <pb id="VAA3882-455" n="447"/> laughs at the sober restraint of the will;
                        my heart is broken for its sake, but it is reprobate still.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I have not won thee?&quot; she asked, shrinking from
                        him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give me time—teach me more—return not to Goshen. Come back to
                        Memphis with me!&quot; he begged in rapid words, pressing after her.
                        &quot;No man uncov- ered so great a problem, alone, in a moment. How
                        shall I find God in an hour?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;O had I the tongue of Miriam!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go not yet. Wilt thou give me up, after a single effort? Miriam
                        could not win me, nor all thy priests. I shall be led by thee alone. A day
                        longer—an hour—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But after the manner of man, thou wilt put off and wait and wait.
                        Thou art too able, Kenkenes, too full of power for aid of
                        mine—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rachel, if thou goest into Goshen—&quot; he began passionately,
                        but she clutched him wildly, as if to hold him, though death itself dragged
                        at her fingers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hide me!&quot; she gasped in a terrified whisper. &quot;The
                        servant of Har-hat!&quot;</p>
                    <p>At the mention of his enemy&apos;s name, Kenkenes turned swiftly
                        about.</p>
                    <p>Two half-clad Nubians were at the river&apos;s edge, hauling up an
                        elegant passage boat. It was deep of draft and had many sets of oars.
                        Approaching over the sand, hesitatingly, and with timid glances toward the
                        tomb beyond, were four others. The foremost was the youth he had seen in
                        Thebes. The next wore a striped tunic. Fourth and last was Unas.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, by my soul,&quot; Kenkenes exclaimed aloud, <pb
                            id="VAA3882-456" n="448"/> &quot;there is no more mystery concerning
                        the boy.&quot; He turned and took Rachel in his arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, do thou test the helpfulness of thy God! I have been tricked
                        and I see no help for us. Enter the tomb and close the door, and since thou
                        lovest honor better than liberty, let this be thine escape.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He put his only weapon, his dagger, into her hands.</p>
                    <p>For an instant he gazed at her tense white face; then bending over her, he
                        kissed her once and put her be- hind him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What want ye?&quot; he demanded of the men.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A slave,&quot; Unas answered evilly, stepping to the fore.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your authority?&quot; The fat courier flourished a document and
                        held up a blue jewel, hanging about his neck. Meneptah had forgotten his
                        promise toreturn the lapis-lazuli signet to Mentu.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art undone, knave!&quot; the courier added with a short
                        laugh. He clapped his hands and the four Nubians advanced rapidly upon
                        Kenkenes. There was to be no parley.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes glanced at the youth. He was not full grown,—spare, light and small
                        in stature.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am sorry for thee, boy,&quot; Kenkenes muttered.&quot;Thy
                        gods judge between thee and me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Nubians, two by two, each man ready to spring, rushed.</p>
                    <p>With a bound, Kenkenes seized the youth by the ankles and swung him like an
                        animate bludgeon over his head. The attacking party was too precipitate to
                        halt-in time and the yelling weapon swung roind, horizontally mowing down
                        the foremost pair of men <pb id="VAA3882-457" n="449"/> like wooden pins.
                        The weight of the boy, more than the force of the blow, jerked him from the
                        sculptor&apos;s hands. Kenkenes recovered himself and retreated. As he
                        did so, he stumbled on a fragment of rock. He wrenched it from its bed and
                        balanced it above his head.</p>
                    <p>The powerful figure with the primitive weapon was too savage a picture for
                        the remaining pair to contem- plate at close quarters. Unas had made no
                        movement to help in the assault. He had felt the weight of the
                        sculptor&apos;s hand and had evidently published the sav- agery of the
                        young man to his assistants. They had come prepared to capture an athletic
                        malefactor, but here was a jungle tiger brought to bay. They retired till
                        their fallen fellows should arise.</p>
                    <p>The vanquished were struggling to gain their feet, and Kenkenes noted it with
                        concern. He was not gaining in this lull. There were other stones about him.
                        He hurled the fragment with a sure aim, and a Nubian, who had been
                        overthrown, dropped limply and stretched himself on the sand.</p>
                    <p> With a howl the remaining three charged.. They were too close for the second
                        missile of Kenkenes to do any slaughter, and he went down under the com-
                        bined attack, fighting insanely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Slit his throat,&quot; Unas shrieked, tumbling on the captive,
                        as Kenkenes&apos; superhuman struggles threat- ened to shake them off.
                        One of the men raised him- self and made ready to obey. Holding to Kenkenes
                        with one hand, he drew a knife from his belt and pre- pared to strike.</p>
                    <p>At that instant, the captive caught sight of a pale woman-face, the eyes
                        blazing with vengeance. There <pb id="VAA3882-458" n="450"/> was a flash of
                        a white-sleeved arm and the thump and jolt of a dagger driven strongly
                        through flesh. The murderous Nubian yelled and tumbled, kicking, on the
                        sand. He carried a knife at the juncture of the neck and shoulder.</p>
                    <p>Instantly there was a chorus of yells.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She-devil! Hyena!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Unas detached himself from the struggle and plunged after Rachel, now in full
                        sight of Kenkenes. He saw her retreat, warding off the fat courier with her
                        hands; he saw her stumble and fall; he saw Anubis fly, with a chatter of
                        rage, in the face of the courier, and struggling mightily, he threw off his
                        captors, and leaped to his feet.</p>
                    <p>And then the light went out in Egypt!</p>

                    <p>A water-carrier in Syene was carrying a yoke across his shoulders and the
                        great earthen jars swung pon- derously as he walked. His bare feet disturbed
                        the red dust of the path down to the granite-basined river, and tiny clouds
                        puffed out on each side of the way at every footfall.</p>
                    <p>On a housetop in Memphis, a. gentlewoman, in a single gauze slip and many
                        jewels, lounged on a rug and gazed at nothing across the city. A
                        flat-shanked Ethiopian fanned her listlessly and dreamed also.</p>
                    <p>A little boy, innocent of raiment, stood before a new tomb, opposite Tanis
                        and awaited his father who la- bored within.</p>
                    <p>The water-carrier collapsed in his tracks; the lady shrieked; the Ethiopian
                        dropped the fan; the little boy fell on his face—all at the same
                        instant.</p>
                    <p>From the sea to the first cataract, from the deepest recess in the Arabian
                        hills to the remotest peak in the Libyan desert, Egypt was blinded and
                        muffled and smothered in a dead, black night—even darkness that could be
                        felt.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes stood still. Harsh hands were no longer on him and for an instant no
                        sound was to be heard. Profound gloom enveloped him. His every sense was
                        frustrated.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-460" n="452"/>
                    <p>Some one of his assailants had found his heart with a knife and this was
                        death, he thought.</p>
                    <p>Then strange, far-off murmurings filled his ears. From the river and beside
                        him went up wild, hoarse cries of men in mortal terror. Memphis began to
                        drone like a vast and troubled hive. The distant pas- tures became blatant
                        and the poultry near the huts of rustics cackled in wild dismay. In the
                        hills about beasts whimpered and the air was full of the screaming of
                        bewildered birds.</p>
                    <p>With the awakening of sound, Kenkenes knew that another plague had befallen
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The dread that might have transfixed him was over- come by the instant
                        recollection of Rachel&apos;s peril. No restraining hands were upon him,
                        but he stood yet a space attempting to catch some rift in the thick
                        night.</p>
                    <p>There was not one ray of light.</p>
                    <p>While he waited it was more distinctly borne in upon him that during that
                        space Rachel might suffer.</p>
                    <p>He would go to her.</p>
                    <p>The night made a wall ahead of him which was im- minent and indiscernible. It
                        was like a great weight upon his shoulders and a pitfall at his feet.</p>
                    <p>He crouched and fumbled before him. His appre- hension was physical; his mind
                        urged him; his body rebelled. He would have run but he could barely force
                        one foot ahead of the other. Illusory obstacles con- fronted him. He waved
                        his arms and put forward a foot. The ground was lower than he thought, and
                        he stepped weightily. He brought up the other foot la- boriously,
                        hesitatingly. This was not advance, but time-losing.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, what might not be happening to Rachel <pb id="VAA3882-461" n="453"
                        /> in this chaos of gloom and clamor? Why need he hide his escape? None of
                        these near-by assailants had any care now save for his own safety.</p>
                    <p>He called her name loudly and listened.</p>
                    <p>There was no answer in her voice.</p>
                    <p>He forced himself to move, but had the next step led into an abyss his feet
                        could not have been more reluctant. He flailed the air with his arms and
                        accom- plished another pace. He realized that he could not reach, in an
                        hour, at this rate, the spot in which he had last seen her. Again he called,
                        using his full lung power, but the only reply was an echo, or the hoarse
                        supplications of men, near him and on the river. The river! Had Rachel gone
                        that way too far and beyond retreat? The thought chilled him with terror and
                        hor- ror.</p>
                    <p>He execrated himself for his trepidation and strove wildly to proceed; but
                        strive as he might he could not advance. How long since the darkness had
                        fallen, and he had moved but two paces from the spot in which it had
                        overtaken-him! The outcry near him subsided into low murmurs of terror, and
                        none lifted a voice in answer to his distracted call.</p>
                    <p>If Rachel had been near she would have replied to him. The alternatives he
                        had to choose as her possi- ble fate were death in the Nile or capture by
                        Unas. The one he fought away from him wildly, the other&apos; made him
                        frantic. And the realization of his own helplessness, with the picture of
                        her distress at that moment, crushed him.</p>
                    <p>A tangle of wind-mown reeds tripped him and pitched him to his knees among
                        the high marsh growth.</p>
                    <p>He did not rise.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-462" n="454"/>
                    <p>The babe in pain cries to his mother; the man in his maturity may outgrow the
                        susceptibility to tears, but he never outwears the want of a stronger spirit
                        upon which to call in his hour of distress.</p>
                    <p>For Kenkenes it had been a far cry, from his careless days and his empyrean
                        populous with deities, to this utter and unhappy night and one unseen Power.
                        In that time he had run the gamut of sensations from a laugh to a wail. Now
                        was his need the sorest of all his life. The most helpful of all hands must
                        aid him. His fathers&apos; gods were in the dust. What of that un-
                        approachable, unfeeling Omnipotence he had created in their stead?</p>
                    <p>He fell on his face and prayed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O Thou, who art somewhere behind the phantom gods that we have
                        raised! To whom all prayer as- Sends by many-charted paths; Thou who canst
                        spread this sooty night across the morning skies and turn to milk the bones
                        of men! Thou who didst undo my surest plans, who dost mock my boasted power,
                        who hast stripped me till my feeble self is bared to me even in this
                        dreadful night; Thou who wast a fending hand about her; who art her only
                        succor now—to whom she prays—and by that sign, Thou Very God! I bow to
                        Thee.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My lips are stiff at prayer to such as Thou. But what need of my
                        tongue&apos;s abashed interpretation of that which I would say, since
                        even the future&apos;s history is open unto Thee?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have run my course without craving Thine aid, and lo! here have I
                        ended—a voice appealing through the night—no more.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, wilt Thou heed an alien&apos;s plea; wilt Thou <pb
                            id="VAA3882-463" n="455"/> know a stranger petitioning before Thy high
                        and holy place? How shall I win Thine ear? Charge me with any mission,
                        weight me with a lifetime of penances, strip me of power everlastingly, but
                        grant me leave to supplicate Thy throne.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not for myself do I pray, O Hidden God! Not one jot would I overtax
                        Thy bounty toward me beyond the sufferance of my devotion. But for her I
                        pray— for her, out somewhere in this unlifting gloom, her ten- der
                        maidenhood uncomforted—with night, with death, with long dishonor
                        threatening her. Attend her, O Thou august Warden! Let her not cry out to
                        Thee in vain! Be Thou as a wall about her, as a light before her, as a firm
                        path beneath her feet. Do Thou as Thou wilt with me. Lo! I offer up myself
                        as ransom for her —myself—all I have! Take her from me, deny mine eyes the
                        sight of her for ever, blot me wholly out of her heart, yield me over to the
                        wrath of mine enemies, and to Thine unknowable vengeance thereafter; but
                        save her, Great God! save her from her enemy!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dost Thou hear me, O Holy Mystery? Is there no sign, no
                        manifestation that Thou dost attend?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but I know that Thou hearest me! By my faith in Thy being I
                        know it, Lord!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Peace fell on him and he slept.</p>
                    <p>In after years Kenkenes remembered only vaguely the long hours of that black
                        and lonely vigil. This climax to a calamitous space eight months in length
                        might have crushed a less sturdy spirit, but he was mystically
                        sustained.</p>
                    <p>With the exception of a few intervals of short dura- tion most of the time
                        was spent in sleep, so profound and dreamless as to border on coma, The
                        reeds had <pb id="VAA3882-464" n="456"/> received him on a bed of crushed
                        herbage and the up- standing ranks about him sheltered him from the blow-
                        ing sand. The whilom assailants of the young man were not so kindly served
                        by the gods to whom they appealed loudly and frequently. The city in the
                        dis- tance moaned and complained and the hills were full of fear.</p>
                    <p>In one of his profound lapses of slumber a hairy paw felt of
                        Kenkenes&apos; face. Later a drifting boat nosed about among the reeds
                        at the water&apos;s edge. Presently one of the crew cried out, and a
                        second voice said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, fear not; it is an ape, by the feel of him. Toth is with us.
                        It is a good omen; let him not go forth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Silence fell again, for the boat drifted on.</p>
                    <p>At last dawn-lights reddened about the horizon; stars faded out of the
                        uppermost as naturally as if they had been there during the three days of
                        unlifting night. All Egypt showed up darkly in the coming day.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes, in his couch of reeds, slept on peacefully.</p>
                    <p>The mid-morning sun shone in his face before he awakened.</p>
                    <p>He leaped to his feet, cramped and stiffened by his long inactivity, and
                        looked about him. Near by was a disturbed spot of wide circumference. Here
                        had the- struggle taken place. Here, also, some of the sand was stained with
                        the blood of the Nubian, who had been wounded by Rachel. Fresh footprints
                        led toward the water. He followed them with a wildly beating heart. There
                        were no marks of a little sandal. At the Nile edge the deep line cut by a
                        keel was still visible in the vet sand. His own boat and the other were
                        gone. All <pb id="VAA3882-465" n="457"/> other signs had been obliterated,
                        for the wind had been busy during the darkness.</p>
                    <p>Across the cultivated land, or rather the land which would have been
                        wheat-covered but for the locusts, he saw the huts of rustics, and to each
                        of these he went, asking of the pallid and terror-stricken tenants if Ra-
                        chel had come to them. Gaining no information, he went next to Masaarah,
                        appeasing his hunger with succulent roots plucked from the loam beside the
                        river. The quarries were deserted, the pocket in the valley, where the
                        Israelites had pitched their tents, was as sol- itary as it had ever been.
                        There was no place here to shelter the lost girl.</p>
                    <p>There were the huts to the north of the Marsh and the deserted village of
                        Toora to search. He retraced his steps.</p>
                    <p>As he came again before the tomb he went to it. Half-way up the steps he
                        stopped.</p>
                    <p>On a blank face of the rock, sheltered by a jutting ledge above it, was an
                        inscription, a little faint, but he ascribed that to the poor quality of the
                        pencil and roughness of the tablet. This is what he read:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Her whom thou seekest thou wilt find in the palace of Har-hat, in
                        the city.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Perhaps under other circumstances Kenkenes would have understood correctly
                        the origin and intent of the writing. Already, however, his fears pointed to
                        the palace of Har-hat as the prison of Rachel, and this faint inscription
                        was corroboration. It appealed to him as villainy worthy of the fan-bearer.
                        It was like his exquisite effrontery.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-466" n="458"/>
                    <p>Kerikenes whirled-away with an indescribable sound, rather like the snarl of
                        an infuriated beast than an ex- pression of a reasoning creature. Dashing
                        down the sand, he plunged into the Nile and swam with super- human speed for
                        the Memphian shore.</p>
                    <p>He defied death as a maniac does. The river was a mile in width and teeming
                        with crocodiles. But the same saving Providence that shields the adventurous
                        child attended him. He clambered up the opposite bank and struck out for
                        Memphis on a hard run.</p>
                    <p>He had but one purpose and that was to find Har- hat and strangle him with
                        grim joy. The rescue of Rachel did not occur to him, for in his excited mind
                        the simple touch of the fan-bearer&apos;s hand was sufficient to kill
                        her with its dishonor.</p>
                    <p>He did not remember anything that Rachel had told him concerning her life in
                        Memphis; or that Har-hat was in Tanis, and Masanath like to be the only
                        resi- dent in the fan-bearer&apos;s palace. His reasoning powers
                        abandoned their supremacy to all the fierce impulses toward revenge and
                        bloodletting of which his nature was capable.</p>
                    <p>Though it was day when he entered the great capi- tal of the Pharaohs, the
                        streets were almost deserted, and every doorway and window showed interiors
                        bril- liant with a multitude of lamps. Memphis was pre- pared against a
                        second smothering of the lights of heaven.</p>
                    <p>The few pedestrians Kenkenes met fell back and gave room to the dripping
                        apparition which ran as if death-pursued. One told him on demand where the
                        mansion of Har-hat stood, and after a few slow min- utes he was within its
                        porch. He flung himself against <pb id="VAA3882-467" n="459"/> the blank
                        portal and beat on it. He did not pause to await a response. He felt within
                        him strength to&apos; batter down the doors if they did not open.</p>
                    <p>Presently an old portress came forth from a side entry and Kenkenes seized
                        her. Fearing that she might cry out and defeat his purpose, he put his hand
                        over her mouth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your master,&quot; he demanded hoarsely. &quot;Where is he?
                        Answer and answer quietly!&quot;</p>
                    <p>For a moment she was dumb with terror.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gone,&quot; she gasped at last when Kenkenes shook her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where? When?&quot; he insisted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To Tanis, eight months since!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was an Israelite maiden brought here? Answer and truly, by your
                        immortal soul!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Many months ago, aye, but she departed three days ago for
                        Goshen,&quot; the old woman answered falteringly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And she came not back?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Swear, by Osiris!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;By Osiris—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And the Lady Masanath?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gone, also, to Tanis with Unas, this morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou liest! In the dark?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I swear by Osiris,&quot; she protested wildly.
                        &quot;The light came in with the hour of dawn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes released her and hurried away. He did not doubt that the old woman
                        had told the truth. He had overslept the light. Unas could not have taken
                        Rachel and Masanath to Tanis together. The Israelite would have been sent on
                        before.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-468" n="460"/>
                    <p>There was yet Atsu to question, and then—on to Tanis to rescue Rachel or to
                        avenge her.</p>
                    <p>He met no one until he reached a bazaar of jewels near the temple square. An
                        armed watchman stood be- fore the tightly closed front of the
                        lapidary&apos;s booth, above the portal of which a flaring torch was
                        stuck in a sconce.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The house of Atsu?&quot; the watchman repeated after Kenkenes.
                        &quot;Atsu is no longer a householder in Mem- phis.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When did he depart?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Eight or nine months ago, at the persuasion of the
                        Pharaoh.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The lightness of the man&apos;s manner irritated the al- ready vexed
                        spirit of the young artist.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be explicit,&quot; he demanded sharply. &quot;What meanest
                        thou?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He was stripped of his insignia and reduced to the rank of ordinary
                        soldier,&quot; the man answered, &quot;for pampering the Israelites.
                        He is with the legions in the north.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hath he kin in the city?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, he is solitary.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes walked away unsteadily. The nervous en- ergy that had upborne him
                        during his intense excite- ment was deserting him. His hunger and weariness
                        were asserting themselves.</p>
                    <p>He turned down the narrow passage leading to his father&apos;s house. And
                        suddenly, in the way of such va- grant thoughts, it occurred to him that the
                        inscription on the tomb had been pointedly denied by the old
                        woman&apos;s statements.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, I might have known,&quot; he said impatiently.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-469" n="461"/>
                    <p>&quot;Rachel put the writing there for me when she left the tomb for the
                        shelter Masanath offered her in Mem- phis.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The admission cheered him somewhat, but it did not repair his exhausted
                        forces. By the time he reached his father&apos;s door he was unsteady,
                        indeed, and beyond further exertion.</p>

                    <p>The murket sat at his place in the work-room, but no papyrus scrolls lay
                        before him; his fine implements were not in sight; the ink-pots and pens
                        were put away and the table was clear except for a copper lamp that
                        sputtered and flared at one end. The great artist&apos;s arms were
                        extended across the table, his head bowed upon them, his hands clasped. The
                        attitude was not that of weariness but of trouble.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes hesitated. For the first, time since the hour he left Memphis for
                        Thebes, months before, he felt a sense of culpability. He realized, with
                        great bounds of comprehension, that the results of his own trouble had not
                        been confined to himself. He began to understand how infectious sorrow
                        is.</p>
                    <p>He crossed the room and laid a trembling hand on the murket&apos;s
                        shoulder. Instantly the great artist lift- ed his head and, seeing Kenkenes,
                        leaped to his feet with a cry that was all joy.</p>
                    <p>The young man responded to the kiss of welcome with so little composure that
                        Mentu forced him down on the bench and summoned a servant.</p>
                    <p>The old housekeeper appeared at the door, started with a suppressed cry and
                        flung herself at her young master&apos;s feet. He raised her and touched
                        her cheek with his lips.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-471" n="463"/>
                    <p>&quot;Bring me somewhat to eat and drink, Sema,&quot; he said weakly.
                        &quot;I have fasted since I returned here, well-nigh four days
                        agone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The stiff old creature rose with a murmur half of compassion, half of
                        promise, and went forth imme- diately.</p>
                    <p>The murket stood very close to his son, regarding him with interrogation on
                        his face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Memphis was full of famishing at the coming of dawn this
                        morning,&quot; he said. &quot;For the first time in my life I knew
                        hunger, and it is a fearsome thing, but thou —a shade from Amenti could not
                        be ghastlier. Where hast thou been—what are thy fortunes,
                        Kenkenes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rachel—thou knowest—&quot; Kenkenes began, speak- ing with an
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, I know. Didst find her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, and lost her, even while I fought to save her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Alas, thou unfortunate!&quot; Mentu exclaimed. &quot;Of a
                        surety the gods have punished thee too harshly!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes was not in the frame of mind to receive so soft a speech composedly.
                        A strong tremor ran over him and he averted his face. The murket came to his
                        side and smoothed the damp hair.</p>
                    <p>The old housekeeper entered with broth and bread and a bottle of wine. Mentu
                        broke the bread and filled the beaker, while Sema stood aloof and gazed,
                        with troubled eyes at the unhappy face of the young master. Silent, they
                        watched him eat and drink, grieved be- cause of the visible effort it
                        required and because no life or strength returned to him with the breaking
                        of his fast. When he had finished, the bowl and platter were taken away, but
                        at a sign the old housekeeper <pb id="VAA3882-472" n="464"/> left the wine
                        with the murket. After she had gone Mentu glanced at the draggled dress of
                        his son.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou needest, further, the attention of thy slave,
                        Kenkenes,&quot; he suggested.</p>
                    <p>The young man shook his head. &quot;Not yet,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;My time is short, and it is thy help I need.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The murket sat down beside his son.</p>
                    <p>Without further introduction Kenkenes plunged into his story. He had had no
                        time to tell it four days be- fore. Then he had asked for Rachel with his
                        second word, and finding her not, had rushed immediately to the search for
                        her.</p>
                    <p>Mentu heard without comment till the story was done. Most of it he had known
                        from Hotep, and only the recent events at the tomb excited him.</p>
                    <p>When Kenkenes made an end the murket brought his clenched hand down on the
                        table with a force that made the lamp wink and the implements rattle in
                        their boxes above him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Curse that smooth villain Har-hat!&quot; he cried in a tempest
                        of wrath. &quot;A murrain upon his greedy, crafty lust! The gods blast
                        him in his knavery! Now is my precious amulet in his hands. Would it were
                        white-hot and clung to him like a leech!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes said nothing. The market&apos;s wrath was more comforting to him
                        than tender words could have been.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who hath the ear of Meneptah?&quot; the murket con- tinued with
                        increasing vehemence. &quot;Har-hat! And behold the miseries of Egypt!
                        Shall we put any great sin past the knave who sinneth monstrously, or divine
                        his methods who is a master of cunning? The land is entangled in difficulty!
                        Give me but a raveling <pb id="VAA3882-473" n="465"/> fiber to pull, and, by
                        the gods, I know that we shall find Har-hat at the other end of it! He is
                        destroying Egypt for his ambition&apos;s sake! And that a son of
                        mine—me! the right hand of the Incomparable Pha- raoh—should furnish meat
                        for his rending!&quot; His voice failed him and he shook his clenched
                        hands high above his head in an abandon of fury.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did I not tell thee?&quot; he burst forth again, pointing a
                        finger at his son. &quot;Did I not warn thee from the
                        first?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes raised his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can you avoid a knave if he hath designs on you?&quot; he
                        asked. &quot;Have I erred in crossing his will? Have I sinned in loving
                        and protecting her whom I love?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mentu&apos;s hands fell down at his sides. The simple questions had
                        silenced him. His son was blameless now that he had expiated his offenses
                        against the law, and from the moral standpoint his persistence in his claim
                        on Rachel was just—praiseworthy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; he said sullenly, &quot;but since thou didst
                        love the girl, how came it that thou didst not wed her long ago and save her
                        this shame and danger?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He saw the face of his son grow paler.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The bar of faith lay between us,&quot; Kenkenes an- swered.
                        &quot;I was an idolater, she a worshiper of the One God. She would not
                        wed with me, therefore.&quot; </p>
                    <p>The murket looked at his son, stupefied with amaze- ment.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou—thou—&quot; he said at last, his words coming slowly by
                        reason of his emotions. &quot;The Israelite re- jected
                        thee!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes bent his head in assent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou! A prince among men—a nobleman, a genius <pb id="VAA3882-474"
                            n="466"/> —a man whom all women—Kenkenes! by Horus, I am amazed!. And
                        thou didst endure it, and continue to love and serve and suffer for her!
                        Where is thy pride?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes stopped him with a motion of his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A maid&apos;s. unwillingness is obstacle enough,&quot; he
                        said. &quot;Shall a man summon further difficulty in the form of his
                        self-esteem to stand in the way of his love? Nay, it could not be, and that
                        thou knowest, my father, since thou, too, hast loved. When a man is in love
                        it is his pride to be long-suffering and humble. But there is naught
                        separating us now save it be the hand of Har-hat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So much for Israelitish zeal! Thou hast been a pawn for her to play
                        during these months. Long ago had she surrendered if thou hadst
                        been—&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes smiled. &quot;She did not surrender. It was I.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thy faith?&quot; the murket asked in a voice low with
                        earnestness.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou hast said!&quot;</p>
                    <p>A dead silence ensued. Kenkenes may have awaited the outbreak with a
                        quickening of the heart, but it did not come. Instead, the murket sat down
                        on the bench and gazed at his son intently.</p>
                    <p>After a long interval he spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thus far had I hoped that thou wast taken by the Israelite but in
                        thy fancy. The hope was vain. Thou art in love with her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes endured the steady gaze and waited for Mentu to go on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is no help for thee now,&quot; the murket con- tinued
                        stoically, &quot;If the gods will but tolerate thee <pb id="VAA3882-475"
                            n="467"/> till the madness leaves thee after thou art wedded and
                        satisfied, it may be that thou wilt turn again to the faith of thy fathers.
                        But if I would fix thee in thine apostasy I should try to persuade thee
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, and further, I should be moved to urge thee into
                        heresy,&quot; calmly responded Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>The murket flung up one hand in a gesture of dis- sent, and arising, walked
                        toward the door of the work- room. There he leaned his shoulder against the
                        frame and looked out at the night. Presently Kenkenes went to him and laid
                        his hand on his sleeve.</p>
                    <p>The murket spoke first, proving what thoughts had been his during the little
                        space of silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is little patriotism in thee, Kenkenes. Thou wouldst wed with
                        one of Egypt&apos;s enemies and bow down to the God which has devastated
                        thy country.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The hand on his sleeve fell.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did Egypt to Israel for a hundred years be- fore these
                        miseries came to pass?&quot; Kenkenes asked. &quot;Let me tell thee
                        how Egypt hath used Rachel. She is free-born, of noble blood, even as thou
                        art and as I am. Her house was wealthy, the name powerful. There were ten of
                        her family—four of her mother&apos;s, six of her father&apos;s.
                        Rameses, the Incomparable Pha- raoh, had use for their treasure and need of
                        their labor in the brick-fields and mines. This day Rachel pos- sesses not
                        even her own soul and body, nor one gar- ment to cover herself, nor a single
                        kinsman to shield her from the power of her masters! Well for Egypt that the
                        God of Israel hath not demanded of Egypt treasure for treasure seized, toil
                        for toil compelled, lash for lash inflicted, blood for blood outpoured! This
                        desolation had been thrice desolate and Egypt&apos;s glory <pb
                            id="VAA3882-476" n="468"/> gone like the green grass in the breath of
                        the Kham in And yet would such justice restore to Rachel the love she lost,
                        the comfort that should have been hers? Nay, not even the sorcery of Mesu
                        might do that. The debt of Egypt to Rachel is most cheaply discharged by the
                        service of one life for the ten which were taken from her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let be; Israel shall cumber Egypt no longer,&quot; the murket
                        muttered after a little; &quot;and the quarrel be- tween them shall be
                        at an end. The hour approacheth when every Hebrew shall leave Egypt—shall be
                        driven forth if he leave it not willingly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thinkest thou so of a truth?&quot; Kenkenes asked
                        earnestly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth. Thou seest the plight of the nation. Can it endure
                        longer? And if thou takest this Israelite to wife—&quot; He paused
                        abruptly, for he had pressed the problem and a solution opened itself so
                        suddenly that it staggered him. Kenkenes understood the pause. Again he laid
                        his hand on the murket&apos;s sleeve.</p>
                    <p>&quot;On this very matter would I take counsel with thee, my
                        father,&quot; he said gently. &quot;The night grows, and my time is
                        short.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mentu turned an unhappy face toward his son and followed him back to the
                        bench they had left. He felt, intuitively, that there was further grave
                        purpose in the young man&apos;s mind and there was dread in his paternal
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou knowest, my father,&quot; Kenkenes began, &quot;that I
                        may not give over my love for Rachel. I am free to love her and she to love
                        me. There is no obstacle be- tween us. Such love, therefore, in the sight of
                        heaven, becometh a duty and carrieth duty with it. In the <pb
                            id="VAA3882-477" n="469"/> spirit I am as though I had been bound to her
                        by the marrying priests. Her griefs are mine to comfort, her wrongs mine to
                        avenge.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is gone and there are these three surmises as to her
                        whereabouts. She may have escaped and re- turned to Goshen; she may have
                        wandered to death in the Nile; she may have been taken by
                        Har-hat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He paused, and Mentu gazed fixedly at the lamp.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am going to Tanis,&quot; Kenkenes began, with forced
                        restraint.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wherefore?&quot; Mentu demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To discover if Har-hat hath taken her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If he hath the Lord God make iron of my hands till I strangle
                        him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Madman!&quot; Mentu exclaimed. &quot;Thou wilt be
                        flayed!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be assured that I shall earn the flaying! The pun- ishment shall be
                        no more savage than the deed that invites it! But enough of that. If I go to
                        Tanis and find her the spoil of the fan-bearer, thine augury will hold. I
                        return not to Memphis. . . . If she was lost in the Nile—!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay! Nay! put away the thought if it wrench thee so. No man removed
                        from his place during that night. We were caught and transfixed at what we
                        did. For three days I sat in the court, where I was overtaken by the
                        darkness, and in that time I stirred not except to slip down on the bench
                        and sleep. The palsy seized all Memphis likewise—not one of my neighbors
                        moved. But the resident Hebrews of the city seemed to have been warned, or
                        else the favor of their strange God was with them. For it is said they came
                        and went as they willed, carrying lamps.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-478" n="470"/>
                    <p>Kenkenes looked at his father with growing hope.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If that be true,&quot; he said eagerly, &quot;if the palsy
                        fell upon Egypt and not upon Israel, Rachel may have fled safely—she may
                        have escaped them!&quot; Mentu as- sented with a nod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She may have returned to her people,&quot; Kenkenes went on.
                        &quot;And if she be in Goshen I must reach her, find her, before her
                        people depart. Having found her-&quot; but Kenkenes stopped and made no
                        effort to resume. Mentu set his teeth, his hands clenched and his whole
                        figure seemed to denote intense physical restraint. Suddenly he whirled upon
                        his son.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou wilt go with her, out of Egypt?&quot; he de- manded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall go with her, out of Egypt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mentu gained his feet. &quot;And dost thou remember that while I live my
                        commands are yet law over thee?&quot; he continued in a tone of
                        increasing intensity. &quot;Mine it is to say whether thou shalt do this
                        thing or do it not!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned away and strode back to his post against the door-frame, his face
                        toward the night. Kenkenes had slowly risen to his feet. Not for an instant
                        did his father&apos;s authority appear to him as an obstacle. He knew
                        that the murket&apos;s outburst was a final stand be- fore capitulation.
                        Kenkenes was troubled only for what might follow after his father had
                        surrendered. He followed the murket to the door and laid his arm across the
                        broad shoulders.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father,&quot; he said persuasively. Mentu did not move.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at me, father,&quot; Kenkenes insisted. Still no movement.
                        The young man put his arm closer about <pb id="VAA3882-479" n="471"/> the
                        shoulders, and lifting his hand, would have turned the face toward him. But
                        the palm touched a wet cheek.</p>
                    <p>The murket had consented.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>An hour later, when it was far into the second watch, Kenkenes changed his
                        dress and made him- self presentable. Then, without further counsel with the
                        murket, he went silently and unseen to the portal of Senci&apos;s house.
                        After a long time, for her household had been asleep, he was admitted, and
                        the Lady Senci, perplexed and surprised, joined him in the chamber of
                        guests.</p>
                    <p>With few and simple words he told his story, pic- tured his father&apos;s
                        loneliness and, while she wept silent- ly, begged her to become his
                        father&apos;s wife—on the mor- row.</p>
                    <p>There was no long persuasion; the need of the oc- casion was sufficient
                        eloquence for the murket&apos;s noble love.</p>
                    <p>An hour after the next day&apos;s sunrise Mentu and Senci repaired
                        together to the temple, and when they returned Senci went not again into her
                        own house. In preparing for his departure, Kenkenes asked at the hands of
                        his father, not his patrimony, for that would have been an embarrassment of
                        wealth, but such portion of it as might be carried in small bulk. In
                        mid-afternoon Senci brought him a belt of gazelle- hide and in this had been
                        sewed a fortune in gems. The murket had given his son his full portion and
                        more.</p>
                    <p>At the close of day, with his face set and colorless, Kenkenes stepped into
                        the narrow passage before his <pb id="VAA3882-480" n="472"/>
                        father&apos;s house. The great portal closed slowly and noiselessly
                        behind him. He did not pause, but sprang into his chariot and was driven
                        rapidly away.</p>
                    <p>At a landing near the northern limits of Memphis he took a punt, bade
                        farewell to his sad-faced cha- rioteer and pushed off.</p>
                    <p>The broken bluffs about Memphis, the temples, the obelisks, the Sphinx, the
                        pyramids melted into night behind him. He kept his head down that he might
                        not look his last on his native city.</p>
                    <p>He had reached that point where endurance must conserve itself.</p>

                    <p>Once out of its confines the Nile divided its flood over and over again and
                        hunted the sea in long mean- derings over the flat Delta. A few miles above
                        On the separation began and continued to the marshy coast far to the north.
                        From the summit of the great towers of Bubastis and Sais the glistening
                        sinuosities of its branches might be discerned for many miles.</p>
                    <p>There was no thirst in the Delta. Nowhere did the capillary, the irrigation
                        canal, fail to reach, even now in the season of desolation and loss.
                        Half-green stubble, hail-mown and locust-eaten, showed where a wheat-field
                        had been. Regular, barren rows were the only evidences of the lentil and
                        garlic gardens in hap- pier days, and the location of pastures might be
                        guessed by the skeletons that whitened the uplands. Through fringes of
                        leafless palm trees, stone-rimmed pools, like splashes of quicksilver or
                        facets of sapphire, reflected the sky.</p>
                    <p>Half-way between On and Pa-Ramesu was one of these basins, elliptical in
                        shape and walled with rough limestone. Moss grew in the crevices of the
                        masonry and about it had been a sod of velvet grass. Black beetles slipped
                        in and out among the stones; dragon- flies hung over the surface of the
                        water and large ants <pb id="VAA3882-482" n="474"/> made erratic journeys
                        about the rough bark of the naked palms. Whoever came dipped his goblet
                        deep, for there the water was cold. If he gazed through to the bottom he
                        detected a convection in the sand below. This was not a reservoir, but a
                        well.</p>
                    <p>Once only had it failed, but then Hapi, the holy river, had been smitten
                        also.</p>
                    <p>The spring bubbled up at the division of a road. One branch led along the
                        northern bank of the Rame- side canal, eastward to Pa-Ramesu. The other
                        crossed the northwestern limits of Goshen and went toward Tanis, in the
                        northeast. Round about the little oasis were the dark circles where the turf
                        fires of many travelers had been. The merchants from the Orient entering
                        Egypt through the great wall of Rameses II, across the eastern isthmus,
                        passed this way going to Memphis. Here Philistine, Damascene, Ninevite and
                        Babylonian had halted; here Egyptian, Bedouin, Ara- bian and the dweller of
                        the desert had paused. The earth about the well was always damp, and the
                        top- most row- of the curb was worn smooth in hollows. This, therefore, was
                        a point common to native and alien, the home-keeping and the traveler, the
                        faithful and the unbeliever.</p>
                    <p>The strait of Egypt was sore and the aid of the gods essential. The priests
                        had seized upon the site as a place of prayers, placed a tablet there,
                        commanding them, and a soldier to see that the command was obeyed.</p>
                    <p>The soldier was in cavalry dress of tunic and tas- seled coif, with pike and
                        bull-hide shield and a light broadsword. He was no ordinary bearer of arms.
                        He walked like a man accustomed to command; he <pb id="VAA3882-483" n="475"
                        /> turned a cold eye upon too-familiar wayfarers and startled them into
                        silence by the level blackness of his low brows. Wealth, beauty, age nor
                        rank won servility or superciliousness from him. The Egyptian soldier was
                        not obliged to cringe, and this one abode by the privilege.</p>
                    <p>He was a man of one attitude, one mood and few words. The Memnon might as
                        well have been ex- pected to smile. The earliest riser found him there; the
                        latest night wanderer came upon him. When the day broke, after the falling
                        of the dreadful night, the brave or the thirsty who ventured forth saw him
                        at his post, silent, unastonished, unafraid.</p>
                    <p>Once only the soldier had been seen to flinch. Me- renra, now nomarch of
                        Bubastis, but whilom comman- der over Israel at Pa-Ramesu, paused one noon
                        with his train at the well. The governor glanced at the soldier, glanced
                        again, shrugged his shoulders and rode away. The man-at-arms winced, and
                        often thereafter stood in abstracted contemplation of the distance.</p>
                    <p>Just after sunrise on the second day following the passing of the darkness,
                        four Egyptians, lank, big- footed and brown, came from the northeast. By
                        their dress they had been prosperous rustics of the un-Is- raelite Delta.
                        But the healthful leanness, characteris- tic of the race, had become
                        emaciation; there was the studious unkemptness of mourning upon them, and
                        they, who had ridden once, before the plagues of mur- rain and hail,
                        traveled afoot.</p>
                    <p>They were evidently journeying to On, where the benevolence of Ra would feed
                        them.</p>
                    <p>They said nothing, looking a little awed at the sol- dier and puzzled at the
                        stela. The warrior read the <pb id="VAA3882-484" n="476"/> command and the
                        unlettered men fell on their knees, each to a different god. The Egyptian
                        was not ashamed of his piety nor did he closet himself to pray.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Incline the will of the Pharaoh to accord with the needs of the
                        hour, O thou Melter of Hearts!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rescue the kingdom, O thou Controller of Nations, tor it descendeth
                        into death and none succoreth itl&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Deal thou as thou deemest best with the destroyer of Egypt, O thou
                        Magistrate over Kings!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thus, in these fragments of prayers was it made manifest that the worm was
                        turning, apologetically, it is true, but surely. For once the prescribed
                        defense of the Pharaoh was ignored. &quot;It is not the fault of the
                        Child of the Sun, but his advisers, who are evil men and full of
                        guile.&quot; And in the odd perversity of fate for once its observance
                        would have been just.</p>
                    <p>Having fulfilled the command and relieved their souls, the four arose and
                        went their way, soft of foot and stately of carriage, after the manner of
                        all their countrymen.</p>
                    <p>Next, descending with a volley of yells, a rout of the nomad tribes, mounted
                        on horses, came from the southwest.</p>
                    <p>They were chiefly Bedouins, their women perched behind them with the tiniest
                        members of-their broods. But every child that could bestride a horse was
                        mount- ed independently. Whatever worldly possessions the nomads owned were
                        bound in numerous flat rolls on, other horses which they led.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hail!&quot; they shouted to the warrior, for the desert races
                        are prankish and unabashed. A younger among them, without wife or goods,
                        drew his gaunt horse back upon its scarred haunches and saluted the
                        soldier.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-485" n="477"/>
                    <p>&quot;Greeting, bearer of many arms!&quot; he said, and then
                        addressed a near-by companion as if he were rods away. &quot;Behold
                        leaden-toed Egypt, cumbered with de- ense:! Bull-hide for shield instead of
                        the safe remote- ness of distance, blade and pike for vulgar intimacy in
                        combat instead of the nice aloofness of the launched spear—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go to, thou prater!&quot; interrupted a companion. &quot;If
                        thou lovest Bedouin warfare so well, wherefore dost thou join thyself to the
                        Israelite who fights not at all?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Spoil!&quot; retorted the first, &quot;and new fields, O
                        waster of the air! Hast thou not heard of Canaan?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; shouted a third, &quot;he hath an eye only to
                        some heifer-eyed brickmaker among them!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The soldier moved forward to the group and ground- ed his pike. His attitude
                        interested them, and in the expectant silence he repeated the writing on the
                        tab- let.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So saith the writing,&quot; the first speaker began, but the
                        warrior interrupted him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It behooves thee to obey. Thou art yet within the reach of the
                        awkward arms of Egypt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;One against a troop of Bedouins,&quot; the trifler laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And there are a thousand within sound of my beaten
                        shield,&quot; was the harsh answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come,&quot; said an elder complacently, &quot;it does no
                        harm to ask the alleviation of any man&apos;s hurt, and it may keep us
                        whole for the journey into Canaan.&quot; He dismounted, and in a
                        twinkling the company, even to the babes, had followed his example. Each
                        dropped to his haunches, his hands spread upon his knees, and there was no
                        sound for a few minutes.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-486" n="478"/>
                    <p>Then they rose simultaneously and, flinging them- selves upon their horses,
                        departed as they came, like the whirlwind, over the road to Pa-Ramesu and
                        the heart of Goshen.</p>
                    <p>These were part of the mixed multitude that went with Israel.</p>
                    <p>The dust of their going had hardly settled before a drove of hosannahing
                        Israelites approached from the direction of the Nile. The soldier saw them
                        without seeming to see and, moving toward the tablet, a four- foot stela of
                        sandstone, planted himself against its inscribed face, and, resting his
                        pike, contemplated the west.</p>
                    <p>The ragged rout approached, singing and shouting, noisy and of doubtful
                        temper. A cloud of dust came with them and the odor of stall and of quarry
                        sweat.</p>
                    <p>Want plays havoc with the Oriental&apos;s appearance. It acutely
                        accentuates his already aggressive features and reduces his color to
                        ghastliness. The approach- ing Hebrews were studies of sharp angularity in
                        mon- ochrome, and the soul which showed in the eyes was no Longer a
                        spiritual but a ravenous thing.</p>
                    <p>Being something distinctly Egyptian, the soldier brought their actual temper
                        to the surface. They had suffered long, but their time had come.</p>
                    <p>The foremost flung themselves into his view and halted, hushed and amazed.
                        When those behind them tried to press forward with jeers, they turned with a
                        frown and a significant jerk of the head in the direc- tion of the
                        man-at-arms. These, also, subsided and passed along the sign of silence. A
                        leader in the front rank walked away and took a drink, using his hands as
                            <pb id="VAA3882-487" n="479"/> a cup. The whole silent herd followed and
                        did like- wise, solemnly and thoughtfully.</p>
                    <p>Presently the bolder began to whisper and conjec- ture among themselves,
                        hushing the sibilant surmises of the humbler with a cautioning frown. An old
                        man, who could not lower his voice, quavered a resolve to &quot;ask and
                        discover,&quot; and started toward the soldier to put his resolution
                        into effect. A wiry old woman seized him and drew him back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wilt thou humiliate him with thy notice, meddler?&quot; she
                        demanded in a fierce whisper. &quot;See him not, and it will be a mercy
                        to him in his hour of abasement,— him who hath been balsam to the wound of
                        Israel!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She turned about and took the road toward Pa- Ramesu, the unprotesting old
                        man trotting after her. The crowd followed, silent at first, then softly
                        talka- tive, and finally, in the distance, singing and noisy once again.</p>
                    <p>A careening camel, almost white in the early morn- ing sunshine, broke the
                        sky-line far up the road leading from Tanis in the north. Very much nearer,
                        to the west, two single litters, with a staff-bearing attendant, were
                        approaching.</p>
                    <p>The camel rider was a Hebrew by the beast that bore him. Egypt had no liking
                        for the bearer of the Orient&apos;s burdens and small acquaintance with
                        him. Likewise the litters were Hebraic, for the attendant was bearded. The
                        soldier kept his place before the stela and con- templated the distance.</p>
                    <p>The time was not long, though in that land of dis- tances the camel had far
                        to come from the horizon to the well, until by the soft jarring of the earth
                        the mo- <pb id="VAA3882-488" n="480"/> tionless sentinel knew that the
                        swifter traveler had arrived. Haste is not common in tropical countries, and
                        the camel had been put to his limit of speed. A commoner spirit than the
                        soldier&apos;s could not have re- sisted the impulses of curiosity
                        concerning this hot haste. But he did not turn his eyes.</p>
                    <p>The traveler alighted before his mount ceased to move, and undoing his
                        leathern belt with a jerk, he struck the camel a smart blow on the shoulder.
                        There was the protesting buzz of a large fly and an angry, disabled
                        blundering on the sand, silenced by the stamp of a sandal.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou wouldst have it, pest!&quot; the traveler exclaimed.
                        &quot;Thy kind is not to be persuaded from its blood-suck- ing by milder
                        means. Ye mind me of the Pharaoh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned toward the well, and his glance fell on the man-at-arms for the
                        first time. He started a little to find himself not alone, and a second.
                        time he started with sudden recognition. The well was between him and the
                        soldier. He leaned upon his hands on the top of the curb and gazed at his
                        opposite. Once he seemed about to speak, but the studious disregard of the
                        sol- dier deterred him. Slowly his eyes fell until they were directed
                        thoughtfully through his own reflection into the green depths of the
                        well.</p>
                    <p>Although there were ten years in favor of the Egyp- tian, there was a certain
                        similarity between the two men. Both were soldiers, both black and stem. But
                        one was a Hebrew, no less than forty-five yeafs of age.</p>
                    <p>He wore a helmet of polished metal, equipped with a visor, which, when
                        raised, finished the front with a flat plate. The top of the head-piece was
                        ornamented <pb id="VAA3882-489" n="481"/> with a spike. His armor was
                        complete—shirt of mail, shenti extending half-way to the knees, greaves of
                        brass and mailed shoes.</p>
                    <p>He was as tall as the Egyptian and as lean, but his structure was heavy,
                        stalwart and powerful. His fore- head was broad and bold, his eyes deep-set,
                        steel-blue and keen. He had the fighting nose, over-long and hooked like an
                        eagle&apos;s beak. The inexorable character of his features was borne
                        out by the mouth, thin-lipped and firm in its closing. Even hig beard, scant
                        and touched with gray, was intractable. Here was an Israelite who was a
                        warrior, a rare thing-but splendid when found.</p>
                    <p>After a pause he turned, and the camel knelt at his command. The litters had
                        halted a little distance away under two palms that leaned their leafless
                        crowns together. The attendant was hastening toward the well.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Joshua!&quot; he cried joyously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even I,&quot; the Hebrew soldier said, walking around the
                        kneeling beast. &quot;Peace to thee, Caleb.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The two men embraced; the warrior imperturbably, the attendant tearfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What dost thou away from Goshen?&quot; Joshua asked,
                        disengaging himself. &quot;The faithful of Israel have been summoned
                        thither from the remotenesses of Miz- raim.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Caleb did not hear, having caught sight of the Egyptian.&apos; The
                        recognition startled him as it had all the others, but he did not hold his
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Atsu!&quot; he exclaimed. Joshua checked him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Vex him not with attention,&quot; he said in a lowered <pb
                            id="VAA3882-490" n="482"/> tone. &quot;His fall hath been great, but
                        it hath not killed his pride. He would speak if it hurt him to be unre-
                        membered.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hath he a grudge against us?&quot; Caleb asked in as-
                        tonishment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, look thou at the writing on the tablet. He would hide its
                        command from us. Is he not a friend to Israel still?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He indicated the characters on either side of the soldier. The words were
                        disconnected, but the sense was easily guessed. The command for prayers to
                        the Pantheon of Egypt was not hidden, beyond conjecture, from the
                        discerning. Caleb saw the meaning of the inscription, but looked to Joshua
                        for further enlighten- ment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He would spare us,&quot; the abler Israelite said:
                        &quot;Let us return the kindness and see him not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>All this had the Egyptian heard, but his eyes, fixed so absently on the
                        horizon, seemed to indicate that he was not conscious of his
                        surroundings.</p>
                    <p>Joshua repeated his question.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was sent forth with Miriam,&quot; Caleb made an- swer.
                        &quot;She hath been abroad, gathering up the scat- tered
                        chosen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His eyes brightened and he clasped his hands with the gesture of a happy
                        woman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Deliverance is at handle Doubt it not, O Son of Nun! We go
                        forth!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>On the camel were hung a shield, a javelin and a quiver of arrows. Joshua
                        jostled the arrows in their case before answering.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not as the moon changes,&quot; he said grimly. &quot;The
                            <pb id="VAA3882-491" n="483"/> time for mild departure is past and the
                        word of the Lord God unto Moses must be fulfilled.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So we but go,&quot; Caleb assented, &quot;I care not. And
                        such is the temper of all Israel—nay,&quot; he broke off,
                        conscientiously; &quot;there is an exception, an unusual ex-
                        ception.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There may be more,&quot; Joshua replied. &quot;There is
                        much in Egypt to hold the slavish. But the captain of Israel hath called me,
                        out of peaceful shepherd life, to the severe fortunes of a warrior, and I
                        go, no mile too short, no moment too swift, that shall speed me into
                        Pa-Ramesu.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And thou takest up arms for Israel?&quot; Caleb cried.
                        &quot;Ah! but Moses hath gloved his right hand in mail, in thee, O Son
                        of Nun! But,&quot; he continued, uneasy with his story untold,
                        &quot;this was no slavish content under a master. Rather did it come
                        from one of the best of Israel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Strange that the lofty of Israel should regret a departure from the
                        land of the oppressors.&quot; Joshua set- tLd himself on the camel and
                        the tall beast rose to its fet with a lurch.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so,&quot; Caleb answered, patting the nose of the canrel
                        and arranging the tassels of its halter. &quot;It was a quarry-slave, a
                        maiden and of gentle blood among the nobility of Israel. She is in the
                        bamboo litter, Miriam is in the other.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We are come from farthest Egypt, fifty of us in three
                        barges,&quot; he began. &quot;To Syene have we been and all the
                        Nilotic towns. To Nehapehu, and even deep into the Great Oasis were
                        messengers sent, for we would not leave a single son of Abraham behind. <pb
                            id="VAA3882-492" n="484"/> And the masters surrendered them to a man!
                        Was it the face of Miriam or the fear of Moses or the might of the Lord that
                        tamed them? Hath Miriam a com- pelling glance, or Moses a power that came
                        not from Jehovah? Nay, not so. Praised be His holy name!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The mild Israelite clasped his hands and raised his eyes devoutly. But
                        fearful lest his pause might fur- nish an opportunity for Joshua&apos;s
                        escape, he continued at once:</p>
                    <p>&quot;We were descending the Nile, below Memphis; the river sang and the
                        hills lifted up their voices. There was rejoicing in the meadows and
                        clapping of hands in the valleys. We possessed the gates of our enemies and
                        Mizraim sat upon the shores and wept after us.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Below Masaarah, the darkness fell; the sun per- ished in the
                        morning and the stars were not sum- moned in the night, for the Lord had
                        withdrawn the lights of heaven. But His hand was upon the waters and His
                        glory stood about us and we feared not.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And lo! there came a call upon Him from the shores to the east. The
                        barge of Miriam paused and from the land we succored an Israelitish maiden.
                        But when we would have moved on, she flung herself be- fore Miriam and
                        besought her:</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Depart not yet, for there is another.&apos;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Of the chosen?&apos; the prophetess asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Nay, an Egyptian, but better and above his
                        kind.&apos;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Of the faith?&apos; Miriam asked further. And the
                        maiden faltered and said, &apos;Nay, not yet—but worthy and
                        kindly.&apos;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But the prophetess bade the men at the poles to <pb
                            id="VAA3882-493" n="485"/> Continue, saying: &apos;Shall we cheat
                        Jehovah in his in- tent and rescue an oppressor?&apos;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But the maiden clung about the knees of Miriam. and prayed to her,
                        while the prophetess said, &apos;Nay, nay&apos; and
                        &apos;Peace,&apos; and sought to soothe her, and when at that moment
                        some one called out of the darkness, she put her hand over the
                        maiden&apos;s mouth and would not let her answer. And the barge went
                        swiftly away. Then the maiden fell on her face, like one dead, and she will
                        not be comforted.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Joshua drew himself into securer position on the camel and shook its
                        harness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Love!&quot; he said with a frown. &quot;The evilest tie and
                        the strongest between Israel and Mizraim!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; Caleb protested, &quot;thou hast
                        loved.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A daughter of Israel,&quot; the warrior answered. bluntly.
                        &quot;Dost thou follow me into Goshen, Caleb?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, we go on to Tanis, where we shall join Moses and Aaron who lie
                        there awaiting the Pharaoh&apos;s sum- mons.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The parting shall not be long between thee and me, then. Peace to
                        thee, Caleb. To Miriam, greeting and peace.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The warrior urged his camel and, rounding the stela-guarding soldier who had
                        stood within ear-shot of the narrative, he was gone in a long undulating
                        swing up the road that led to Pa-Ramesu.</p>
                    <p>Caleb gazed after him until he was only a tall. shape like the stroke of a
                        pen in the distance. Then the mild Israelite looked longingly at the
                        Egyptian, and finally returned to the litters. These in a mo- ment were
                        shouldered by the bearers and moved out <pb id="VAA3882-494" n="486"/> up
                        the road toward Tanis. Caleb walked before them, dotting every other
                        footprint with the point of his staff. He sighed gustily and sank his
                        bearded chin on his breast.</p>
                    <p>The soldier turned his head as soon as the attendant had passed and gazed at
                        the litters.</p>
                    <p>The Hebrew bearers of the foremost, were four in number, dressed in the garb
                        of serving-men to noble Israel. The hangings of blue linen had been thrust
                        aside and within was the semi-recumbent figure of a woman. One knee was
                        drawn up, the hands clasped behind the head, but the majesty of the august
                        coun- tenance belied the youth of the posture. The eyes of the woman met
                        those of the Egyptian and lighted With recognition. She lowered her arms and
                        crossed the left to the shoulder of the right. It was the old attitude of
                        deference from Israel to Atsu. A dusky red dyed the man&apos;s cheeks
                        and he touched his knee in response.</p>
                    <p>The litter of Miriam passed.</p>
                    <p>The next was a light frame of jungle bamboo, borne by a pair of young men.
                        Its sides were latticed, with the exception of two small window-like
                        openings on either side. These were hung with white linen, but the drapings
                        had been put aside to admit the morning air.</p>
                    <p>The soldier looked and the shock of recognition drew him a pace away from the
                        stela.</p>
                    <p>The head of a young girl, partly turned from him, was framed in the small
                        window. The wimple had been thrown back and a single tress of golden hair
                        had escaped across the forehead. The countenance was <pb id="VAA3882-495"
                            n="487"/> unhappy, but beautiful for all its misery. The lids were
                        heavy, as if weighted down with sorrow; the cheeks were pallid, the lips
                        colorless and pathetically drooped. A white hand, resting on the slight
                        frame of the small opening, was tightly clenched.</p>
                    <p>The picture was one of weary despair.</p>
                    <p>The soldier, blanched and shaken, took a step for- ward as if to speak, but
                        some realization brought him back to rigid attention against the stela.</p>
                    <p>The light litter passed on.</p>
                    <p>The regular tread of the men grew fainter and fainter and silence settled
                        again about the well.</p>
                    <p>The soldier stood erect, gray-faced and immovable, his eyes fixed, his teeth
                        set, his hand gripping the pike, till the insects, reassured, began to chirr
                        close about him. Then his lids quivered; the pike leaned in his grasp; his
                        jaw relaxed, weakly. He shifted his posi- tion and frowned, flung up his
                        head and resumed his vigil. The moments went on and yet he retained his
                        tense posture. The hour passed and with it his phys- ical endurance.</p>
                    <p>Then his emotion gathered all its forces, all the com- pelling sensations of
                        disappointment, rebuff, heart- hurt, jealousy, hopelessness, and stormed his
                        soul. He turned about and, stretching his arms across the top of the stela,
                        hid his face and surrendered.</p>
                    <p>Around him was the unbroken circle of the earth and above the blue desert of
                        sky, solitary, soundless. And the union of earth and heaven, like a mundane
                        and spiritual collusion, lay between him and the little litter.</p>
                    <p>The beat of a horse&apos;s hoofs in the distance roused <pb
                            id="VAA3882-496" n="488"/> him after a long time, and hastily turning
                        his back toward the new-comer, he resumed at once his sol- dierly
                        attitude.</p>
                    <p>The traveler bore down on him from the west and reined his horse at the
                        intersection of the two roads. He looked up the straight highway toward Pa-
                        Ramesu, then turned in the saddle and gazed toward Tanis. His indecision was
                        not a wayfarer&apos;s casual Shesitarity in the choice of roads. By the
                        anxiety writ- ten on his face, life, fortune or love might be at stake upon
                        the correct selection of route. Once or twice he looked at the soldier, but
                        showed no inclination to ask advice, even had the man-at-arms turned his
                        way.</p>
                    <p>It was one of fate&apos;s opportunities to be gracious. Here was Kenkenes
                        seeking for the maiden whom he and the soldier loved, and it lay in the
                        power of the unelect to direct the fortunate. But Kenkenes did not know the
                        warrior, and Atsu had no desire to turn his unhappy face to the new-comer.
                        The young man grew more and more troubled, his indecision more marked.
                        Suddenly he dropped the reins, and without guiding the horse, urged the
                        animal forward.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes was relying on chance for direction.</p>
                    <p>Confused and unready the horse awaited the intelli- gent touch on the bridle.
                        It did not come. He flung up his head and smelt the wind. Nervously he
                        stamped and trod in one place, breathing loudly in protest.</p>
                    <p>The low voice of his rider continued to urge him.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the wind from Goshen brought the smell of unblighted pastures.
                        Whatever the reason, the horse turned, with uncertainty in his step and took
                        the road eastward to Pa-Ramesu.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-497" n="489"/>
                    <p>Having chosen, he went confidently, and as he was not halted and was young
                        and swift, he increased his pace to a long run.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile far to the north the little litter was borne toward Tanis. And
                        Atsu, the warrior, did not move his eyes from the distant point where it had
                        disap- peared over the horizon.</p>

                    <p>The morning of the second day after the lifting of the darkness lay golden
                        over Egypt, blue-shadowed before the houses and trees to the west and
                        shimmer- ing and illusory toward the east. A slow-moving, fragmentary cloud
                        had gathered in the zenith just after dawn and for many minutes over the
                        northern part of Goshen there had been a perpendicular down- pour of
                        illuminated rain. Now the sky was as clear and blue as a sapphire and the
                        little wind was bur- dened with odorous scents from the clean-washed pas-
                        tures of Israel.</p>
                    <p>Seti had crossed the border into Goshen at day- break and was now well into
                        the grazing-lands, yet scintillating with the rain. The hoofs of his fat
                        little horse were patched with wet sand of the roadway and there was no dust
                        on the prince&apos;s modest raiment. Behind the youth plodded two
                        heavy-headed, limp- eared sumpter-mules, driven by a big-boned black.</p>
                    <p>Seti was not far from his destination, an obscure village of image-makers
                        directly south of Tanis and situated on the northern border of Goshen. The
                        same region that furnished clay to Israel for Egypt&apos;s bricks
                        afforded material for terra-cotta statuettes.</p>
                    <p>Ahead of him were fields with clouds of sheep upon <pb id="VAA3882-499"
                            n="491"/> the uplands and cattle standing under the shade of dom-palms.
                        Here and there hovels with thatches no higher than a man&apos;s head, or
                        low tents, dark with long use, and lifted at one side, stood in a setting of
                        green. About them were orderly and productive gardens. Nowhere was any sign
                        of the desolation that prevailed over Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Seti looked upon the beautiful prosperity of Goshen at first with the natural
                        delight loveliness inspires, and then with as much savage resentment as his
                        young soul could feel. Belting this garden and stretching for seven hundred
                        miles to the south, was Egypt, desolate, barren and comatose. The God of the
                        Hebrews had avenged them fearfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They had provocation,&quot; he muttered to himself;
                        &quot;but they have overdone their vengeance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A figure appeared on the road over the comb of a slight ridge, and Seti
                        regarded the wayfarer with in-&apos; terest.</p>
                    <p>He was a Hebrew. His draperies were loose, vo- luminous, heavily fringed, and
                        of such silky texture of linen that they flowed in the light wind. His head
                        was covered with a wide kerchief, which was bound with a cord, and hid the
                        forehead.</p>
                    <p>He was of good stature and upright, but his drap- ings were so ample that the
                        structure of his frame was not discernible. His eyes were black, bright and
                        young in their alertness, but the beard that rippled over his breast to his
                        girdle was as white as the foam of the Middle Sea.</p>
                    <p>The Hebrew walked in the grass by the roadside and came on, his face
                        expectant. At sight of the prince he stepped into the roadway. Seti drew up. </p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-500" n="492"/>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art Seti-Meneptah?&quot; the ancient wayfarer asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so,&quot; the prince answered.</p>
                    <p>The Hebrew put back his kerchief and stood uncov- ered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dost thou know me, my son?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art that Aaron, of the able tongue, brother to Mesu. Camest
                        thou forth to meet me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Hebrew readjusted the kerchief.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast said.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wast thou, then, so impatient? Where is thy brother?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay. The village of image-makers is not safe. Moses hath departed
                        for Zoan.&quot;<ref id="ref_Y" target="note_Y">*</ref></p>
                    <p>&quot;And named thee in his stead. But his mission to my
                        father&apos;s capital bodes no good. He might have stayed until I could
                        have persuaded him into friend- ship.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not with all thy gold!&quot; said Aaron gravely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, I had not meant that,&quot; Seti rejoined with some
                        resentment. &quot;If Egypt&apos;s plight can not win mercy from him
                        by its own piteousness, the treasure I bring is not enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Hebrew waved his hand as if to dismiss the subject.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let us not dispute so old a quarrel,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;We have a new sorrow, thou and I.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of Mesu&apos;s sending?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, of thine own misplaced trust.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What!&quot; the prince exclaimed. &quot;Have I clothed thy
                        kinsman with more grace than he owns?&quot;</p>

                    <pb id="VAA3882-501" n="493"/>
                    <p> &quot;Thou hast put faith in thine enemy. A woman hath deceived
                        thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What dost thou tell me?&quot; Seti cried, leaping to the ground
                        and angrily confronting Aaron.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A truth,&quot; the Hebrew answered calmly. &quot;The
                        Princess Ta-user is a fugitive charged with treason.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Seti turned cold and smote his forehead. &quot;Undone through
                        me!&quot; he groaned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so, my son. Thou art undone through her. She betrayed
                        thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Seti turned upon him with a fierce movement.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Peace!&quot; the Hebrew interrupted the furious speech on the
                        prince&apos;s lips. &quot;I bear thee no malice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will give ear to no tales against the princess,&quot; Seti
                        avowed with ire.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy blind trust hath already wrought havoc with thee. Let it not
                        bring heavy punishment upon thy head. Thou hast dealt kindly with me, and I
                        am beholden to thee. Give me leave to discharge my debt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The prince looked stubbornly at Aaron for a mo- ment, but the doubt that had
                        begun to assert itself in his mind clamored for proof or refutation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say on,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The story is long,&quot; the Hebrew explained mildly,
                        &quot;and the sun is ardent. There are friends in yonder house. Let us
                        ask the shelter of their roof for an hour.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gathering his robes about him with peculiar grace, he went through the grass
                        toward a low, capacious tent, pitched by a trickling branch of the great
                        canal. Seti followed moodily.</p>
                    <p>A black-haired Israelitish woman, sitting on the <pb id="VAA3882-502" n="494"
                        /> earth before the lifted side of the tent, arose, and rev- erently kissed
                        the hem of Aaron&apos;s robes. Her dark- eyed brood appeared at various
                        angles of the tent, and at a sign and a word from the woman they did obei-
                        sance and hailed the ancient visitor in soft Hebrew.</p>
                    <p>After a short colloquy between Aaron and the woman of Israel, the children
                        were dismissed to play in the fields and the woman carried the bowl and
                        basket of lentils out of ear-shot of her house.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let us enter,&quot; Aaron said, with an inclination of his head
                        toward Seti. He stooped and preceded the young man into the home of the
                        Hebrew.</p>
                    <p>The prince saw the black dispose himself on the grass outside, with his eyes
                        upon the sumpter-mule.</p>
                    <p>Aaron sat upon one of the rugs, and Seti, following his example, took
                        another.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say on,&quot; the prince urged.</p>
                    <p>The Hebrew began at once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What I tell thee, O my son, will soon be talked abroad over the
                        land. But if thou hast a doubt in thy heart, and art like to question my
                        truth-speaking, there are witnesses I may summon, such as no wise man will
                        deny. And these be Jambres, and the twelve priests of the cities of the
                        north, and the innkeeper at Pithom, also the governor over the
                        treasure-city, his soldiers, and others, who know the secret by now.</p>
                    <p>&apos;&quot;I will give thee the tale now, and the proof there-
                        after, if thou believest me not.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Last night, I lay under the tent of a son of Israel, at Pithom.
                        When I arose, two hours before dawn, horsemen began to gallop through the
                        city toward the south. The inhabitants were aroused; there was much running
                        to and fro, and the inn was full of lights.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-503" n="495"/>
                    <p>&quot;We approached, and when the tumult had. died and the Egyptians were
                        so full of the tidings that they were glad to relieve themselves even to an
                        Israelite, I asked and learned this story. Many times after- ward, on my way
                        hither, I heard it from the lips of men whom I passed, so I am not
                        deceived.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Seven days agone, under an evil star, a veiled woman came to the
                        temple of Bast, in the village of image-makers, and made offerings to the
                        idol. She remained in the shrine, praying, for a time without reason, as
                        though she pretended to worship, until a certain space should elapse. At the
                        end of the hour in which she came, another woman, closely covered, her mouth
                        hidden, entered and knelt near her. In a little they arose and went forth
                        together, and Jambres, who is priest at the little temple, grown suspicious
                        by reason of their behavior, looked after them. The wind swayed the garments
                        of the second stranger, and showed the foot and ankle of a man. Filled with
                        won- derment, Jambres laid aside his priest&apos;s robes and garb- ing
                        himself like a wayfarer, followed. They left the village, going east where
                        the road leadeth along the canal, which is hidden by the sprouts of young
                        trees. Farther up the way were servitors who waited for the man and woman,
                        but the two stepped out of ear-shot, and sat by the road to talk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jambres, hidden in the fringe of bushes behind, heard them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They laid a snare. And thou, O Prince, wast to be trapped
                        therein.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Seti&apos;s eyes were veiled and his face showed a height- ening of
                        color.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou wast to come to the temple in the village of <pb
                            id="VAA3882-504" n="496"/> image-makers with treasure to give into the
                        hands of Moses. Thy message to my brother was to be deliv- ered by the
                        Princess Ta-user. She delivered it not. The word she should have brought
                        came to Moses by a son of Belial, a godless Hebrew, sent by Jambres, for the
                        brotherhood of priests would have had Moses come to the temple, for their
                        own ends. But the serv- ants of the Lord God of Israel are keen-eyed and
                        they know a jackal from a hare. However, these matters I did not hear from
                        the people. Such secret things are not discussed upon the streets. All that
                        I heard in Pithom may be talked openly over Egypt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The man and the woman laid their plans, and they were these: Last
                        night, the man and his servants were to lie at Pithom, and to-day they were
                        to meet thee at the temple of Bast, overpower thee, take thy treasure and,
                        with the woman, fly to some secure place. With the treasure they were to
                        hire them soldiers— mercenaries, and take arms against the king, thy
                        father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The speaker paused again. Seti&apos;s breast labored and his gaze was
                        fixed upon the Hebrew.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The ire of Jambres was kindled against the plot- ters, and he
                        called an assembly of the priests within short distances from the village of
                        image-makers and laid his discoveries before them. They pledged them- selves
                        to proceed to Pithom last night, which was the night they came together in
                        council, and take the traitors. But one among their number, a young priest
                        who knew the woman, played them false, entered the city before his fellows
                        and warned the plotters. They had fled, with the priests in pursuit.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-505" n="497"/>
                    <p>&quot;My son, the man was Siptah, son of Amon-meses; the woman, the
                        Princess Ta-user.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The prince&apos;s face took on an insane beauty. In each cheek was a
                        scarlet stain—his lips smiled without part- ing and his eyes glittered. He
                        did not question the Hebrew&apos;s story. Something within him
                        corroborated every word. He sprang to his feet and with an un- natural laugh
                        flung his hand above his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, by Horus,&quot; he cried, &quot;I must get back to
                        Tanis. I would ask the pardon of Rameses!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Aaron arose and laid detaining hands upon him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did not tell thee this, that I might be a bearer of evil tidings.
                        I came forth to meet thee, that thou mayest save thyself. Far be it from me
                        to bring mis- fortune upon Israel&apos;s one friend in Egypt&apos;s
                        high places. Return to Tanis with all speed and take the treasure with thee.
                        Then only will the intent rest against thee—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so,&quot; Seti interrupted harshly. &quot;Wilt thou rob
                        me of the one balm to my humiliation? Wilt thou de- feat me also in the one
                        good deed I would do? Take thou the treasure and be glad that it fell not
                        into the hands of the wanton. Let me depart.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Aaron was planted in his way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Knowest thou not what they will do with thee? Thou wouldst have
                        given aid to. the enemy of Egypt. Thou knowest the penalty. Sooner would
                        Israel make it a garment of sackcloth and feed upon alms, than yield thee up
                        to thine enemies for thy gold&apos;s sake—&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Seti would not hear him. &quot;I care not what they do with
                        me,&quot; he said. &quot;The gods grant they lay upon me the extreme
                        weight of the law. I go back to Tanis as one returneth to his
                        beloved.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-506" n="498"/>
                    <p>He shook off the Israelite&apos;s hands and ran into the open. There, he
                        ordered the black to give the treasure over to the Hebrew, and flinging
                        himself upon his horse, galloped furiously toward Tanis.</p>
                    <p>Of the remainder of the day Seti had little memory. Once or twice as he
                        proceeded headlong through ham- lets, he caught from the lips of natives a
                        denunciation of Siptah, a vicious epithet applied to Ta-user, or, like a
                        fresh thrust in an old wound, a pitying groan for himself. His shame had
                        preceded him on fleet wings. He hoped he might as swiftly run his sentence
                        down.</p>
                    <p>None knew him in the roadways and the towns did not expect him. The pickets
                        on the outer wall of Tanis halted him, but when they beheld his face, their
                        pikes fell and with hands on knees, they bade him pass. The palace sentries
                        started and gave him room.</p>
                    <p>He was running, sobbing, through the dark and ea- pacious corridors of the
                        palace and no man had stayed him yet. Were they to make his shame more
                        poignant by pitying him and punishing him not at all? He flung himself
                        through the doors of the council cham- ber and halted.</p>
                    <p>The great hall was crowded and full of excitement. Meneptah had summoned the
                        court to the royal pres- ence.</p>
                    <p>In his loft above the throng stood the king, purple with rage. The queen, in
                        her place at his side, was staying his outstretched hand. Below at his right
                        stood Rameses, the kingliest presence that ever graced a royal sitting. At
                        the left of Meneptah, was Har-hat, complacent and serene.</p>
                    <p>Out in the center of a generous space stood Moses.</p>
                    <p>The great Hebrew was alone and isolated, but his <pb id="VAA3882-507" n="499"
                        /> personality was such that a throng could not have obscured him.</p>
                    <p>In his massive physique was an insistent suggestion of immovability and
                        superhuman strength; in the shape of his imperial head, there was
                        illimitable ca- pacity; in his face, the image of a nature commanding the
                        entire range of feeling, from the finest to the fiercest. There was nothing
                        of the occult in his atmos- phere. His intense human force would have com-
                        manded, though Egypt had not known him as the emis- sary of God.</p>
                    <p>As it was, when he moved the assembly swayed back as if blown by a wind. A
                        motion of his hand sent a nervous start over the hall. The nearest cour-
                        tiers seemed prepared to crouch. Meneptah did not win a glance from his
                        court. Every eye, wide and expectant, was fixed upon the Israelite.</p>
                    <p>The pale and troubled queen strove ii vain. Me- neptah thrust her aside and
                        shaking his clenched hand at the solitary figure before him, ended the
                        audience in a voice violent with fury.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Get thee from me! Take heed to thyself; see my face no more. For in
                        that day thou seest my face, thou shalt die!&quot;</p>
                    <p>After the speech, the silence fell, deepened, grew ominous. None breathed,
                        and the overwrought nerves of the court reached the limit of endurance.</p>
                    <p>Then Moses answered. His tones were quiet, his voice full of a calm more
                        terrifying than an outburst had been.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast spoken well,&quot; he said. &quot;I will see thy
                        face no more.,</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-508" n="500"/>
                    <p>Another breathless silence and he turned, the cour- tiers shrinking from his
                        way, and passed out of the hall.</p>
                    <p>At the doors, his eyes fell upon Seti. He made no sign of surprise. Indeed
                        his glance seemed to indicate that he expected the prince. He raised his
                        hand and extended it for a moment over the boy&apos;s head, and went
                        forth.</p>
                    <p>The strength went from Seti&apos;s limbs, the passion from his brain, and
                        when Rameses with grim purpose in his face beckoned him, he obeyed meekly
                        and pros- trated himself before the angry king.</p>

                    <p>The distance by highway between Memphis and Tanis was eighty miles, a little
                        more than two days&apos; journey by horseback.</p>
                    <p>Masanath had required two weeks to accomplish that distance. She refused to
                        travel except in the cool of the morning and of the afternoon; if she felt
                        the fatigue of an hour&apos;s journey, she rested a day at the next
                        town; she consulted astrologers, and moved for- ward only under propitious
                        signs; she insisted on fol- lowing the Nile until she was opposite Tanis,
                        instead of taking the highway at On and continuing across the Delta.</p>
                    <p>The most of her following walked, and she proceeded at the pace of her
                        plodding servants.</p>
                    <p>She spoke of her freedom as though she went to meet doom; she gazed on the
                        sorry fields and pastures of Egypt as though the four walls of a prison were
                        soon to shut out heaven and earth from her eyes.</p>
                    <p>She was now within ten miles of Tanis, fourteen days after her departure from
                        Memphis.</p>
                    <p>Four solemn Ethiopians bore her litter upon their shoulders, and another
                        waved a fan of black ostrich plumes over her. The litter was of glittering
                        ebony, hung with purple, tasseled with gold. At her right, <pb
                            id="VAA3882-510" n="502"/> was Unas; at her left, Nari. Behind her were
                        dusky attendants and sooty sumpter-mules.</p>
                    <p>Her robes were white, and very fine, but there was no henna on her nails, nor
                        kohl beneath her lids, nor jewels in her hair. So she would prove that,
                        though she was a coming queen, she was not glad of it. Hers was not the
                        spirit that hides its trouble and enamels the exterior with false flushes
                        and smiles. She envel- oped herself in her feelings. She tinctured her voice
                        with them; she made her eyes languid with them; and the touch of her hand,
                        the curve of her lips and the droop of her head were eloquent of them.</p>
                    <p>By this time, she had despaired. There was yet an opportunity to spend
                        another day covering the re- maining ten miles, but she would loiter no
                        longer. She was tired, of a truth.</p>
                    <p>It was near sunset when a company of royal guards, under Menes, rode up from
                        the north.</p>
                    <p>The captain flung himself from his horse and hur- ried to Masanath&apos;s
                        litter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Holy Isis! Lady Masanath,&quot; he exclaimed; &quot;where
                        in all Egypt hast thou hidden thyself these fourteen days? The whole army of
                        the north hath been searching after thee, and Rameses hath raved like a
                        madman since that day long past on which thou shouldst have arrived in
                        Tanis.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have been on the way,&quot; she answered loftily.
                        &quot;The haste of the prince is unseemly. I would not fatigue myself
                        nor court disaster by incautiousness, these perilous days.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Menes bowed. &quot;I am reproved, and contrite. I forgot that I spoke
                        with my queen. But I am most grateful that thou didst permit me to find
                        thee, for <pb id="VAA3882-511" n="503"/> Rameses sent me fofth an hour
                        since, with the hard alternative of fetching thee to him or losing my head.
                        But that he was sure of my success is proved by the litter he sent between
                        two horses for thee. Wilt thou leave this and proceed in the
                        other?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath answered by extending her hand to him.</p>
                    <p>Three of the soldiers laid their cloaks on the earth for her feet; six others
                        let down the litter and Menes assisted her into the sumptuous conveyance
                        Rameses had sent.</p>
                    <p>Another soldier, after rapid and low-spoken instruc- tions from the captain,
                        whirled his horse about, saluted and took the road toward Tanis at a
                        gallop.</p>
                    <p>The six shouldered the litter of the crown princess- to-be, Menes mounted his
                        horse and rode beside her; Unas, her Memphian train, and the riderless
                        horses were left to bring up the rear, and Masanath continued to the
                        capital.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perchance, thou hast been famished these fourteen days in the
                        matter of court-gossip,&quot; the captain said. &quot;Wherefore I am
                        come as thy informant with such news as thou shouldst know. For, being
                        ignorant of the infelicities in the household of the king, it may be that
                        thou wouldst ask after the little prince, Seti, and wherefore the queen
                        appears no more at the side of the Pharaoh, nor speaks with thy lord nor
                        sees thy noble father; and furthermore, where Ta-user hath taken herself and
                        other things which would embarrass thee to hear answered
                        openly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath roused herself and prepared to listen. Serious words from the lips
                        of the light-hearted cap- tain were not common, and when he spoke in that
                        manner it was time to take heed.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-512" n="504"/>
                    <p>&quot;I had heard of the little prince&apos;s misfortune and of the
                        treason of Ta-user and her party, and the placing of a price upon her head;
                        but nothing more hath come to mine ears. Is there more, of a
                        truth?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Remember, I pray thee,&quot; the captain replied, rid- ing near
                        to her, &quot;that I bring thee this for thine own sake—not for the love
                        of tale-bearing. On the counsel of Rameses, this day the Pharaoh sentenced
                        Seti to banishment for a year to the mines of Libya—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To the mines!&quot; Masanath cried in horror.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not as a laborer. Nay, the sentence was not so harsh. But as a
                        scribe to the governor over them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It matters little!&quot; she declared indignantly.
                        &quot;The boy-prince—the poor, misguided young brother sent to a year of
                        banishment—a lifelong humiliation Libya, the death-country! Now, was
                        anything more brutal? Nay, it is like Rameses!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye,&quot; the captain replied quickly,-leaning over her with a
                        cautioning motion of his hand. &quot;Aye, and it is like thee to say it.
                        But hear me yet further. The queen and the Son of Ptah have quarreled,
                        violently, over Seti,&quot; he continued in a low tone. &quot;The
                        little prince merited thy father&apos;s disfavor, because Seti es-
                        poused the cause of Ta-user in thy place, though he loves thee, and for
                        that-we can find no other reason -the noble Har-hat also urged the king into
                        the harsh sentence of the little prince. For this the queen hath publicly
                        turned her back upon the crown prince and the fan-bearer, and the atmosphere
                        of the palace is most unhappy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He lowered his voice to a whisper. &quot;Hotep cham- pioned Seti,—for the
                        young sister&apos;s sake, it would <pb id="VAA3882-513" n="505"/>
                        appear,—but to me it seemeth that the scribe hath lost his
                        wits.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It would seem that he courteth a sentence to the mines likewise,
                        and he needs but to go on as he hath begun to succeed most thoroughly. And
                        it behooveth his friends to prevent him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took Masanath&apos;s hand and, leaning from the saddle, whispered:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ye are under the same roof-thou and Hotep. Avoid him as though he
                        were a pestilence.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He straightened himself and drew his horse away from her so that she could
                        not answer.</p>
                    <p>The captain&apos;s meaning, though obscure to any other that might have
                        heard him, was very clear to Masa- nath. Har-hat was still holding a threat
                        of Hotep&apos;s undoing over his daughter&apos;s head, lest, at the
                        last mo- ment, she rebel against her marriage. She trembled, realizing how
                        desperately she was weighted with the safety of the scribe. Her fear for him
                        brought the first feeling of willingness to wed with kameses that she had
                        ever experienced. Distasteful as marriage was to her, it was a species of
                        sacrifice to be catalogued with the many self-abnegations of which womanhood
                        is capable when the welfare of the beloved is at stake.</p>
                    <p>She sank back in the shadows of her litter, covered her face with her hands
                        and shuddered because of the imminence of her trial.</p>
                    <p>So they journeyed on, till at last Masanath fell asleep—not from
                        indifference,&apos; for her fears ex- hausted her—but because her mind
                        still retained baby- hood&apos;s way of comforting itself when too
                        roughly beset.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-514" n="506"/>
                    <p>She was aroused in the middle of the first watch by the passage of her litter
                        between bewildering stretches of lights. She was within the palace. The
                        soldiers that bore her were tramping over a Damascene carpet, and between
                        long lines of groveling attend- ants, through an atmosphere of overwhelming
                        per- fume. The messenger had been swift and the court had had time to
                        prepare to greet the coming crown princess with propriety.</p>
                    <p>After the first spasm of terror, Masanath set her teeth and prepared to
                        endure. She was borne to the doors of the throne-room and two nobles
                        gorgeously habited set the carved steps beside the litter for her feet.</p>
                    <p>Without hesitation she descended.</p>
                    <p>The great hall was ablaze with light and lined with courtiers. The Pharaoh,
                        with the queen by his side again, was in his place under the canopy.</p>
                    <p>How tiny the little bride seemed to those gathered to greet her! In that vast
                        chamber, with its remote ceiling, its majestic pillars, its distances and
                        sonorous echoes, her littleness was pathetically accentuated.</p>
                    <p>Outside the shelter of her litter, she felt stripped of all protection. She
                        dared not look at the ranks of courtiers, lest her gaze fall on the fair
                        face of the royal scribe. She reminded Isis of her threat and moved into the
                        open space, which extended down the center of the hall.</p>
                    <p>Har-hat, glittering with gems, and rustling in snow- white robes, approached
                        with triumph in his face to embrace her. But within three steps he paused as
                        suddenly as though he had been commanded. Masanath had not spoken, but her
                        pretty chin had risen, her <pb id="VAA3882-515" n="507"/> mouth curved
                        haughtily, and the gaze she fixed upon him from under her lashes was cold
                        and forbidding.</p>
                    <p>She extended the tips of her fingers to him. The action clamored its meaning.
                        Not in the face of that assembly dared he disregard it, but his black eyes
                        hardened and flashed threateningly. The warning given, he bent his knee and
                        kissed the proffered hand. He had become the subject of his daughter.</p>
                    <p>She suffered him to lead her to the royal dais where she knelt. The queen
                        descended, raised her and led her to the throne. Meneptah met them, kissed
                        Masa- nath&apos;s forehead, and blessed her. The queen embraced her and
                        returned to her place beside the Pharaoh.</p>
                    <p>Masanath turned to the right of the royal dais and faced the prince. Thus
                        far, her greetings had not been hard. Now was the supreme test. Har-hat con-
                        ducted her within a few paces of the prince and stepped aside. What followed
                        was to prove Masa- nath&apos;s willingness.</p>
                    <p>Rameses stood in the center of a slightly raised platform, which was carpeted
                        with gold-edged purple. Behind him was his great chair. But for the badge of
                        princehood, the fringed ribbon dependent from a gem-crusted annulet over
                        each temple, his habiliments were the same as the Pharaoh&apos;s.</p>
                    <p>Masanath gave him a single comprehensive glance. She was to wed against her
                        will, but she noted philosophically that she was to wed with no puppet, but
                        a kingly king. With all that, admitting herself a peer to this man, it
                        wrenched her sorely to acknowl- edge subserviency to him.</p>
                    <p>Hope dead—the hour of her trial at hand—nothing was left to uphold her but
                        the memory of the good <pb id="VAA3882-516" n="508"/> she might do for
                        Hotep. Her face fell and she ap- proached the prince with slow steps. Within
                        three paces of the platform she paused and sank to her. knees.</p>
                    <p>It was done. She had acknowledged the betrothal and knelt to her lord.
                        Somewhere in that assembly Hotep had seen it, and she wondered numbly if he
                        un- derstood why she had submitted; wondered if she had saved him; wondered
                        if she could endure for the long life they must spend under the same roof;
                        wondered if the gods would take pity on her and kill her very soon.</p>
                    <p>By this time, Rameses had raised her. He lifted the badge of princehood from
                        his forehead, shortened the fillet from which it hung, so that it would fit
                        her small head and set it on her brow.</p>
                    <p>The great palace shook with the acclaim of the courtiers. Organ-throated
                        trumpets were blown; the clang of crossed arms, and sound of beaten shields
                        arose from all parts of the king&apos;s house; all the an-
                        cients&apos; manifestations of joy were made,—and the pair that had
                        brought it forth looked upon each other.</p>
                    <p>Masanath was trembling, and filled with a great de- sire to cry out. All this
                        was manifest on her small, white face. The light had died in the
                        prince&apos;s eyes, the exultation was gone from his countenance. He
                        knew what thoughts were uppermost in the mind of Masanath, and the tyrant
                        had spoken truly to her long ago, when he said his heart might be hurt. His
                        brow contracted with an expression of actual pain and he turned with a
                        fierce movement as if to com- mand the rejoicings to be still. But a thought
                        de- terred him and taking Masanath&apos;s hand he led her <pb
                            id="VAA3882-517" n="509"/> down the hall through the bending ranks of
                        purple- wearing Egyptians to the great portals of the hall. There, he gave
                        her into the hands of a troop of court- ladies, lithe as leopards and
                        gorgeous as butterflies, who led her with many sinuous obeisances to her
                        apartments. She had not far to go. The suite given over to the new crown
                        princess was within the wing of the palace in which the royal family lived.
                        Masa- nath noted with a little trepidation that her door was very near to
                        the portals over which was the winged sun, carven and portentous. Here were
                        the chambers of her lord, the heir.</p>
                    <p>Within her own apartments, she was attended mul- titudinously.
                        Ladies-in-waiting bent at her elbow; soft-fingered daughters of nobility
                        habited her in pur- ple-edged robes; flitting apparitions, in a distant
                        cham- ber, glimpsed through a vista, laid a table of viands for her, to
                        which she was led with many soft flatter- ies; her every wish was
                        anticipated; all her trepida- tion conspicuously overlooked; her rank
                        religiously observed in all speech and behavior. And of all her retinue, she
                        was the least complacent.</p>
                    <p>After her sumptuous meal, she was informed that a member of her private train
                        had come to Tanis from Memphis, ten days agone, in a state of great concern
                        and had awaited all that time in the palace till she should arrive. Now that
                        she had come, the servitor insisted on seeing the princess and would not be
                        de- nied. Troubled and wondering, Masanath ordered that he be brought. In a
                        few minutes, Pepi stood be- fore her. The taciturn servant was visibly
                        frightened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pepi!&quot; she cried. &quot;What brings thee
                        here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have lost the Israelite,&quot; he faltered.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-518" n="510"/>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast lost Rachel!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hear me, my Lady, I pray thee. Thou knowest we were to stop at the
                        Marsh of the Discontented Soul to leave a writing on the tomb for the son of
                        Mentu. So we did. The Israelite bade me stand away from the shore lest we be
                        seen. I put out into midstream and while mine eyes were attracted for a
                        space toward the other shore, a boat drew up at the Marsh. I started to
                        return, but before I could reach the place, the Israelite—the man—they were
                        in—each other&apos;s arms.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath clasped her hands happily, but the servant went on, in haste.
                        &quot;It was the son of Mentu, I know, my Lady. He was wondrous tall,
                        and the Israelite was glad to see him—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, of a surety it was Kenkenes,&quot; Masanath inter- rupted
                        eagerly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, but hear me, my Lady,&quot; the serving-man pro- tested,
                        his distress evident in his voice. &quot;I moved away and turned my
                        back, for I knew they had no need of me. Once, twice, I looked and still
                        they talked together. But, alas! the third time I looked, it was because I
                        heard sounds of combat, and I saw that the son of Mentu and several men were
                        fighting. One, whom by his fat figure I took to be Unas, was pursuing the
                        Israelite. I would have returned to help her, but the dreadful night
                        overtook me before I could teach her—and as thou knowest,—none moved there-
                        after.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When the darkness lifted, I was off the wharves at On, where my
                        boat had drifted. I halted only long enough to feed, for I was famished, and
                        with all haste I returned to the Marsh. None was there. I went to <pb
                            id="VAA3882-519" n="511"/> the house in Memphis, but it was dark and
                        closed. Next I visited the home of Mentu and asked if Rachel were there, but
                        the old-housekeeper had never heard of such a maiden. But when I asked if
                        the young master had returned, she asked me where I had been that I had not
                        heard he was dead. And having said, she shut the door in my face. I think he
                        was within, and she would not answer me &apos;aye&apos; or
                        &apos;nay,&apos; but I know that she told the truth concerning the
                        Israelite.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath, who had stood, the picture of dismay and apprehension during the
                        last part of the recital, seized his arm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou had an eye to the master?&quot; she demand- ed in a
                        fierce whisper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye,&quot; he answered quickly. &quot;I have followed him
                        like a shadow, and this I know. Nak and Hebset were here when I came, but
                        they went that same night, each in a different direction, to search further
                        for her. They returned to-night, but I know not whether they brought one
                        with them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath clasped her hands and thought for a mo- ment, a mental struggle
                        evidenced on her little face by the rapid fluctuations of color.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Get thee down to the kitchens, Pepi,&quot; she said presently,
                        &quot;and if Nari hath come, send her up to me. Give thyself comfort and
                        remain in the palace. It may be that I shall need thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She surveyed herself with a swift glance in a plate of polished silver which
                        was her mirror, and then, darting out of her door, ran down the corridor as
                        though she would outstrip repentance before it over-&apos; took her.</p>
                    <p>The flight was not long, but she had lost her com- <pb id="VAA3882-520"
                            n="512"/> posure before she started. Outside her doors, she trembled as
                        if unprotected. Soldiers of the royal guard paced along the hall before her
                        chambers. The lamps that burned there were of gold; the drapings were of
                        purple wrought with the royal symbols; the asp supported the censers; the
                        head of Athor sur- mounted the columns. She was a dweller of the royal
                        house. Far, far away from her were the unimperial quarters in which, once,
                        she would have lived. There was her father—there was Hotep—</p>
                    <p>She came upon him whom she sought. He was on the point of entering his
                        apartments. He paused with his hands on the curtains and waited for her.</p>
                    <p> &quot;A word with thee, my Lord,&quot; she panted, chiefly from
                        trepidation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have come to expect no more than a word from thee,&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>The answer would have sent her away in dudgeon, under any other
                        circumstances, but her pride could not stand in the way of this very
                        pressing duty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A boon,&quot; she said, choking back her resentment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A boon! Thou wouldst ask a boon of me! Nay, I will not promise, for
                        it may be thou comest to ask thy freedom, and that I will not grant for
                        spleen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Still she curbed herself. &quot;Nay, O Prince; I am come to ask naught of
                        thee which—a wife—may not justly ask of—her—lord.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He left the curtain and came close to her. &quot;Had the words come
                        smoothly over thy lips, they would have meant any wife—any husband. But thy
                        very faltering names thee and me. What is the boon that thou may- est justly
                        ask of me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My father—&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-521" n="513"/>
                    <p> &quot;Hold! There, too, I make a restriction. Already have I suffered
                        thy father sufficiently.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tears leaped into her insulted eyes, and in the bright light, shining from a
                        lamp above her head, her emo- tion was very apparent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast begun well in thy siege of my heart, Rameses,&quot;
                        she said, &quot;I am like to love thee, if thou, dost woo me with
                        affronts!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am as like to win thee with rough words as I am with soft
                        speeches. I had thought thee above pre- tense, Masanath.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I pretend not,&quot; she cried, stamping her foot.
                        &quot;And if thou wouldst know how I esteem thee, I can tell thee most
                        truthfully.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laughed and caught her hands. &quot;Nay, save thy judgment. Thou hast
                        a long life with me before thee, and the minds of women can change in the
                        blink of an eye. Furthermore, I love thee none the less because thou art so
                        untamed. Thou art the world I would subdue. So thou dost not give allegiance
                        to another conqueror, I shall not grieve over thy rebellion. Is there
                        another?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would liefer wed with well-nigh any other man in Egypt than with
                        thee, Rameses,&quot; she replied deliber- ately.</p>
                    <p>The declaration swept him off his feet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gods! but thou dost hate me,&quot; he cried. Panic pos- sessed
                        her for a moment, remembering Hotep, but it was too late. She returned the
                        prince&apos;s gaze without wavering, though her hands shook pitifully.
                        After what seemed, to her an interminable time, he spoke again.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-522" n="514"/>
                    <p>&quot;Perchance I am unwise in taking thee,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;Perchance I but give thee opportunity to spit me on a dagger in my
                        sleep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The tears brimmed over her lashes this time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost slander me!&quot; she exclaimed passion- ately.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I do not understand thee, Masanath,&quot; he as-
                        serted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a surety,&quot; she declared, withdrawing a hand that she
                        might dry the evidences of her indignation from her cheeks. &quot;Take
                        the example home to thy- self! Thoi hast been loved in thy time, and if ever
                        there was awakened any feeling in thy heart in re- sponse it was repugnance.
                        What if one of these women had it in her power to take thee against thy
                        will? By this time thou hadst been dead of thy frantic hate of her if
                        self-murder had not been done!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so,&quot; he answered with a short laugh; &quot;but I
                        will not set thee free, Masanath, if thou didst convict me a monster in mine
                        own eyes. If thou art good thou wilt love me or do thy duty by me. If thou
                        art base, I have wedded mine own deserts.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took the Thand she had withdrawn and prepared to go on, but she
                        interposed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not yet have I asked my boon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am no longer in debt to thy father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I ask no favor for my father at thy hands. Rather am I come to
                        crave a boon for myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Speak.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My father asked an Israelite maiden at the hands of the Pharaoh a
                        year agone, and she was beloved by my friend and thine. She fled from my
                        father and was hidden by the man she loved—&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-523" n="515"/>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, I know the story. Hotep brought it to mine ears months ago.
                        The man was Kenkenes, and thy father overtook him and threw him into prison
                        in Tape. What more?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods keep me in my love for thee, O my father! for thou dost
                        strain it most heavily,&quot; Masanath thought. After an unhappy silence
                        she went on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast given me news. I know little of the tale save that the
                        day the darkness fell Kenkenes met his love on the eastern shore of the Nile
                        opposite Mem- phis, and there my father&apos;s servants came upon them
                        and fought with him for the possession of the Israel- ite. The Israelite is
                        gone, and my father&apos;s servants are still seeking for her, and I
                        would not have her taken.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art a queen. What is she, a slave, to thee?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A sister, my comforter, my one friend!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou canst find sisters and comforters and friends among high-born
                        women of Egypt. I had laid Ken- kenes&apos; folly concerning this
                        Israelite to the moonshine genius in him. But the slave is a sorceress, for
                        the madness touches whosoever looks upon her. Behold her worshipers—first,
                        thy father, Kenkenes, Hotep and thyself, and the gods know whom else. She
                        would better be curbed before she bewitches Egypt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is her goodness and her grace that win, Rameses. If that be
                        sorcery, let it prevail the world over. Give her freedom and save her
                        spotlessness.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Har-hat shall not take her, I promise thee. I shall send her back
                        to her place in the brick-fields.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Masanath recoiled in horror. &quot;To the brick-fields!&quot; she
                        cried. &quot;Rachel to the brick-fields!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have said. Her Israelitish spotlessness will be <pb
                            id="VAA3882-524" n="516"/> secure there, and the reduction of her charms
                        will be the saving of Kenkenes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Alas! what have I done?&quot; she cried. &quot;I am as fit
                        for the brick-fields as Rachel. O, if thou but knew her,
                        Rameses!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, it is as well that I do not; she might bewitch me. And seeing
                        that she is born of slaves, how shall she be pampered above her parents? Put
                        the folly from thy mind, Masanath, and trouble me not concern- ing a single
                        slave. Shall I let one go, seeing that I am holding the body at the
                        sacrifice of Egypt?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Great was Masanath&apos;s distress to make her seize him so
                        beseechingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Turn not away, my Lord,&quot; she begged. &quot;See what
                        havoc I have wrought for Rachel when I sought to help her. And behold the
                        honesty of thy boast of love for me. My first boon and thou dost deny
                        it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laughed, and slipping an arm,about her, pressed her to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;First am I a king—next a lover,&quot; he said. &quot;Thy
                        prayer seeketh to come between me and my rule over the Israelites. Ask for
                        something which hath naught to do with my scepter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Surely if thou sendest her to the brick-fields Ken- kenes will go
                        into slavery with her,&quot; she persisted, enduring his clasp in the
                        hope that he might soften.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then it were time for the dreamer to be awakened by his
                        prince.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou wilt not come between them!&quot; she ex- claimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, no need. Seven days of the lash and the sun of the slave-world
                        will heal Kenkenes.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-525" n="517"/>
                    <p>&quot;Thou shalt see!&quot; Masanath declared, endeavoring to free
                        herself. &quot;And the gods judge thee for thy savage use of
                        maidenhood!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again he laughed, and this time he kissed her in spite of her resistance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods judge me rather for this sweeter use of
                        maidenhood,&quot; he said. &quot;Let them continue to prosper me in
                        it and hasten the day of her willingness. Mean- while,&quot; he
                        continued, still holding her, as if he enjoyed the mastery over her,
                        &quot;get thee back to thy sleep and put the thought of slaves out of
                        thy mind. To-morrow thou settest thy feet in the path to the throne; to-
                        morrow there will be ceremonies and prayers and blessings out of number; and
                        to-morrow sunset thou art no longer betrothed but a bride! My bride! Go now,
                        and be proud of me if thou canst not love me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He released her and, as he entered his apartments, lifted the curtain and
                        stood for an instant looking back at her.</p>
                    <p>Masanath saw him through her despairing tears— strong, immovable, terrible—in
                        his youth and his pur- poses and his capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Then the curtain fell behind him.</p>
                    <p>Crushed and stunned with despair and horror, she made her way to her
                        apartments in a mist of tears.</p>
                    <p>There was no help for the beloved Rachel or for the young lover. All whom she
                        might ask to ap- proach the king in their favor were helpless or preju-
                        diced. Seti was disgraced; the queen, useless; Hotep, already too imminently
                        imperiled; Rameses, Har-hat, against the lovers; and the king—the poor,
                        feeble king, hopelessly beyond any appeal that she might direct to him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-526" n="518"/>
                    <p>A sorry resolve shaped itself in her mind. To-mor- row at dawn she also would
                        put forth searchers, and finding Rachel, send her out of Egypt, and Kenkenes
                        after her.</p>

                    <p>At the door of her apartments Masanath was met by the faithful Nari, who drew
                        her within and showed her triumphantly that the usurping ladies-in-waiting
                        had departed. The unhappy girl was grateful for the change. The relief for
                        her sorrow was its expression, and&apos;she dreaded the restraint put
                        upon her by the pres- ence of discerning and unfamiliar eyes.</p>
                    <p>All desire for sleep had left her. Nari, weary and heavy-headed, begged her
                        to retire, but she would not. So at last the waiting woman, at her
                        mistress&apos; com- mand, lay down and slept.</p>
                    <p>The apartment consisted of two chambers running the width of the palace. The
                        outer chamber had a win- dow opening on the streets of Tanis, the inner
                        looked into the palace courtyard.</p>
                    <p>Masanath wrapped a woolen mantle about her and sat at the window overlooking
                        the park.</p>
                    <p>Without was the wide hollow, walled by the many- galleried stories of the
                        king&apos;s house. Below a fountain of running water, issuing from an
                        ibis-bill of bronze, and falling into a pool, purled and splashed and talked
                        on and on to itself.</p>
                    <p>Above, the mighty constellations were dropping slowly down the west. The wild
                        north wind from the <pb id="VAA3882-528" n="520"/> sea strove against her
                        cheek. The gods were too ab- sorbed in great things, the shifting of the
                        heavens, the flight of the wind and the rocking of the waters, to care for
                        her great burden of trouble. Or, indeed, were they not prejudiced against
                        her as all the world was? They had heard every prayer but hers. They had
                        harkened to Rameses when he asked for her at their&apos; hands; they had
                        harkened to her father and yielded him power at her sacrifice; they had even
                        pitied Rachel; they had returned her love from Amenti, and yet had not
                        Rachel reviled them? Nay, there was con- spiracy laid against her by the
                        Pantheon, and what had she done to deserve it?</p>
                    <p>In some one of the many windows that looked into the court another dragged at
                        his chestnut locks and execrated gods and men because of their hardness of
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>So the night wore on to its noon.</p>
                    <p>Masanath was becoming drowsy in spite of her de- termination to keep a
                        sleepless vigil until dawn, when she was aroused by a commotion in the
                        vicinity of the palace. There were indoor cries and shouts for help.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A brawl,&quot; she thought. But the noise seemed to emerge into
                        the street, and there came the sound of flying footsteps and frantic knocks
                        upon doors with- out. The sound seemed to swell and spread abroad, widening
                        and heightening. Wild shrieks and husky broken shouts swept up from all
                        quarters of the town, and the whole air was full of a vast murmur of many
                        voices, calling and wailing, excited, tremulous and full of fear.</p>
                    <p>Masanath passed into the outer room to the window that looked upon the
                        city.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-529" n="521"/>
                    <p>Every house had a light, which flickered and ap- peared at this window and
                        that, and the streets were full of flying messengers, who cried out as they
                        ran. Now and then a chariot, drawn at full speed, dashed past, and by the
                        fluttering robes of the occupants Masanath guessed them to be physicians.
                        All Tanis was in uproar, and its alarm possessed her at once.</p>
                    <p>She turned to awaken Nari, when she heard inside the palace excited words and
                        hurrying feet. Some one ran, barefoot, past her door, calling under his
                        breath upon the gods. At that moment an incisive shriek cut the increasing
                        murmur in the palace and died away in a long shudderingwail of grief.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Awake, awake, Nari!&quot; Masanath cried, shaking the sleeping
                        woman. &quot;Something has befallen the city. It is in the palace and
                        everywhere.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile a chorus of screams smote upon her ears and the wild outcries of
                        men filled the great palace with terrifying clamor.</p>
                    <p>Masanath, shaking with dread, wrung her hands and wept. Nari, stupid with
                        fear, sat up and listened.</p>
                    <p>Presently some one came running and beat, with frenzied hands, upon the
                        door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Open! Open! In the name of Osiris!&quot; cried a voice which,
                        though it quaked with consternation, Ma- sanath recognized as her
                        father&apos;s.</p>
                    <p>She flew to the door and wrenched it open. Har-hat, half-dressed, stood
                        before it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father, what manner of sending is this?&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Death!&quot; he panted. &quot;Come with me!&quot; He
                        caught her arm and ran, dragging her after him down the corridor,
                        half-lighted, but murmurous with sound.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-530" n="522"/>
                    <p>&quot;What is it, father?&quot; she begged as he hurried her on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods only know. Rameses hath been smitten and is dying, or even
                        now is dead!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rameses!&quot; she breathed in a terrified whisper.
                        &quot;Rameses! And an hour ago I talked with him—so strong, so resolute,
                        so full of life—O Holy Isis!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is a pestilence sent by Mesu. The whole city is afflicted. Ptah
                        shield us!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The hangings that covered the entrance to each suite of chambers had been
                        thrown aside and the interiors were vacant. But the farther end of the hall
                        was filled with terrified courtiers in all attitudes and degrees of
                        extravagant demonstration of grief. Men and women were fallen here and there
                        on the pavement or sup- porting themselves by pillar and wall, wailing,
                        tear- ing their hair, wounding their faces, rending their garments.</p>
                    <p>All the dwellers of the palace were flocked about the apartments of Rameses.
                        From the entrance into these chambers issued sounds of the wildest nature.
                        Masanath heard and attempted to draw away from the fan-bearer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take me not into that awful place!&quot; she pleaded.
                        &quot;How canst thou force me, my father!&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Har-hat did not seem to hear and pushed his way, still dragging her
                        through the crush of shaking attendants that crowded into the outer
                        chambers.</p>
                    <p>The sleeping-room of the heir was the focal spot of violent sorrow.</p>
                    <p>The royal pair, the king&apos;s ministers, the immediate companions of
                        Rameses, the high priest from the <pb id="VAA3882-531" n="523"/> Rameside
                        temple to Set at Tanis and a corps of leeches were present. The couch was
                        surrounded.</p>
                    <p>Seti was not present, for only in the last moment had some one realized that
                        the young prince should be brought. Hotep had gone to conduct him to the
                        chamber.</p>
                    <p>The queen, inert and lifeless, lay on the floor at the foot of the
                        prince&apos;s bed. Most of the physicians bent over her. Her women,
                        chiefly the wives of the minis- ters, were hysterical and helpless.</p>
                    <p>But it was Meneptah who froze the hearts of his courtiers with horror.</p>
                    <p>Because of his obstinacy Egypt had gone down into famine, pestilence and
                        destruction. Without more than ordinary concern he had watched the hand of
                        the scourge pursue it into ruin till what time he should relent, and he had
                        not relented.</p>
                    <p>But now that dread Hand had entered within the boundaries of his loves and
                        had smitten Rameses, his heir, his idol!</p>
                    <p>The effect upon him was terrible. The death cham- ber rang like a torture
                        dungeon. Nechutes and Menes, by united efforts, barely prevented him from
                        doing self- murder. The earnest attempts of the priest to quiet him were
                        totally useless. Nothing could have been more shocking.</p>
                    <p>The violent scene wrought Masanath&apos;s already over- strained nerves
                        to the highest pitch of distress. The blood congealed in her veins and her
                        steps lagged, but Har-hat, for some purpose not apparent to any who looked
                        upon his daughter&apos;s anguish, drew her to the very side of the
                        couch. The leeches, who had been <pb id="VAA3882-532" n="524"/> vainly
                        seeking for some flicker of life, stepped aside and the eyes of the cowering
                        girl fell on the prince.</p>
                    <p>Rameses had seen the Hand that smote him.</p>
                    <p>The look on the frozen features completed the un- doing of
                        Masanath&apos;s self-control and she collapsed be- side the bed, utterly
                        prostrated.</p>
                    <p>Hotep entered with Seti. The boy prince&apos;s face was inflamed with
                        much weeping, and he flung himself upon the cold clayof Rameses, forgetting
                        wholly that the older brother had urged the passage of a harsh sen- tence
                        upon his young head.</p>
                    <p>The courtiers, who had stoically witnessed Menep- tah&apos;s frantic
                        grief, turned now and hid their blinded eyes. Hotep went to the Pharaoh and
                        laid his hand on the monarch&apos;s shoulder. The action commanded.
                        Exhausted by his frenzy, Meneptah leaned against his scribe. The cup-bearer
                        and the captain released him and Hotep spoke quietly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Seest thou, O my King, the sorrow of thy people? Behold thy young
                        son and pity him. Look upon thy queen and comfort her. If thou, their staff,
                        art broken, who shall bear them up in their sorrow? Break not. Be thou as
                        the strong father of thy great son, so that from the bosom of Osiris he may
                        look upon Egypt and sleep well, seeing that in his loss his kingdom lost not
                        her prop and stay, her king, also.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The scanty manhood of the monarch, thus ably in- voked, responded somewhat.
                        He raised himself and permitted Hotep to conduct him to the side of the boy
                        prince. Seti fell down at his father&apos;s feet, and Hotep took
                        Meneptah&apos;s hand and laid it on the bowed head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost pardon him, O Son of Ptah,&quot; the scribe <pb
                            id="VAA3882-533" n="525"/> said in the same quiet voice. The king nodded
                        weakly and wept afresh. After the prince had clasped his father&apos;s
                        knees and covered the hand with kisses, he obeyed the scribe&apos;s sign
                        and went away to his mother&apos;s side. Again Hotep, compelling by his
                        low voice, spoke to the king and the assembly listened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods have not limited the darts of affliction to thee, O Son of
                        Ptah. Rameses journeyed not alone into Amenti. He took a kingdom with him.
                        Behold, the Hebrew hath loosed his direst plague upon Egypt, and by the lips
                        of an Israelite, in the streets, every first- born in thy realm perished in
                        the home of his father this night!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The entire assembly cried out, and most of them ran sobbing and praying from
                        the chamber. Instantly the outcry and clamor in the palace broke forth
                        again, for the inhabitants knew that the blow which had smit- ten Rameses
                        had fallen on ope of their own.</p>
                    <p>Meneptah staggered away from Hotep, his frenzy upon him again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Send them hither,&quot; he cried hoarsely, waving his arms
                        toward a white-faced courtier that had stood his ground. &quot;Send them
                        hither—the Hebrews, Mesu and Aaron! Israel shall depart, before they make,me
                        sink the world! For they have sent madness upon me! I condemned my gentle
                        son, I punished those who gave me wise counsel, I have ruined Egypt, I have
                        slain mine heir, and now the blood of the first-born of all my kingdom is
                        upon my head!&quot; His voice rose to a shriek, and Hotep, putting an
                        arm about him, hushed him with gentle authority and signed the courtier to
                        obey.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-534" n="526"/>
                    <p>The physicians lifted the queen and bore her away. Seti stopped at
                        Masanath&apos;s side and looked at her with compassion in his eyes.
                        Har-hat came to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Seeing that thou hast won the pardon of thy father, am I not also
                        included in the restoration of good feel- ing? Have I won thine enmity, my
                        Prince?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hold naught against thee, O Har-hat,- but thou hast not been a
                        profitable counselor to my father in &quot;these days of his great
                        need.&quot; The young prince spoke frankly and returned the
                        comprehending gaze of the fan-bearer. Har-hat&apos;s eyes fell on his
                        daughter, and again on the prince. Slow discomfiture overspread his
                        features. Rameses was dead and with him died the fan-bearer&apos;s hold
                        upon his position. Seti was arisen in the heir&apos;s place, with all
                        the heir&apos;s enmity to him. But from Seti he could not purchase
                        security with Masanath.</p>
                    <p>Hotep supported Meneptah out of the death chamber, for the court paraschites
                        were already hiding in the shadows of the great halls without. The
                        bed-chamber slowly emptied. Har-hat lifted Masanath and followed the last
                        out-going courtier.</p>
                    <p>Another tumult had arisen in the great corridor, an uproar of another nature
                        that advanced from the entrance hall of the palace. There were cries of sup-
                        pliction, persuasion, urging, that were frantic in their earnestness. The
                        whole palace seemed to be on its knees.</p>
                    <p>Hotep, with the king, had paused, and several cour- tiers went before him and
                        looked down the cross cor- ridor. Instantly they fell on their knees, crying
                        out:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ye have the leave of the powers of Egypt! Go! <pb id="VAA3882-535"
                            n="527"/> Make haste! Take your flocks, all that is yours! Aye, strip us
                        even, if ye will! But let not the sun rise upon you in Egypt! For we be all
                        dead men!&quot;</p>
                    <p>A murmur ran through the ministers. &quot;The He- brews!&quot;</p>
                    <p>They came slowly, side by side, the two brothers. Egyptians in all attitudes
                        of entreaty cumbered their path-Egyptians, born to the purple, rich, proud,
                        powerful, on their faces to enslaved Israel!</p>
                    <p>Meneptah wrenched himself from Hotep&apos;s sustain- ing arms and,
                        staggering forward, all but on his knees, met them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rise up and get you forth from among my people,&quot; he
                        besought them, &quot;both ye and the children of Israel, and go and
                        serve the Lord as ye have said. Also take your flocks and your herds as ye
                        have said, and be gone; and bless me also!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Great was the fall for a Pharaoh to pray a blessing from the hands of a
                        slave; great was his humility to kneel to them. But there was no triumph, no
                        exulta- tion on the faces of the Hebrews. Aaron, with his bearded chin on
                        his breast, looked down on the head of the shuddering, pleading monarch; but
                        Moses, after sad contemplation of the humbled king, raised his splendid head
                        and gazed with kindling eyes at Har-hat.</p>
                    <p>Then with the words, &quot;It is well,&quot; spoken without
                        animation, he turned and, with his brother, disappeared into the dusk of the
                        long corridor. The expression, the act, the mode of departure seemed to
                        indicate that the Israelites doubted the stability of the king&apos;s
                        intent. In a moment, therefore, the courtiers were pursuing the departing
                        brothers, urging and praying with all their former wild insistence.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-536" n="528"/>
                    <p>Har-hat put Masanath on her feet and started to leave her, but she flung her
                        arms about his neck.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Forgive me, my father,&quot; she sobbed. &quot;For my re-
                        bellion the gods may absolve me, but I have been un- filial and for that
                        there is no justification. If aught should befall thee in these awful days,
                        how I should reproach myself! Sawest thou not the Hebrew&apos;s gaze
                        upon thee? Say thou dost forgive me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, nay,&quot; he said hastily; &quot;thou hast not done
                        me to death by thine undutifulness. And the Hebrew fears me. Get back to thy
                        chamber and rest.&quot; He kissed her and undid her clinging arms. Going
                        to the king, he put aside Hotep, who was striving to raise the monarch, and
                        lifted Meneptah in his arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Masanath is better now, good Hotep, and I would take my place
                        beside my king.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Without summoning further aid, he half carried the limp monarch up the hall
                        and into the royal bed-cham- ber.</p>
                    <p>Weak, shaking, sated with horror and numb with fear, Masanath attempted to
                        return to her apartments, but at the second step she reeled. Hotep saw her.
                        The fan-bearer was not in sight. In an instant the scribe was beside the
                        fainting girl, supporting her, nor did he release her until she was safe in
                        the ministering arms of Nari.</p>
                    <p>As he was leaving her he commended her most solemnly to the gods.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Death hath wrenched a scepter from the gods. and ruled the world
                        this night,&quot; he said. &quot;We may not delude ourselves that we
                        have escaped, my Lady. As sure as there is a first-born in thy
                        father&apos;s house and in mine, that one is dead. And think of those
                        others <pb id="VAA3882-537" n="529"/> whom we love, the eldest born of other
                        houses! Do thou pray for us, thou perfect spirit. I can not, for there is
                        little reverence for my gods in me this night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned away and disappeared down the corridor.</p>
                    <p>Within her chamber Masanath knelt and dutifully strove to pray, but her
                        petition resolved itself into a repeated&apos; cry for help. In that
                        hour she did not think of the relief to her and to many that the death of
                        Rameses had brought about, for in her heart she counted it sin to be glad of
                        benefit wrought by the death of any man.</p>
                    <p>Through the fingers across her face she knew that dawn was breaking, but
                        quiet had not settled on the city. Surging murmurs of unanimous sorrow rose
                        and fell as if blown by the chill wind to and fro over Egypt. The nation
                        crouched with her face in the dust. There was no perfunctory sorrow in her
                        abasement. She was bowed down with her own woe, not Menep- tah&apos;s.
                        Never before had a prince&apos;s going-out been at- tended by such wild
                        grief. There was no comfort in Egypt, and the air was tremulous with
                        mourning from the first cataract to the sea.</p>

                    <p>Kenkenes had spent two weeks in Goshen in sys- tematic search for Rachel.</p>
                    <p>The labor had been time-consuming and fruitless.</p>
                    <p>More than two million Israelites were encamped about Pa-Ramesu, and among
                        this host Kenkenes had searched thoroughly and fearlessly. He was an Egyp-
                        tian and a noble, and Israel did not make his way easy. But all Judah knew
                        Rachel and loved her, and the first the young man came upon was a quarryman
                        who had known of Rachel&apos;s flight from Har-hat and of her pro-
                        tection at the hands of an Egyptian. Therefore when Kenkenes bore witness,
                        by his stature, that he was the protecting Egyptian, and by his testimony
                        concerning the God of Israel, that he was worthy, this friendly son of Judah
                        began to suspect that Rachel would be glad to see the young noble, and he
                        joined Kenkenes in his search. Furthermore, he softened the hearts of the
                        tribe toward the Egyptian and they tolerated him with some assumption of
                        grace.</p>
                    <p>The other tribes gave him no heed except to glower at him in the camp-ways or
                        to mutter after him when he had passed. Seeing that Judah suffered him, they
                        did not fall on him. Thus the young man was safe. As for the notice Kenkenes
                        took of Israel, it began <pb id="VAA3882-539" n="531"/> and ended with his
                        inquiry after Rachel, the daughter of Maai the Compassionate, a son of
                        Judah. His ear- nestness absorbed him. Otherwise he was but part- ly
                        conscious of great preparations making in camp, of tremendous excitement,
                        heightening of zeal and vast meetings after nightfall, when he had withdrawn
                        to a far-off meadow to sleep in the grass.</p>
                    <p>When he had searched throughout the length and breadth of Israel and found
                        Rachel not, he led his horse from the distant meadow, where he had been
                        pastured, and turned his head toward Tanis.</p>
                    <p>While he was binding the saddle of sheep&apos;s wool about the
                        Arab&apos;s narrow girth he was surprised to find that the friendly son
                        of Judah had followed him to the pasture. The man approached, as though one
                        spirit urged him and another held him back, and offered Kenkenes the shelter
                        of his tent for the night.</p>
                    <p>Somewhat gratified and astonished, Kenkenes thanked him and declined. Still
                        the Hebrew lingered and urged him with strange persistence: Kenkenes
                        expressed his gratitude, but would not stay.</p>
                    <p>Having taken the road toward Tanis where Rachel might be in the hands of
                        Har-hat, his heart seemed to turn to iron in his breast. All the energies
                        and aims of his youth seemed to resolve into one grim and inexorable
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>It was far into the second watch when he left Pa- Ramesu. But the great city
                        of tents was not yet sleeping.</p>
                    <p>The horse was anxious for a journey after a fort- night of idleness and he
                        bade fair to keep pace with his rider&apos;s impatience. The Arabian
                        hills had sunk below the sky-line and the Libyan desert was not <pb
                            id="VAA3882-540" n="532"/> marked by any eminence. With Pa-Ramesu behind
                        him, a wide unbroken horizon belted the dusky land- scape. The lights winked
                        out over Goshen and the hamlets were not visible except as Kenkenes came
                        upon them. The shepherd dogs barked afar off, or now and then a wakened bird
                        cheeped drowsily, or the waters in the canals rippled over a pebbly
                        space.</p>
                    <p>But these sounds ceased unaccountably, at last, and a silence settled down
                        till the atmosphere was tense with stillness. A deadening hand seemed to
                        cover the night.</p>
                    <p>The silence roused Kenkenes and he realized the solemnity of the earth, the
                        vastness of the sky and the majesty of the solitude. Mysteriously affected,
                        he withdrew within himself and humbly acknowledged the One God.</p>
                    <p>At midnight a chill struck the breeze and he drew his mantle about him while
                        he rode. The wind fresh- ened and a heated counter-current from the desert
                        met it and they whirled away, rustling through the grassy country.</p>
                    <p>The Arab reduced his gallop so suddenly that Ken- kenes was jolted. The small
                        peaked ears of the horse went up and he showed a disposition to move side-
                        wise into the meadow growth beside the way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A wild beast hath taken the road,&quot; Kenkenes thought.</p>
                    <p>The horse brought up, with a start, his prominent muscles twitching, and
                        sniffed the air strongly.</p>
                    <p>A high oscillation in the atmosphere descended on Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>The Arab reared, snorting, and then crouched, quiv- ering with wild terror in
                        every limb.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-541" n="533"/>
                    <p>Unconscious, even of the movement, Kenkenes threw up his arm as if to ward
                        off the blow and bent upon his horse&apos;s neck.</p>
                    <p>Gust after gust of icy air swept down on his head, as if winnowed by frozen
                        wings. Then with a back- ward waft, colder than any wind he had ever known,
                        the hovering Presence passed.</p>
                    <p>Instantly the horse plunged and took the road to- ward Tanis as if stung by a
                        lash. Kenkenes, shaken and full of solemn dread, did well to keep his
                        saddle. He grasped the stout leather bridle with strong hands, but he might
                        have curbed the hurricane as easily. The Arab stretched his gaunt length,
                        running low, and the haunted night reechoed with the sound of his hoofs. The
                        land of Goshen lay east and west, with a slight divergence toward the north.
                        The road to Tanis ran due north. It was not long until Kenkenes&apos;
                        flying steed brought him in sight of the un-Israelite Goshen. Illuminated
                        windows starred the plain and the wind shrilling in Kenkenes&apos; ears
                        bore uncanny sounds. A turf-thatched hovel at the roadside showed a light as
                        they swept by and a long scream clove the air, but the Arab was not to be
                        halted.</p>
                    <p>The murmurous wind did not soothe him, and the wakeful night had a terror for
                        him that he could not outrun. He veered sharply and galloped through the
                        pastures tq avoid a roadside hamlet that shrieked and moaned. He leaped
                        irrigation canals and brush hedges, swept through fields and gardens, until,
                        at last, by dint of persuasion, coupled with the animal&apos;s growing
                        fatigue, Kenkenes succeeded in drawing the horse down into a milder
                        pace.</p>
                    <p>The young man made no effort to fathom the mys- <pb id="VAA3882-542" n="534"
                        /> terious visitation. Instead, he bowed his head and rode on, awed and
                        humbled.</p>
                    <p>The night wore away and the gray of the morning showed him, strange-featured,
                        the misty levels, mead- ows, fields and gardens of northern Goshen. The wind
                        faltered and died; the stars, strewn down the east, paled and went out, one
                        by one. Fragmentary clouds toward the sunrise became apparent, tinted,
                        silvered and at last, like flakes of gold, scattered down to a point of
                        intensest brilliance on the horizon. A lark sprang out of the wet, wind-mown
                        grass of a meadow and shot up, up till it was lost in radiance and only a
                        few of its exquisite notes filtered down to earth again.</p>
                    <p>A brazen rim showed redly on the horizon and the next instant the sun bounded
                        above the skyline. It was the morning after the Passover, and Ken- kenes,
                        the son of Mentu, was the only Egyptian first- born that lived to see it
                        break.</p>

                    <p>At sunrise, Kenkenes drew up his horse and took counsel with himself. By
                        steady riding he could reach Tanis shortly, but once within the capital of
                        the Pha- raoh, he was near to Har-hat and within reach of the
                        fan-bearer&apos;s potent hand. When he entered the city he must be
                        mentally and physically alert. He had not slept since the last daybreak, and
                        he was weary and heavy-headed.</p>
                    <p>Ahead of him was a squat hamlet, set on the very border of Goshen. It was the
                        same village that Seti had designated in his appointment with Moses. Here he
                        might have found a hospitable roof and a pallet of matting, but the
                        accompanying gratuity of curiosity and comment would&apos; have
                        outweighed the small ad- vantage of a bed indoors over a bed in the
                        meadows.</p>
                    <p>He dismounted and, leading his horse some distance from the road, into the
                        fringe of water-sprouts which lined the canal, picketed him within shade,
                        out of view from the highway. Usually the meadow growth with- in reach of
                        the seepage from the canals was most -luxuriant, and here the flocks of the
                        Israelites had come for sweet grass. They had kept the underbrush down, and
                        the herbage closely cropped. But for two months Israel had been near
                        Pa-Ramesu with its <pb id="VAA3882-544" n="536"/> cattle, and the
                        canal-borders were again riotous with growth. The place Kenkenes came upon
                        was most tempting, odorous and cool. He rolled his mantle for a pillow and
                        flung himself into the grass, where he lay, half-buried in green, and
                        slept.</p>
                    <p>The April sun, hot as a torrid July noon in northern lands, discovered the
                        sleeper and stared into his up- turned face. He flung his arm across his
                        eyes and slept on. Shadows fell and lengthened; the afternoon passed, and
                        still he slept.</p>
                    <p>Mounted couriers riding at a dead gallop, passed over the road, toward Tanis.
                        Following them, war- chariots thundered by with a castanet accompaniment of
                        jingling harness and jarring armor. Kenkenes stirred during the tumult, but
                        when it had receded he lay still again. Three mounted soldiers leading a
                        score of horses passed.. The Arab in the copse whin- nied softly. A second
                        trio of soldiers, following with a smaller drove, heard the call from the
                        bushes and drew up. The foremost man spoke to another, tossed the knotted
                        bridles to him and, dismounting, came through the copse to the Arab. There
                        he found the young nobleman, sleeping.</p>
                    <p>For a moment he hesitated, but no longer. Silently he untied the horse, led
                        him forth, attached him with the others and speedily took the road toward
                        Tanis.</p>
                    <p>After these had passed the road was deserted and no more came that way. In a
                        little time the sun set. The wind from the north freshened and swayed the
                        close-standing bushes so that their branches chafed one against another. At
                        the sound Kenkenes, ready to wake, stiired and opened his eyes. After a
                        moment <pb id="VAA3882-545" n="537"/> he sat up and looked for the Arab. The
                        horse was gone.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes arose and searched industriously. The trampled space in the road
                        convinced him that the horse had departed with a number of others. Hoping
                        that he might find some trace of the lost animal among the inhabitants, he
                        went to the hamlet.</p>
                    <p>Two ragged lines of huts, built of sun-dried brick, formed a single
                        straggling street. A low shed, the first building Kenkenes came upon, showed
                        a flicker- ing red light. A spare figure darted into it, just ahead of the
                        young man.</p>
                    <p>From the threshold, the whole of the small interior was visible.</p>
                    <p>The light came from a small annealing oven. At a table, overlaid with a thin
                        slab of stone, a man was modeling a cat in clay. On the opposite side of the
                        room was a younger man, painting an image, pre- paratory to burning it in
                        the oven. The walls were black with smoke, the floor strewn with broken im-
                        ages and dried crumbs of clay.</p>
                    <p>In the center of the room was the spare figure, in white robes. Kenkenes had
                        opened his lips to speak when the conversation among the trio stopped
                        him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cowards! Dastards!&quot; the spare man vociferated.
                        &quot;Is there not a patriot in Egypt? The Pharaoh in danger and not a
                        man in the hamlet who will raise a heel to save him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Holy Father,&quot; the short man protested, &quot;the way
                        is long, the horses have been required at our hands by the Pharaoh and were
                        taken from us, and if there be. evil omens, the king&apos;s sorcerers
                        will discover them.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-546" n="538"/>
                    <p>&quot;King&apos;s sorcerers!&quot; the spare man repeated indig-
                        nantly. &quot;There is not one of them who can tell a star from a
                        fire-fly or read the events of yesterday! Horses! Must ye go mounted, in
                        litters, in chariots, afraid of the harsh earth and a rough mile? In my
                        youth, the young men went barefoot and traveled the desert for the joy of
                        effort. Oh, for one of mine own best days! Horses!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is the son of Hofa away?&quot; the younger man asked.
                        &quot;He is a runner as well as a soldier.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The spare man broke out afresh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A runner! Aye, of a truth he is a runner. When the tidings came
                        that the Pharaoh was to pursue the Israelites he ran his best-for the
                        hay-fields-and is hidden safe under a swath somewhere-the
                        craven!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes stepped into the shed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is this concerning the Israelites?&quot; he de-
                        manded.</p>
                    <p>The spare man turned and the two artisans gazed at the young sculptor with
                        open mouths.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The news is not to be cried abroad,&quot; the spare man replied
                        shortly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast become cautious too late,&quot; Kenkenes retorted.
                        &quot;The most of thy talk have I heard. I would know the rest of
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;By Bast, thou art imperious! In my great days the nobles groveled
                        to me. Now, am I commanded by them. How thou art fallen, Jambres!</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Israelites, my Lord,&quot; he continued mockingly,
                        &quot;departed out of the land of Goshen, in the early morning hours of
                        this day, but the Pharaoh hath re- pented, and will pursue them-to turn them
                        back, or <pb id="VAA3882-547" n="539"/> to destroy them.&quot; The old
                        man&apos;s voice lost its sar- casm and became anxious.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But the signs are ominous, the portents are evil. I know, I know,
                        for I am no less a mystic because I have fallen from state. His seers are
                        liars, they can not guide the king. He must not pursue them, for death
                        shadows him the hour he leaves the gates of Tanis. He must not go! I love
                        him yet, and I can not see him overthrown.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art no more eager to stay him than I,&quot; Ken- kenes
                        answered quickly. &quot;Thou art in need of a run- ner. I am
                        one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The eye of the sorcerer fell on the young man&apos;s dress.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A runner among the nobility?&quot; he commented sus-
                        piciously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is a man less likely to be a patriot because he is of blood, or
                        less fleet of foot because he is noble?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay; nor less useful because he is sharp of tongue. Come with
                        me!&quot; &quot;Jambres seized his arm and, hurry- ing him out of
                        the shed, went through the ragged street to the shrine at the upper end of
                        the village.</p>
                    <p>From the tunnel-like entrance between the dwarf pylons a light was diffused
                        as though it came through thin hangings. The pair entered the porch and
                        passed into the sanctuary.</p>
                    <p>Entering his study, Jambres made his way to the heavy table and, fumbling
                        about the compartments under it, drew forth a wrapped and addressed roll..
                        Taking up a lighted lamp, he scrutinized the messen- ger sharply.</p>
                    <p>While he gazed, Kenkenes took the opportunity of <pb id="VAA3882-548" n="540"
                        /> inspecting the priest. He had been a familiar figure about the palaces of
                        two monarchs. For thirty years he had read the stars for the great Rameses,
                        six for Meneptah, but he had measured rods with Moses and had fallen. From
                        the pinnacle of power he had de- clined precipitately to the obscurest
                        office in the priest- hood. This bird-cote shrine was his.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Art thou seasoned? Canst thou endure? Nay, no need to ask
                        that,&quot; he answered himself, surveying the strong figure before him.
                        &quot;But who art thou?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am the son of Mentu, the murket.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The son of Mentu? Enough. If a drop of that man&apos;s blood
                        runneth in thy veins, thou art as stead- fast as death. Surely the gods are
                        with me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He opened a second compartment in the end of the table, but before he found
                        what he sought he raised himself, suddenly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If thou art that son of the murket,&quot; he asked,
                        &quot;how is it thou art not dead?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes looked at him, wondering if the news of his supposed death had
                        penetrated even to this little hamlet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Art thou not thy father&apos;s eldest born?&quot; the
                        priest asked further.</p>
                    <p>&quot;His only child.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What sheltered thee in last night&apos;s harvest of
                        death?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou speakest in riddles, holy Father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Knowest thou not that every first-born in Egypt died last night at
                        the Hebrew&apos;s sending?&quot; the sorcerer demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The first-born of Egypt,&quot; Kenkenes repeated slow- ly.
                        &quot;At the Hebrew&apos;s sending?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-549" n="541"/>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, by the sorcery of Mesu. Save for the eldest of Israel, there
                        is no living first-born in Egypt to-day. From that most imperial Prince
                        Rameses to the first- ling of the cowherd, they are dead!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The young man heard him first with a chill of hor- ror, half-unbelieving,
                        barely comprehending. He was not of Israel and yet he had been spared. Then
                        he remembered the dread presence above him in the night, —the chill from its
                        noiseless wing. A light, instant and brilliant as a revelation, broke over
                        him. Uncon- sciously, he raised his eyes and clasped his hands against his
                        breast. He knew that his God had ac- knowledged him.</p>
                    <p>When his thoughts returned to earth, he found the glittering eyes of the
                        sorcerer fixed upon him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Seeing that thou dost live, tell me what sheltered thee in this
                        harvest of death?&quot; Jambres repeated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Lord God of Israel, who reaped it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The answer was direct and fearless. To the aston- ished priest who heard it,
                        it seemed triumphant.</p>
                    <p>Each of the many emotions the sorcerer experienced, displayed itself, in
                        turn, on his face,—amazement, anger, censure, irresolution, distrust. After
                        a silence, he took up the scroll and made as if to return it to its
                        hiding-place in the compartments under the table.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stay,&quot; Kenkenes said, laying his hand on the sor-
                        cerer&apos;s. &quot;Put it not away, for I shall carry it. Shall I,
                        being a believer in Israel&apos;s God, be willing for the Pharaoh to
                        pursue Israel?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; Jambres replied bluntly; &quot;but thou wouldst
                        stay him for Israel&apos;s sake; I would prevent him for his
                        own.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So the same end is accomplished, wherefore quar- <pb
                            id="VAA3882-550" n="542"/> rel over the motive? But when thou speakest
                        of Ts- rael&apos;s sake, which, by the testimony of past events, is now
                        the more imperiled, Egypt or Israel?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Egypt! But it shall not be wholly overthrown through mine
                        incautious trust of a messenger.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The young man still retained his hold on the sor- cerer&apos;s hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost impugn my fidelity. Now, consider this. I could have
                        defeated thee and accomplished the Pharaoh&apos;s undoing by refusing to
                        carry the message, by keeping silence in yonder shed of image-makers. Is it
                        not so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jambres assented.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so. Instead, I offered and now I insist. Now, if thou deniest
                        me, there is none to carry the warning and thou, thyself, hast undone the
                        Pharaoh.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The sorcerer put away the hand and showed no sign of softening.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, then,&quot; Kenkenes said, &quot;there is no need of
                        the writing. I shall warn the king by word of mouth.&quot; He turned
                        away and walked swiftly toward the portals of the shrine. Jambres beheld him
                        recede into the dusk and wavered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stay!&quot; he called.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes stopped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wilt thou swear fidelity by the holy Name?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, and by that holier Name of Jehovah, also.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He returned and faced the priest. &quot;Thou art mystic, Father
                        Jambres,&quot; he said persuasively; &quot;what does thy heart tell
                        thee of me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The supplication of the need indorses thee, as it in- dorses any
                        desperate chance. If thou art false, thou art the instrument of Set, whom
                        the Hathors have <pb id="VAA3882-551" n="543"/> given to overthrow Egypt. If
                        thou art true, the Pha- raoh shall return safe to his capital in Memphis.
                        The gratitude of Egypt will be sufficient reward.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I take the message?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jambres nodded. &quot;Art thou armed?&quot; he asked, bending again
                        to look into the compartment he had opened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Except for my dagger, nay.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The sorcerer brought forth a falchion of that won- drous metal that could
                        carve syenite granite and bite into porphyry; also, a pair of horse-hide
                        sandals and a flat water-bottle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Put on these.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes undid his cloak and untying his broidered sandals, wrapped them in
                        his mantle and bound the roll, crosswise, on his back. Over this he slung
                        the water-bottle, which the priest had filled in the mean- time, fixed the
                        falchion at his side and put on the horse-hide sandals.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When hast thou broken thy fast?&quot; the priest asked
                        next.</p>
                    <p>&quot;At sunset yesterday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The priest turned with a sign to the young man to follow him and, passing
                        through the shrine, led the way out of the sanctuary into the house of the
                        sorcerer. Here, shortly, Kenkenes was served by a slave, with a haunch of
                        gazelle-meat, lettuce, white bread and wine.</p>
                    <p>While he ate, the priest informed him of the situa- tion he might expect to
                        find at the end of his journey.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Israelites departed in the early hours of this morning taking
                        the Wady Toomilat, east, toward the gates of the Rameside wall. It was the
                        going forth of a multitude—the exodus of a nation! And they <pb
                            id="VAA3882-552" n="544"/> will travel at the pace of their slowest
                        lambs. Thus Meneptah can gather his legions and make ready to pursue ere
                        they have reached the wall.&quot; The priest had begun calmly, but the
                        thought of pursuit excited him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He must not follow!&quot; he continued. &quot;They are
                        unarmed, but the Pharaoh deals with a wizard and a strange God-no common
                        foe. And if these were all who have evil intents against him, but there is
                        an- other-another!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He came to the young man&apos;s side, saying in an ex- cited whisper:</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is another, I say, within the king&apos;s affections —a
                        scorpion cherished in his bosom!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man&apos;s vehemence and his words fired Ken- kenes. He arose and
                        faced Jambres with kindling eyes. The sorcerer went on with increasing
                        excite- ment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better that his slaves depart increased, enriched threefold by
                        Egypt, better that never again one stone be laid upon another, nor monument
                        bear the king&apos;s name, than that Meneptah should leave the precincts
                        of shelter! For his enemy would lead him outside the pale of protection, and
                        there put him to death; and wear his crown after him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>During this impetuous augury, the young man nat- urally searched after the
                        identity of the offender. Not Ta-user, nor Siptah, nor Amon-meses, for the
                        sorry tale of Seti and the outlawing of the trio had reached him at
                        Pa-Ramesu. Furthermore, they had never had a place in the affections of the
                        king. There was a new conspirator! At this point the blood heated and went
                        charging through the young man&apos;s veins.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-553" n="545"/>
                    <p>&quot;If the king&apos;s enemy be mine enemy,&quot; he declared
                        passionately, &quot;thou hast this hour commissioned and armed that
                        enemy&apos;s dearest foe! Name him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The priest shook his head. His excitement had not carried him beyond the
                        limits of caution.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Save for my mystic knowledge, I have no proof against him, and if I
                        balk him not and offend him, he hath a heavy and a vengeful
                        hand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And thou hast not named him in the writing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again the priest shook his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then,&quot; said the young man firmly, &quot;then will I
                        name him to the Pharaoh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jambres looked at Kenkenes with profound admira- tion, not unmixed with
                        apprehension.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let not thy youthful zeal undo thee,&quot; he cautioned.
                        &quot;Perchance thou dost mistake the man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The gods did not bestow all the art upon the mys- tics when they
                        endowed thee with divining powers. They gifted every man with a little of
                        it, and it speak- eth no less truthfully because it is small. Come, thy
                        board has been generous and I am satisfied. I have another and a fiercer
                        hunger I would appease. Give me the message and let me be
                        gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Silent, the priest led the way again into the sanc- tuary. Taking the scroll
                        from its hiding-place once more he said, as he gave it into the
                        messenger&apos;s hands: &quot;Go first to Tanis, and if thou findest
                        not the king in his capital, seek until thou dost find him. And have a care
                        to thyself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes hesitated a moment, and said at last:</p>
                    <p>&quot;It may be that I shall not return, but I would have my father know
                        that I died not with the first-born. Wilt thou tell him, when thou
                        canst?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-554" n="546"/>
                    <p>&quot;The word shall go to him by sunset to-morrow if I carry it
                        myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes expressed his thanks and the priest went on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be not rash, I charge thee. Farewell, and thy father&apos;s
                        gods attend thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Without the dwarf pylons, Kenkenes bent for the old man&apos;s blessing
                        and turned away. Walking rapidly to the northern limits of the town, he took
                        the dusty highway again, and struck into an easy run.</p>
                    <p>The road sloped up toward the north, but the rise was gradual and the ascent
                        was not wearying. The miles slipped behind swiftly, for he covered them as
                        naturally as the unloitering bird traverses the air.</p>
                    <p>In two hours he had reached the pinnacle of the up- land. To the north the
                        road led continuously down to the sea. He paused and looked back over the
                        long gentle declivity toward the south and west.</p>
                    <p>A sharp pain pierced him. In that moment, he real- Ized that he was
                        expatriated. After he had warned Meneptah, Egypt dropped out of his aims.
                        There- after he had the rescue of Rachel, or her avenging to accomplish, and
                        the results following upon the neces- sity of either of these alternatives
                        would not permit him to return into the land of his fathers. There was no
                        turning back now, nor any desire in him to do so. His conscience had been
                        witness to the renunciation of his nation and his faith, and it did not
                        chide him.</p>
                    <p>Still he stretched out his arms to the limitless, fea- tureless, velvety dusk
                        that was Egypt by day, and wept.</p>
                    <p>He entered Tanis in the middle of the third watch, and there he learned that
                        the Pharaoh had departed, <pb id="VAA3882-555" n="547"/> but whither, the
                        solemn, haggard citizens he met could not tell. He repaired to the inn, a
                        house of mourning, also, and awaited the dawn. Then he looked on the
                        funereal capital of Meneptah. The city no longer cried out; it sighed or
                        sobbed, exhausted with its grief; it went the heavy round of labor demanded
                        by the ne- cessities of life, bowed, disheveled and blinded with woe.
                        Kenkenes, humbled, sorrowful, and helpless, averted his eyes and hurried to
                        the palace.</p>
                    <p>There he found that the queen and Seti, with all the queen&apos;s
                        retinue, had departed on a pilgrimage to the temple of the sacred ram at
                        Mendes for the welfare of the soul of Rameses. Masanath was in Pelusium
                        mourning for her sister who died with the first-born. The others,-Har-hat,
                        Hotep, Nechutes, Menes, Se- neferu, Kepliren the mohar,—all except the
                        palace attendants had accompanied the king. The great house of the Pharaoh
                        was empty, solitary and haunted.</p>
                    <p>The destination of the king was a state secret that had not been imparted to
                        the chamberlains. Kenkenes returned into the unhappy streets again.</p>
                    <p>He went to the square in which the loiterers were congregated, even though
                        there was one dead in the household, and seeking out the most intelligent,
                        ques- tioned him concerning the departure of the Pharaoh.</p>
                    <p>He learned that the king and the ministers had left Tanis, and
                        driven&apos; south, the afternoon after the night of death. At
                        nightfall, sixteen chariots from the nome followed him. And though the young
                        man inquired of many sources in the capital, he discovered nothing
                        further.</p>
                    <p>Avowedly, it was Meneptah&apos;s intent to overtake the Hebrews, turn
                        them back, or destroy them. He could <pb id="VAA3882-556" n="548"/> not
                        accomplish that thing with a score of ministers and sixteen picked chariots.
                        It was evident that he meant to collect an army near the track of the He-
                        brews, and that he had departed for the rendezvous.</p>
                    <p>If the Israelites traveled but two miles an hour, they could cover the
                        distance between Pa-Ramesu and the Rameside wall by the sunset of this, the
                        second day after the death of the first-born. It would have been the first
                        act of the Pharaoh to close the gates of the wall against them. The army of
                        the north could gather from the remotest nomes by the close of this day
                        also. Therefore, the hour to proceed against the Israelites was not far
                        away. Kenkenes knew that he might not delay, even for a short sleep, in
                        Tanis.</p>
                    <p>He fixed upon Pithom as the chosen spot for the rendezvous, since it was
                        situated on the Wady Toom- ilat.</p>
                    <p>He refreshed himself with a beaker of sour wine in which a recuperative
                        simple had been stirred, and took the road to the south.</p>
                    <p>Immediately outside of the city walls he came upon the track of the departing
                        king, and followed it faith- fully as long as there was light to show it to
                        him. A dozen miles out of Tanis he ceased to run, and there- after his
                        progress became slower as his fatigue in- creased. Toward the end of the
                        first watch, at the northern borders of the district known as Succoth, at
                        the extreme east of Goshen, he came upon a mighty track.</p>
                    <p>Even in the dark he could see that a diaphanous gauze of dust overhung it and
                        the air was heavy with the most volatile particles. The sandy earth had been
                        ground and worked to the depth of over a foot. How <pb id="VAA3882-557"
                            n="549"/> difficult had it been for the rearmost ranks to cover this
                        ploughed soil! The track was a mile in width, and by the nature of the marks
                        upon it, Kenkenes knew that husbandmen, not warriors, had passed over this
                        spot. It was the path of Israel, leading east to the Rameside wall.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes tightened his sandal straps and continued toward the south. Ahead of
                        him, the horizon began to glow and then an edge,-a half,-all of a perfect
                        moon lifted a vast orange disk above the world. At its first appearance it
                        was sharply cut by a tower of the city of Pithom.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, the God of Israel be thanked,&quot; he said to himself,
                        &quot;for another mile I can not cover.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The gates were tightly closed and a sentry from the wall challenged him.</p>
                    <p> &quot;I bring a message to the Pharaoh,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Son of Ptah is not within the walls.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hath he departed,&quot; Kenkenes wearily asked, &quot;or
                        came he not hither?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He came not to Pithom.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come thou down, then, and let me in, friend, for I am
                        spent.&quot;</p>
                    <p> In a little time, he entered the inn of the treasure city, was given a bed,
                        upon which he flung himself without, so much as loosening the kerchief on
                        his head, and slept.</p>

                    <p>In mid-afternoon of the following day, Kenkenes awoke and made ready to take
                        up his search again. He was weary, listless and sore, but his mission urged
                        him as if death threatened him.</p>
                    <p>The young man&apos;s athletic training had taught him how to recuperate.
                        Most of the process was de- nied him now, because of his haste and the
                        little time at his command, but the smallest part would be bene- ficial. He
                        stepped into the streets of the treasure city, and paused again, till the
                        recollection of the sorrow upon Egypt returned to him to explain the gloom
                        over Pithom. The great melancholy of the land, attending him hauntingly,
                        oppressed him with a sense of culpa- bility. And he dared not ask himself
                        wherein he de- served his good fortune above his countrymen, lest he seem to
                        question the justice of the God of his adoption.</p>
                    <p>At a bazaar he purchased two pairs of horse-hide sandals, for the many miles
                        on the roads had worn out the old and he needed foot-wear in reserve. From
                        the booth he went straight to the baths, now wholly deserted; for when Egypt
                        mourned, like all the East, she neglected her person.</p>
                    <p>When he came forth he was refreshed and stronger. Of the citizens, haggard
                        and solemn as they had been <pb id="VAA3882-559" n="551"/> in Tanis, he
                        asked concerning the Pharaoh. None had seen him, nor had he entered the
                        city. The last one he questioned was a countryman from Goshen, and from him
                        he learned that the army was assembling in a great pasture on the southern
                        limits of the Israelitish country.</p>
                    <p>At sunset he was again upon the way, taking the level highway of the Wady
                        Toomilat for a mile toward the west, and turning south, after that distance,
                        as the rustic had directed him.</p>
                    <p>The road was good and he ran with old-time ease. At midnight he came upon the
                        spot where the army had camped, but the Pharaoh had already moved against
                        Israel. He had left his track. The great belt of disturbed earth wheeled to
                        the south, and as far as Kenkenes could see there was the same luminous veil
                        of dust overhanging it, that he had noted over the path of Israel.</p>
                    <p>The messenger drank deep at an irrigation canal, for he turned away from
                        water when he followed the army, and leaving the level, dust-cushioned road
                        be- hind, plunged into a rock-strewn, rolling land, deso- late and silent.
                        The growing light of the moon was his only advantage.</p>
                    <p>The region became savage, the trail of the army wound hither and thither to
                        avoid sudden eminences or sudden hollows. Kenkenes dogged it faithfully, for
                        it found the smoothest way, and, besides, the wild beasts had been
                        frightened from the track of a amulti- tude.</p>
                    <p>In the early hour of the morning, Kenkenes emerged from a high-walled valley
                        with battlemented summits. Before him was the army encamped, and wild,
                        indeed, <pb id="VAA3882-560" n="552"/> was the region chosen for the
                        night&apos;s rest. The glis- teing soil was thickly strewn with rocks,
                        varying in size from huge cubes to sharp shingle. Every abrupt ravine ahead
                        was accentuated with profound shadow, and the dim horizon was broken with
                        hills. The local- ity maintained an irregular slope toward the east. The
                        camp stretched before the messenger for a mile, but the great army had
                        changed its posture. It squatted like a tired beast.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes approached it dropping with weariness, and after a time was passed
                        through the lines and con- ducted to the headquarters of the king. In the
                        center of the great field were pitched the multi-hued tents of Meneptah and
                        his generals. Above them, turning- like weather-vanes upon their staves,
                        were the stand- ards bearing the royal and divine device, the crown and the
                        uplifted hands, the plumes and the god-head.</p>
                    <p>About the royal pavilion in triple cordon paced the noble body-guard of the
                        Pharaoh.</p>
                    <p>Of one of these Kenkenes asked that a personal at- tendant of the king be
                        sent to him.</p>
                    <p>In a little time, some one emerged from the Phara- oh&apos;s tent, and
                        came through the guard-line to the messenger. It was Nechutes.</p>
                    <p>The cup-bearer took but a single glance at Kenkenes and started back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou!&quot; he exclaimed in a hoarse whisper. &quot;Out of
                        Amenti!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And nigh returning into it again,&quot; was the tired
                        reply.</p>
                    <p>In a daze, Nechutes took the offered hands and stared at Kenkenes through the
                        dark.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where hast thou been?&quot; he finally asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-561" n="553"/>
                    <p>&quot;In the profoundest depths of trouble, Nechutes, nor have I come out
                        therefrom.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The cup-bearer&apos;s face showed compassion even in the dusk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, now; thine was but the fortune a multi- tude of lovers have
                        suffered before thee,&quot; he said, with a contrite note in his deep
                        voice. &quot;It was even odds between us and I won. Hold it not against
                        me, Ken- kenes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was the sculptor&apos;s turn to be amazed. But with one of the instant
                        realizations that acute memory ef- fects, he recalled that he had
                        disappeared immediately after Nechutes had been accepted by the Lady Ta-
                        meri. And now, by the word of the apologetic cup- bearer, was it made
                        apparent to Kenkenes that a tragic fancy concerning the cause of his
                        disappearance had taken root in the cup-bearer&apos;s mind. With a
                        desperate effort, Kenkenes choked the first desire to laugh that had seized
                        him in months.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, let it pass, Nechutes,&quot; he said in a strained voice.
                        &quot;Thou and I are friends. But lead me to the king, I pray
                        thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To the king?&quot; the cup-bearer repeated doubtfully.
                        &quot;The king sleeps. Will thine interests go to wreck if thou bidest
                        till dawn?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I carry him a message,&quot; Kenkenes explained. &quot;A
                        message!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so. Hand hither a torch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A soldier went and returned with a flaming knot of pitch. In the wavering
                        light of the flambeau, Nechutes read the address on the linen scroll.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The king could not read by the night-lights,&quot; he said
                        after a little. &quot;Much weeping is not helpful to <pb
                            id="VAA3882-562" n="554"/> such feeble eyes as his. Wait till dawn. My
                        tent is empty and my bed is soft. Wait till daybreak as my
                        guest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is Har-hat?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In his tent, yonder,&quot; pointing to a party-colored
                        pavilion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dost thou keep an unsleeping eye on the Pha- raoh?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;By night, aye.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes had a thought to accept the cup-bearer&apos;s hospitality. He
                        knew that the expected climax would follow immediately upon the
                        king&apos;s perusal of the mes- sage, and that the nature of that climax
                        depended upon himself. He needed mental vigor and bodily freshness to make
                        effective the work before him. His cogitations decided him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let the unhappy king sleep, then, Nechutes; far be it from me to
                        bring him back to the memory of his sorrows. Lead me to thy shelter, if thou
                        wilt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With satisfaction in his manner Nechutes conducted his guest into a
                        comfortably furnished tent, and showed him a mattress overlaid with sheeting
                        of fine linen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shame that thou must defer this soft sleeping till the noisy and
                        glaring hours of the day,&quot; Kenkenes observed as he fell on the
                        bed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By this time to-morrow night, I may content my- self in a bed of
                        sand with a covering of hyena-fending stones,&quot; the cup-bearer
                        muttered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Comfort thee, Nechutes,&quot; the artist said senten- tiously.
                        &quot;But do thou raise me from this ere day- break, even if thou must
                        take a persuasive spear to me.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-563" n="555"/>
                    <p>So saying, he fell asleep at once.</p>
                    <p>After some little employment among his effects, the cup-bearer came to the
                        bedside on his way back to the king&apos;s tent, and bent over his
                        guest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Holy Isis! but I am glad he died not!&quot; he said to himself.
                        &quot;Aye, and there be many who are as glad as I am. Dear Ta-meri! She
                        will be rejoiced, and Hotep. What a great happiness for the old mur-
                        ket—&quot; he paused and clasped his hands together. &quot;He is
                        Mentu&apos;s only son! Now, in the name of the mys- tery-daling Hathors,
                        how came it that he died not with the first-born?&quot; After a silence
                        he muttered aloud: &quot;Gods! the army would barter its mummy to have
                        the secret of his safety, this day!&quot;</p>
                    <p>At the first glimmerings of the dawn, the melody of many winded trumpets
                        arose over the encampment of the Egyptians. Now the notes were near and
                        clear, now afar and tremulous; again, deep and sonorous; now, full and rich,
                        and yet again, fine and sweet. There is a pathos in the call of a
                        war-trumpet that no frivolous rendering can subdue—it has sung so long at
                        the death of men and nations.</p>
                    <p>Outlined in black silhouette against the whitening horizons, the sentries,
                        tiny and slow-moving in the distance, tramped from post to post in a
                        forward- leaning line. Soldiers began to shout to each other. The clanking
                        of many arms made another and a harsher music. The tumult of thousands of
                        voices burdened the wind and above this presently arose the eager and
                        expectant whinnyings of a multitude of war- horses.</p>
                    <p>While the army broke its fast and prepared to move the king stood in the open
                        space before his tent, with <pb id="VAA3882-564" n="556"/> his eyes on the
                        east. The Red Sea lay there beyond the uplifted line of desert sand, and it
                        was the birth- place of many mists and unpropitious signs.</p>
                    <p>Would the sun look upon the king through a veil, or openly? Would he smile
                        upon the purposes of the Pharaoh?</p>
                    <p>There were striations, watery and colorless, in the lower slopes of the
                        morning sky, and these were tak- ing on the light of dawn without its hues.
                        Long wind-blown streaks crossed the zenith from east to west and the setting
                        stars were blurred. The moon had worn a narrowing circlet in the night.
                        Meneptah shook his head.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly some one in the ranks of the royal guard exclaimed to a mate:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look! Look to the southeast!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meneptah turned his eyes in that direction, as though. he had been commanded.
                        There, above the spot where he had guessed the Israelites to be, a straight
                        and mighty column of vapor extended up, up into the smoky blue of the sky.
                        The tortuous shapes of the striations across the zenith indicated that there
                        was great wind at that height, but the column did not move or change its
                        form. It was further distinguished from the clouds over the dawn, by a fine
                        amber light upon it, deepening to gold in its shadows. So vivid the tint,
                        that steady contemplation was necessary to assure the beholders that it was
                        not fire, climbing in and out of the pillar&apos;s heart.
                        Egypt&apos;s skies were rarely clouded and never by such a formation as
                        this.</p>
                    <p>Meneptah turned his troubled eyes hurriedly toward the east. He must not miss
                        the sunrise. At that mo- <pb id="VAA3882-565" n="557"/> ment, unheralded,
                        the disk of the sun shot above the horizon as if blown from a crater of the
                        under-world— blurred, milky-white, without warmth.</p>
                    <p>He turned away and faced Nechutes, bending be- fore him; behind the
                        cup-bearer, a stately stranger— Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A message for thee, O Son of Ptah,&quot; Nechutes said.</p>
                    <p>At a sign from the king, the messenger came for- ward, knelt and delivered
                        the scroll. The king looked at the writing on the wrapping.</p>
                    <p>&quot;From whom dost thou bring this?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;From Jambres, the mystic, O Son of Ptah.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah!&quot; It was the tone of one who has his surmises proved.
                        &quot;Now, what is contained herein?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes took it that the inquiry called for an an- swer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A warning, O King.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How dost thou know?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The purport of the message was told me ere I
                        departed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wherefore? It is not common to lead the messen- ger into the secret
                        he bears.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know, O Son of Ptah,&quot; Kenkenes replied quietly;
                        &quot;but the messenger who knew its contents would suf- fer not
                        disaster or death to stay him in carrying it to thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As if to delay the reading of it, the king dismissed Nechutes and signed
                        Kenkenes fo arise. Then he turned the scroll over and over in his hands,
                        inspect- ing it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Age does not cool the fever of retaliation,&quot; he said <pb
                            id="VAA3882-566" n="558"/> thoughtfully, &quot;and this ancient
                        Jambres hath a grudge against me. Come,&quot; he exclaimed as if an idea
                        had struck him, &quot;do thou open it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes took the scroll thrust toward him, and ripped off the linen
                        wrapping. Unrolling the writing he extended it to the king.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And there is naught in it of evil intent?&quot; Menep- tah
                        asked, putting his hands behind him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, my King; naught but great love and concern for
                        thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Read it,&quot; was the next command. &quot;Mine eyes are
                        dim of late,&quot; he added apologetically, for, through the young
                        man&apos;s reassuring tones, a faint realization of the trepidation he
                        had exhibited began to dawn on Meneptah.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes obeyed, reading without emphasis or in- flection, for he knew no
                        expression was needed to convey the force of the message to the already
                        intimi- dated king.</p>
                    <p>When Kenkenes had finished, Meneptah was stand- ing very close to him, as if
                        assured of shelter in the heroic shadow of the tall young messenger. The
                        color had receded from the monarch&apos;s face, and his eyes had widened
                        till the white was visible all around the iris.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Call me the guard,&quot; he said hoarsely; but when Kenkenes
                        made as if to obey, the king stayed him in a panic.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, heed me not. Mine assassin may be among them.&quot; The
                        sound of his own voice frightened him. &quot;Soft,&quot; he
                        whispered, &quot;I may be heard.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes maintained silence, for he was not yet ready.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the king turned hither and thither, es- <pb id="VAA3882-567"
                            n="559"/> sayed to speak and cautiously refrained, grew paler of face
                        and wider of eye, panted, trembled and broke out recklessly at last.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gods! Trapped! Hemmed like a wild beast in a circle of spears! Nay,
                        not so honestly beset. Ringed about by vipers ready to strike at every
                        step-! And this from mine own people, whom I have cherished and hovered over
                        as they were my children—&quot; His voice broke, but he continued his
                        lament, growing un- intelligible as he talked:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not enough that mine enemies menace me, but mine own must stab me
                        in my straits! Not even is the identity of mine assassin revealed, and there
                        is none on whom I may call with safety and ask protec- tion—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, nay, Beloved of Ptah,&quot; Kenkenes interrupted.
                        &quot;There be true men among thy courtiers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not one—not one whom I may trust,&quot; Meneptah declared
                        hysterically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here am I, then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meneptah, with the inordinate suspicion of the hard- pressed, backed
                        hurriedly away from Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who art thou?&quot; he demanded. &quot;How may I know thou
                        art not mine enemy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so,&quot; Kenkenes protested. &quot;Give me ear, I pray
                        thee. Would I have brought thee thy warning, knowing it such, were I thine
                        enemy? And further, did not Jambres, the mystic, who readeth men&apos;s
                        souls, trust me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, so it seems,&quot; the king admitted, glad to be won by
                        such physical magnificence. &quot;But who art thou?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kenkenes, the son of Mentu, thy murket.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-568" n="560"/>
                    <p>&quot;It can not be,&quot; the king declared with suspicion in his
                        eye. &quot;The murket had but one son and he must be dead with the
                        first-born.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay; I was in the land of Goshen, the night of death, and the God
                        of Israel spared me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meneptah continued to gaze at him stubbornly. Then a conclusive proof
                        suggested itself to Kenkenes, which, under the stress of an austere purpose
                        and a soul-trying suspense, he had no heart to use. But the need pressed
                        him; he choked back his unwillingness, and submitted. Coming very close to
                        Meneptah, he began to sing, with infinite softness, the song that the
                        Pharaoh had heard at the Nile-side that sunrise, now as far away as his
                        childhood seemed. How strange his own voice sounded to him—how out of
                        place!</p>
                    <p>At first, the expression of surprise in the king&apos;s face was mingled
                        with perplexity. But the dim rec- ords of memory spoke at the urging of
                        association. After a few bars, the Pharaoh&apos;s countenance had be-
                        come reassured. Kenkenes ceased at once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Enough!&quot; Meneptah declared. &quot;The gods have most
                        melodiously distinguished thee from all others. Thou art he whom I heard one
                        dawn, and mine heir in Osiris, my Rameses, told me it was the son of
                        Mentu.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then, being of the house of Mentu, thou hast no fear of my
                        steadfastness; O my Sovereign?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay; would that I might be as trustful of all my ministers. Alas,
                        that a single traitor should lay the stain of unfaith upon all the court!
                        Ah; who is mine enemy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The sentence, more exclamatory than questioning, seemed to the young man like
                        a call upon him to voice <pb id="VAA3882-569" n="561"/> his impeachments.
                        His inclination pressed hard upon him and the tokens of his knowledge wrote
                        themselves upon his open face. When a man is dodging death and expecting
                        treachery, his perceptions become acute. The king, with his eyes upon the
                        young man&apos;s coun- tenance, caught the change of expression.</p>
                    <p>He sprang at Kenkenes and seized his arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Speak!&quot; he cried violently. &quot;Thou knowest; thou
                        knowest!&quot;</p>
                    <p>A sudden ebullition of rage and vengeance sent a tingling current through the
                        young man&apos;s veins. The moment had come. In the eye of a cautious
                        man, he had been called upon for a dangerous declaration. He had a mighty
                        man to accuse, no proof and little evi- dence at his command, and a weakling
                        was to decide between them. But his cause equipped him with strength and a
                        reckless courage. He faced the king fairly and made no search after
                        ceremonious words. He spoke as he felt—intensely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay; it is thou who shalt tell me, O my King. I know thee, even as
                        all Egypt knows thee. There is no power in thee for great evil, but behold
                        to what depths of misery is Egypt sunk! Through thee? Aye, if we charge the
                        mouth for the word the mind willed it to say. Have the gods afflicted thee
                        with madness, or have they given thee into the compelling hands of a knave?
                        Say, who is it, thou or another, who playeth a perilous game with Israel,
                        this day, when its God hath already rent Egypt and consumed her in wrath?
                        Like a wise man thou admittest thine error and bid- dest thy scourge depart,
                        and lo! ere thy words are cold thou dost arise and recall them and invite
                        the descent of new and hideous affliction upon thine em- <pb
                            id="VAA3882-570" n="562"/> pire. Behold the winnings of thy play, thus
                        far! From Pelusium to Syene, a waste, full of famine, mourners and dead men,
                        and among these last—thy Rameses!—&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meneptah did not permit him to finish. Purple with an engorgement of grief
                        and fury, the monarch broke in, flailing the air with his arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Har-hat!&quot; he cried. &quot;Not I! Har-hat, who coz-
                        ened me &quot;</p>
                    <p>The voice rang through the royal inclosure, and the ministers came
                        running.</p>
                    <p>Foremost was Har-hat.</p>
                    <p>At sight of his enemy, the king put Kenkenes be- tween him and the
                        fan-bearer. At sight of Kenkenes, Har-hat stopped in his tracks.</p>
                    <p>Behind followed Kephren and Seneferu, the two generals, who, with the
                        exception of Har-hat, the com- mander-in-chief, were the only arms-bearing
                        men away from their places among the soldiers; after these, Hotep and
                        Nechutes, Menes of the royal body-guard, the lesser fan-bearers, the many
                        minor attaches to the king&apos;s person—in all a score of nobles.</p>
                    <p>They came upon a portentous scene.</p>
                    <p>The tumult of preparation had subsided and the hush of readiness lay over the
                        desert. The orders were to move the army at sunrise, and that time was past.
                        The pioneers, or path-makers for the army, were already far in advance.
                        Horses had been bridled and each soldier stood by his mount. Captains with
                        their eyes toward the royal pavilion moved ab6ut rest- lessly and wondered.
                        The high commanding officers absent, the next in rank began to weigh their
                        chances to assume command. Soldiers began to surmise to <pb id="VAA3882-571"
                            n="563"/> one another the cause of the delay, which manifestly found its
                        origin in the quarters of the king.</p>
                    <p>All this was the environment of a hollow square formed by the royal guard.
                        Within was the Pharaoh, shrinking by the side of his messenger. The messen-
                        ger, taller, more powerful, it seemed, by the heighten- ing and
                        strengthening force of righteous wrath, faced the mightiest man in the
                        kingdom. Har-hat, though a little surprised and puzzled, was none the less
                        com- placent, confident, nonchalant. Near the fan-bearer, but behind him,
                        were the ministers, astonished and puzzled. But since the past days had been
                        so filled with momentous events, they were ready to expect a crisis at the
                        slightest incident.</p>
                    <p>The fan-bearer did not look at the king. It was Kenkenes who interested
                        him.</p>
                    <p>The young man&apos;s frame did not show a tremor, nor his face any
                        excitement. There was an intense quies- cence in his whole presence. Hotep,
                        who knew the provocation of his friend and interpreted the menace in his
                        manner, walked swiftly over to Kenkenes, as if to caution or prevent. But
                        the young sculptor undid the small hands of the king, clinging to his arm,
                        and gave them to Hotep, halting, by that act, all interfer- ence from the
                        scribe. Then he crossed the. little space between him and the
                        fan-bearer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What hast thou done with the Israelite?&quot; he asked in a
                        tone so low that none but Har-hat heard him. But the fan-bearer did not
                        doubt the earnestness in the quiet demand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hast thou come to trouble the king with thy petty loves, during
                        this, the hour of war?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Answer!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-572" n="564"/>
                    <p>&quot;She escaped me,&quot; the fan-bearer answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A lie will not save thee; the truth may plead for thee before
                        Osiris. Hast thou spoken truly?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have said, as Osiris hears me. Have done; I have no more time for
                        thee!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stand thou there! I have not done with thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The thin nostril of the fan-bearer expanded and quivered wrathfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have a care, thou insolent!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes did not seem to hear him. He had turned toward Meneptah.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have dared over-far, my King,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;because of my love for Egypt and my concern for thee. Bear with me
                        further, I pray thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Meneptah bent his head in assent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Suffer mine inquiry, O Son of Ptah. Wilt thou tell me upon whose
                        persuasion thou hast gathered thine army and set forth to pursue
                        Israel?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Upon the persuasion of Har-hat, my minister.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yet this question further, my King. Wherefore would he have thee
                        overtake these people?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Since it was foolish to let them go, being my slaves, my builders
                        and very needful to Egypt. But most particularly to execute vengeance upon
                        them for the death of my Rameses, and for the first-born of
                        Egypt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ye hear,&quot; Kenkenes said to the nobles. Then he faced
                        Har-hat. The fan-bearer&apos;s countenance showed a remarkable increase
                        of temper, but there was no sign of apprehension or discomfiture upon
                        it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast beheld the grace of thy king under ques- tion,&quot;
                        Kenkenes said calmly. &quot;Therefore thou art de- nied the plea that
                        submission to the same thing will be- <pb id="VAA3882-573" n="565"/> little
                        thee. Thy best defense is patience and prompt answer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perchance the king will recall his graceful testi- mony,&quot;
                        Har-hat replied with heat, &quot;when he learns he hath been entangled
                        in the guilty pursuit of a mis- creant after—&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes stopped him with a menacing gesture.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say it not; nor tempt me further! Thou speakest of a quarrel
                        between thee and me, and of that there may be more hereafter. Now, thou art
                        to answer to mine impeachment of thee as an offender against the Pha-
                        raoh.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Har-hat received the declaration with a wrathful exclamation.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou! Thou to accuse me! I to plead before thee! By the gods, the
                        limit is reached. The ranks of Egypt have been juggled, the law of deference
                        reversed! A noble to bow to an artisan! Age to give account of it- self to
                        green youth!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And thou pratest of law! The benefits of law are for him who obeys
                        it; the reverence of youth is for the honorable old. But thou wastest mine
                        opportunity. Thou shalt silence me no longer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy dearest enemy, O Har-hat,&quot; Kenkenes con- tinued,
                        &quot;would not impugn thy wits. He deserves the epithet himself who
                        calls thee fool. But be not puffed up for this thing I have said. Thou hast
                        made a weap- on of thy wits and it shall recoil upon thee. Thou seest Egypt;
                        not in all the world is there another empire so piteously humbled. Her
                        fields are white with bones instead of harvests; her cities are loud with
                        mourning instead of commerce; the desert hath over- <pb id="VAA3882-574"
                            n="566"/> run the valley. And this from the hands of the He-
                        brews&apos; God! Who doubts it? Hath Egypt won any honor in this quarrel
                        with Israel? Look upon Egypt and learn. Hath the army of the Pharaoh availed
                        him aught against these afflictions? Remember the polluted waters, the
                        pests, the thunders, the darkness, the angel of death and tell me.
                        &apos;Vengeance?&apos; Vengeance upon a God who hath blasted a
                        nation with His breath? Chas- tisement of a people whose murmurs brought
                        down consuming fire upon the land? And yet, for vengeance and chastisement
                        hast thou urged the king to follow after Israel. I know thee better,
                        Har-hat! That ser- viceable wit of thine hath not failed thee in an hour.
                        Thou hast not wearied of life that thou courtest de- struction by the
                        Hebrews&apos; God. Never hast thou meant to overtake Israel! Never hast
                        thou thought further to provoke their God! Rather was it thine intent here,
                        somewhere in the desert, thyself to be a plague upon Meneptah and wear his
                        crown after him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Confident were the words, portentous the manner as though proof were behind,
                        astounding the accusation, One by one the ministers had fallen away from
                        Har-hat and placed themselves by the king. After a long time of humiliation
                        for them, the supplanter, the insulter, was overtaken, his villainy
                        uncovered to the eyes of the king. Kenkenes had justified them, and their
                        triumph had come with a gust of wrath that added further to their
                        relief.</p>
                    <p>Hotep gazed fixedly at Kenkenes. Where had this young visionary, new-released
                        from prison, found evi- dence to impeach this powerful favorite? How was he
                        fortified? What would be his next play? How much more did he know? And while
                        Hotep asked himself <pb id="VAA3882-575" n="567"/> these things, trembling
                        for Kenkenes, Har-hat put the same questions to himself. The roll of
                        papyrus, with its seals, still in the young man&apos;s hands, was
                        significant. He folded his arms and forced the issue.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your proof,&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Both the hour and need of my proof are past. Already art thou
                        convicted.&quot; Kenkenes indicated the king and the ministers behind
                        him. The fan-bearer followed the motion of the arm and for the first time
                        met the gaze of the angry group.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes had not ventured blindly, nor dared with- out deep and shrewd
                        thought. When the artist-soul can feel the fiercer passions it has the
                        capacity to work them out in action. Kenkenes, having been wronged, grew
                        vengeful, and therefore had it within him to as- pire to vengeance. He knew
                        his handicap, but had estimated well his strength. With calmness and de-
                        liberation he had studied conditions, assembled all con- tingencies and
                        fortified himself against them, gathered hypotheses, summarized his evidence
                        and brought about that which he had planned to accomplish—the destruc- tion
                        of Har-hat&apos;s rule over Meneptah.</p>
                    <p>Har-hat was alone. Before him were all the powers of the land arrayed against
                        him. Behind him in Tanis was Seti, the heir, who hated him, and the queen
                        who had turned her back upon him. He had not seen the need of friends during
                        the days of his supremacy over Meneptah. Now, not all his denials,
                        eloquence, subtle- ties could establish him again in the faith of the
                        fright- ened king. His ministership had crumbled beyond re- construction.
                        What would avail him, then, to defend himself? What proof had he to offer
                        against this im- peachment? The young man&apos;s argument met him at <pb
                            id="VAA3882-576" n="568"/> every avenue toward which he might turn for
                        escape. At best his future in Egypt would be mere toleration; the worst,
                        condign punishment.</p>
                    <p>A flame of feeling surged into his face. With a wide sweep of his arm, as
                        though to thrust away pretense, he faced the ministers, all the defiance and
                        audacity of his nature faithfully manifested in his manner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why wait ye? Would ye see me cringe? Would ye hear me deny,
                        protest, deprecate? Go to! ye glower- ing churls, I disappoint you! Flock to
                        the king; dandle the royal babe a while! Endure the stress a little, for ye
                        will not serve him long. And thou,&quot; whirling upon Kenkenes,
                        &quot;dreamest thou I fear this bloody God of Israel, or all the
                        gibbering, incense-sniffing, pedestal- cumbering gods of earth? I will show
                        thee, thou rant- ing rabble spawn! See which of us hath the yellow- haired
                        wanton when I return. For I go to wrest spoil and fighting men from Israel.
                        Then, by all the demons of Amenti! then, I say! look to thy crown, thou
                        puny, puling King!&quot;</p>
                    <p>With a bound he broke through the cordon of royal guards, leaped into his
                        chariot, and putting his horses to a gallop, drove at full speed to his
                        place at the head of the army. There, in an instant, clear and long- drawn,
                        his command to mount rang over the desert. Front and rear, wing and wing,
                        the trumpets took up the call, &quot;To horse!&quot; A second
                        command in the strong voice, a second winding of the many trumpets, and with
                        a rush of air and jar of earth the great army of the Pharaoh swept like the
                        wind toward the sea.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes, Menes, Nechutes and those of the royal, guard that had started in
                        pursuit of the traitor, did well to save themselves from annihilation under
                        the <pb id="VAA3882-577" n="569"/> hoofs of twenty thousand horse.
                        Bewildered and amazed, they were an instant realizing what was tak- ing
                        place.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is running away with the army!&quot; they said to themselves
                        in a daze. &quot;He is running away with the army!&quot; And they
                        knew that not all the efforts of the guards and the ministers and the
                        Pharaoh himself would avail, for the army had received its orders from its
                        great commander and no man but he might turn it back.</p>
                    <p>So the short-poled chariots, multi-tinted and gor- geous, wheel to wheel,
                        axle-deep in a cloud of dust, glittered out across the desert—sixty ranks,
                        ten abreast. Far to the left moved the horsemen, the dust of their rapid
                        passage hiding their galloping mounts up to the stirrup. To the watchers by
                        the king they seemed like an undulant sea of quilted helmets and flying
                        tassels, while the sunlight smote through a level and straight- set forest
                        of spears. They were seasoned veterans, many of them heroes of a
                        quarter-century of wars. They had followed Ramesey the Great into Asia and
                        had extended the empire and the prowess of arms to the farthest corners of
                        the known world. They had drunk the sweets of unalloyed victory from the
                        blue Nile to the Euphrates and had filled Egypt with booty, scented with the
                        airs of Arabia, gorgeous from the looms of India, and heavy with the ivory
                        and gold of Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>Now they went in formidable array in pursuit of two millions of slaves to dye
                        their axes in unresisting blood, to return, not as victors over a heroic
                        foe, but as drivers of men, herders of sheep and cattle, and laden with in-
                        glorious spoil.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-578" n="570"/>
                    <p>Behind them, in regular ranks, beaten by their driv- ers into an awkward run,
                        came the sumpter-mules, and after them the rumbling carts filled with
                        provision.</p>
                    <p>Meneptah, raging and weeping, saw his army leave him and gallop in an aureole
                        of dust toward the Red Sea.</p>
                    <p>Thus it was that &quot;the Pharaoh drew nigh,&quot; but came no
                        farther after Israel.</p>

                    <p>Kenkenes did not remain long in the apathy of amazement and helplessness.
                        Consternation possessed him the instant he roused himself sufficiently to
                        realize and speculate. He had saved the king and exposed Har-hat, but the
                        accomplishing of this temporary good had forced the probable commission of a
                        great evil. If death in some form did not overtake the fan-bearer he could
                        enrich and strengthen himself from Israel. Then, even if Meneptah&apos;s
                        army did not continue to fol- low him, he would be enabled to buy
                        mercenaries and return equipped to do battle with Meneptah, even as he had
                        vowed. The flower of the military was with him; the Pharaoh was incapable
                        and Egypt demoralized. The success of the traitor seemed assured. What then
                        of Rachel, of his own father, of the faithful ministers, of all whom
                        Kenkenes had loved or befriended? The thought filled him with resolution and
                        vigor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If the Lord God of Israel overtake him not,&quot; he said,
                        returning to the king, &quot;then must I! For, in my good intent, it
                        seems that I have undone thee. Hotep,&quot; he continued, taking the
                        scribe&apos;s hands, &quot;let my father know that I died not with
                        the first-born. Also, thou seest the danger into which the nation hath
                        descended <pb id="VAA3882-580" n="572"/> in this hour. Help thou the king! I
                        return not. Fare- well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He kissed the scribe on the lips, and freeing himself from his clinging
                        hands, ran through the broken line of the royal guards.</p>
                    <p>The army was already a compact cluster in the cen- ter of a rolling cloud of
                        dust to the south.</p>
                    <p>When Nechutes had aroused him before daybreak, the cup-bearer had brought
                        Hotep with him, and while the messenger broke his fast, he had availed
                        himself of the scribe&apos;s presence to learn many things. Not the
                        smallest part of his information was the fact that the Pharaoh&apos;s
                        scouts had located Israel encamped on a sedgy plain at the base of a great
                        hill on the northern- most arm of the Red Sea. Meieptah&apos;s army had
                        marched twenty-five miles due south of Pithom and pitched its tents for the
                        night. It was twenty-five miles From that point to Baal-Zephon or the hill
                        before which Israel had camped. The fugitives had chosen the smoothest path
                        for travel, keeping along the Bitter Lakes that their cattle might feed.
                        Their track led in a southeasterly direction.</p>
                    <p>But Har-hat, making off with the army, had struck due south. He had chosen
                        this line for more than one advantage it offered. The Arabian desert ap-
                        proached the sea in a series of plateaux or steps. The most westerly was
                        surmounted by a ridge of high hills, higher probably than any other chain
                        within the boun- daries of Egypt. The most easterly overlooked the sea-
                        beach and was originally, it may be, the old sea margin. At points the
                        table-land advanced within sight of the water; at other localities an
                        intervening space of several <pb id="VAA3882-581" n="573"/> miles lay
                        between it and the sea. The summit was flat, at least smooth enough for the
                        passage of horsemen, and at all times it was a good field for strategic ma-
                        nceuverings by an army arrayed against anything which might be on the beach
                        below.</p>
                    <p>If Meneptah&apos;s scouts had reported truly, Israel had behind it a
                        hill, east of it the sea. West of it the army would approach. South only
                        could it flee, into a torrid, arid, uninhabited desert.</p>
                    <p>The slaves were entrapped. The pursuer had but to follow the pursued in, the
                        only open direction, and over- take the starving, thirsting multitude at
                        last. But from Har-hat&apos;s movement he had meant to continue along
                        this plateau, out of sight of Israel, until he had posted part of his army
                        in the way of escape to the south. Kenkenes reached this conclusion without
                        much pon- dering. He had his own manceuverings in mind. Of the captain of
                        Israel, Prince Mesu, he would discover, first, if the Lord God had prepared
                        him against Har- hat. This grave question answered to the repose of his mind
                        concerning the welfare of Israel, the path of his next duty would be clearly
                        laid for him. He would join the army and take the life of the fan-bearer,
                        for the sake of all he loved, and Egypt. In the course of the day&apos;s
                        events his motive had been exalted from the personal desire for revenge to
                        the high intent of a patriot. He felt most confident that he would forfeit
                        his own life in the act.</p>
                    <p>Not an instant did he hesitate.</p>
                    <p>Ahead of him was the narrow bed of a miniature torrent which rolled out of
                        the desert during the infre- quent rains. Now it was dry, packed hard, free
                        of all <pb id="VAA3882-582" n="574"/> obstructions except the great
                        boulders, and led in a comparatively straight line toward the sea. It was an
                        ideal stretch for running.</p>
                    <p>He summoned all his forces, gathering, in a mighty mental effort, all that
                        depended on his speed, and took the path with a leap. The dazed king and his
                        ministers saw him with whom they had that moment talked stretch a vast and
                        ever-widening breach between them with a bat-like swoop, and while they
                        watched he was swallowed up in distance.</p>
                    <p>The bed of the torrent served him for the first few miles. Then it turned
                        abruptly toward the Bitter Lakes. He left it and entered the rougher
                        country. Thereafter no great bursts of speed were possible, be- cause the
                        runner had to pick his way. He ran, not with a steady pace, each stride
                        equal to the preceding, but with bounds, aside and forward, dimly
                        calculating the safety of the footfall.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly a column of sand rose under his feet, and he dashed through it.
                        Blinded and choking, he cleared his eyes, caught his breath and ran on. A
                        gust of wind, like a breath of flame, met him from the east and passed. Then
                        he realized that the atmosphere had thickened, as if an opaque cloud of heat
                        had enveloped the earth. He glanced at the sky and saw that it was strewn
                        with fragmentary clouds, but a little south and east of him was the pillar,
                        unmoving and gilded royally.</p>
                    <p>There was storm in the air.</p>
                    <p>Finally the region began to grow level, proving the proximity to the sea. In
                        another moment he came upon the old sea bed. It was sandy, sedge-grown, with
                        here and there a palm, and tremendously trampled.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-583" n="575"/>
                    <p>Israel had passed this way.</p>
                    <p>The clash and ring of meeting metal fell on his ear. He looked and saw ahead
                        of him two men fight- ing with a third. Three horses with empty saddles
                        nervously watched the fray.</p>
                    <p>The single combatant was a soldier in the uniform of a common fighting man.
                        One of the pair was a tall Nubian in a striped tunic; the other was an
                        Egyptian, short, fat, purple of countenance—Unas!</p>
                    <p>With a furious exclamation, Kenkenes slackened his pace only long enough to
                        undo the falchion at his side and rushed to the fight. It did not matter to
                        him who the soldier was or what his cause. The fact that he was fighting the
                        emissaries of Har-hat was sufficient indorsement of the lone soldier. But
                        even as he sprang forward, Unas sank on the sand, moved convulsively once or
                        twice and lay still.</p>
                    <p>The soldier staggered back from the second servitor and fell. The Nubian,
                        standing over him, swung his heavy weapon aloft, but Kenkenes thrust his
                        falchion over the fallen man and caught the blow, as it descend- ed, upon
                        the broad back of the blade.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Set receive your cursed soul,&quot; the Nubian snarled.
                        Kenkenes leaped across the prostrate soldier, and si- multaneously the
                        weapons went up, descended and clashed. Then followed a wild and fearful
                        battle.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian falchion was nothing more than a sword-shaped ax. Therefore,
                        these were not tongues of steel which would whip their supple length one
                        across the other and fill the air with the lightning of their play and the
                        devilish beauty of their music. The vanquished would not taste the nice
                        death of a spitted heart. There was yet the method of the stone-ax war- <pb
                            id="VAA3882-584" n="576"/> riors in this battle, and he who fell would
                        be a fearful thing to see.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps it was because Kenkenes was stronger and more agile; perhaps he
                        remembered Deborah at that moment, or perhaps&apos; he was simply a
                        better fighter. Whatever the cause his blade went up and descended at last,
                        before the Nubian could parry, and the second servitor of Har-hat fell on
                        his face and died.</p>
                    <p>Chilled by the instant sobering, which follows the taking of life, the young
                        man sickened and whirled away from the quivering flesh. Plunging his
                        falchion in the sand to hide its stain, he went back to the fallen
                        soldier.</p>
                    <p>He knew by the look on the gray face, by the dark pool that had grown beside
                        him, that the warrior had fought his last fight. Kenkenes raised the
                        man&apos;s head, and heard these words, faintly spoken:</p>
                    <p>&quot;He sent them in pursuit. I knew he meant to do it, but I could not
                        get near to kill him. So I followed them. But thou art her lover; do thou
                        protect her now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Her! Rachel?&quot; Kenkenes cried. &quot;Who art
                        thou?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Atsu, once her taskmaster, always her—&quot; the voice died
                        away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is she?&quot; Kenkenes implored. &quot;In the name of
                        thy gods, go not yet! Where is she?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The lips parted in answer, but no sound came. The arm went up as if to point,
                        but it fell limp without in- dicating direction, and with a sigh the soldier
                        turned his face away.</p>
                    <p>Sobbing, wild with anxiety and grief, Kenkenes shook the inert body, pleading
                        frantically for some sign <pb id="VAA3882-585" n="577"/> to guide him to
                        Rachel. But there was no response, for the dead speak not out of Amenti.</p>
                    <p>At last Kenkenes laid the body down and stood up. It had come to him very
                        plainly that, but for Atsu, already these dead servitors would have been
                        beyond overtaking in pursuit of his love. Though a worship- er of
                        Israel&apos;s God, Kenkenes was still Egyptian in his instincts. The man
                        who had died to save Rachel he could not bury uncoffined in a grave of sand,
                        where the natural processes of dissolution would destroy him utterly. His
                        and Rachel&apos;s debts to Atsu were great, and the demand was made upon
                        him now to discharge all that was possible in the one act of caring for the
                        dead soldier&apos;s remains. Kenkenes could not bear the body back to
                        the group he had left about the king, for he had a mission which concerned
                        all the living who were dear to him. Furthermore the sky was threaten- ing,
                        the desert was a terrible place during high winds, and he dared not
                        delay.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly a thought struck him. Travelers and sea- faring men had told him
                        that there were settlements along the Red Sea. Might he not go forward, on
                        his, way after Israel, till he found one of these?</p>
                    <p>He led the largest horse past the dead servitors, and persuading it to stand,
                        lifted the body of Atsu upon its back. With difficulty he mounted, and
                        supporting the limp burden with one arm, turned again toward the
                        southeast.</p>
                    <p>As he went forward, Kenkenes meditated on the signs of this recent and tragic
                        event. He had searched throughout the length and breadth of Goshen for
                        Rachel and none had seen her or heard of her <pb id="VAA3882-586" n="578"/>
                        since she had fled from Har-hat into the desert, eight months before he had
                        seen her last. Israel was more ignorant of the whereabouts of Rachel than
                        he. He could not tell whether Har-hat knew where she was, nor could he guess
                        from the position of the fighters in which direction the servants had meant
                        to ride. The tracks of their horses were not to be discovered in the great
                        trampled roadway Israel had made.</p>
                    <p>Of this thing Kenkenes was sure. If Rachel were with Israel she had joined it
                        after he had left Goshen. In that case he was going to her, to ask after her
                        safety, when he inquired after all Israel. If she were still in Egypt he
                        would stop Har-hat&apos;s search for ever. This recollection added to
                        his determination and intensified his zeal.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning of the great fields of sea-grass he came upon a little
                        hamlet. It was a considerable dis- tance inland, and the chief industry of
                        the people could have been only the gathering of sedge for hay, or the
                        curing of herb and root for medicines. Some of the villagers were in sight
                        but the most of them were out in the direction of the lakes, laboring in the
                        marsh grass.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the past year&apos;s events Kenkenes had learned to be a
                        cautious and skilful fugitive. He did not care to be caught and taxed with
                        the death of the man whose body he bore. The village shrine was the
                        structure nearest to him. It was built of sun-dried brick, with three walls,
                        the fourth side open to the sun- rise. Kenkenes dismounted and
                        reconnoitered. The shrine was empty, and none of the villagers was near.</p>
                    <p>He lifted the dead man from the horse and bore the body into the sanctuary.
                        Before the image of Athor <pb id="VAA3882-587" n="579"/> was a long table
                        overlaid with a slab of red sandstone. Here the offerings were left and here
                        Kenkenes laid Atsu, a true sacrifice to the love deity. Reverently the young
                        man closed the eyes and straightened the chill- ing limbs. Going into his
                        patrimony of jewels sewn in his belt, he took an emerald, and putting it in
                        the hands, crossed them above the breast. Then he laid his mantle over the
                        bier.</p>
                    <p>At the threshold he found a soft stone and with that. he wrote upon the head
                        of the long table the name of the dead man, and Mendes, his native city.
                        Under this he wrote further to the villagers, charging them, in the name of
                        the goddess, to care for the body reverently and return it to the tomb of
                        Atsu&apos;s fathers. Having made note of the emerald as remuneration for
                        their labors, he completed the inscription without signature.</p>
                    <p>Thus he insured the safety and preservation of the bones of Atsu, and in the
                        eye of the average Egyptian he had served the soldier well. But Kenkenes was
                        not satisfied.</p>
                    <p>As he left the shrine he muttered with trembling lips:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bless him! The fate is not kind which yields to such goodness, no
                        reward save gratitude. There must be, because of the great God&apos;s
                        justness, some especial blessing laid up for Atsu.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the time he had spent in the sanctuary the atmos- phere had grown hazy and
                        the sun shone obscurely. To the east were tumbled and darkening masses,
                        which gathered even as he looked and joined till they stretched in a vast
                        and unillumined sweep about the horizon. The wind had died and the heat
                        bathed him in perspira- tion.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-588" n="580"/>
                    <p>Once again his eyes sought the pillar and found it above him, still somewhat
                        to the east, yet in form un- changed, in hue undimmed. Something within him
                        associated the column of cloud with Israel and Israel&apos;s God.</p>
                    <p>He went to his horse and found him terrified and unmanageable. After vain
                        efforts to soothe the crea- ture, he walked awaya little space, clasping his
                        hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O Thou mysterious God! By these tokens Thy hand is upon the earth
                        and upon the heavens. Even as Thou hast shielded me thus far, withdraw not
                        Thy sheltering hand from about me, Thy worshiper, in this, Thy latest hour
                        of mystery.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He skirted the village, now filling with frightened peasants, and took the
                        path of Israel.</p>
                    <p>It led in a southeasterly direction toward a far-off hill, barely outlined
                        through the haze of the distance. Meanwhile the darkness settled and over
                        the sea the somber bastion of cloud heaved its sooty bulk up the sky. The
                        air stagnated and the whole desert was soundless.</p>
                    <p>A round and tumbled mass, blue-black but attended by a copper-colored rack,
                        detached itself from a shelf- like stratum of cloud, and elongating, seemed
                        to de- scend to the surface of the sea. Daylight went out instantly and a
                        prolonged moan came from the distant east. Blinding flashes of lightning
                        illuminated the whirling mass and almost absolute darkness fell after each
                        bolt. Out of the inky midnight toward the east came an ever-increasing sound
                        of a maddened sea, gathering in volume and fury and menace. Kenkenes flung
                        himself dn his face and waited.</p>
                    <p>He did not have long to wait.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-589" n="581"/>
                    <p>With a noise of mighty rending, reinforced by a continuous roll of savage
                        thunder, the storm struck. A spinning cone of wind caught a great expanse of
                        sand, and lifting the loose covering, carried a huge twisting column
                        inland—death and entombment for any living thing it met. With it went a
                        great blast of spray, stones, sea-weed, masses of sedge uprooted bod- ily,
                        much wreckage, palm trees, small huts which went to pieces as they were
                        carried along, wild and domestic animals, anything and everything that lay
                        in the path of the storm.</p>
                    <p>The rotatory movement passed with the first whirl, but a hurricane, blowing
                        with overcoming velocity, pressed like a wall against anything that strove
                        to face it. Its hoarse raving filled Kenkenes&apos; ears with titanic
                        sound. The breath was snatched from his nostrils;. his eyelids, tightly
                        closed, were stung with sharply driven sand. Though he struggled to his feet
                        and attempted to proceed, he staggered and wandered and was prone to turn
                        away from the solid breast of the mighty blast. He could not hope to make
                        headway blinded, yet he dared not lift his face to the sand.. He could make
                        a shelter over his eyes that he might watch his feet, but he could not
                        discover path and direction in this man- ner.</p>
                    <p>The day was far advanced, and already the army had outstripped him. Might not
                        Har-hat at this hour be descending with his veterans, seasoned against the
                        simoons of Arabia, upon Israel, demoralized in the storm?</p>
                    <p>Desperate, the young man dropped his hands and flung up his head.</p>
                    <p>He was standing in a soft light, very faintly diffused <pb id="VAA3882-590"
                            n="582"/> about him but narrowing ahead of him, brightening, as it
                        contracted, into almost daytime brilliance to the south. The illuminated
                        strip was not wide; the plateau to the west was dark; the farther east
                        likewise storm- obscured. Taking courage, he raised his eyes for an instant.
                        The drifting sand would not permit a longer contemplation, but in that
                        fleeting glimpse he discov- ered the source of the supernatural radiance.
                        The pillar was tinged like a cloud in the sunset, with a mel- low and benign
                        fire.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes did not marvel and was not perplexed. The miracles no longer amazed
                        him, but he had not become indifferent or unthankful. Each forward step he
                        took was a declaration of faith; the thrill of relief in his veins, a psalm
                        of thanksgiving. The stones were as many and as sharp, the way as untender,
                        and the mighty, tempest strove against him as powerfully, but he followed
                        the ray, trusting it implicitly.</p>
                    <p>Night fell unnoticed for it merged with the super- natural darkness of the
                        day.</p>
                    <p>At the summit of the slope which led down to the water&apos;s edge, he
                        paused. Below him was a gentle declivity ending to the south in darkness.
                        There was not a glimmer of radiance on the sea. Far to the east could be
                        heard the sound of infuriated surges, storming the rocks, but dense darkness
                        shrouded all the distance. Only the beach directly under him was alight. The
                        shadows cast were blacker than daylight shadows, and the radiance had a
                        touch of gold, which gilded everything beneath it. The poorest object was
                        enriched, the gaudiest subdued.</p>
                    <p>Had the number of Israel been ten thousand or even <pb id="VAA3882-591"
                            n="583"/> a hundred thousand, Kenkenes might have had some conception of
                        the multitude. The millions massed be- low him on the sand were not to be
                        looked on except as a vast unit.</p>
                    <p>The tribes were divided, the herds were collected at the rear or inland side,
                        and the lepers were isolated, but no order in detail was possible. Tents
                        were down, goods were being gathered, andmuch commotion was apparent. Even
                        at a distance Kenkenes could see that consternation and dismay were rife
                        among Israel. The whole valley was murmurous with subdued out- cry, and a
                        multitudinous lowing and bleating of the herds swept up, blown wildly by the
                        hurricane.</p>
                    <p>The senses, too, are limited in their grasp, even as the brain has bounds
                        upon its conception. The di- mensions, movement and sound of the multitude
                        over- taxed the eye and ear.</p>
                    <p>Was it the storm or the army that had frightened them?</p>
                    <p>Slipping and sliding in his haste, he descended the slope without care for
                        the sound he made. The hil- locks and hollows that interposed irritated him.
                        His impatience made him forget his great weariness. Israel&apos;s
                        helpless ones to the sword, Israel&apos;s treasure open to the
                        enrichment of a traitor, Israel&apos;s fighting- men driven to rally to
                        his standard—Rachel&apos;s people, to be mastered by Har-hat!</p>
                    <p>Great was his intent and its scope, and how cheaply attained if it cost but
                        two lives—his enemy&apos;s and his own! How much depended upon him! His
                        enthusiasm and zeal put out of his sight all his young reluctance to
                        surrender life and the world. He could have explained, truthfully, from his
                        own feelings, <pb id="VAA3882-592" n="584"/> what it is that enables men to
                        suffer an eager martyr- dom.</p>
                    <p>Two Hebrews outside the limits of the camp halted him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I bring tidings to your captain,&quot; he explained. The answer
                        was swept from the speaker&apos;s lips and carried astray by the wind,
                        but he caught these words.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art an Egyptian. Thy kind hath no friend- ship for
                        Israel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am of Egypt, but I am one with you in faith. Conduct me to the
                        prince, I pray you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take him,&quot; said one to the other. &quot;He is but
                        one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Hebrew, thus addressed, motioned Kenkenes to follow him, and turned
                        toward the encampment.</p>
                    <p>They passed through a lane between two tribes. Kenkenes guessed; looking
                        first upon one and then the other, that there were one hundred thousand in
                        the two. Strip a city of her plan and shape, her houses, her pleasures and
                        commerce; leave only her people, their smallest possessions, and all their
                        fears; beset such a city with an army on three sides, the sea on the fourth
                        and a furious hurricane over all—and in such state and of such appearance
                        were these two tribes.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes fortified himself and resisted with all his might the contagious
                        panic that seemed about to attack him. As well as he might, he concentrated
                        his mind upon other things. He noted that the shadows were. long like those
                        of afternoon. Turning his head, he gaw that the pillar stood behind the
                        encampment and that its light was thrown forward and downward, not backward
                        and outward. Very manifestly, the benefits <pb id="VAA3882-593" n="585"/> of
                        the miracle were only for the believers in Jehovah. The marvel brought into
                        the young man&apos;s mind some natural speculation concerning the great
                        miracle- worker to whom his guide was leading him. What manner of man was he
                        about to look upon,—a sorcerer, a trafficker in horrors, a confounder of
                        men?</p>
                    <p>Ahead, particularly illumined by the celestial light, was a group of
                        elders—great, grave men, misted in the flying fleeces of their own beards.
                        They bent firmly against the blast and the broad streaming of their ample
                        drapings added much to the idea of super- natural power and resistance they
                        inspired.</p>
                    <p>The Hebrew leading Kenkenes slackened his step as if hesitating to approach
                        so venerable a council, when suddenly the group separated, revealing a
                        majes- tic man about whom it had been clustered.</p>
                    <p>After a word in his own tongue, delivered with bent head and deferential
                        attitude, the Hebrew stood aside.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes prepared to meet a prince of Egypt, what- ever the personality of
                        the Israelite. He dropped on one knee, bent his head and extended his hand
                        with the palm toward Moses. The great man took the fingers and bade the
                        young Egyptian arise. Forty years a courtier, forty years a shepherd, but
                        the graces of the one had not been forgotten in the simplicities of the
                        other. When Kenkenes gained his feet, lo! he faced the wondrous stranger he
                        had seen in the tomb of the Incomparable Pharaoh.</p>
                    <p>At a sign from Moses Kenkenes came near to him, that the howl of the tempest
                        and the turmoil of Israel might not drown their voices.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-594" n="586"/>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art weary, my son,&quot; the Israelite said, glanc- ing at
                        the tired face and dusty raiment. &quot;Hast thou come from
                        afar?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;From Goshen to Tanis, and hither, O Prince.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Afoot?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast journeyed farther than Israel, and Israel is most weary.
                        I trust thy journey is done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And this was the confounder of Egypt, the vicar of God—this kindly noble!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not yet, O Prince; but its dearest mission endeth here. I come of
                        the blood of the oppressors, but I am full of pity for thy people&apos;s
                        wrongs. Knowest thou that the Egyptians pursue thee? Is thy hand made strong
                        with resource? Hath the Lord God pre- pared thee against them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;From whom art thou sent?&quot; the Israelite asked
                        pointedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am come of mine own accord.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wherefore?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because I am one with Israel in faith.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The great Lawgiver surveyed him in silence for a moment, but the penetrative
                        brilliance in his eyes soft- ened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wast thou taught?&quot; he asked at last.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In casting away the idols, nay; in finding the true God, I
                        was.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the pause that followed, Israel lifted up its voice, and to Kenkenes it
                        seemed that the people besought their great captain, urgingly and chidingly.
                        The Lawgiver listened for a little space. His gaze was absent, the lines of
                        his face were sad. Something in his attitude seemed to say, &quot;What
                        profiteth all Thy <pb id="VAA3882-595" n="587"/> care, O Lord? Behold Thy
                        chosen—these men of little faith!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then, as if some thought of the young proselyte, the Egyptian, arose in
                        contrast, his eyes came back to Kenkenes again.</p>
                    <p> &quot;Thou hast filled me with gladness, my son,&quot; he said
                        simply.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes bowed his head and made no answer. Presently the Israelite spoke to
                        the panic-stricken people nearest to him. In the tone and the words he used
                        there was a world of paternal kindliness—a com- posite of confidence,
                        reassurance, and implied protec- tion, that should have soothed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fear ye not; stand still and see the salvation of the Lord. For the
                        Egyptians ye have seen this day, ye shall see again no more for
                        ever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At the words, Kenkenes lifted his head quickly. The Hebrew had answered his
                        question, but how enig- matically! Was Israel to escape, or Har-hat to be
                        destroyed? In either case, the young man wondered concerning himself. Again
                        the eyes of the Lawgiver returned to him, as if the sight of the young
                        Egyptian was grateful to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Abide with us,&quot; he said. &quot;Saith not thy faith,
                        &apos;Fear not; the Lord shall fight for thee?&apos; &quot;</p>
                    <p> Kenkenes&apos; face wore a startled expression; how had the Israelite
                        divined his purpose? &quot;Saith not thy faith?&quot; Faith? He
                        confessed faith, but faith had not spoken that thing to him. Slowly and
                        little by little it began to manifest itself th him, that he had wavered in
                        his trust; that the purpose of his visit to Israel had questioned the
                        fidelity of his God&apos;s care; that so surely had he doubted, he had
                        defied danger and fought with <pb id="VAA3882-596" n="588"/> death to ask
                        after the intent of the Lord; that he had meant to perform the duty which
                        the Lord had left undone. The realization came with a rush of shame. In the
                        asking he had betrayed his wavering, and Moses had tactfully told him of it.
                        A surge of color swept over his face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast recalled my trust to me, my Prince,&quot; he said in
                        a lowered tone. &quot;Till now, I knew not that it had failed me. But
                        remember thou, it was my love for Israel—O, and my love for mine own—that
                        made me fear. Forgive me, I pray thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Lawgiver laid his hand on the young man&apos;s shoulder but did not
                        answer at once. The growing clamor about them had reached the acme of
                        insistence. The nearest people pressed through the tribal lines and, rushing
                        forward, began to throw themselves on their knees, tumbling in circles about
                        the majestic Hebrew. Others kept their feet, and with arms and clenched
                        hands above their heads, shouted vehemently. Their cries were partly in
                        Egyptian, partly in their own tongue, but the cause of their terror and the
                        burden of their supplications were the same. The Egyptians were upon them!
                        Even the dumb beasts were swept into the panic and the illuminated beach
                        shook with sound.</p>
                    <p>After a little sad contemplation of the clamoring horde about him, the
                        Lawgiver drew nearer to Ken- kenes and said in his ear, because the tumult
                        drowned his voice:</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Lord will fight for thee; thine enemy can not flee His strong
                        hand. Wait upon Him and behold His triumph.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes bowed his head in acquiescence.</p>

                    <p>The voices of the storm found harmonious tones of different pitch and swelled
                        in glorious accord from the faintest breath of melody to an almighty blast
                        that stunned the senses with stupendous harmony. Then the chord seemed to
                        melt and lose itself in the wild dissonances of the hurricane.</p>
                    <p>The turmoil of Israel began to subside, growing fainter, ceasing among the
                        ranks nearest the sea, fail- ing toward the rear, dying away like a sigh up
                        and down the long encampment. The people that had been on their knees rose
                        slowly. The bleating of the flocks quieted into stillness. Commotion ceased
                        and Israel held its breath.</p>
                    <p>The Lawgiver had passed from among them, and those that followed him with
                        their eyes saw that he was moving toward the sea, seemingly at the very
                        limit of the outer radiance and still going on. First to one and then to
                        another, it became apparent that the extent of the illuminated beach was
                        widening. Hither and thither over the multitude the intelligence ran, in
                        whispers or by glances. Having showed his neighbor each looked again.
                        Ripple-worn sand, shells, barnacle-covered rocks, slowly came within the
                        pale of the radiance and Moses moved with it. Eight <pb id="VAA3882-598"
                            n="590"/> stalwart Hebrews, bearing a funeral ark, shrouded with a
                        purple pall, fringed with gold, emerged from among the people and, taking a
                        place in front of the Lawgiver, walked confidently down the sand toward the
                        east.</p>
                    <p>The radiance progressed step by step. Wet rocks entered the glow, lines of
                        sea-weed, immense drifts of debris, the brink of a ledge, the shadow before
                        it, and then a sandy bottom.</p>
                    <p>A long line of old men, two abreast, the wind mak- ing the picture awesome as
                        it tossed their beards and gray robes, followed the Lawgiver. After these
                        sev- eral litters, borne by young men, proceeded in imposing order.</p>
                    <p>Except for the raving of the tempest there was no sound in Israel.</p>
                    <p>A double file of camels with sumptuous housings moved with dignified and
                        unhasty tread after the litters. By this time, the foremost ranks of the
                        pro- cession were some distance ahead, the limit of radiance just in
                        advance, and lighting with special tenderness the funeral ark. Here were the
                        bones of that noblest son of Jacob. Having brought Israel into Egypt, Joseph
                        was leading it forth again.</p>
                    <p>Pools, lighted by the ray, glowed like sheets of gold, darkling here and
                        there with shadow; long ledges of rock, bearded with deep-water growth,
                        sparkled rarely in the light; stretches of sodden sand, colored with salts
                        of the waters, and littered with curious fish-life, lay between.</p>
                    <p>Where was the sea?</p>
                    <p>After the camels followed a score of mules, little and trim in contrast to
                        the tall shaggy beasts ahead <pb id="VAA3882-599" n="591"/> of them. They
                        were burden-bearing animals, precious among Israel, for they were laden with
                        the records of the tribes, much treasure in jewels and fine stuffs, incense,
                        writing materials, and such things as the people would need, and were not to
                        be had from among them, or like to be found in the places to which they
                        might come. These passed and their drivers with them.</p>
                    <p>The next moment, Kenkenes was caught in the center of a rushing wave of
                        humanity. He fought off the consternation that threatened to seize him and
                        tried to care for himself, but a reed on the breast of the Nile at flood
                        could not have been more helpless. Be- hind Israel were the Egyptians, ahead
                        of it miraculous escape; the one impulse of the multitude was flight. That
                        any remembered his mate or his children, his goods, his treasure or his
                        cattle, was a marvel.</p>
                    <p>The foremost ranks, moving in directly behind the leaders, had adopted their
                        pace. Furthermore, as the advance-guard, they had a greater sense of
                        security, and before them was all the east open for flight. Not so with the
                        hindmost; they were near the dreaded place from which the army would
                        descend; ahead of them was a deliberate host; within them, soul-consum- ing
                        fear and panic. The rear rushed, the forward ranks walked, and the center
                        caught between was jammed into a compact mass.</p>
                    <p>Neither halt nor escape was possible. Press as the hindmost might upon those
                        forward, the pace was slackened, instead of quickened. The advance grew
                        slower as it extended back through the ranks, for each succeeding line lost
                        a modicum in the length of the step, till at the rear they were pushing hard
                        and barely <pb id="VAA3882-600" n="592"/> moving. No wonder they sobbed,
                        prayed, panted, surged, swayed and pressed. How they reviled the snail-like
                        leaders, not knowing that the sturdy pace lagged in the bddy of the
                        multitude. So they hasted and progressed only inch by inch.</p>
                    <p>After the first moment of battle against the human sea, Kenkenes recognized
                        the futility of resistance and suffered himself to be borne along. There was
                        no turning back now, had he been so disposed. He had left behind him his
                        purposes, unaccomplished.</p>
                    <p>He had received no explicit promise from Moses, and if he had given ear to
                        the doubts of his own reason, he might have been sorely afraid, much
                        troubled for Egypt and all he loved therein. But he went with the multitude
                        passively, even contentedly; he did not speculate how his God would fight
                        for him; his faith was perfect.</p>
                    <p>As for his presence with Israel, no one heeded him. Sometimes it came his way
                        to be helpful; an old man lost his feet and becoming panic-stricken was
                        soothed only when the young Egyptian put a strong arm about him and held him
                        till his feet touched earth again. Children became heavy in the arms of
                        parents and the little Hebrews had no fear of the young man who carried
                        them, a while, instead. But no one stopped to take notice that this was an
                        Egyptian, totally unlike those among the &quot;mixed multitude&quot;
                        that had come to join Israel; nor did any wonder what a nobleman of the
                        blood of the oppressors did among the fleeing slaves. Indeed, if the host
                        had any thought beyond the impulse of self-preservation, it was only a dim
                        realization that they were walking over a most rocky, <pb id="VAA3882-601"
                            n="593"/> oozy and untender road and that the smell of the sea was very
                        strong about them.</p>
                    <p>In the early hours of the morning, having become so accustomed to the roar of
                        the wind and the sound of the moving multitude, Kenkenes ceased to be con-
                        scious of it. Other sounds, which hours before would have failed to reach
                        his ears, became distinct. The crying of tired children reached him, and he
                        detected even snatches of talk among the ranks some distance away from him.
                        Thus a clamor of noise, secondary in force, grew about him. Above it all, at
                        last, came a sound that would have made him halt if he could.</p>
                    <p>He tried to think it one of the many voices of the storm, but the second time
                        he heard it, he knew what it was.</p>
                    <p>Far to the rear, a trumpet-call, beautiful and spirited, rose upon the
                        air.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian army was in pursuit!</p>
                    <p>Israel heard it, and crying aloud in its terror, swept forward, as if the
                        trumpet-call had commanded it. Kenkenes felt a quickening of pulse, a
                        momentary tremor, but no more.</p>
                    <p>He became conscious finally of a warmth penetrating his sandals. He knew that
                        he had been struggling up a slope for a long time, and now he realized that
                        he was again on the dry, sun-heated sand of the desert. The multitude ceased
                        to crowd, the pressure about him diminished; the ranks began to widen to his
                        left and right; the leaders halted altogether, and though there was still
                        much movement among the body and rear of the host, people turned to look
                        upon their neighbors.</p>
                    <p>The overhanging cloud parted from the eastern horizon, leaving a strip of sky
                        softly lighted by the <pb id="VAA3882-602" n="594"/> coming morn. Without
                        any preliminary diminution of its force, the wind failed entirely.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes, with many others, looked back and saw that the pillar, illuminated,
                        but no longer illuminating, had halted above a solitary figure of seemingly
                        super- human stature in the morning gray, standing on an eminence,
                        overlooking the sea.</p>
                    <p>The arm was uplifted and outstretched, tense and motionless.</p>
                    <p>From his superior height, Kenkenes saw, over the heads of the immense
                        concourse, two lines of foam riding like the wind across the sea-bed toward
                        each other. Between them was a great body of plunging horses; overhead a
                        forest of fluttering banners; and faint from the commotion came shouts and
                        wild notes of trumpets. Then, the two lines of foam smote against each other
                        with a fearful rush and a muffled report like the cannonading of surf. A
                        mountain of water pitched high into the air-and collapsed in a vast froth,
                        which spread abroad over the churning, wallow- ing sea. The falling wind
                        dashed a sheet of spray over the silent host on the eastern shore. Sharp
                        against the white foam, dark objects and masses sank, arose, and sank
                        again.</p>
                    <p>At that moment the sun thrust a broad shaft of light between the horizon and
                        the lifted cloud.</p>
                    <p>It discovered only the sea, raving and stormy, and afar to the west a misty,
                        vacant, lifeless line of shore.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen,
                        and all the host of the Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there
                        remained not so much as one of them.&quot;&apos;</p>
                    <p>So perished Har-hat and the flower of the Egyptian army.</p>

                    <p>Of the ensuing day, Kenkenes had no very distinct memory. Very fair and
                        beautiful, one recollection remained—a recollection of another figure on the
                        emi- nence, and by the flash of white upthrown arms, and the blowing of a
                        somber cloud of hair, this time it was a woman. How the morning sun
                        glittered on the shaken timbrel; how the spotless draperies went wild in the
                        wind; how the group of lissome maidens on the sand below wound in and out,
                        in a mazy dance; how the multitude was swept into transports of beatifica-
                        tion; how the men became prophets and the women, psalmists; how the vast
                        wilderness reverberated with a great chant of exultation—all this he
                        remembered as a sublime dream.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter, Israel moved inland and down the coast some distance, for the sea
                        began to surrender its dead. Of the stir and method of the removal he did
                        not remember, but of the encampment and the reassem- bling of the tribes he
                        recalled several incidents. He was numb and sleep-heavy beyond words, and
                        while lean- ing, in a semi-conscious condition, against some house- hold
                        goods, he was discovered by the owner, who was none other than the friendly
                        son of Judah, his assistant in his search for Rachel in Pa-Ramesu. The
                        man&apos;s <pb id="VAA3882-604" n="596"/> honest joy over
                        Kenkenes&apos; safety was good to look upon. A few words of explanation
                        concerning his very apparent exhaustion were fruitful of some com- fort to
                        the young Egyptian. The Hebrew&apos;s wife had a motherly heart, and the
                        weary face of the comely youth touched it. Therefore, she brought him bread
                        and wine and made him a place in the shadow of her tent-furnishings where he
                        might sleep till what time the family shelter could be raised.</p>
                    <p>But Kenkenes did not rest. He fell asleep only to dream of Rachel, and awoke
                        asking himself why he had abandoned the search for her; why he had left
                        Egypt without her; and why he had not gone to Moses at once for aid to
                        further his seeking through Israel.</p>
                    <p>He arose from his place, sick with all the old sus- pense and heartache. He
                        would begin now to look for Rachel and cease not till he found her or died
                        of his weariness.</p>
                    <p>He stepped forth directly in the path of a party of women. He moved aside to
                        give them room, and glancing at the foremost, recognized her immediately as
                        the Lady Miriam. She stopped and looked at him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou art he who found Jehovah in Egypt?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>He bowed in assent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy faith is entire,&quot; she commented. &quot;Also, have
                        I cause to remember thee. Thou didst display a cour- teous spirit in Tape, a
                        year agone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou hast repaid me with the flattery of thy re- membrance, Lady
                        Miriam,&quot; he replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thy speech publishes thee as noble,&quot; she went on calmly.
                        &quot;Thy name?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kenkenes, the son of Mentu, the murket.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-605" n="597"/>
                    <p>Her lips parted suddenly and her eyes gleamed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See yonder tent,&quot; she said, indicating a pavilion of new
                        cloth, reared not far from the quarters of Moses. &quot;Repair thither
                        and await till I send to thee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Without pausing for an answer she swept on, her maidens following, damp of
                        brow and bright of eye.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes turned toward the tent. A Hebrew at the entrance lifted the side
                        without a word and signed him to enter.</p>
                    <p>The interior was not yet fully furnished. A rug of Memphian weave covered the
                        sand and a taboret was placed in the center.</p>
                    <p>Presently the serving-man entered with a laver of sea-water, and an
                        Israelitish robe, fringed and bound at the selvage with blue. With the
                        despatch and adroit- ness of one long used to personal service, he attended
                        the young Egyptian, and dressed him in the stately garments of his own
                        people. When his service was complete, he took up the bowl and cast-off
                        dress and went forth.</p>
                    <p>After a time he brought in a couch-like divan, dressed it with fringed linen
                        and strewed it with cushions; next, he suspended a cluster of lamps from the
                        center-pole; set a tiny inlaid table close to the couch, and on the table
                        put a bottle of wine and a beaker; and brought last a heap of fine rugs and
                        cover- ings which he laid in one corner. The tent was furnished and nobly.
                        The man bowed before Ken- kenes, awaiting the Egyptian&apos;s further
                        pleasure, but at a sign from the young man, bowed again and retired.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes went over to the divan and sat down on it, to wait.</p>
                    <p>Presently some one entered behind him. He arose <pb id="VAA3882-606" n="598"
                        /> and turned. Before him was the most welcome picture his bereaved eyes
                        could have looked upon. His visitor was all in shimmering white and wore no
                        ornament except a collar of golden rings. What need of further adornment
                        when she was mantled and crowned with a glory of golden hair? Except that
                        the face was marble white and the eyes dark and large with quiet sorrow, it
                        was the same divinely beautiful Rachel.</p>
                    <p>It may have been that he was beyond the recupera- tive influence of sudden
                        joy, or that the unexpected restoration of his love might have swept away
                        his forces had he been in full strength; but whatever the cause, Kenkenes
                        sank to his knees and forward into the eager arms flung out to receive him.
                        Her cry of great joy seemed to come to him from afar.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kenkenes! O my love! Not dead; not dead &quot;</p>
                    <p>Then it was he learned that she had despaired, grieving beyond any comfort,
                        for she had counted him with the first-born of Egypt. And even though
                        thoughts came to him but slowly now, he said to himself:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Praise God, I did not think of it, or I had gone dis- tracted with
                        her trouble.&quot;</p>
                    <p>How rich woman-love is in solicitude and minister- ing resource! It made
                        Rachel strong enough to raise him, and having led him back to the divan,
                        gently to lay him down among the cushions. The wine was at her hand, and she
                        filled the beaker, and held it while he drank. Then she kissed him and,
                        hiding her face in his breast, wept soft tears. And though he held her very
                        close and had in his heart a great longing to soothe her, he could not
                        speak.</p>
                    <p>After a little she spoke.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-607" n="599"/>
                    <p>&quot;I had not dreamed that there was such artifice in Miriam. She told
                        me of a nobleman that had served God and Israel, and was in need of comfort
                        in his tent. But she bridled her tongue and governed her expres- sion so
                        cunningly, that I did not dream the hero was mine—mine!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then on a sudden she disengaged herself from his arms and gaining her feet,
                        cried out with her hands over her blushing face:</p>
                    <p>&quot;And now, I know why she and Hur—O I know why they came with me, and
                        brought me to the tent!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nay, now; may I not guess, also?&quot; Kenkenes laughed, though
                        a little puzzled over her evident con- fusion. &quot;They had a mind to
                        peep and spy upon our love-making. Perchance they are without this instant;
                        come hither and let us not disappoint them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She dropped her hands and looked at him with flam- ing cheeks and smiling
                        eyes. There was more in her look than he could fathom, but he did not puzzle
                        longer when she came back to her place and hid her face away from him.</p>
                    <p>It is the love of riper years, that makes the lips of lovers silent. But
                        Kenkenes and Rachel were very young and wholly demonstrative, and they had
                        need of many words to supplement the testimony of caresses. They had much to
                        tell and they left no avowal un- made.</p>
                    <p>But at last Kenkenes&apos; voice wearied and Rachel noted it. So in her
                        pretty authoritative way, she stroked his lashes down and bade him sleep.
                        When she removed her hands and clasped them above his head, his eyes did not
                        open.</p>
                    <p>As she bent over him, she noted with a great sweep <pb id="VAA3882-608"
                            n="600"/> of tenderness how young he was. In all her relations with
                        Kenkenes she had seen him in the manliest roles. She had depended upon him,
                        looked up to him, and had felt secure in his protection. Now she
                        contemplated a face from which content had erased the mature lines that care
                        had drawn. The curve of his lips, the length of the drooping lashes, the
                        roundness of cheek, and the softness of throat, were youthful,—boyish. With
                        this enlightenment her love for him experienced a transfigitration. She
                        seemed to grow older than he; the maternal element leaped to the fore; their
                        positions were instantly reversed. It was hers to care for him.</p>
                    <p>After a long time, his arms relaxed about her, and she undid them and
                        disposed them in easy position. Lifting the fillet from his brow, she
                        smoothed out the mark it had made and settled the cushions more softly under
                        his head. From the heap of coverings she took the amplest and the softest
                        and spread it over him. Remembering that the wind from the sea blew shrewdly
                        at night, she laid rugs about the edges of the tent which fluttered in the
                        breeze and returned again to his side.</p>
                    <p>After another space of rapt contemplation of his unconscious face she went
                        forth and drew the entrance together behind her.</p>
                    <p>The next daybreak was the happiest Israel had known in a hundred years.
                        Egypt, overthrown and humbled, was behind them; God was with them, and
                        Canaan was just ahead—perhaps only beyond the hori- zon. Few but would have
                        laughed at the glory of Babylonia, Assyria and the great powers.</p>
                    <p>For had it not been promised that out of Israel nations should be made, and
                        kings should come?</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-609" n="601"/>
                    <p>The march was to be taken up immediately, and in the cool of the morning the
                        host was ready to advance.</p>
                    <p>Rachel had not permitted herself to be seen until the tent of Miriam was
                        struck. She knew that Kenkenes was without, waiting for her, and with the
                        delightful inconsistency of maidenhood, she dreaded while she longed to meet
                        her beloved again. And when the moment arrived she slipped across the open
                        space to the camel that was to bear her into Canaan, but in the shadow of
                        the faithful creature, Kenkenes overtook her and folded her in his arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A blessing on thee, my sweet! And I am blest in having thee once
                        more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didst thou sleep well?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Most industriously, since I made up what I lost and overlapped a
                        little. And yet I was abroad at dawn prowling about thy tent lest thou
                        shouldst flee me once again. Rachel—&quot; his voice sobered and his
                        face grew serious—&quot;Rachel, wilt thou wed me this day?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If it were only &apos;aye&apos; or &apos;nay&apos;
                        to be said, I should have said it long ago,&quot; she answered with
                        averted eyes, &quot;but there are many things that thou shouldst know,
                        Kenkenes, before thou demandest the answer from me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Name them, Rachel,&quot; he said submissively; &quot;but
                        let me say this first. Mine eyes are not mystic but most truthfully can I
                        tell this moment, which of us twain will rule over my tent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And thou art ready for the tent and shepherd life of
                        Israel?&quot; she asked gravely, but before he could answer she went
                        on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hear me first. So tender hast thou been of me; so much hast thou
                        sacrificed for my sake that it were <pb id="VAA3882-610" n="602"/> unkind to
                        bind thee to me in the life-long sacrifice and life-long hardships that I
                        may know. Thine enemy and mine is dead, and Egypt rid of him. There is much
                        in Egypt to prosper thee; there, thy state is high; there, thou hast
                        opportunity and wealth. Israel can offer thee God and me. Even the faith
                        thou couldst keep in Egypt, so thou wert watchful. And further, thou art the
                        murket&apos;s son, and building takes the place of carving for thee,
                        now. But, here, O Kenkenes, thou must lay thy chisel down for ever, for the
                        faith of the multitude, so newly weaned from idolatry, is too feeble to be
                        tried with the sight of images.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes heard her with a passive countenance. She gave him news,
                        indeed—facts of a troublous nature, but he held his peace and let her
                        proceed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And this, yet further. Once in that time when I was a slave and
                        thou my master and loved me not—&quot;</p>
                    <p>His dark eyes reproached her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didst love me, then, of a truth? But it matters not —and
                        yet&quot;—coming closer to him, &quot;it matters much! In that time
                        ere thou hadst told me so, we talked of Canaan, thou and I. I boasted of it,
                        being but newly filled with it and freshly come from Caleb who taught us.
                        Then, Israel was enslaved and not yet so vastly helped by Jehovah. But alas!
                        I have seen Israel freed, and attended by its God, and by the tokens of its
                        conduct, Israel is far, far from Canaan. I am of Israel and whosoever weds
                        with me, will be of Israel likewise. It may not be that I shall escape my
                        peo- ple&apos;s sorrows. Shall I bring them upon thy head, also, my
                        Kenkenes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a little he answered, sighing.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-611" n="603"/>
                    <p>&quot;Thou dost not love me, Rachel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kenkenes!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye, I have said. Thou wouldst send me away from thee, back into
                        Egypt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;O, seest thou not? I would have thee know thy heart; I would not
                        have thee choose blindly; I do but sacrifice myself,&quot; she cried,
                        panic-stricken.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And yet, thou wouldst deny me that same delight of sacrifice. Can I
                        not surrender for thee as well?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She drooped her head and did not answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah! thou speakest of the benefits of Egypt,&quot; he continued.
                        &quot;What were Egypt without thee, save a great darkness haunted and
                        vacant? Besides, there is no Egypt beyond this sea. She hath risen and
                        crossed with Israel—all her beauty and her glory and her beneficence. For
                        thou art Egypt and shalt be to me all that I loved in Egypt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took her hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why may I not as justly doubt thy knowledge of thy heart?&quot;
                        he asked softly.</p>
                    <p>Seeing that she surrendered, he persisted no further in his protest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When wilt thou wed me, my love?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She drew back from him a little, though she will- ingly left her hands where
                        they were, and Kenkenes, noting the flush on her cheeks, the pretty gravity
                        of her brow, and the well-known air she assumed when she discoursed, smiled
                        and said fondly to himself:</p>
                    <p>&quot;By the signs, I am to be taught something more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thou knowest, my Kenkenes,&quot; she began, &quot;the
                        Hebrews are married simply. There is feasting and dancing and the bride is
                        taken to the house of her <pb id="VAA3882-612" n="604"/> father-in-law.
                        Thereafter there is still much feasting, but the wedding ceremony is done at
                        the home-bring- ing of the bride.&quot;</p>
                    <p> &quot;I hear,&quot; said Kenkenes when she paused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am without kindred; thou art here without house. There can be no
                        wedding feast for us, nor dancing nor singing, for Israel is on the
                        march.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of a truth,&quot; Kenkenes assented.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So there is only the essential portion of the cere- mony left to
                        us—the home-bringing of the bride.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is enough,&quot; said Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hur and Miriam brought me to thy tent last night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With his face lighting, Kenkenes drew her to him and put his arm about
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So if thou wilt, we shall say—that—from—that moment—&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her voice grew lower, her words more unready and failed altogether.</p>
                    <p>&quot;From that moment,&quot; he said eagerly, reassuring her.
                        &quot;From that moment—&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;From that moment, I have been thy wife!&quot;</p>

                    <p>One sunset, shortly after his marriage, word came to the tent of Kenkenes
                        that an Amalekite chieftain on his way to Egypt had paused for the night
                        just without the encampment of Israel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here may be an opportunity to speak with thy father,&quot;
                        Rachel suggested. The prospect of talking once again to those he had left
                        behind was one too full of pleasure for the young Egyptian to receive
                        calmly. Hurriedly he despatched one of his serving men to the Amalekite to
                        bid him await a message. But Rachel called the messenger back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell the Amalekite that thou comest from an Egyp- tian noble. For
                        such thy master is, and this chieftain is more willing to take command from
                        Egypt than from Israel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The servant in his enthusiasm and the importance of his mission told the
                        Amalekite that he came from a prince of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The chieftain was a youth who had just succeeded his father over his people
                        and was on his way to Mem- phis bearing tribute to Meneptah. To this
                        tributary nation Egypt was remote, splendid and full of glamour. The name
                        was synonymous of the world and all the glories thereof, and particularly
                        had it appealed to the active imagination of this youth. He had seen many
                            <pb id="VAA3882-614" n="606"/> Egyptians, but they were naked prisoners
                        laboring in the mines of Sinai, or overseers or scribes or the an- cient
                        exile who was governor of the province,—and surely these were not
                        representative of the land.</p>
                    <p>Now he was to get a glance at real Egypt.</p>
                    <p>In the early hours of the dawn a follower came to his pallet and told him in
                        awed tones that the prince was without. Tremulous with pleasurable
                        trepidation, he went out into the misty daybreak twilight of the open. And
                        there he met an imperial stranger who towered over him as a palm over a
                        shrub. At a single glance the Amalekite saw that there was a circlet of gold
                        about the brow, that the face was fine and that the garments swept the
                        sands. All this was significant, but when the stranger delivered him two
                        rolls, one addressed to the chief of the royal scribes of the Pharaoh, the
                        other to the royal murket, and paid him with a jewel, the Amalekite,
                        convinced and satisfied, prostrated himself.</p>
                    <p>But we may not know what the youth thought when he found that there were few
                        in all Egypt like this princely stranger.</p>
                    <p>After these writings came, with all fidelity, to the hands of those who loved
                        him in Egypt, silence fell be- tween them and Kenkenes.</p>
                    <p>Meneptah erected no more monuments after the eighth year of his reign, for in
                        that year Mentu, the murket, died. None could fill his place, since to his
                        name was attached the title &quot;the Incomparable,&quot; as be-
                        fitted the artist of that great Pharaoh, likewise titled, who had so loved
                        him and his genius. Meneptah, in memory of Mentu and his artist son who had
                        served his king so well, set up no sculptor nor any murket in his place. It
                        was the one graceful act in the life of the <pb id="VAA3882-615" n="607"/>
                        feeble king, the one resolution to which he held most tenaciously.</p>
                    <p>Though Mentu&apos;s union with Senci was short, it was most happy, save
                        perhaps for the absence of Kenkenes. But after the letter came from the
                        well-beloved son there was more cheer in the heart of the father. Ken- kenes
                        was not dead, only absent, as he would have been had he lived in Tanis or
                        Thebes. Furthermore, the young man had spoken glowingly and at length on the
                        future of Israel and the Promised Land, and Mentu told himself that he might
                        visit Kenkenes one day in that new country.</p>
                    <p>Since there were no children in their house, Senci and the murket spoiled
                        Anubis, and in the eyes of his devoted master the ape had earned his soft
                        life. Short- ly after the departure of Kenkenes Mentu discovered the ape
                        burying something in the sand of the courtyard flower-beds. In spite of the
                        favorite&apos;s vigorous pro- tests Mentu overturned the tiny heap of
                        earth and dis- covered therein the lapis-lazuli signet. There was but one
                        explanation of the ape&apos;s possession of the gem. He had torn the
                        scarab from about the neck of Unas when he flew in his face, the moment the
                        light went out. After his nature, he kept the jewel because it was
                        bright.</p>
                    <p>All these things—the discovery of the signet in the tomb, the safety of
                        Kenkenes when all the other first- born had died, and the testimony of the
                        miracles to the power of Israel&apos;s God—made the good murket think
                        deeply. Indeed, all Egypt thought deeply after the Exodus of Israel, and to
                        such extremes was this sober thinking carried that through very fear many
                        added the name of the Hebrews&apos; God to the Pantheon. <pb
                            id="VAA3882-616" n="608"/> Mentu did not go so far, because he saw the
                        inconsist- ency in such procedure, but he shook his head and pon- dered and
                        was not wholly satisfied with many things in the Osirian creed.</p>
                    <p>Of the love of Hotep and Masanath something yet remains to be told. It was
                        common to examine the en- tire family of a traitor as to their complicity in
                        his mis- deeds, and the option lay with the Pharaoh whether or not they
                        should bear some of his punishment. Har-hat was dead, the army destroyed at
                        his hands. When the news of the disaster reached Tanis Meneptah&apos;s
                        anger and grief knew no bounds.</p>
                    <p>After Rameses had been interred at Thebes beside his fathers, and the court
                        had returned to Memphis, the king summoned Masanath, the sole representative
                        of the family of Har-hat, to give reason why she should not be accused of
                        complicity in the treason of her father.</p>
                    <p>Meneptah had taken counsel with none on this step. Perhaps he had an inkling
                        that it would be unpopular; perhaps he thought he was but fulfilling the
                        law. Ho- tep was at On comforting his family, who mourned over Bettis, and
                        most of the other ministers were scat- tered over Egypt lamenting their own
                        dead, and few expected the ungallant act of the king.</p>
                    <p>But one day, when all the court had reassembled, Masanath came into the great
                        council chamber. Alone and dressed in mourning, she seemed so little and de-
                        fenseless that Meneptah stirred uncomfortably in his throne. Slowly she
                        approached the dais and fell on her knees before the king. The great
                        gathering of courtiers held its breath, wondering and pitying.</p>
                    <p>Such was the scene upon which Hotep came all un- <pb id="VAA3882-617" n="609"
                        /> knowing. At a glance he understood the situation. It was too much for his
                        well-bridled spirit. With a cry, full of horror, indignation and compassion,
                        he dropped his writing-case and scroll, and, rushing forward, flung himself
                        on his knees beside her, one arm about her, the other extended in
                        supplication to the Pharaoh.</p>
                    <p>Meneptah, who, from the moment of Masanath&apos;s en- trance into the
                        council chamber, had begun to repent his ill-advised act, was glad to be won
                        over. At the end of Hotep&apos;s impassioned story he came down from the
                        dais, and raising Masanath, kissed her and put her into the young
                        man&apos;s arms. Supplementing his pardon with command, he ordered his
                        scribe to marry the sad little orphan at once and take her away from the
                        scene of her sorrows till Isis restored her in spirits again.</p>
                    <p>The alacrity with which this royal command was obeyed proved how acceptable
                        it was to the lovers. By the next sunset they were going by a slow and
                        sumptuous boat down the broad bosom of the Nile toward the sea, but they had
                        no care whether or not they ever reached their destination.</p>
                    <p>After some months spent on the coast, Masanath grew stronger and began to
                        live with much apprecia- tion of the joys of existence. On their return to
                        Mem- phis Hotep was made fan-bearer in Har-hat&apos;s place, and for the
                        remaining fourteen years of Meneptah&apos;s reign practically ruled over
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Vastly different, however, was his favoritism from the favoritism of Har-hat.
                        During the wise adminis- tration of the young adviser Egypt recovered some-
                        thing of her former glory, lost in the dreadful plague- ridden days
                        preceding the Exodus. The army was re- organized first, for
                        Ta-user&apos;s party began to make dem- <pb id="VAA3882-618" n="610"/>
                        onstrations the hour that the news of the Red Sea dis- aster reached the
                        Hak-heb. All public building and na- tional extravagance were halted, and
                        the surplus treas- ure was expended in restocking the fields and grana- ries
                        and restoring commerce. Within five years after the Exodus the great check
                        Egypt had met in her nine- teenth dynasty was not greatly apparent.</p>
                    <p>So the land recovered from the plagues, but its ruler never. The death of
                        Rameses lay like a heavy sin and torturing remorse on his conscience. He
                        wept till the feeble eyes lost their sight, but not their susceptibility to
                        tears. At last, succumbing to melancholia, he be- came a child, for whom
                        Hotep reigned and for whom the queen cared with touching devotion.</p>
                    <p>The story of Seti is history. It is needless to say that his rough usage at
                        the hands of Ta-user awakened him, but it was long before he found courage
                        to return to Io, the sweetheart of his childhood. Yet, when he did, after
                        the manner of her kind, she wept over him and took him back without a word
                        of reproach. So the fair-faced sister of Hotep came to be queen over Egypt
                        and took another title with Nefer-ari as prefix, and the quaint Danaid name,
                        Io, was lost to all lips but Seti&apos;s and Hotep&apos;s.</p>
                    <p>After Seti came to the throne he continued Hotep in the advisership and
                        prepared to reign happily. But in a little time the Thebaid, long
                        disaffected, seceded from the federation of Egypt and crowned Amon-meses
                        king of Thebes. Seti gathered his army, marched against the rebellious
                        district, put Amon-meses to the sword and reduced the Thebaid to submission.
                        Then he returned to Memphis for another space of pros- perity.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-619" n="611"/>
                    <p>At the end of a year Ta-user and Siptah, after much browbeating of the
                        Hak-heb, raised funds sufficient to purchase mercenaries. Then, with Ta-user
                        at the head in barbaric splendor, they descended on Memphis.</p>
                    <p>The course Seti pursued has puzzled historians. He gathered up his family,
                        his court, his treasure, and without so much as lifting a spear, fled into
                        Ethiopia. After some time Ta-user sent to him and conferred upon him the
                        title of the Prince of Cush.</p>
                    <p>To the friends of the young Pharaoh it was patent that he feared to meet
                        Ta-user. Having succumbed once to her influence, to his undoing and the
                        misery of his beloved Io, he dared not come under the all-com- pelling eyes
                        of the sorceress again. So he surrendered his crown and his country for his
                        soul&apos;s sake.</p>
                    <p>But fifty years after, Seti&apos;s son, the formidable Set- Nekt,
                        returned into Egypt and restored the Rameside house on a basis so solid that
                        another glorious dynasty arose thereon, second only in brilliance to that
                        which had gone out in the anarchy of Siptah and Ta-user&apos;s reign.
                        This done, he wreaked personal vengeance upon the usurpers of his
                        father&apos;s throne. He broke open the tomb of Siptah and Ta-user,
                        threw out their bodies to the jackals, obliterated the inscriptions,
                        enlarged the crypt, put his own and his father&apos;s history on the
                        walls and used it for his mausoleum when he died.</p>
                    <p>And this was the deadliest retaliation he could in- flict in his
                        father&apos;s name.</p>
                    <p>Much of this Kenkenes learned from the lips of Egyptian merchants whom he met
                        in Canaan, forty years after the Exodus.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes was a proselyte who had found his God for himself. He believed as he
                        drew his breath and as <pb id="VAA3882-620" n="612"/> his heart beat,
                        involuntarily and without any lapse. Never could a son of Israel have
                        surrendered himself more eagerly to the law. Its good and its purposes were
                        ever before his eyes, and his footsteps led in the paths that it lighted.
                        Though he saw not the Lord in a burning bush nor talked with Him on Sinai,
                        he found Him on the lonely uplands of the sheep-ranges and heard Him in the
                        voiceless night on the limitless desert. The young Egyptian was not yet
                        twenty years old at the time of the numbering before Sinai, and he entered
                        the Promised Land with Joshua and Caleb. For verily he walked with God all
                        the days of his life.</p>
                    <p>It must not be supposed that there was no serene life nor any happiness in
                        the long wandering of forty years. A generation of oriental adults
                        practically dies out in that time. The passing of the elders of Israel,
                        though it was accomplished by plagues and sendings for iniquities, was as
                        the passing of the old in the Orient to-day. The encampment was not
                        continually filled with calamity and great mourning—far from it. There were
                        long stretches of peace and plenty, extend- ing almost uninterruptedly for
                        years, and those who followed the law escaped the intervals of
                        catastrophe.</p>
                    <p>Kenkenes was among the chosen people but not of them, partly because he was
                        of the execrated race of the oppressors and partly because the most of
                        Israel had nothing in common with the nobleman. But Moses loved him and
                        found joy in his company. Joshua loved him and had him by his side when
                        Israel warred. Ca- leb and Aaron loved him because he was godly, and Miriam
                        was proud of him and was mild in his presence. He took no public part in the
                        people&apos;s affairs, yet who shall say that he was not near when
                        Bezaleel wrought <pb id="VAA3882-621" n="613"/> the wondrous angels for the
                        ark? Who shall say that his purest jewel did not enter the breast-plate of
                        the high priest? There are many names embraced in that general term,
                        &quot;every wise-hearted man among them that wrought the work of the
                        tabernacle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So when Israel took up the forty years of pasture- hunting in Paran, Kenkenes
                        made his tent beautiful and pitched it always apart from the multitude, and
                        here he was contented all the days that Israel tarried in that place. Under
                        his care his flocks increased, his cat- tle multiplied and his camels were
                        not few, and he laid up riches for the four stalwart sons and the golden-
                        haired daughter who were to live after him.</p>
                    <p>From the moment of his union with his beautiful wife, through the long years
                        of semi-isolation that he knew thereafter, he grew closer and closer to
                        Rachel. She filled all his needs as Israel failed to supply them, and he
                        missed neither friend nor neighbor when she was near. Rachel knew wherein
                        she was more fortu- nate than other women and her content and her devo- tion
                        were beyond measure. So Kenkenes and Rachel were lovers all the days of
                        their lives.</p>
                    <p>If ever they grew reminiscent there was one name spoken more tenderly than
                        any other—the name of Atsu. Kenkenes would grow sad of countenance and he
                        would look away, but there was no jealousy in his heart for the tears of
                        Rachel weeping over the task- master who died for her.</p>
                    <p>The collar of golden rings became popular in Israel, and, after many
                        modifications effected by time and fashion, it came at last to be the
                        insignia of the virtuous woman. For centuries it was worn and no one knows
                        when the custom died out.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3882-622" n="614"/>
                    <p>The genius of Kenkenes did not die. His voice en- riched with age, and the
                        rocky vales wherein his flocks wandered had melodious echoes whenever he
                        followed the sheep. But he never used chisel upon stone again. His sons were
                        artists after him, but they were handi- capped also. And so it continued for
                        many genera- tions until the Temple of Solomon was built. Then, though the
                        plans came from the Lord, and artisans were brought from Tyre, it was the
                        descendants of Kenkenes who made the Temple beautiful &quot;with carved
                        figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and
                        without.&quot;</p>

                <head>AUTHOR&apos;S NOTE</head>
                <p>When the Chaldeans prostrated themselves before Nebuchadnezzar, they cried:
                    &quot;O King, live forever!&quot; When patrician Rome hailed Nero in the
                    Circus, the acclaim was: &quot;Vivat Imperator!&quot; When the faithful
                    saluted the Caliph, they said: &quot;May thy shadow never grow
                    less.&quot;</p>
                <p>Humanity, living in eternal contemplation of the tomb, offers its highest tribute
                    in bespeaking immor- tality for its great.</p>
                <p>But Egypt did not invoke the gift of deathlessness upon the Pharaoh; she declared
                    it. He was an Im- mortal and died not. Though he more nearly justified the
                    confident declaration of his people, he but proved that there is no sublunar
                    immortality, though in Egypt-almost.</p>
                <p>The Pharaoh lived with a triple purpose: the per- petuity of his empire, of his
                    dynasty, of his individual- ity. He steeped his body in indestructibility and
                    wrote his name in adamant. He employed the manifold means at the command of his
                    era, and whether his monument were a colossus, a temple or a city, he builded
                    well.</p>
                <p>While Europe was yet a vast tract of gloomy for- ests, and morasses, and plains,
                    while the stone that was to rear Troy was yet scattered on the slopes of Ida,
                    Mena, the first Pharaoh of the first Dynasty, de- flected the Nile against the
                    Arabian hills and built <pb id="VAA3882-624" n="616"/> Memphis in its bed. So
                    saith the writings that are graven in stone. If this be true, this story deals
                    with a quaint but efficient civilization that was already three thousand years
                    old, fourteen centuries before Christ.</p>
                <p>An effort has been made to conform to the history of the time as it comes down to
                    us in the form of biblical accounts and the writings of contemporaneous
                    chroniclers. The author has taken liberty with ac- cepted history in the age of
                    Meneptah&apos;s first-born and in placing Hebrews in the quarries at
                    Masaarah. The escape of Kenkenes in the Passover is not in- tended to contradict
                    the biblical statement that not one of the eldest born was spared. Rather, it is
                    offered, as an hypothesis, that the Angel of Death would have passed over any
                    true believer in Jehovah, regardless of his nationality. Furthermore, the author
                    has given the Greek spelling to some names, the Egyptic to others, the purpose
                    being to present those pronuncia- tions most familiar to readers.</p>
                <p>For all facts herein set forth, the author is indebted to a multitude of
                    authorities, chiefly to Wilkinson, Birch, Rawlinson, Ebers, and Erman.</p>
