            <p>The days when American socialists counted their sympathizers in hundreds of thousands are gone, and
                    many students and historians are unaware that fifty years ago the Socialist Party of America was a
                    power to be reckoned with in presidential elections. The history books that extol the campaign
                    exploits of William Jennings Bryan, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson often fail to record that
                    the most famous American socialist, Eugene Victor Debs, waged five presidential campaigns between
                    1900 and 1920. None of these campaigns was more colorful than that of 1908, the year of the
                    "Red Special." Preserved in song and poem, as well as in the fading memories of
                    participants and bystanders, the Socialist party's campaign of that year illustrated the
                    vigor of the organization and the amount of effort which Socialists could pour into a national
                    campaign.</p>
            <p>By 1908, the Socialist Party of America had made considerable progress toward fulfilling the promise
                    it had shown in the presidential election of 1904. It could now claim its place as the third party
                    of American politics, a position it had taken from the Prohibitionists in 1904. Politically, the
                    Socialists were gaining strength on local levels. In <placeName>

                    and in various areas in the Midwest.</p>
            <p>In addition to devoting a great deal of time, energy, and strength to waging electoral contests, the
                    Socialists continued their work in the labor movement. They acted as an ever-present irritant to
                    conservative leadership in the American Federation of Labor, which feared the Socialists'
                    tactics of "boring from within." Furthermore, several prominent Socialists, among
                    them the nationally known and influential Eugene V. Debs, helped found the radical Industrial
                    Workers of the World in 1905.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The I.W.W. was especially dedicated to organizing
                    the "unorganizable" workers in the mines, mills, and lumber camps of the country,
                    and the A.F. of L. quite rightly looked upon it as a rival. Particularly in the West, the I.W.W.
                    acquired a radical tone that caused it to be tarred with the brush of anarcho-syndicalism, and it
                    quickly became anathema to other labor unions and labor leaders.</p>
            <p>In addition to political action and work with organized labor, the Socialists by 1908 had begun what
                    promised to be a substantial program for the farmers of the West and Midwest.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>Though their growing strength seemed substantial, the Socialists posed no immediate threat to the
                    political control of the two older parties; but they stood as a reminder that they were perhaps only
                    the first expression of a much larger potential. The Socialists who were elected to public office
                    were usually moderates pledged to political reform rather than to revolution. They usually seemed
                    content to work for a more distant socialistic utopia. Their propaganda not only contributed to
                    their own success but in some areas, such as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>

                    represented a party whose prospects had greatly improved since the national convention of 1904. They
                    spoke for more than 40,000 dues paying members, twice as many as in 1904, and represented an
                    organization that was divided into approximately 3,000 locals in nearly every state and territory in
                    the Union. The dues and contributions paid into the national headquarters supported a propaganda
                    program that operated day and night to spread the message of socialism. A number of full time paid
                    organizers, as well as an estimated 4,000 volunteer stump speakers, were in the field the year
                    around on behalf of socialism. More than 100 weekly newspapers were pro-Socialist, and the party

            <p>Only seven years had passed since the formation of the unified Socialist Party of America, but the
                    membership had already undergone striking changes. These changes were reflected by the delegates who

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1908 to attend to party business and to nominate a presidential ticket. Most of the
                    founders of the party had been young people engaged in radical pursuits within journalism,
                    lecturing, labor organizing, and the professions.11 Many of their successors at the convention of
                    1908 bore testimony to the growing strength of the "parlor socialists" within the
                    party, those Socialists who were willing to reform rather than to revolt. Their watchword was
                    orderly evolution toward state socialism; they rejected the class struggle and the need for social
                    revolution. They were usually ministers, lawyers, writers, professors, and small businessmen.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These "Slowcialists," as their more radical comrades called them, were opposed
                    within the party by a radical left wing and by a group of centrists, who hoped to avoid violence but
                    who called for a more forthright socialism. The more radical labor organizers, lecturers,
                    journalists, and a few national figures like Eugene V. Debs either belonged openly to the radical
                    group or flirted with it. The organization of the I.W.W. by this group in 1905 and their continued
                    talk of social revolution and labor violence alarmed the right wing of the party, and by 1908 lines
                    were drawn between the groups for a struggle over policy making organs and for control of the party
                        machinery.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>The dragon's teeth of intra-party conflict had been sown long before 1908, and it was

                    </placeName> that struggle would be the watchword of the day. Dissension quickly appeared in the
                    debates over the party's official attitude toward organized labor and in the preliminary
                    skirmishes over drafting a platform for the coming national campaign. The left wing delegates wanted
                    open condemnation of the A.F. of L. policies of cooperation with management, a strong call for
                    organized labor's political support in the coming campaign, and official recognition of the
                    I.W.W. On the other hand, the right wing demanded that a conciliatory tone be adopted. The result
                    was a compromise resolution which called on labor to vote the Socialist ticket and a general
                    statement on the importance of organized labor.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>Factionalism again reared its head when nominations for president and vice-president were in order.
                    Eugene V. Debs had borne the Socialist standard in 1900 and 1904, and it was inevitable that his
                    name would be placed in nomination again. No figure within the Socialist movement was more widely
                    known and loved than Debs, and the cheers that greeted his nomination were a tribute to his past
                    work for the party. Once the cheers died down, John Spargo of <placeName>

                    Debs' rumored poor health and his "mistakes" in past campaigns.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> When Spargo finished it looked as though the right and center wings might be
                    able to combine and prevent Debs' nomination. Many delegates had heard rumors about
                    Debs' health and wondered if he was able to conduct another grueling national campaign.

                    letter from Debs. Whatever doubts the delegates may have had faded as Hanford read the letter.
                    "My general health is about all that could be desired", Debs wrote. "So
                    far as strength is concerned, I never had more to my credit, if as much."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The letter ended with a pledge of support for whomever received the nomination and a tacit
                    invitation for the nomination. "You need have no fear that I shall shirk my part in the
                    coming campaign. I shall be in good condition, and I hope there will be no good ground for complaint
                    when the fight is over."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> The letter did not prevent further
                    nominations, but Debs' assurances that he was well and physically able to conduct another
                    national campaign, together with his great support among the rank and file Socialists, assured his
                    nomination. The first ballot gave him 159 of the 198 votes cast.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Hanford was
                    nominated for the vice presidency and after a long wrangle the convention adopted a compromise

            </p>
            <p>Few people were surprised when Debs received his third successive presidential nomination. No other
                    Socialist commanded the audience and respect accorded Eugene Victor Debs. He had been a member of
                    the Socialist Party of America since its founding in 1901; and prior to that time, he had engaged in
                    Socialist politics in the old Social Democratic party. He had come to socialism with a national
                    reputation gained from his work in organized labor before the turn of the century. Born in Indiana
                    in 1855, Debs had grown up believing that labor unions could be used as tools of social progress. At
                    an early age he began work as a labor organizer and gained substantial recognition when he founded
                    the American Railway Union in 1893. It was an industrial union and Debs championed industry-wide
                    unionization throughout his long career.</p>
            <p>Debs attained national prominence when the American Railway Union joined the Pullman strikers in <placeName>

                    served a jail term. When he emerged from jail he was a changed man, and shortly thereafter he

                    champion their cause. In 1900 he ran as the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic party
                    and polled almost a hundred thousand votes. Four years later he quadrupled that vote as the
                    candidate of the unified Socialist Party of America. He was eminently successful as a propagandizer
                    and agitator and was quickly recognized as one of the prophets of American socialism. He wrote much
                    and campaigned perpetually, lecturing to large audiences all over the country the year around. His
                    studied efforts to avoid entanglement in party factionalism were not always successful; though he
                    considered himself a radical Socialist, he retained his popularity with almost all the factions
                    within the party and especially with the rank and file party members and sympathizers throughout the
                    country.</p>
            <p>Ever anxious to avoid quarrels with his comrades, Debs had gone to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Girard</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
               </placeName>, to write
                    copy for the <hi rend="i">Appeal to Reason</hi> while the convention was in session; he received the
                    news of his nomination while working in the cramped editorial offices there. He began his campaign
                    at once. Fred Warren, an <hi rend="i">Appeal</hi> staff member, suggested that he and Debs take a
                    walk to the town square, where a "carnival" was in progress. Anxious for a little
                    exercise, Debs agreed. The "carnival" turned out to be a crowd waiting for Debs.
                    Though somewhat surprised at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>'s little subterfuge, Debs launched into a characteristic biting attack on
                    capitalism which set the tone of his whole campaign. He told the assembled farmers and townspeople
                    that he hated capitalism because it was "a system in which labor is simply merchandise; in
                    which the man who works the hardest and longest has the least to show for it."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> To him the eternal question was the many versus the few, of want versus
                    plenty; and he blamed all evil 011 capitalism. Unemployment and idle factories reminded voters in
                    1908 of the Panic of 1907, and Debs exploited this theme to the fullest. "Nothing is more
                    humiliating than to have to beg for work," he told his Girard audience, "and a
                    system in which any man has to beg for work stands condemned. No man can defend it."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> He ended with an appeal for organized labor's support, in which he
                    also vigorously expressed hope that the farmers <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The response from the crowd was electric, proving that Debs could still hold a crowd as no other
                    Socialist could. A recent throat operation had sparked the rumors that he was in poor health, but
                    there was little evidence of illness in his first speech. At the beginning of his career, Debs had
                    been considered an indifferent orator. Julius Wayland, the peppery publisher of the Appeal to
                    Reason, had thought him only average; Art Young, famous radical cartoonist, had compared him to a
                    schoolboy elocutionist.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> By 1908, his two previous presidential campaigns and
                    his perpetual speaking tours on behalf of a multitude of causes had had their effect, and he was
                    considered one of the most effective orators in national life. There was little variety in the
                    content of his speeches but he combined the drama of radicalism, the verve of appeal, and flair for
                    the dramatic into vivid words and gestures that indelibly impressed the minds of his audiences.</p>
            <p>A few weeks after Debs' speech at Girard, which opened his own campaign, the Republicans
                    held their national convention in <placeName>

                    William Howard Taft, for the Republican nomination. With Roosevelt's backing, Taft was
                    easily nominated on a platform that extolled the reform program of the Roosevelt administration and
                    which promised four more years of liberal Republicanism under Taft.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Though
                    Taft himself was considerably more cautious in his public statements than Roosevelt would have

                    developed rapidly and it soon became apparent that there would be little rest for Debs until
                    election day. Though he had said he would rather write than speak during the campaign, once
                    nominated he entered the fray with all his strength. By late summer he was speaking several times a

                    defray campaign costs, he generally spoke to packed houses. Everywhere his speeches inspired scenes
                    of adulation and the receptions accorded him were often idolatrous. While he was trying to quiet a
                    crowd in <placeName>

                    smashed into his open palm. The watcher felt himself electrically identified with Debs'
                    torrential eloquence as the tall, lanky, balding speaker strode back and forth across the platform,
                    his voice alternately scornful and soothing, rousing and hopeful, ironic and biting. He never spared
                    his opponents, but his audiences were never overcome by a sense of hatred or by a feeling that Debs
                    employed vilification for its own sake since even his hardest <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The flurry of activity around the Socialist campaign and the apparent success of Debs'
                    speeches aroused the interest and curiosity of Lincoln Steffens, veteran journalist and muckraker.
                    He asked Debs for an interview in order to question him about his own and the Socialist
                    party's stand on the issues of the day. He met Debs in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milwaukee</settlement>
                    </placeName> after attending a Socialist picnic at which he estimated that twenty five thousand
                    people had bought admission tickets to hear Debs give a rousing speech. Steffens, Debs, and Victor
                    Berger, who was a veteran <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milwaukee</settlement>
                    </placeName> Socialist and a leading conservative in the party, went to the latter's home
                    for the interview when the picnic was over. Debs gave some forthright answers to Steffens'
                    questions. Asked what he would do with the trusts, he shrugged his shoulders and replied that he
                    would simply confiscate them without compensation to the owners on the grounds that the original
                    investments had long since been repaid. Berger was instantly on his feet. "No. No, you
                    wouldn't. Not if I was there," he snapped at Debs. "And you shall not say
                    it for the party. It is my party as much as it is your party, and I answer that we would offer to
                        pay."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Debs and Berger disagreed on the question of confiscation of the trusts, they at least agreed that
                    once capitalism was uprooted mankind could enter into an age of limitless progress. Berger too
                    blamed all evils on the capitalistic system, but he employed softer language than Debs and was
                    anxious to avoid violence. He agreed with Debs who argued that the trust owner, like the
                    improverished worker, was only a product of the capitalistic system and that once the trusts were
                    nationalized and operated for the benefit of all the people they would cease to be an evil.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    range. The argument between the two Socialists highlighted the differences between the wings of the
                    party. Berger insisted that the revolution was "coming every day" and that the
                    socialist commonwealth could be established without violence. He and the conservatives for whom he
                    spoke were anxious to hold political office in an effort to enact their set of "immediate
                    demands" and were often willing to cooperate with other reform elements in order to obtain
                    half the Socialist loaf. They feared that the work of the radical Socialists in the labor unions
                    would weaken the party's appeal to the "respectable" reform element. They
                    were content with evolution rather than revolution. "Next year, or ten years, or twenty
                    years, or a hundred years from now, we shall perhaps still be working toward the completing of our
                    civilization— toward Socialism," Berger told the delegates to the national
                        convention.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> His conservative supporters could only nod in agreement.</p>
            <p>Debs had as much faith in the coming cooperative commonwealth as any Socialist, but he had less time.
                    He felt that organized labor and political agitation were the keys to the Socialist kingdom. There
                    was often a wide gulf between Debs' public statements and his private actions. In reality,
                    he was no more fond of violence than Berger, regardless of his sharp tongue and tall words, and he
                    too hoped that the revolution could be avoided by educating the public in Socialist doctrine. He
                    insisted, however, that American socialism would fail unless it was truly socialistic with its base
                    on the working class rather than on the middle class. He watched the growing power of the
                    conservatives within the party with alarm, and he undertook another exhausting national campaign in
                    part to counter these conservative tendencies. To Berger's question "Did you ever
                    see an impossibilist do something?"<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Debs could answer that he
                    had—at the Pullman barns in 1894, in his many tours of the West, and in his daily
                    contacts with the people.</p>
            <p>Steffens commented frankly that Debs did not seem to be presidential timber, and the Socialist
                    candidate readily agreed. He answered that he campaigned for propaganda purposes, <list type="footnotes">

                    would step aside in favor of a more qualified man. Debs realized as much as anyone else that he was
                    the evangelist of American socialism, not the thinker or practical politician. He agitated frankly
                    and used every means at his command to spread the Socialist gospel. He never burdened his audiences
                    with theories or abstractions, preferring to hammer home epigrams that remained embedded in his
                    listeners' memories. He preferred to speak and write in idioms and metaphors that the
                    people at large could understand, that made socialism's message live for them. One of his
                    friends once told Debs that he simply could not accept some of the wild things that he often said.
                    Debs replied, "Well, you have to give the workingmen something vigorous if you want to wake
                    them up."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Steffens left <placeName>

                    standard, for he later wrote Brand Whitlock urging him to vote for Debs even though he had no chance

            <p>While Debs was touring the Midwest and East, speaking at rallies, picnics, parks, giving interviews,
                    and writing material for the Socialist press, his campaign manager, J. Mahlon Barnes, had a
                    brainstorm. Why not rent a train and outfit it as a moving campaign headquarters? Debs could ride
                    across the country speaking in every city and at every crossroads. What better way to advertise
                    socialism and to reflect its growth as a national political force? Though most conservative
                    Socialists were skeptical, Bill Haywood, Debs, and others set to work raising the necessary funds.
                    It was estimated that such a train would cost $20,000; it ultimately cost
                        $35,000.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Haywood conducted a series of huge meetings, asking
                    for contributions; a corps of lesser Socialists went fund gathering and before long enough money was

                    immense drain on Debs' time and strength. Often exhausted after a series of speeches, he
                    would sink down in his chair, loosen his collar, and smile weakly after shaking their hands, trying
                    to say as little as possible in order to spare his throat for the next speech. The train consisted
                    of an engine, a combination sleeper and diner in which Debs, his brother Theodore, and their
                    assistants somehow had to eat, sleep, and work, as well as a baggage car stuffed to the top with all
                    kinds of Socialist literature. A brass band provided music when the train pulled into a station.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            <p>Even before the train was underway, Debs took note of the enthusiasm that greeted his speeches and

            <p>By this time the party on the Red Special had run out of funds and the train was threatened with
                    being stranded on the West Coast. Debs called a meeting and decided that they would somehow have to

                    </placeName> offered to make a quick trip selling literature and guaranteed a return of eight
                    hundred dollars. Appeals to the rank and file brought a flood of nickels and dimes into the national
                    headquarters. Contributions were taken at the larger rallies and support from a few wealthy
                    sympathizers in the East saved the day. The Red Special was able to continue its journey.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>Debs' throat, a major cause of concern among those around him, began to bother him more and
                    more. The incessant speaking kept his throat raw; and the pressure of greetings, tours, and
                    appearances, plus the fact that he often got out of bed in the middle of the night to greet crowds,
                    drained his strength and prevented his recuperation. Sometimes his voice failed him completely in
                    the middle of a speech, and the audience waited patiently while one of the Red Special crew carried
                    on until Debs could finish hoarsely. At many of the smaller stops, Debs' younger brother
                    Theodore, who resembled him a great deal, secretly substituted for the exhausted candidate. The
                    relief afforded by these and other measures restored much of Debs' strength and he was able

               </placeName>. Mayor Brand Whitlock,
                    close friend of many reformers of the day and a famous municipal reformer himself, was in the crowd
                    and seemed delighted to see Debs. He dropped five dollars into the collection hat as it passed him.
                    He marched with Debs later in a labor parade. Later that evening, 2,000 spectators heard Debs
                    lambast the masters of capital.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>

            <p>Increased interest of the farmer in Socialist politics had been noted and as the campaign developed
                    in the Midwest and Southwest, Debs tailored more and more of his speeches for farm audiences. The
                    Red Special combined the virtues of glamour, novelty, and practicality which appealed greatly to
                    isolated farm families. As the train pulled into a rural station or paused momentarily at a country
                    crossroads lined with buggies and wagons, red flags were put out, the band began to play a rousing
                    Socialist song, and members of the crew circulated in the crowd selling pictures, buttons, flags,
                    and literature.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> The whole idea, from the train itself to the glamour and
                    publicity that accompanied its progress, was "trump" and had been partly designed
                    to appeal to the spectacle loving, isolated farm families who might be inclined to support Debs. The
                    whole Socialist campaign of 1908 revealed a growing understanding of mass psychology and campaign
                    techniques.</p>
            <p>Socialist organizers in the South and Midwest had prepared a special program for the farmers, the
                    farm encampment. Tent villages were set up and farmers from the surrounding countryside were invited
                    to attend a combination Sunday school, picnic, revival meeting, and Socialist indoctrination course.
                    The farmers drove into the encampments in their buggies and wagons, each flying a red flag from the
                    whip holder, and participated in meetings that lasted for days and often weeks. Local merchants,
                    anticipating increased business, sometimes helped finance such encampments. When Oscar Ameringer,

                    Mr. Taft had no great admiration for the Socialist presidential candidate. Eugene Debs, he said, was

                    praise and champion Debs, to condone his faults, is precisely like praising and championing Tweed
                    and condoning Tweed's faults," he wrote a friend. He accused Debs'
                    followers of "mushy morality" and labeled Debs' speeches "mere

                    he was merely another vessel containing the acids of capitalistic society and a willing tool for the

            </p>
            <p>Debs especially disliked Roosevelt because he feared the President's political influence
                    with the "parlor socialists" and because he honestly believed that the President
                    was not progressive. He ridiculed Taft's progressive pretensions by reading his judicial
                    record and generally referred to him as "Injunction Bill Taft." In reality, Debs
                    had no sympathy with mere reformers, however sincere and well meant their efforts might be. Given
                    his belief that capitalism was the root of all evil, he could accept no program that improved the
                    system by reform. His sincere belief that there was a class struggle in America led him to demand
                    the abolition of the entire capitalistic system as the only way to change society for the better. He
                    opposed the conservative Socialists in their desire for public office and evolutionary change
                    because he felt that such a program did not move beyond reform and would merely, in the end, serve
                    the best interests of the capitalists.</p>
            <p>The campaign also brought sharp exchanges between Debs and President Samuel Gompers of the American
                    Federation of Labor. Debs had quarreled with Gompers before, but seldom with such intensity as in
                    1908. Long before the campaign began, he attacked Gompers for his cooperation with management.

                    file were paying for the train and for the whole Socialist campaign. Furthermore, he had made it

                    turned out to be the question of campaign contributions, not even the Socialists were spared having

                            and emotion, all of which, in Gampers' view, detracted from his success in the
                            labor movement. "When Debs began to discount his judgement in favor of his
                            emotions," Gompers wrote, "he ceased to play a constructive part in the

                    since the beginnings of their careers. Debs' old American Railway Union had been an
                    industrial union and he always favored that form of unionization. He insisted that organized labor
                    should support the Socialist party in local and national politics, since that party was the only one
                    which represented labor's needs and wishes. Debs had helped found the I.W.W. in part to
                    start a political union, but he had been disappointed in the Wobblies' lack of emphasis on
                    politics. That action had further alienated him from other labor leaders and had widened the breach
                    between him and the conservative Socialists, who feared that Wobbly violence would boomerang on the
                    whole party. Debs still insisted that labor would have to support political candidates pledged to
                    its cause in order to achieve real freedom.</p>
            <p>The progress of the Red Special could not be overlooked by the regular press and for the first time
                    the Socialists found themselves in the pages of some of the country's major newspapers. The
                    size of the crowds that greeted Debs and the vigor of the whole Socialist campaign aroused fears in
                    conservative circles that the Socialists would poll a vastly increased vote.<hi rend="sup">78</hi>
                    Ex-President Grover Cleveland, who died before the election, warned his countrymen that the
                    Socialists would poll a million votes.<hi rend="sup">79</hi> The regular press could not afford to
                    ignore the news value of the Debs campaign, and at the same time it could not afford to add to the
                    publicity attending the campaign. A nice compromise was struck in the back pages of many newspapers.
                    The Socialist press continued its impressive showing on behalf of Debs.<hi rend="sup">80</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Arguments with Roosevelt and Gompers took second place in Debs' mind to the necessity of

            <p>Debs made a special appeal for the Negro vote and couched his appeal in terms he thought the Negro
                    could understand. Neither he nor the Socialist party as a whole ever formulated a special program
                    for the alleviation of the Negro problem but tended rather to treat it in the broader framework of
                    worker versus master, poor versus rich. Debs' attitude was considerably more lenient than
                    that of many other Socialists, and he insisted that the Negro was entitled to the full products of
                    his labor; with economic equality, social equality would come.<hi rend="sup">82</hi> The Red Special
                    stopped at Harper's Ferry where Debs saw the monument to John Brown, one of his heroes. He
                    took the occasion to urge the Negro to vote for the Socialists. "The Socialist Party is
                    carrying on the work begun by John Brown," he said when asked for a statement.<hi rend="sup">83</hi>

                    had been imprisoned after the Pullman strike. His former jailer was among the five hundred
                    well-wishers who greeted him at the jailhouse steps. Debs spoke briefly and went through the jail. A

                    alive with red flags and choruses of approval. Despite intense fatigue, he drew on his last reserves
                    of energy and delivered a rousing speech, appealing one final time for the vote of organized labor.

                    <pb n="235" id="VAA4025-054-3-029"/> What had happened? Why had the Socialist total remained almost
                    stationary despite the vigorous national campaign? Debs' appeal to the masses of
                    sympathetic voters was obvious; great quantities of Socialist literature had flooded promising
                    areas; and hundreds of party members and workers had followed in Debs' wake, preaching,
                    teaching, exhorting the voters for Debs. Why had the vote increased so little?</p>
            <p>One of the basic Socialist miscalculations was reliance on the results of the election of 1904 as a
                    yardstick to Socialist strength in 1908. In the former year, many Democrats, faced with the
                    distasteful alternatives of Alton B. Parker and Theodore Roosevelt, had undoubtedly voted for Debs.
                    These voters had returned to Bryan in 1908.<hi rend="sup">93</hi> Thus Debs argued that every
                    Socialist vote in 1908 was a pure Socialist vote and the seemingly small total was in fact a
                    considerable gain in Socialist strength. Taft's ample figure had apparently fitted the
                    mantle of progressivism passed on to him by Roosevelt and the President's support had
                    helped him greatly throughout the campaign.<hi rend="sup">84</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An economic upswing had turned many voters to the Republicans, who used the prosperity issue
                        freely.<hi rend="sup">95</hi> The Socialists were never able to overcome the American
                    workers' fear of panaceas and experimentation in times of economic dislocation, and this
                    fear was never better illustrated than in 1908 when the Socialists should logically have benefited
                    more from unemployment and labor unrest. The fate of most American third parties has been to
                    stimulate the older parties rather than to succeed to national power themselves. Such was the case
                    with the Socialists in 1908.</p>
            <p>Bryan had captured the liberal Democratic vote; Taft had won the progressive Republican vote; Samuel
                    Gompers had been unable to turn the labor vote to Bryan but had made sure that as little of it as
                    possible went to Debs.<hi rend="sup">96</hi> In addition, many workers had lost their right to vote

                    </placeName>, he did not regret his tremendous effort. He looked back across the preceding months
                    with the conviction that the whole Socialist campaign had been a job well worth the effort and well
                    done. His primary aim throughout the campaign had been to agitate for socialism and he had succeeded
                    in this. There would be other campaigns and other speaking tours, countless opportunities in the
                    years ahead to preach the coming socialist revolution. His stand in favor of socialism and his faith
                    in the goodness of the common man remained unshaken and undiminished. At the moment he was to tired
                    to reflect on the deeper meanings of the election results. Before the votes were counted he said
                    that the campaign had "expressed the true spirit of socialist comradeship, which is the
                    making of our movement, and which will sustain it through every ordeal until it is finally
                        triumphant."<hi rend="sup">98</hi> There is no reason to believe that he changed his
                    mind after the votes were counted.</p>

                    unrewarding. Edward Stanwood in his <hi rend="i">History of the Presidency from 1897 to 1916</hi>,

                    election is desirable.</p>
            <p>The presidential election with which this paper is concerned occurred in the midst of an era of
                    domestic reform. Since 1901 the Republican party had been dominated by the liberal-minded Theodore
                    Roosevelt, whose rare popularity rested upon his reputation as war hero, trust-buster, friend of
                    conservation, battler for reform legislation, and advocate of a "Square Deal" for
                    labor. In 1908 Bryan, adoringly known as the "Great Commoner" in many segments of
                    American society, was once again the ringmaster of the Democratic party, having wrested control of
                    it from the conservatives. Bryan, champion of free silver in 1896 and of anti-imperialism in 1900,
                    prepared in 1908 to fight for a host of domestic reforms. On the state and local level the early
                    years of the century also witnessed reform-motivated activities of such leaders as Governor Charles
                    Evans Hughes of <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>. Among groups which helped to develop reform consciousness in the public mind during
                    the years before 1908 were the Populists of the 1890's, the forces of organized labor, the
                    Socialists, and the Muckrakers, those widely-read journalists who publicized certain sordid aspects
                    of the American scene. As might be expected, the campaign issues of the presidential election of
                    1908 mirrored various features of this era of reform.</p>
            <p>Before discussing the campaign issues reflected in the activities of the two major parties and their
                    candidates, one should note that third parties, attracting only 800,219 popular votes out of a total
                    of 14,885,989 and no electoral votes, played a distinctly minor role in the election of 1908.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> The Prohibition <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The Democratic platform, longer than its Republican counterpart, called for a law providing for
                    pre-election publicity of campaign contributions and lashed out at the G.O.P. National Convention
                    for its refusal to endorse a similar plank. The Democrats clearly favored an immediate downward
                    revision of the tariff, attacked private monopoly, and recommended national legislation which would
                    establish a license system for all corporations engaged in interstate commerce which controlled as
                    much as 25 per cent of the product they manufactured, The Panic of 1907 was cited as proof of
                    Republican incompetence to protect the public, and the Democrats pledged to support legislation
                    establishing a fund for the guaranty of bank deposits. Lastly, the party responded to the wishes of
                    organized labor by calling for trial by jury in cases of indirect contempt, opposing the issuance of
                    injunctions in any cases in which they would not issue if no industrial dispute were involved, and
                    endorsing legislation providing for a general employer's liability act and a separate
                    Department of Labor. Among the many lesser planks which did not achieve importance during the
                    campaign were those regarding the popular election of senators, the curbing of the powers of the
                    Speaker of the House of Representatives, more democracy in government, the income tax, patronage,
                    government spending, the rights of the states, civil service, pensions for veterans, overseas
                    possessions, conservation, and Asiatic immigration.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                    to the Republican doctrine of protection, stating that it made for increased wages and a richer
                    standard of living. The G.O.P. candidate qualified his views, however, by adding that he opposed
                    such tariff rates as exceeded the difference between the cost of production at home and abroad, that
                    certain schedules were not high enough and should therefore be raised.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

                    Democratic doctrine of tariff for revenue only, would adhere strictly to the principle of
                    protection. He added, however, that schedules which were too high would be lowered and those which
                    were too low would be raised.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> A few days later, while seeking votes in the

            </p>
            <p>On the side of the opposition, the Democratic campaign textbook asserted that Republican protective

               </placeName>, Bryan argued that Republican promises of tariff revision were
                    worthless, since the G.O.P. was too deeply obligated to protected corporate interests to pay off
                    such promises. The Nebraskan also explained that the Democrats favored a revenue tariff approached
                    gradually, since a protective tariff merely taxed all the people for the benefit of the few. A
                    revenue tariff would stimulate business and provide more jobs by reducing the cost of materials for
                    industry and by encouraging a two-way type of foreign trade.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>One notes with interest that even various pro-Taft periodicals were inclined to praise
                    Bryan's tariff views. A political commentator for <hi rend="i">Outlook</hi> magazine, for
                    example, conceded that the Democracy's standard-bearer had struck where the Republican
                    party was most vulnerable, and that he had dealt courageously with the protective principle.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>

            <p>While the subject of the tariff has permeated many American political battles, the issue concerning
                    guaranty of bank deposits represented a unique feature of the 1908 election. Indeed, this topic,
                    though usually overlooked by historians of the era, drew more attention and comment during the
                    campaign, especially from Democratic ranks, than did the tariff. Its prominence was, of course, in
                    part the result of the bank panic of the preceding winter. In the Middle West where the issue
                    carried its greatest political appeal, the plan was already in operation in <placeName>

            <p>According to the plan advocated by Bryan, a tax was to be imposed on national banks and upon such

                    </placeName>, the Democratic candidate insisted that it was logical to "make the depositor
                    secure" since national, state, county, and city governments required security for their
                    deposits, and that the idea was already working successfully in <placeName>

                    predicted that a guaranty fund would not invite reckless banking practices, but rather would promote

                    adopted resolutions which mercilessly branded the scheme as unsound in principle, impracticable,
                    revolutionary, subversive of sound economics, encouraging to bad banking, and conducive to

            <p>Because the election of 1908 occurred during an era of reform, the labor question constituted still
                    another major area for discussion and disagreement. According to Forum's political pundit,
                    Henry L. West, there was more speculation and uneasiness regarding the attitude of the laboring man
                    during the campaign than in any previous presidential contest.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> During their
                    stumping activities, both major candidates showered as much verbiage on labor as any other subject,
                    while President Roosevelt, Samuel Gompers, and the press also awarded it intensive consideration.</p>
            <p>Generally speaking, Bryan's remarks on labor were more reform-minded and inclusive than
                    those of his opponent. Addressing a major rally in <placeName>

                    </placeName> City, the Democratic nominee called for the establishment of a separate Department of
                    Labor with a cabinet officer at its head. He insisted that labor organizations be exempt from the
                    operation of the anti-trust laws for the reason that the difference between the labor organization
                    and the industrial combination was too great to be covered by one statute. Bryan urged that
                    "the law relating to injunctions should be so modified that an injunction shall not issue
                    in an industrial dispute except under conditions that would justify an injunction if there were no
                    industrial dispute." Lastly, he advocated trial by jury in cases of indirect contempt
                    because in such cases, the candidate maintained, the judge attempted to combine in himself the
                    deliberation of the lawmaker, the zeal of the prosecuting attorney, and the impartiality of the
                    judge. As if to add a <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Not infrequently during the campaign Bryan reached for the labor vote by attacking Taft's

            <p>Bryan's White House aspirations and views on labor were energetically supported by President
                    Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor. In the middle of July, the union leader visited

            </p>
            <p>In early October, Gompers issued a circular in which he charged that Taft and his party favored the
                    extension of a despotic government vested in the judiciary, while the Democracy and Bryan stood for
                    government by law vested in the people.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> On the occasion of an important

            <p>Even a cursory study of the campaign reveals that union labor was divided in its willingness to
                    follow Gompers' advocacy of the cause of the Democracy. Among those backing Gompers was
                    Thomas Healey, president of the International Brotherhood of Firemen, who maintained that
                    Gompers' work on behalf of the Democratic party was the logical outgrowth of decisions of

                    Bryan but explained the basis for his viewpoint. "Trade unionists," Kidd reasoned,
                    "think alike on craft questions, but they differ widely on political …
                    questions, and this difference is universally tolerated by labor bodies. … Therefore, any
                    attempt to corral the political expression of workingmen is destructive of the basic principles of
                    the trade union movement."<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Republican viewpoint on the labor question, while not diametrically opposed to that of the Bryan
                    camp, evinced greater satisfaction with the status quo. For one thing, Taft staunchly defended his
                    course toward labor while he had been a federal judge by contending that he had no apologies to make
                    for any of his decisions. He maintained that his rulings actually had furthered the development and
                    standing of unions and that, instead of being an enemy, he was one of labor's greatest
                        benefactors.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the corpulent candidate's stand on the subject of injunctions differed from that

                    helped to keep not only lawless elements of labor within the law, but lawless capitalists as well.

                    added that there were cases when no other device seemed satisfactory. Finally, the candidate
                    attacked the plank in the Democratic platform which called for a jury trial in cases of indirect
                    contempt by claiming that such a procedure would "so hamper the administration of justice

                    disputes. In the same address Taft jabbed at Gompers by saying that the workingmen of the nation had

            <p>It is a point of considerable significance that the campaign of 1908 had no single paramount issue in
                    the sense that free silver and imperialism overshadowed, respectively, the political battles of 1896
                    and 1900. The daily newspaper accounts of Bryan's speaking tours of 1908 reveal that he
                    usually mentioned several issues in a single address, and that if he emphasized a certain theme one
                    day he was apt to dwell upon a different one the following day. He discussed the tariff, the trusts,
                    labor questions, Roosevelt's active role in the campaign, the Roosevelt policies, Taft, the
                    popular election of senators, the income tax, the guaranty of bank deposits, and many other issues.
                    None, however, towered above all others. Correspondent Charles W. Thompson, who covered the campaign

            </p>
            <p>Both Bryan and Taft made a point of discussing each other's fitness for the presidency in
                    their campaign speeches. For example, the Democratic candidate claimed, while speaking in <placeName>

                    earlier and had secured the G.O.P. nomination only because of the President's powerful
                    support, not because of his record. By way of contrast, Bryan argued that he had secured his
                    nomination from the "rank and file of my party."<hi rend="sup">69</hi> Taft, on
                    the other hand, told his listeners at a <placeName>

                    he had been guilty of sponsoring unsound financial theories.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many influential periodicals at the time of the election of 1908 devoted considerable attention to
                    the relative qualifications of the two major candidates. Typical was an editorial in <hi rend="i">Outlook</hi> by the editor-in-chief of the magazine, Lyman Abbott, which held that Taft was by
                    temperament, equipment, and training better qualified for the presidency than Bryan.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> Articles or editorials of a comparable nature appeared in <hi rend="i">American Review

            <p>A fair number of articles appeared during the weeks before the election which expounded upon
                    Bryan's virtues, though they were fewer in number than those which praised Taft. John
                    Welliver, writing for <hi rend="i">Munsey's Magazine</hi>, reasoned that the Democratic
                    candidate had had a remarkable preparation for the presidency as the result of information and
                    experience gained during his travels throughout the nation.<hi rend="sup">75</hi> An article in <hi rend="i">Midwestern Magazine</hi> advocated Bryan's election because of his remarkable
                    personal integrity, high mindedness, immaculate ideals, modesty, magnificent appearance, oratorical
                    superiority, and sympathy for those who are oppressed and weak.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> The Reverend
                    Robert Bisbee wrote an article for Arena which recommended Bryan's election and
                    Taft's defeat because the Republican candidate was "utterly without the democratic
                    spirit." Bisbee claimed that Taft was imperialistic, "the tool of privileged
                    wealth," a "blundering administrator," lacking in independence, and
                    ignorant on the subject of tariff reform.<hi rend="sup">77</hi>

            <p>Lastly, a group of articles derogatory to Bryan appeared in various publications in which the

                    ridiculous panaceas. William Allen White, writing for Collier's, referred to
                    Bryan's "lack of intellectual strength" and concluded that his

            <p>Because many exploitive and predatory practices of big business had not yet been effectively curbed
                    in 1908, the trust question was another issue of considerable prominence. Bryan, again assuming a
                    more reform-minded position than his opponent, told a <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                    that Taft and the Republican party intended merely to regulate the trusts, not prevent them.
                    Moreover, he said that regulation under the "complacent Mr. Taft" would not be
                    effective, since "Mr. Roosevelt, with all his strenuosity, has not succeeded in imprisoning
                    a single trust magnate."<hi rend="sup">81</hi> While stumping in Indiana, the former
                    advocate of free silver emphasized that his party favored strict enforcement of the Sherman
                    Anti-Trust Act and the extermination of private monopoly. To accomplish the latter, Bryan called for
                    a law preventing duplication of directors among competing corporations, and the requiring of a
                    federal license of any corporation controlling 25 per cent or more of the product it produced as a
                    means of preventing the company from controlling more than 50 per cent of the market. In the same
                    address Bryan defined a trust as a "corporation which controls so large a proportion of the
                    total quantity of any article used in this country as to be able to regulate the price and terms of
                    sale." He concluded his remarks by assuring his listeners that, while his party did not
                    oppose all corporations, "the Democratic Party draws the line at private
                        mononoly."<hi rend="sup">82</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As one might expect, Bryan's trust policy evoked harsh criticism because it constituted a
                    challenge to the status quo. The editors of the Nation labeled Bryan's plan for trust
                    regulation as "plainly unworkable," claiming that it would be impossible to define
                    50 per cent of the total amount of any product.<hi rend="sup">83</hi> Political analyst Samuel E.

            <p>The only significant issue in addition to those already discussed had to do with publicity for
                    campaign contributions and expenditures. Though no national statute existed in 1908 which compelled
                    the national committees to make public the sources of their campaign funds, mounting public opinion
                    on the subject was too strong to be ignored by either party. As a result, the Democratic National
                    Convention adopted a plank for its platform which called for pre-election publicity of the sources
                    of campaign funds. Moreover, on July 14, the National Committee pledged itself, under a plan
                    suggested by Bryan, to publish before October 15 the names of all contributors of $100 or
                    more, to limit the size of individual contributions to $10,000, not to accept money from
                    corporations, and to publish a list of expenditures not later than one month after the election.<hi rend="sup">97</hi> Though the G.O.P. national assemblage in June rejected a publicity plank by a
                    vote of 880 to 94, Taft in his July acceptance speech defended himself on this issue by pointing out
                    that the selection of New Yorker George Sheldon as treasurer of the Republican National Committee
                    would put the records of that committee under the laws of his state and would require that a
                    statement of receipts and expenditures be filed twenty days after the election.<hi rend="sup">98</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During his stumping activities, Bryan proudly reminded his audiences that the Republican National
                    Convention had rejected a plank pledging publicity, whereas the Democratic platform had included
                    such a feature. He also emphasized that the Democratic National Committee had promised to publish a
                    list of its contributors before the election, rather than after, as the Republicans intended to do.
                    Quite logically, Bryan reasoned that publication of contributors before the election was significant
                    for the reason that such a list would reveal to the electorate the people to whom the party was
                        indebted.<hi rend="sup">99</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Articles in Bryan's <hi rend="i">Commoner</hi> also hammered away at the importance of
                    letting the voters know the identity of contributors before the ballots were cast. This highly

                    like Edward Harriman, Charles Depew, John Pierpont Morgan, and John D. Rockefeller. Yet Roosevelt
                    and Taft dared to maintain in 1908, the <hi rend="i">Commoner</hi> pointed out, that the people must
                    wait until after they cast their votes before being told by the Republican managers "of the

            <p>On October 15 Herman Ridder, treasurer of the Democratic National Committee, made public the list of
                    contributions that had been made to the Democratic national fund up to October 9. The largest
                    contributor was Carl Hughes of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a well-known corporation lawyer, who had given $5,000. Next on the list was
                    Bryan himself, who had contributed the profits of the <hi rend="i">Commoner</hi>, $4,046.
                    Ridder stated that subsequent subscriptions would be made public daily.<hi rend="sup">101</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In an address devoted largely to the publicity issue, Taft defended Roosevelt's contention
                    that campaign contributions should be publicized after, and not before, the election. The G.O.P.
                    hopeful argued that publication of contributions before the election would cause the motives of the
                    contributors to be "misconstrued … and misrepresented," and that
                    candidates would be "charged … as being completely under the control of those
                    who make the contributions." Taft concluded that a rigid law requiring the publication of
                    contributions and expenditures within ten days after the election was all that public policy
                        demanded.<hi rend="sup">102</hi>

            <p>The American press was inclined to praise the stands of both major parties and their candidates on

            <p>In addition to the foregoing topics of major status, the presidential campaign of 1908 included a
                    number of minor issues such as the Panic of 1907. The Republicans naturally discussed the subject
                    sparingly, while their opposition logically raised the issue frequently. Nevertheless, the matter
                    failed to achieve primary significance in the campaign. The main reason why the Panic of 1907 did
                    not assume a role of major proportions was that by the autumn of 1908 economic conditions were once
                    again close to normal. The panic had started suddenly in October of 1907, spreading westward from <placeName>

            <p>The Republican campaign textbook, trying to brush away the Panic of 1907, asserted that the
                    disturbance was merely financial, not industrial or commercial, in nature. The Roosevelt
                    administration was applauded for establishing the National Monetary Commission to study the needs of
                    the nation's monetary system.<hi rend="sup">110</hi> In his acceptance speech Taft
                    discussed the causes of the panic in passing and soothingly assured his listeners that

                    Their importance as an issue lay in the tendency of many American voters to support the candidate
                    more closely associated with them. Taft, as Secretary of War, had become identified with the
                    policies long before the 1908 campaign. When the Ohioan delivered speeches on Roosevelt's
                    behalf in the election of 1904, his remarks literally defended every controversial aspect of the
                    Roosevelt administration.11B Four years later, while in quest of the 1908 Republican presidential
                    nomination, he repeatedly offered unqualified endorsement of "The
                    Trust-buster's" policies. Speaking at the Sandusky Opera House in <placeName>

                    </placeName> during his 1908 campaign for the White House, Taft promised, if elected, to devote all
                    his ability to clinching the Roosevelt policies. Taft went on to insist that Bryan had no right to
                    label himself as their legitimate heir.<hi rend="sup">117</hi> Displaying a measure of political
                    sagacity, Taft wisely emphasized his belief in the course of the Roosevelt administration while
                    stumping the progressive-minded western states.<hi rend="sup">118</hi>

            <p>Attempting to score a few points in the game by disassociating the G.O.P. from the popular Roosevelt
                    policies, the Democrats in their 1908 campaign textbook chided the Republican National Convention
                    for having rejected certain reforms previously endorsed by the President. Mentioned in particular
                    were publicity for campaign funds, ascertaining the value of railroads, and income and inheritance
                        taxes.<hi rend="sup">119</hi> In late August, Bryan provided the rare spectacle of a
                    presidential aspirant offering tacit approval of the policies of the opposition. Seeking votes at

            <p>The above-mentioned Republican tactics of predicting disaster in the event of a Bryan victory were
                    closely paralleled by the rattling of various "skeletons" in the Democratic
                    candidate's closet. By way of illustration, the Republican textbook cited excerpts from
                    speeches of 1906 in which Bryan had called for government ownership of railroads.<hi rend="sup">128</hi> When during the 1908 campaign, Taft accused Bryan of favoring government ownership, the
                    Nebraskan shot back by pointing out that both the Republican candidate and Roosevelt had at one time
                    threatened the railroads with government ownership if they did not consent to effective regulation;
                    and that threat, reasoned Bryan, represented substantially the position he had taken. The Democratic
                    candidate also insisted that government ownership was not an issue in the 1908 election.<hi rend="sup">129</hi> In late September the Republicans attempted to exploit the
                    "skeleton" of free silver when vice-presidential nominee James Sherman asserted

                    Convention in 1896 had pledged itself to international bimetallism. Bryan justified his former

            </p>
            <p>Though the presidential battlefield of 1908 featured no single issue of giant proportions, the
                    debating of a number of topics during the campaign warrants the careful attention of students of
                    recent American political and economic history. On the time-tattered subject of the tariff, Bryan
                    strongly opposed protection by advocating a tariff for revenue only, maintaining that such a policy
                    would benefit the domestic economy and promote a two-way type of foreign trade. On the other hand,
                    though Taft vaguely talked about revision, he staunchly defended protection as being conducive to
                    economic prosperity. The Democratic standard-bearer thus assumed the more advanced, reform-minded
                    position, the one vindicated by time and present-day dedication of both major parties to a
                    low-tariff program.</p>
            <p>Regarding the bank guaranty issue, a topic frequently overlooked by historians of the era, Bryan
                    again assumed the more liberal position by recommending that a tax be levied against all national
                    banks and participating state banks for the establishment of an insurance fund for the guaranty of
                    bank deposits. The conservative Republican camp claimed that the plan would invite reckless banking
                    practices and promote financial panics. In view of the impressive success of the Federal Deposit
                    Insurance Corporation during the last twenty years, the Taft-Republican position stands discredited
                    and the popularization of the bank reform by the Bryan-Democratic side must properly be regarded as
                    a constructive contribution.</p>
            <p>On the widely-discussed and complicated issue of labor, Bryan once again proved to be reform-minded
                    and responsive to the wishes of labor by advocating a separate Department of Labor, the exemption of
                    labor organizations from prosecution under the anti-trust laws, a more limited use of the injunction
                    in labor disputes, and trial by jury in cases of indirect contempt. Taft, though he voiced approval

                    opposed the Bryan-backed labor reforms either openly or tacitly, In view of the congressional
                    enactment during the five to six years that followed the election of 1908 of most of the reforms
                    which Bryan helped to popularize (in 1908), the position of the Democratic camp on the labor
                    question was the more foresighted.</p>
            <p>Though Bryan's positions on the tariff, bank guaranty, and labor questions were not without
                    merit, Taft appeared in the eyes of most voters to be the more qualified candidate for the awesome
                    position of President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Not only did the Ohioan have the bulk of the press on his side and benefit from the
                    backing of the ever-popular Theodore Roosevelt, but his experiences and accomplishments as a judge,
                    Governor of the Philippine Islands, and Secretary of War appeared to most citizens to surpass any
                    recommendations his opponent could present. Compared to his foe, Bryan appeared to many elements of
                    the electorate as untried, shifty, inexperienced, and of limited intellectual capacity.</p>
            <p>The pattern of Bryan as the liberal and of Taft as the conservative, which emerged on the tariff,
                    bank guaranty, and labor issues, appeared again on the trust question. The more reform-minded
                    Democratic candidate called for legislation preventing duplication of directors among competing
                    corporations, a suggestion which a few years later became a feature of the Clayton Anti-Trust Act of
                    1914. Bryan also urged the enactment of a law requiring a federal license for any corporation
                    controlling 25 per cent or more of a product it produced as a means of preventing the company from
                    controlling more than 50 per cent of the market. This proposal never received more than fleeting
                    consideration during the years that followed. More inclined to defend the status quo, Taft opposed
                    Bryan's license scheme, favored no new trust legislation, and merely promised effective
                    application of existing law.</p>
            <p>While both sides and their candidates look presentable in the pages of history on the publicity
                    issue, the Democrats may claim whatever edge existed. The Bryan camp not only included a plank in
                    its platform which called for pre-election publicity of the sources of campaign funds, but actually
                    published the names of contributors before election day. <pb n="264" id="VAA4025-054-3-058"/> Though
                    the G.O.P. rejected a publicity plank at its convention, Taft voiced approval of post-election
                    publication of campaign contributions. Both national committees made public their contributions and
                    expenditures soon after the election.</p>
            <p>Lastly, with regard to minor issues of the campaign, both Taft and Bryan endorsed the Roosevelt
                    policies. The Republicans were on the defensive with reference to the Panic of 1907 and
                    Taft's record as a judge; the Democrats, however, found themselves with their backs to the
                    wall as the result of Bryan's former advocacy of free silver and government ownership of
                    railroads.</p>

            <p>Storing natural gas underground is not a twentieth century development. Certain geological formations
                    beneath the earth's surface have held natural gas for millions of years. However, it was
                    not until after the turn of the century that gas utility engineers, with the assistance of
                    geologists, began to utilize these subterranean formations, emptied of gas by past production, to
                    store part of the utility's gas supply. Natural gas not only was reintroduced into such
                    depleted and abandoned gas fields but geological investigations were undertaken to discover non-gas
                    bearing structures which would serve the same purpose.</p>
            <p>The gas industry's interest in underground storage developed slowly. The first underground
                    storage project in this country was placed into operation in 1916.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> It involved
                    the use of an exhausted gas well in the Zoar Field in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Although a few additional storage reservoirs were constructed in the following two
                    decades, it was not until the middle and late 1930's when utilities experienced an
                    unprecedented demand for natural gas as a heating fuel that industry-wide interest in underground
                    storage materialized. This interest has continued up to the present time with current indications
                    pointing to further emphasis on this method of storing natural gas. Between the years 1950 and 1955
                    the construction of storage facilities in the <placeName>

                    show expenditures of $32,000,000 and $34,000,000, respectively.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> As of 1956, gas utilities in twenty states, including Indiana, had 214 storage fields in

            <p>What is behind the gas industry's interest in underground storage reservoirs? These
                    reservoirs provide the most satisfactory solution to a major supply problem confronting gas
                    utilities today, that of furnishing uninterrupted service to their customers, especially space
                    heating customers, during the critical winter months of the year.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Space heating
                    requirements, i. e., heating single and multiple family dwellings, commercial establishments, and
                    institutional buildings, generally comprise the largest service classification of a gas utility. The
                    following general remarks on the supply situation in this industry and the wide fluctuations
                    experienced in meeting space heating requirements will explain the importance and desirability of
                    underground storage.</p>
            <p>While gas utilities in Indiana and other midwestern and eastern states were originally supplied with
                    natural gas from local fields, the majority of these fields proved to be productive only for a
                    relatively few years.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Thereafter, natural gas was obtained from the vast gas
                    deposits located in the southwest section of the country. By means of high pressure pipe lines, this
                    gas was transported interstate and sold to intrastate utilities for local distribution.</p>
            <p>When space heating requirements reach their peak on extremely cold winter days, the interstate
                    transmission pipe lines, already operating at maximum capacity, have no surplus gas available for
                    delivery. Therefore, a gas utility must carefully estimate the highest number of customers its
                    system can serve under such restrictive supply conditions. In other words, the number of space
                    heating customers (and other customers) a utility can satisfactorily serve is limited by the
                    capacity of its gas supply to meet any foreseeable peak demand on a given day (twenty-four hour
                    period). If a gas company can enlarge its supply potential beyond that needed to meet peak winter
                    demands, it is in a position to take on new customers and increase its revenues accordingly. The
                        <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi> Underground gas storage also enables a gas utility to increase the
                            number of customers it can serve, reduce the costs of purchasing gas, improve the operating
                            efficiency of its equipment and pipe lines, increase its revenues, and, in the interest of
                            conservation of natural resources, avoid the consumption of natural gas for inferior uses.
                            These economic and operational benefits are explained and illustrated in a recent article,

            <p>Throughout the warmer months of the year when the need for space heating gas is absent, the supply
                    situation is reversed. The interstate suppliers have the pipe line capacity to deliver substantial
                    volumes of gas, but the local utilities usually have no suitable markets for it. Under these
                    circumstances, however, it is possible for a gas utility to take some of this available gas and
                    store it for use during the winter heating season (November through March), thereby increasing the
                    system's capacity to meet peak space heating loads. In the beginning, the gas was stored in
                    large, above-ground gas holders.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Subsequently, exhausted and abandoned gas
                    fields located in or near the utility's service area were successfully employed as storage
                    facilities. Economic considerations of both storage methods, costs versus capacity, normally favor
                    the use of underground storage. These same considerations favor underground storage over the use of
                    liquefied petroleum air-gas plants (tanks of butane or propane) as a means of supplementing the
                    natural gas supply when exceptionally cold weather prevails.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the advantages of underground storage are not available to every gas utility. Many
                    utilities are not located near any abandoned gas fields or suitable geological formations.

                    Upon completion of the current projects, there will be a total of ten storage reservoirs in

                    which have not previously held natural gas. The locations of these storage fields are indicated by

            <p>In order to make the following remarks on underground storage developments in Indiana more
                    meaningful, a brief examination of the cross section diagram of an underground reservoir which
                    appears on page 270 is needed. This diagram illustrates the geological requirements of the most
                    common type of subterranean gas reservoir.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Notice that the several layers of
                    rock strata conform to the shape of a large dome. The layer or bed of rock which is to hold the
                    natural gas must be characterized by a satisfactory degree of porosity and permeability. The gas,
                    under pressure, is forced into and stored in the billions of minute pores and crevices of this
                    formation-underground storage does not involve the discovery and use of large caverns or underground
                    cavities. Of course, this rock layer has to be bracketed by impervious formations to prevent the gas
                    from escaping. The necessary gastight seal is completed by the back pressure which develops <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> Gas Transmission Corporation, an interstate pipe line supplier, has four of the ten
                    storage projects in Indiana. The interstate supplier's interest in utilizing underground
                    storage is not unlike that of the distributing gas utility. By increasing the system's
                    capacity to supply gas for peak day heating requirements, additional sales of gas to new or
                    established customers are possible. This corporation had the first operating storage reservoir in
                    the state of Indiana. The Oaktown Field, located three miles west of the town of Oaktown (fifteen
                    miles north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                    </placeName>, was first used for storage in 1944. It was developed by merely converting a
                    corporation-owned natural gas field, which was still producing small quantities of gas, into a
                    storage facility. This was a simplified and economical operation due to the absence of the three
                    major considerations associated with underground storage: the problems involved in constructing a
                    tightly sealed field to minimize or eliminate leakage; the high cost of laying a connecting pipe
                    line from the storage site to the existing gas mains; and the delays and difficulties experienced in
                    securing the storage rights for property overlying the gas reservoir. Since the Oaktown Field was
                    still in production when the conversion occurred, its ability to hold natural gas was conclusively
                    established. The usual search for possible openings or leaks in the formation was not necessary.
                    Furthermore, the pipe lines and equipment, already installed to take gas out oi the field, were
                    utilized to deliver and pump gas into the formation. The storage volume of this reservoir is rated
                    slightly over one billion cubic feet.</p>
            <p>The corporation's second project is known as the Alford Field and is situated two miles east
                    of the town of Alford (two miles east of Petersburg) in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike County</region>
                    </placeName>. Started in <pb n="272" id="VAA4025-054-3-066"/> 1948, it was completed in 1951. This
                    storage pool was constructed by using a depleted and abandoned gas and oil field. The problems
                    encountered in making this old natural gas field usable again are indicative of the general
                    construction situation. All the old unplugged or improperly plugged well holes in this field were
                    located and sealed to make the formation gastight. To do this, hundreds of acres of land had to be
                    carefully and thoroughly searched. For the most part, there were no written records of these
                    previously drilled wells to aid the investigators. Before the Alford Field was satisfactorily sealed
                    and made usable, eighty well holes had to be plugged. It took two years of exploration finally to
                    find one of these abandoned wells which was leaking gas. The storage capacity of this field is
                    reported to be four billion cubic feet.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    in the initial stages of construction. Here, the corporation plans to utilize a non-gas bearing
                    stratum as a reservoir.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Geological analysis of this formation indicates the
                    possibility of a water bearing rock structure with a good seal. Numerous test or core holes have
                    been drilled to determine the suitability of this formation for storage purposes. Understandably,
                    the risk involved in attempting to construct a reservoir from a non-gas bearing formation is
                    considerably greater than when working with an old gas field. In developing a non-gas bearing
                    formation there is no assurance that a particular geological structure has the ability to retain
                    natural gas. On the other hand, in constructing a storage facility from a formation which formerly
                    held gas it is known that at one time such formation was, and probably still is, capable of holding
                    gas. The storage process at the Leesville Field will begin when the introduction of gas, under high
                    pressure, displaces and holds back the water. The huge "gas bubble" which forms at
                    the point of injection constitutes the storage volume.</p>

                    wells have been drilled into the storage formation. This allows more gas to be pumped out of storage
                    on any given winter day. It also reduces the time required to recharge or refill the reservoir.
                    Increasing the number of wells to boost a storage field's daily deliverability is a common
                    practice.</p>
            <p>The value of underground storage to a gas utility is illustrated by the experience of the Southern
                    Indiana Gas and Electric Company. Following World War 11, this company, like most gas utilities,
                    could not supply the demand for space heating. Waiting lists for this gas service were compiled
                    regularly. Furthermore, to guard against the oversubscription of space heating customers by gas
                    utilities the state's regulatory agency, the Public Service Commission of Indiana, issued a
                    regulation on December 20, 1946, which is still in effect, prohibiting the addition of new space
                    heating customers without commission approval.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Capitalizing on the advantages

                    erase its backlog of space heating requests but has been able actively to solicit new heating
                    business. The other Indiana gas utilities with underground storage facilities also have been able to
                    narrow the gap between supply and demand for heating gas within their service areas. For example,
                    one Indiana gas company which plans to have its storage reservoir in service for the 1958-1959
                    heating season estimates that a minimum of 4,200 and a maximum of 9,500 new space heating customers
                    can be served, thus greatly reducing its present backlog of approximately 10,400 applications.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Generally speaking, however, gas utilities in Indiana are not in a position
                    to satisfy the demand for space heating gas. This is especially true of utilities in the heavily
                    populated northern portion of the state where as yet, unfortunately, storage strata have not been
                    successfully utilized.</p>
            <p>Since 1952 the Central Indiana Gas Company, which serves the <placeName>

                    been conducting investigations as to the possibility of storing gas underground. After considerable
                    experimentation and consultation with geologists, a site has been selected. The project is located

                    lies beneath the pipe line of its interstate supplier. The site's proximity to the existing
                    distribution and supply systems is an advantageous feature in that the cost of constructing
                    connecting gas lines from the supplier to the storage pool and then to the utility's
                    distribution system will be nominal. Because of the high costs of pipe line construction, a gas
                    utility must limit itself to explorations for underground storage within or near its general service

                    contained an unusually high number of old well holes, most of them unplugged or partially plugged.
                    Great care, therefore, had to be exercised in the search for possible sources of leakage from
                    unsealed holes. To assist the search, the utility collected all the available records showing the

            <p>As mentioned earlier, one of the major problems confronting a gas utility in developing an
                    underground storage field is the leasing of storage rights of property above the reservoir. To begin
                    with, the difficulty in accurately determining the boundaries of the storage stratum means that a
                    utility does not know exactly how much area it should cover in purchasing property rights for gas
                    storage. The importance of having secured leases for all property overlying the reservoir, however,
                    prompts a utility to adopt a cautious attitude and purchase leases on any property which could
                    conceivably be located above the storage formation. Without this protection, numerous wells could be
                    drilled into the reservoir from unleased property and large quantities of "free"
                    gas produced. Then, there are the usual problems encountered in negotiating with recalcitrant
                    property owners for the sale of storage rights. To avoid the delays and ill feelings associated with
                    condemnation proceedings, a utility generally will try to <list type="footnotes">

                    the Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company, is such that all requests for space heating gas <pb n="278" id="VAA4025-054-3-072"/> have been fulfilled on the system served by the storage
                    reservoir. The service territory of this system includes the cities of <placeName>

            <p>At the present time, the Indiana Gas and Water Company is working on a third storage site in and
                    around the town of Westpoint (ten miles southwest of <placeName>

            <p>As for the future plans of the above-mentioned gas utilities concerning underground storage, no
                    particulars are available for publication or public announcement. As a general policy such matters
                    are treated as confidential. However, it is safe to say that the utilities already named, as well as
                    the other Indiana gas companies, are interested in finding additional storage sites. Some are
                    currently engaged in preliminary investigations and explorations with this objective in mind.</p>
            <p>The greatest potential for underground storage development lies in the central and southern sections
                    of Indiana where the state's natural gas fields, now depleted, are located and where
                    geological formations of a non-gas bearing nature are most favorable for holding gas. It is here
                    that gas utilities, including interstate transmission corporations, are centering their attention.

            </p>
            <p>With both interstate and intrastate gas utilities seeking appropriate storage sites in the state,
                    further underground storage developments are a certainty. Indiana residents and businesses are thus
                    assured a greater natural gas supply to meet the ever-increasing demand for this premium heating

            <p>Although various gas wells had been drilled in Indiana before 1886, it was in that year that the
                    natural gas boom got under way. Natural gas fields, however, had earlier been discovered and used in

               </placeName>, in 1884
                    apparently touched off the Indiana boom. On March 14, 1886 a successful well was opened near <placeName>

            <p>It seems fitting in this centennial year of the Western Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends that
                    some account be given of one of its earliest monthly meetings. The oldest monthly meeting within the
                    boundaries of Western Yearly Meeting is Lick Creek in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange County</region>
                    </placeName>, established in 1813; the second is <geogName>Blue River</geogName> in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington County</region>
                    </placeName>, established in 1815. The third oldest monthly meeting was Honey Creek in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vigo County</region>
                    </placeName>, which was set off from Lick Creek Monthly Meeting and established September 9, 1820.
                    At this time Honey Creek included all Friends that lived in central and western Indiana; as other
                    monthly meetings were set up, the boundaries of Honey Creek were narrowed to western Indiana and
                    eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. On February 14, 1829, the meeting was laid down and the membership attached to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> Monthly Meeting. The reason for its discontinuance is not known; it has been stated
                    that it was due to the Hicksite controversy, but there is no evidence of this in the minutes.</p>
            <p>At the time of the opening of the meeting in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vigo County</region>
                    </placeName>, two settlements are mentioned: "Honey Creek on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

            <p>The exact location of the Honey Creek Meetinghouse is not known to this writer. Evan Hadley writes of
                    it as being "on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>." It was not until April, 1822, that trustees were appointed to hold title to
                    the property. They were William Durham and Moses Hoggatt. Schools were conducted by the Honey Creek
                    and Turmins Creek meetings as early as 1824.</p>
            <p>The following records were compiled from a photostat of the Men's Minutes of the Honey Creek
                    Monthly Meeting, September 9, 1820 to May 14, 1825, in the Genealogy Division, Indiana State
                    Library; from the Women's Minutes, October 8, 1825 to February 14, 1829; and from loose
                    pages containing marriage records and removals located at the meetinghouse of the Western Yearly

               </placeName>, the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>, and the Great Lakes
                    region during the late colonial period, Volume XII of the papers of Sir William Johnson, British
                    superintendent of Indian Affairs, 1755-1774, is a rare gift. The many-score documents contained in
                    this volume are superbly reproduced, briefly but well annotated, and helpfully cross-referenced. The
                    documents themselves supplement the ones published for the years 1766-1774 in volumes V-VIII of the
                    first chronological series of the <hi rend="i">Sir William Johnson Papers.</hi> The material for the
                    latest volume was drawn chiefly from collections in the Canadian Archives, the William L. Clements
                    Library, the <placeName>

                        </placeName> State Historical Library;</hi> the reason for reprinting these in the present
                    definitive collection is obvious.</p>
            <p>Because the nearly three hundred new items which were found subsequent to the publication of volumes
                    V-VIII could not all be included between the covers of one manageable volume, the longer documents
                    (journals, accounts, and land papers) written within the period 1766-1774 have been reserved for
                    future publication in an additional volume. This addenda volume will also contain a chronological
                    list of all published documents indicating their locations in the series. The final volume, to
                    conclude the series, will be an index volume (p. viii).</p>
            <p>Over half the present Volume XII is devoted to letters to and from Sir William Johnson and to short
                    journals, accounts, and other documents relating to Indian Affairs from 1766 to the Treaty of Fort
                    Stanwix of 1768. The remainder of the volume contains materials relating to Indian affairs and land
                    development from 1769 to 1774. The volume begins with General Thomas Gage's instructions of
                    January 10, 1766 to Major Robert Rogers, Commandant of the Post at Michilimackinac, and ends with a
                    letter written by Guy Johnson, Sir William's son-in-law, to Gage on July 12, 1774 from
                    Johnson Hall. This letter informed Gage of Sir William Johnson's sudden death the evening
                    before during a "Critical Congress" then in progress at Johnson Hall with the Six
                    Nations Indians (pp. 1121-1124). Sir William's will, which was written six months prior to
                    his death, is also included in Volume XII (pp. 1062-1076), but publication of the inventory of
                    Johnson Hall, and other post-July 12, 1774 items dealing with Johnson's large estate and
                    his policies has been deferred for inclusion in the addenda volume (p. viii).</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Papers of Sir William Johnson</hi> will be, upon completion, one of the most
                    important documentary series for late colonial history. For <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-054-3-088"/>

                    </placeName> the series is invaluable, containing primary documents relating to Indians from the

                    reviewer has been using the series almost daily, in connection with a particular ethnohistorical
                    research project. As soon as Volume XII appeared, it was put to immediate use and has been in use
                    ever since. To Dr. Milton W. Hamilton, senior historian of the University of the State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, this reviewer feels, as many others will doubtless feel, deeply grateful for the fine
                    reproduction and fine footnoting of the rich contents of Volume XII. The promise of more wealth to
                    come in the addenda volume leads one to hope for an early appearance of this latter volume.</p>

                    experience working in a store, young Johnston departed for the West where he became a wagoner in the
                    Indian campaign of Anthony Wayne. After a not too successful venture into business in <placeName>

                    exemplary fashion, but, during the War of 1812, for example, he was instrumental in keeping trouble
                    to a minimum and in enlisting support from his charges for the American cause. Although removed from
                    office with the accession of Andrew Jackson to the presidency, Johnston's influence with

                    William Henry Harrison and it is probable, but for the President's untimely death, that
                    Johnston's star would have risen rapidly.</p>

                    activities are discussed; again, "Removal of Senecas, Shawnees, and Ottawas" seems
                    to be included only because these groups stopped to visit their old friend while en route to the
                    West.</p>
            <p>This book is primarily one of extensive and lengthy quotations from source materials, principally
                    from the National Archives. Hill's frequent use of quotation is unfortunate because it
                    destroys continuity, includes much material that is not relevant, and makes for difficult reading.
                    To be sure, the author has tapped a mine of source material, but unhappily it is impossible for
                    anyone else to benefit from the considerable amount of time and effort he has put forth to compile
                    the volume. Such assertions as "it has been stated" (p. 21) or "it has
                    been stated on good authority" (p. 46) are of no help. Nor are footnote references such as
                    "National Archives" or "State Historical Society of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>" of any value to one interested in further use of the author's
                    sources. And the practice of lumping as many as twenty-five footnotes into one might save
                    printer's cost, but it leads to the reader's confusion.</p>
            <p>Without source material, research is not possible, but a judicious use of the sources would have
                    saved the author from erroneous statements, inconsistencies, and misleading conclusions. A few
                    examples will suffice to illustrate this point. He gives credibility to Little Turtle's
                    statement at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName> Ville that the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> "kindled the first fire at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>" (p. 1). Probably neither is it true that the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> were first to establish a village at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, nor that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the first <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> village. Hill accepts a newspaper statement (p. 8) that Bluejacket was leader of the
                    Indians in St. Clair's defeat of 1791 and then asserts Little Turtle's leadership
                    on a later page (p. 14). The author subscribes to Johnston's statement that the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> were the original inhabitants of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and to his inference that all other tribes came into the <placeName>

                    </placeName> country with <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> permission (p. 1). The author suggests that since the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> name is propagated in the names of three western <geogName>Ohio rivers</geogName>,
                    Johnston's statements are true—a conclusion which does not follow. In fact,
                    historical evidence will not support either Johnston or the author.</p>
            <p>Part II of this book contains the "Recollections of Sixty Years," an
                    autobiographical statement which Johnston prepared for a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspaper. The author here reproduces an edited version of another edited version of
                    the original account which appeared in the newspaper and, therefore, renders no real service to the
                    reader. "Recollections" does, however, contain information that might well have
                    been used to good advantage in the first part of the book.</p>
            <p>The real value of Hill's volume is that it calls attention to the need for a full scale
                    biography of John Johnston, a secondary figure of considerable importance on the Indian-white
                    frontier of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, until he enlisted as surgeon's mate in 1792 and joined General Anthony

                        <settlement type="city">Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s victory over the Indians at Fallen Timbers, August 20, 1794, he was assigned
                    to Fort Defiance. This outpost, overlooking the confluence of the <geogName>Maumee</geogName> and
                        <geogName>Auglaize rivers</geogName>, was the strongest of those constructed by General Wayne as
                    he moved northward against the enemy. And here at the American army's crossroads fort,
                    Andrews sensed the general uneasiness which was still manifest until the Indians returned loaded
                    with trinkets from the peacemaking at Greeneville in 1795.</p>
            <p>As surgeon's mate, Andrews faithfully looked after the health of the garrison; just as
                    faithfully, he recorded everything which impressed him. He made trips up the Maumee to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> for supplies, handled a large correspondence, and even planted a garden. He preferred
                    to dine alone in his quarters and was not slow in expressing his pleasure at this rare occurrence.
                    Andrews usually ate at general mess, however, and there he frequently met Indian chiefs and traders.
                    His journal is full of comments on their manners and character. But it was not until November 3,
                    1795, that the first American merchant reached Fort Defiance, He was Abijah Hunt from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of each month Andrews added a report on the "State of the Garrison of Fort
                    Defiance." He tabulated all sick and well, noting what disorders were present. Dysentery
                    from improperly cured beef was prevalent in the winter; late summer and early fall brought malaria.
                    On October 1, 1795, the sick list was almost twice that of the well, approximately two-thirds of the
                    garrison. Although he had no thermometer, which he duly lamented, Andrews made meteore logical
                    observations. He recorded the kind of weather (rain, snow, cloudy, fair) and the direction of the
                    wind for each day of each month. And as one reads his observations and compares them with
                    today's average weather in the area, he notes that there is not much difference.</p>
            <p>Packed with the action of daily life at Fort Defiance, Andrews' vivid account is superior to
                    those of his contemporaries, The clear and concise English in which it is written testifies to his
                    educational background. Just twenty-seven when he wrote the journal, Andrews gives evidence of the
                    wisdom and stability of his <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> ancestors. Indispensable to the scholar, this small volume is a delight to historian
                    and layman alike.</p>
            <p>Richard C. Knopf, historian of the Anthony Wayne Parkway Board, has provided commendable editing and
                    an excellent introduction. The notes are ample and accurate. The index is generally adequate;
                    however, a few important names are missing, notably that of Little Turtle. The Andrews Journal was

               <hi rend="i">The War of 1812 in the Old Northwest.</hi> By Alec R. Gilpin. (East Lansing: <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> State University Press, 1958. Pp. vii, 286. Illustrations, bibliography, index.
                    $6.50.)</head>
            <p>The title of Professor Gilpin's book is both fitting and apt, for it is a historical
                    monograph covering every battle, land and lake, that was fought in the Old Northwest during the War
                    of 1812. Little or nothing is said about the war's causes or effects. The bulk of the book
                    is taken up with military matters. This is its purpose; and as such, it is an extremely complete and
                    meticulously detailed history. Not a skirmish is omitted; even the abortive battles are considered.
                    Here, then, is an encyclopedic account of the war in the Great Lakes region that will undoubtedly be
                    of value to the scholar interested in the period.</p>
            <p>Professor Gilpin's treatment of the war is, however, somewhat partisan. He regards General
                    Hull's absurd proclamation to the inhabitants of Upper Canada, heralding their emancipation
                    from British tyranny and urging their cooperation with his army, as effective propaganda. On the
                    other hand, General Brock's reply, counseling the Canadians to remain true to the Crown, is
                    evaluated as crude. Hull's defeat by Brock is, in large measure, blamed upon logistics. But
                    why then should Brock, almost as remote as Hull from his base of supplies, have succeeded? The
                    author criticizes Proctor, Brock's successor in the Northwest, for failing to prevent his
                    Indians from murdering captive Americans after the Battle of River Raisin. But were American troops
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName>'s command under control when they mutilated the bodies of the Indian dead
                    after the Battle of the Thames? War is a bloody business and Indian warfare particularly so. These
                    are the morbid facts of frontier life.</p>
            <p>The author has leaned far more heavily upon American sources than upon Canadian, both primary and
                    secondary; and the results are, at times, unfortunate. The relationship and the contribution of the
                    Canadian fur traders—and American, too—to the war effort were never made
                    clear. To the men of the North West Company, this was a war to regain "Canada
                    irredenta," the domain lost to them in the Treaty of 1783; and the Nor'Westers did
                    much to account for Canadian military successes in the Northwest. Indeed, to them, the Treaty of
                    Ghent seemed a second betrayal of their (and Canadian) interests, for so much of the Old Northwest
                    that had been won by the force of their arms was handed back to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> at the peace table. A greater balance would have been achieved in Gilpin's
                    work by reference to certain standard works on Canada and the fur trade.</p>
            <p>One can also quarrel with certain statements of fact and conclusions made by the author. For example,
                    no evidence is presented to substantiate the claim (p. 24) that the Canadians, in the immediate
                    pre-war years, "actively enlisted the aid of the Indians to defend their country."
                    There is no historical basis for the categorical assertion (p. 88) that "French control [of
                    Canada] … would have been welcomed by most French Canadians." And while Canada
                    might be strategically likened to a tree, its tap roots were (p. 45) not in Halifax— save
                    for the Maritime Provinces—but in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Montreal</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and Generals <pb n="298" id="VAA4025-054-3-092"/> Hull and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName> were still engaged in lopping off branches in the Northwest without ever deadening the
                    Canadian tree.</p>
            <p>General Hull is ever so gently handled. He emerges as a victim of circumstances largely beyond his
                    control, a man (p. 124) who "surrendered [<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>] for the sake of humanity, but lost his good name because … the
                    Administration … required a scapegoat to bear its responsibility for the disastrous blow
                    to American arms and pride." Hull may not have been a physical coward, but he was a
                    miserable general, irritatingly indecisive, vacillating, and apparently devoid of military skills.
                    The reviewer heartily sympathizes with Lewis Cass and his fellow officers for plotting to remove
                    Hull from his command. For here was a man who was not fit to command, whose action and inaction bred
                    demoralization and mutiny among his troops. Moreover, to advance in Hull's behalf the
                    testimony of General James Wilkinson, who has been called an "unprincipled idiot"
                    and worse, does not lend meaningful support to the author's thesis. If all American
                    generals surrendered because of what might happen, there would be few battles won. Hull remains,
                    therefore, a victim both of circumstances and of himself.</p>

            <p>Professor emeritus at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, Arthur M. Schlesinger has brought to this study a highly qualified
                    background in an attempt to ascertain the role of newspapers in undermining American loyalty to
                    Great Britain and creating a demand for independence. Schlesinger has from time to time published
                    articles on this subject. The present work assimilates these and his later research. The author
                    portrays the dominant causes of the Revolution along lines originally stated in his well-known <hi rend="i">The Colonial Merchants and the American Revolution (1918) and New Viewpoints in
                        American History</hi> (1922). Although particular social and economic grievances often motivated
                    the Revolutionary patriots, until almost the outbreak of the Revolution they sought merely to
                    restore the relationship with the mother country that existed before Great Britain instituted the
                    new imperial policy after 1763. Their object was not to disrupt the Empire, Schlesinger concludes,
                    but only to insure what would today be called dominion status. One might ask, however, if this, in
                    effect, is not independence, as well as whether the colonies actually had enjoyed dominion status
                    before 1763.</p>
            <p>Following a brief review of colonial journalism prior to the Revolutionary crisis, the bulk of the
                    work details the part played in the propaganda campaign against <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The author's evidence fully justifies his conclusion that the press was a key
                    agency in the patriot cause. Moreover, aside from its political consequences, the newspaper
                    offensive made a permanent impression on American journalism by establishing its function in forming
                    public opinion and by insisting on the right of freedom of the press. One might ask here, as
                    Schlesinger <pb n="299" id="VAA4025-054-3-093"/> has not, whether the colonial press adopted the
                    responsibility concomitant with this freedom—the responsibility to report the truth as
                    best ascertained. Is it not relevant that the patriot newsmen deliberately misrepresented the
                    measures and intentions of the home government? Professor Schlesinger admits (p. 34) that the stigma
                    of "tyranny," "oppression," and "slavery"
                    applied to British policy had little or no objective reality, at least prior to the Intolerable Acts
                    of 1774. Perhaps a more balanced view of these last measures might even eliminate his qualification,
                    but can it be said that the colonial press functioned responsibly? By the author's
                    pragmatic test they were justified in misrepresenting British intentions, for their actions aided
                    the goal of independence, which was the greatest contribution of the Revolutionary generation.</p>
            <p>Ranking second only to independence, Schlesinger concludes, was the legacy of freedom of the press.
                    In their task of forming public opinion, the newsmen were inescapably involved in the issue of
                    freedom of the press, since as long as Crown officials exercised effective control, the Whig
                    journalists extolled the virtues of unfettered discussion—often unbridled
                    license—which brought them squarely into conflict with the English common law doctrine of
                    seditious libel. Once the patriots gained the upper hand, they inconsistently denied their loyalist
                    opponents liberty, charging them with license in attacking popular governments. The Whig concept of
                    license was diametrically opposed to that of the Tories, Schlesinger points out, for it meant not
                    defiance of royal but popular authority. It may be noted, however, that the justification for free
                    use of the press was not merely an American one for it was the great English Lord Chancellor,
                    Hardwicke, who said in 1739 of the pressmen of the Glorious Revolution that when they wrote in
                    defense of liberty "they were warrented by the law for what they wrote, and they had the
                    sense of the nation on their side" (House of Lords, February 12, 1739: <hi rend="i">Parliamentary History</hi>, X, 1331-32). Were both peoples really so far apart? The American
                    Bill of Rights and FOX'S Libel Law of 1792 both struck at the old repressive common law
                    doctrine. Perhaps it would not be inappropriate to add to Professor Schlesinger's
                    conclusion that the concept of freedom of the press, as it emerged by the end of the eighteenth
                    century, was rooted in both the American and English revolutions.</p>

            <p>In an era of British history most frequently characterized by the bellicose Palmerston, the
                    diplomatic achievements of the gentle Earl of Aberdeen have been somewhat obscured. His moderate and
                    pacific policies were territorially profitable to America, and we, while recognizing that
                    Europe's tribulations have often been the source of our triumphs, have not been prone to
                    admit that occasionally our glory must <pb n="300" id="VAA4025-054-3-094"/> be shared. As Wilbur D.
                    Jones has analyzed Aberdeen's policy between 1841 and 1846, American success in settlement
                    of the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>, <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> questions must redound to the credit of that British Foreign Secretary who patiently
                    worked to maintain the peace of the English-speaking peoples.</p>
            <p>The historian who can provide the American background for himself will find in these pages welcome
                    relief from the raucous cries of the expansionists of the 1840's. Unfortunately, save for a
                    short Foreword by Lady Pentland, and a brief concluding estimate, Aberdeen appears only as the
                    author of numerous soothing and diplomatically circuitous notes. Professor Jones' chief
                    concern seems to be the full documentation of his earlier controversy with Frederick Merk over the
                    proper evaluation of Aberdeen's motivation. Merk argued that British Opposition politics
                    significantly affected the settlement of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> dispute. Jones builds a persuasive case for Aberdeen's independence, but he
                    avoids Merk's evidence except to reject it as a slur upon Lord Aberdeen. That is not quite
                    convincing, and few would think less of Aberdeen if he were shown to be sensitive to bipartisan
                    pressures in a delicate diplomatic situation. Both the diplomatic history of the period and the
                    biography of Lord Aberdeen need further development. Judging from the real merits of this volume,
                    what Professor Jones may say upon either subject in the future will deserve weighty consideration.</p>

                    </placeName>," and with the author been conscious that they have defied a century of time?
                    Fairfax Downey has back of his writing the enthusiasm, or perhaps it might be called inspiration, of
                    the true <placeName>

                    </placeName> fan.</p>
            <p>Downey is an artillerist, and consequently tends to overstress the importance of that arm and to
                    exaggerate somewhat its destructive power. He develops the battle by describing the employment of
                    artillery, day by day, and ends with a brief critique. He does it well, and for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> addict who has always felt the need of a better picture of the artillery battle, <hi rend="i">The Guns at <placeName>

                        </placeName>
               </hi> is the answer to a prayer and a guide to the field.</p>
            <p>As might be expected, Downey is a little at a loss in explaining the employment of masses of infantry
                    which furnished the development pattern of the battle. For instance, Hood's Division of the
                    First Corps opened the second day's battle, attacking by brigades in echelon. Then
                    McLaw's Division took up the movement, and Barksdale's Brigade which cracked the
                    salient at the Peach Orchard was the last unit committed. However, Downey jumps in right here and
                    introduces an account of the artillery masterpiece that eased the Union line back to its original
                    position. He is probably inaccurate on the commitment of <pb n="301" id="VAA4025-054-3-095"/> the
                    Fifth Corps to the defense of Sickles' ill-formed salient. Moreover, he is unaware of the
                    presence of Vincent's Brigade in the defense of Little Round Top and not clear on the
                    situation into which General Warren directed "Paddy" O'Rorke at the head
                    of the Hundred and Fortieth of <placeName>

                    the battle leaves a little to be desired.</p>
            <p>This book is full of personal incidents and first-hand description. It is filled with technical
                    information on the operation and employment of artillery. The author has no quarrel with the
                    traditional—no yen for new theories or appraisements. <placeName>

            <p>Leonard D. White's <hi rend="i">The Republican Era</hi> concludes a series of studies in
                    administrative history which began with <hi rend="i">The Federalists</hi> (1948), followed by <hi rend="i">The Jeffersonians</hi> (1951) and <hi rend="i">The Jacksonians</hi> (1954). The series
                    was not intended to be a comprehensive history of public administration in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. It was, rather, the intention of the author to describe the theory and practice of
                    administration in the national government under four distinctive and formative phases of its
                    political history. As with the volumes which precede it, <hi rend="i">The Republican Era</hi> is
                    concerned with the national level of government, state and local administration receiving only
                    passing attention.</p>
            <p>The years 1869-1901 were not, in the main, years of progress or perfection in the art of public
                    administration. Accomplishments such as the Pendleton Civil Service Law of 1883 were primarily a
                    means of return to the higher standards of public service prevailing during the early years of the
                    Republic. In this and other measures, foundations were laid (often inadvertently) for far-reaching
                    developments to follow. But neither Republicans nor Democrats in this era favored positive public
                    administration in the sense later to be dramatized by Woodrow Wilson and the Roosevelts. The
                    Republicans were as "Jacksonian" in their political principles as the Democrats,
                    but with the important omission of Andrew Jackson.</p>
            <p>Both major parties were factionalized throughout the Republican era. But the most consistent and
                    characteristic leadership among the Republicans was found in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate. Initiative in the chief executive was not a quality sought by these Republican
                    leaders. They expected that Republican presidents would serve primarily as executors of their
                    policies and wishes. They became "righteously" indignant when presidents Hayes and
                    Roosevelt demurred and advanced policies of their own which were prejudicial to personal interests
                    of prominent Republican senators. <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-054-3-096"/>
                    <hi rend="i">The Republican Era</hi> affords a good background for anyone interested in
                    understanding the inner contradiction of Republican party politics in our own times. It should be of
                    particular interest to students of politics and history in Indiana. For it appears to be in Indiana
                    that the political viewpoints of the Republican era have enjoyed the most complete and prolonged
                    survival.</p>
            <p>It should of course be apparent that there has never been any uniform or consistent Republican
                    philosophy of public administration comparable to the Hamiltonian or Jeffersonian theories of
                    government. The negativism of the Republican era toward effective government was, however, equally
                    shared by Republicans and Democrats, although there were also men associated with both parties who
                    sought greater effectiveness and responsibility in the public service than public opinion was
                    prepared to support. <hi rend="i">The Republican Era</hi> is a powerful antidote to latter day
                    notions of an inherent American superiority in matters governmental. If this nation had a genius for
                    government it was hardly evident in the years between 1869 and 1901.</p>

            <p>This volume of biographical essays, dedicated to Ellis Merton Coulter by some of his former students
                    at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="gau">Georgia</region>
                    </placeName>, presents a scholarly view of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="gau">Georgia</region>
                    </placeName>'s history from 1733 to 1920. While most of the fourteen essays deal with
                    political leaders, there are also included studies of a poet, a historian, a railroad builder, and a
                    woman journalist. Each, in his time, was closely associated with the affairs of the Cracker state.
                    Perhaps the absence of such notable figures as William H. Crawford, Robert Toombs, and Alexander H.
                    Stephens should not be questioned since their careers were devoted largely to the national scene.</p>
            <p>The essays begin with John Percival, Earl of Egmont, and end with Hoke Smith who was secretary of the
                    interior during Grover Cleveland's second administration, governor of the state, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator. Although Percival never came to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, he was second in importance only to James Oglethorpe in founding the colony. These
                    essays present a fair sampling of the people who shaped <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="gau">Georgia</region>
                    </placeName>'s colonial history, her Indian policies in the early years of the nineteenth
                    century, her role in the Old South, her part in the building of the New South, her relations with
                    Populism and Progrqsivism, and finally her role in the struggle over Woodrow Wilson's
                    League of Nations. It appears to this reviewer, however, that the study would have been strengthened
                    by the inclusion of Joseph E. Brown, the state's controversial governor during the Civil
                    War, and by the addition of the elder Eugene Talmadge to help bridge the gap between 1920 and the
                    present.</p>
            <p>The profession will welcome this volume's fresh and comprehensive approach to certain phases
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="gau">Georgia</region>
                    </placeName>'s history. This is especially true <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-054-3-097"/> of the
                    four essays which deal with aspects of the colony's affairs, particularly the judicial
                    side. Although there is some repetition, other studies present a full account of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="gau">Georgia</region>
                    </placeName>'s handling of the Creek and Cherokee Indian problem. New light is thrown upon
                    John McPherson Berrien and his association with Andrew Jackson. Evidence is presented that
                    Berrien's appointment as attorney general by Old Hickory was not influenced solely by John

                    regrettable that the footnotes are at the back of the volume, the arrangement is much better than is

            <p>Accurate maps are taken for granted by the mid-twentieth century American, who can satisfy most of
                    his cartographic requirements at the nearest filling station, although he may be slightly surprised
                    by the news that mountain ranges rivalling the Alps or Andes have just been discovered in
                    Antarctica, or by the realization that there is still considerable doubt as to the precise location
                    of much of the White Continent's coastline.</p>
            <p>But we must constantly remind ourselves that our own continent was as little known as Antarctica only
                    three centuries ago, and that any understanding of past policies and decisions must be based on
                    clear comprehension of the existing state of geographic information—or misinformation. In
                    tracing the historical cartography of the pre-Revolutionary Carolinas and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="gau">Georgia</region>
                    </placeName>, Professor Cummings indicates the significance of ignorance and of changing geographic
                    knowledge in the diplomatic and political evolution of a newly discovered and developing region. Nor
                    does he slight the importance of early maps for the historian concerned with exploration,
                    territorial conflicts, or the expansion of settlement and trade.</p>
            <pb n="304" id="VAA4025-054-3-098"/>
            <p>Professor Cummings clearly understands the cartographic process: how knowledge gained by explorers is
                    translated into maps; the problems of the cartographer in Europe, confronted with conflicting
                    information trickling back from the New World, who sometimes elected to use erroneous data; the
                    inescapable fact that map makers have always borrowed from each other—as they still
                    do—and often without acknowledgement; and the manner in which geographic fallacies are
                    perpetuated by indiscriminate copying. Much sound detective work was required to prepare the
                    fascinating appendix listing the "genealogies" of some of the more important
                    "mother maps."</p>
            <p>The great mass of information contained in this volume makes it an interesting reference work,
                    although its three major components are not so well integrated as one might wish. A lively
                    introductory essay sketching the history of early maps and map makers is poorly keyed to the
                    remainder of the work. The well reproduced atlas section contains 67 plates of maps which were
                    apparently selected on the basis of their rarity, since some of the more important maps are merely
                    cited in an exhaustive list of some 450 items. And one cannot carp at a listing of maps in
                    chronological order, even when it places large-scale fortification or town plans cheek-by-jowl with
                    small-scale regional maps, but a thoughtful system of cross-indexing would have been of inestimable
                    value to many users.</p>

                    </placeName> career of Henry H. Crapo, who was a major producer of lumber in the <geogName>Saginaw
                        valley</geogName>, vividly describes a segment of that industry in the state.</p>
            <p>Students of business history' will find this detailed account of Crapo's lumbering
                    activity a source of valuable information. Crapo entered the business with the purchase of the
                    Driggs tract. Woefully lacking in knowledge of the industry, he expected to make it profitable in
                    his spare time but soon realized that lumbering was a full time occupation. The problems which
                    confronted him in finance, transportation, marketing, and labor are dealt with at length. His belief
                    in the necessity of establishing a monopoly and his many attempts to undermine the position of his
                    chief competitors are discussed fully and provide an interesting commentary on the mind of the
                    nineteenth century businessman. At times arrogant, he once admitted to his son that his business was
                    a "perfect system," (p. 139). One suspects that his later entrance into politics
                    (he served as mayor of Flint, state senator, and governor) was motivated by a desire to strengthen
                    his position in the business world.</p>
            <p>The author's comments about Crapo's labor policy are particularly illuminating. He
                    looked upon himself as exceptionally gifted in managing his men and claimed they would not work for
                    anyone else. In his letters to his son, he blamed poor business conditions as the reason for the low
                    wages in his mills. At one time he was so hard pressed for cash that he paid wages in commodities.
                    Later, however, when his business did take a turn for the better he bitterly complained that the
                    "men are continually clamoring for more wages" (p. 123). Apparently he saw no
                    connection between his increasing profits and rising wages.</p>
            <p>The principal source for the work is the Crapo Manuscripts, particularly the hundreds of
                    Crapo's letters to his son William which are in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Dr. Lewis' frequent use of the letters in the text adds luster to the
                    narrative and makes fascinating reading. The book contains appendices which are pertinent to the
                    material presented in the text. A serious error occurs in the first chapter. One wonders when <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, records his hopes that the study will contribute ‘to the
                    understanding of contemporary society and of the creative forces which run through our ever changing
                    business structure"; that as a history of a business concern, its observations will
                    preserve the focus of the business executive dealing "with the facts as they are before him
                    at the moment of decision and within the alternatives then available"; and that this volume
                    is presented not as a "polemic on the public power issue but as a record of one company,
                    one of America's great corporations." Raymond C. Miller has succeeded admirably in
                    the fulfillment of these hopes; the resulting volume which is reviewed here is a notable and
                    unusually readable addition to the growing list of worthwhile company histories that can be read
                    with profit by businessmen and historians alike.</p>
            <p>The Introduction contains a noteworthy statement of Professor Miller's relations with the
                    company. Although he was invited to undertake the study in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary
                    of the firm's incorporation, the product is in no sense an "official"
                    history. The company's records were made available to him without limitation, and he
                    records that upon the reading of his manuscript by the firm's directors and officers he was
                    asked to make "no alteration or deletion for the sake of ‘policy’ or
                    in any matter involving finance, administration, or public responsibility" (p. xv).</p>
            <p>The story begins with the introduction of arc lights in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> (1878) several years before the first Edison lamp was put in use there (1881). The
                    first section of the book gives a very interesting account of the struggles of the predecessor
                    companies and of the emergence of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> Edison Company, which was incorporated on January 17, 1903. The work actually covers,
                    therefore, a little more than seventy five years of the history of electrical generating and
                    distributing in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its hinterland. There are a number of threads of interest that can be followed
                    through these years: (1) the transition from competition to monopoly in the local utility field; (2)
                    the expansion of company territory from downtown <placeName>

                    the leading role played by this company in the advance;(4) the efforts to develop new uses and to
                    stimulate demand for electricity; (5) the development of rate schedules and rate-making policy; (6)
                    the relations between the company and the <placeName>

            <p>The reader of this volume gets the feeling that he has had a very good vantage point from which to
                    observe many features of the changing problems of the electrical utility field—from the
                    viewpoint of a company more independent than most it is true, but perhaps the more interesting in
                    consequence. The book concludes with a full description of the sources and is, on the whole, well
                    worth reading.</p>

                    Professor G. R. Potter of Sheffield University. Professor Denys Hay of Edinburgh University
                    completed the editorial revision, wrote the introductory chapter, and saw the book through the
                    press.</p>

                    alloted to the Renaissance. Most of the authors, however, include materials outside this time span.
                    Since the period of time covered is only twenty-seven years, one might question the advisability of
                    having assigned the sixteen chapters to twenty different authors. Although there is relatively
                    little overlapping of materials, there is noticeable unevenness of quality and style.</p>
            <p>The introductory chapter is followed by a helpful and fresh essay by H. C. Darby on "The
                    Face of Europe on the Eve of the Great Discoveries," but these discoveries are not
                    discussed until at the end of the book. Instead, there follows a brilliant, interpretative chapter
                    by Hans Baron on "Fifteenth-Century Civilisation and the Renaissance," in which he
                    explains the social backgrounds of European culture and shows how the scholars of northern Europe
                    responded to Italian humanism. A chapter on the papacy and the church offers little that is new;
                    however, two chapters on learning, literature, and the fine arts contain many new interpretations.
                    Six chapters are devoted to the internal history of a number of European countries, excluding
                    Scandinavia and Russia, which will be discussed in a subsequent volume, and <placeName>

                    There is a scholarly chapter on international relations by J. R. Hale, which provides the setting
                    for one on the invasions of Italy. There are two essays on the expansion of Europe and its impact on
                    the Old World. The latter, unfortunately, is concerned almost solely with economic consequences and
                    ignores the influence of the New World on the intellectual and cultural history of Europe.</p>

                    </placeName>: The Macmillan Company, 1957. Pp. xvi, 496. Frontispiece, illustrations, index.
                    $8.00.)</head>
            <p>"John Locke," writes Maurice Cranston, in bringing this volume to a close,
                    "was a great man; indeed so great a man that his biographer cannot grasp the measure of
                    that greatness. His biographer is perforce too close to him. Only an historian of European thought
                    with a panoramic vision, could judge his stature. But this at least one can say here: Locke did not
                    merely enlarge men's knowledge, he changed their way of thinking." The
                    author's comment in itself is remarkable, for it amounts to saying that those who most
                    thoroughly know Locke are somehow less fitted to know Locke as a great and influential thinker than
                    are those who know him less well. Yet, somehow at the same time, the biographer does know that he
                    was a very great man. How he knows it, except on the word of others who presumedly know less about
                    his subject than he does, is not indicated. Mr. Cranston, however, can document his conclusion by
                    pointing to the biography which he himself has written, for it is seldom that the greatness of Locke
                    breaks through the details of his life to impress itself upon the consciousness of the reader.</p>
            <p>The biography itself is based upon more complete sources than any earlier work dealing with Locke. It
                    is the first biography in which the author has been able to take full advantage of the Lovelace
                    Collection, now the property of the Bodleian Library at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This collection contains approximately three thousand letters besides a thousand
                    miscellaneous manuscripts which include such disparate material as Locke's library lists,
                    his notebooks on politics, economics, philosophy, etc., and even his entries of recipes and
                    inventories, as well as his own personal journals. Mr. Cranston has also succeeded in breaking the
                    secret cyphers, and the personal shorthand system, used by the remarkably secretive philosopher of
                    common sense. In consequence, he has produced a work which, when read in conjunction with Fox
                    Bourne's earlier biography, provides a complete and very useful portrayal of the details
                    and somewhat striking pecularities of Locke's life. It is a volume, however, which is of
                    much greater value for the Locke scholar than for those less conversant with Locke's
                    intellectual contributions <pb n="309" id="VAA4025-054-3-103"/> to the western world. The reader who
                    is only superficially acquainted with Locke's work in philosophy and political theory is
                    likely to be led astray by this biography, for it is rather surprising that the essential element of
                    Locke's life, the growth of his intellectual vision and the development of his philosophy,
                    receives relatively superficial consideration, upon the whole.</p>
            <p>This treatment is unfortunate on two counts. First, the reader is left uncertain about the very facts
                    of Locke's life which it is most important that he know, while at the same time he is
                    provided with all kinds of information about Locke's expenditures for combs, candles, tips
                    for servants, as well as the details of his relations with insignificant people. Second, it is
                    unfortunate because Mr. Cranston would seem to be particularly fitted to the performance of the more
                    important task. His earlier work, <hi rend="i">Freedom: A New Analysis</hi>, shows that he has
                    considerable ability to handle ideas, to see relationships between seemingly separated categories,
                    and to express these matters in clear and precise language. It is to be hoped that he will now turn
                    his attention to the development of Locke's thought. As matters now stand, his biography
                    provides us with a two dimensional picture of Locke, and what is missing is the essential dimension
                    of depth.</p>

                    Bibliographies and index. $15.00.)</head>
            <p>This selection of mid-nineteenth century contemporary sources of English history is the fifth
                    published volume of <hi rend="i">English Historical Documents</hi>, compiled under the general
                    editorship of David C. Douglas. It is one of two volumes on the Victorian age. These will be the
                    last (chronologically) of a monumental series designed "to make generally accessible a wide
                    selection of the fundamental sources of English history" (p. iii).</p>
            <p>Without question, teachers and students of nineteenth century English and European history will find
                    this work invaluable. The editors have successfully achieved their aim of illustrating the
                    "profound transformation of English society" during "the epoch of
                    Britain's greatest influence in the world" (p. 3). Two hundred and sixty-nine
                    documents are presented in a volume divided into twelve parts: the monarchy; parliament; natural
                    resources and economic changes; the churches; Chartism and free trade; law, penal system, and
                    courts; central administration; local government; the Poor Law; public health; education; industrial
                    conditions and legislation. Imperial and foreign policy are excluded on the ground that they are
                    well covered in other collections and that they had little effect upon the central theme of
                    Victorian history. Irish affairs are postponed for treatment in Volume XII, Part 2. Nevertheless,
                    the complexity of the Victorian age is vividly illustrated.</p>
            <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-054-3-104"/>
            <p>Scholarly introductions and select critical bibliographies are valuable parts of the book. There are
                    thirteen introductions (one general and one for each of the twelve parts) and an equal number of
                    bibliographies. The introductions provide not only information which the general reader needs to
                    understand the documents, but interpretations which embody the best of historical scholarship; at
                    times they contain information which is the equivalent of source material, (e.g., the explanatory
                    notes on the principal reform bills, 1852-1866, pp. 121-123). The bibliographies should be of
                    material assistance to all scholars, especially to serious undergraduates and to graduate students.
                    References are made to scholarly journals as well as to books and documents.</p>
            <p>Many of the documents deal forcefully with features of English society which are treated inadequately
                    in the average textbook. Part XI reveals the main problems in education. The reader's
                    attention is held by such topics as governmental assistance to elementary education for procuring
                    competent teachers through a program of incentive and inspection, the reform of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, and the general conditions of elementary and secondary education. The
                    documents dealing with public health (Part X) cast light on the beginnings of a new science and
                    illustrate both the strength and the weaknesses of Edwin Chadwick, the protagonist of sanitary
                    reform. Twenty-two pages are given to Chadwick's Report on the Sanitary Condition of the
                    Labouring Population (1842), a searching analysis. The public health and the Poor Law (Part IX)
                    documents show that the Poor Law and its administration involved far more than efficient
                    administration and reduction in taxes. Medical care, pauper education, and the problems presented by
                    large-scale industrial unemployment are described.</p>
            <p>The documents on natural resources and economic changes (Part III) provide a wealth of statistical
                    and factual data and of other illustrative material. The readings on panics, banking, railway
                    operation, and monopoly will fascinate students of American as well as of English history. The
                    section on Chartism and free trade (Part V) contains selections from Peel's and
                    Gladstone's budget speeches as well as selections from the great debates on the repeal of
                    the Corn Laws and on the Charter. The section on industrial conditions and legislation (Part XIII)
                    contains a well-balanced set of sources which will revise one-sided interpretations of the
                    Industrial Revolution.</p>
            <p>Students of present-day religious trends will find the Census Report of 1851-1853 on religious
                    worship to be enlightening. Well-known controversial religious issues are also covered (Part IV, The
                    Churches). Legal and court reform, prison conditions and reform, civil marriage and divorce receive
                    adequate attention (Part VI). Molesworth's classic report on transportation is given twelve
                    pages (pp. 513-525). A number of selections in Parts IX-XII show that contemporary observers were
                    not oblivious to the interrelation of morals, crime and punishment, public health, education, and
                    industrial conditions.</p>
            <p>The well-known political and constitutional developments receive adequate documentation. Basic
                    municipal and county problems and the work of the Metropolitan Board of Works are well illustrated
                    (Part VIII). Civil service, army, and financial reform are described (Part <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-054-3-105"/> VII). The role of the monarch and parliamentary reform are well
                    illustrated (Parts I and II).</p>
            <p>The editors of so great an undertaking could scarcely avoid some errors of fact and judgment.
                    Professor P. and Mrs. G. Ford are listed as P. G. Ford (p. 37). The editors might well have noted in
                    the select general bibliography some of the pitfalls that students encounter in using the <hi rend="i">Parliamentary Papers.</hi> Perhaps the citations of <hi rend="i">Parliamentary
                    Papers</hi> could have been improved by including the number of each paper in the references. Twenty
                    pages are devoted to the reform of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, but no illustrations of the work of the training colleges are provided.
                    Peel's classic speech of February 16, 1846, is so edited as to undervalue to some extent
                    his conversion to free trade and to overrate the effect of the Irish potato famine upon his decision
                    to press repeal of the Corn Laws. Such errors do not, however, detract from the value of the work.</p>
            <p>All in all, this volume is a splendid collection of printed source material (principally the public
                    records). It will be helpful to specialists in the Victorian age. It will greatly enlighten and
                    interest students of modern history. For the teachers and students of nineteenth century English
                    history who do not have access to adequate libraries, this volume will be indispensable; indeed,
                    those who fail to use it will run the risk of historical ignorance.</p>
