                    <p>Alas, the Rube Town in which she Hung Forth was given over to Croquet, Mush

                        Her. So she led a lonely Life, dreaming of the One--the Ideal. He was a big

                        his Pink Spats were the first ever seen in Fostoria.</p>
                    <p>"Have you a Manicure Parlor in this Beastly Hole?" asked the New York Man, as
                        they walked up from the Train.</p>

                    <p>"Great Heavens!" exclaimed the New York Man, and was silent for several
                        Moments.</p>
                    <p>At Dinner he called for Artichokes, and when told that there were none, he
                        said, "Oh, very well," in a Tone of Chastened Resignation.</p>
                    <p>After Dinner he took the Family into the Parlor, and told the Members how
                        much they would Enjoy going to Weber and Fields'. Seeing a Book on the
                        Table, he sauntered up to It and said, "Ah, one of Dick Davis' Things."
                        Later in the Evening he visited the only Club House in Town. The Local
                        Editor of the Evening Paper was playing Pin-Pool with the Superintendent of
                        the Trolley Line. When the New York Man came into the Room, they began to
                        Tremble and fell down on their Shots.</p>

                        a Drink. The New York Man wondered if a Small Bottle was already cold. They
                        said Yes, but it was a Lie. The Boy had to go out for it.</p>
                    <p>He found One that had been in the Window of the Turf Exchange since the Grand
                        Opening, the Year after Natural Gas was discovered. The New York Man drank
                        it, remarking that it was hardly as Dry as he usually got it at

                        about her in a Limited Orbit and was known by Courtesy as her Husband. He
                        was Soft for her, and so she got it Mapped out with Herself that she was a

                    <p>She had read about nine Subscription Books with Cupid and Dove Tail-Pieces
                        and she believed that she could get away with any Topic that she batted up

                    <p>But never you Fear, She thought She had Julia Arthur and Mary Mannering
                        Seventeen up and One to play, so far as Good Looks were concerned; and when

                        of a Cable Car, and he didn't have the Nerve to get a Divorce. So he stood

                        She skated off into the Woods to hear a man with a Black Alpaca Coat lecture
                        to the High Foreheads about the Subverted Ego, he used to go out with a few
                        Friends and tell them his Troubles and weep into his Beer. They would slap
                        him on the Back and tell him she was a Nice Woman; but he knew better.</p>
                    <p>Annyhow, as Bobby Gaylor used to say, she became restless around the House,
                        with nothing to do except her Husband, so she made up her mind to be
                        Benevolent to beat the Band. She decided that she would allow the Glory of
                        her Presence to burst upon the Poor and the Uncultured. It would be a Big
                        Help to the Poor and Uncultued to see what a Real Razmataz Lady was
                        like.</p>
                    <p>She didn't Propose to put on Old <pb id="VAA2418-044" n="38"/> Clothes, and
                        go and live with Poor People and be One of Them, and nurse their Sick, as

                        Benevolent, and be Dead Swell at the Same Time.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, she would Lace Herself until she was the Shape of a Bass Viol,
                        and put on her Tailor-Made, and the Hat that made her Face seem longer, and
                        then she would Gallop forth to do Things to the Poor. She always carried a

                    <p>"I think he plays the Stock Market," would be the Reply.</p>

                        learns to spell 'Ibex' by the time I call again I will let him look at my
                        Rings. As for you, bear in mind that it is no Disgrace to be Poor; it is
                        simply Inconvenient, that's all."</p>
                    <p>Having delivered herself of these Helpful Remarks she would Duck, and the <pb
                            id="VAA2418-049" n="43"/> Uplifted Mother would put a Nickel in the Can
                        and send Lizzie over to the Dutchman's.</p>
                    <p>In this manner the Benevolent Lady carried forward the Good Work, and Dazzled
                        the whole Region between O'Hara's Box Factory and the City Dump. It didn't
                        Cost anything, and she derived much Joy from the Knowledge that Hundreds of
                        People were Rubbering at her, and remarking in Choked Whispers: "Say, ain't
                        she the Smooth Article?"</p>
                    <p>But one day a Scrappy Kid, whose Mother didn't have any Lorgnette or Diamond
                        Ear-Bobs, spotted the Benevolent Lady. The Benevolent Lady had been in the
                        House telling his Mother that it was a Glorious Privilege to wash for a
                        Living.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2418-050" n="44"/>
                    <p>After the Benevolent Lady went away the Kid's Mother sat down and had a Good
                        Cry, and the Scrappy Kid thought it was up to them. He went out to the Alley
                        and found a Tomato Can that was not working, and he waited.</p>
                    <p>In a little while the Benevolent Lady came out of a Basement, in which she
                        had been telling a Polish Family to look at her and be Happy. The Scrappy
                        Kid let drive, and the Tomato Can struck the Benevolent Lady between the
                        Shoulder Blades. She squawked and started to run, fell over a Garbage Box,
                        and had to be picked up by a Policeman.</p>
                    <p>She went Home in a Cab, and told her Husband that the Liquor League had tried
                        to Assassinate her, because she was Reforming so many Drunkards. That
                        settled it with her--she said she wouldn't <pb id="VAA2418-051" n="45"/> try
                        to be Benevolent any more--so she joined an Ibsen Club.</p>
                    <p>The Scrappy Kid grew up to be a Corrupt Alderman, and gave his Mother plenty
                        of Good Clothes, which she was always afraid to wear.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">I</hi>N Centreville there lived two husky Young Fellows named
                        Bill and Schuyler--commonly abbreviated to Schuy. They did not find any
                        nourishing Excitement in a Grain Elevator, so they Enlisted to Free
                        Cuba.</p>
                    <p>The Government gave each of them a Slouch Hat and a prehistoric Firearm. They
                        tied Red Handkerchiefs around their Necks and started for the Front, each
                        with his Head out of the Car Window. They gave the Sioux Yell to everybody
                        along the Track between Centreville and Tampa.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2418-053" n="48"/>
                    <p>While in Camp they played Double Pedie, smoked Corn-Cob Pipes and cussed the
                        Rations. They referred to the President of these United States as "Mac," and
                        spoke of the beloved Secretary of War as "Old Alger."</p>
                    <p>After more or less Delay they went aboard a Boat, and were landed in Cuba,
                        where they began to Shoot at everything that looked Foreign. The hot Rain
                        drenched them, and the tropical Sun steamed them; they had Mud on their
                        clothes, and had to sleep out. When they were unusually Tired and Hungry,
                        they would sing Coon Songs and Roast the War Department.</p>
                    <p>At last they were ordered Home. On the way back they didn't think of Anything
                        except their two Lady Friends, who worked in the Centreville Steam
                        Laundry.</p>

                    <p>They rode into Town with a Machete under each Arm, and their Pockets full of
                        Mauser Cartridges.</p>
                    <p>The first Thing they saw when they alighted from the Train was a Brass Band.
                        It began to play, "See the Conquering Hero Comes."</p>
                    <p>Then eight Little Girls in White began to strew Flowers in their Pathway.</p>
                    <p>The Artillery company ripped out a Salute.</p>
                    <p>Cap Gibbs, who won his Title by owning the first Steam Thrashing Machine ever
                        seen in the County, confronted them with a Red, White, and Blue Sash around
                        him. He Barked in a loud Voice--it was something about Old Glory.</p>
                    <p>Afterward the Daughters of the Revolution took them in Tow, and escorted them
                        to Pythian Hall, where they were <pb id="VAA2418-056" n="51"/> given Fried

                    <p>While they were Feeding, the Sons of Veterans Quartet stood on the Rostrum
                        with their Heads together, and sang:</p>

                        Clarence. Joseph was much the older. His Parents brought him up on a Plan of

                        he would soil himself, and learn to be Rude and Boisterous.</p>
                    <p>So they kept Him in the House, and his Mother read to him about Little Rollo,
                        who never lied or cheated, and who grew up to be a Bank President. She
                        seemed to think that a Bank President was above Reproach.</p>

                    <p>Little Joseph was kept away from the Public Schools, and had to Play Games in
                        the Garret with two Spindly Little Girls. He learned Tatting and the
                        Herring-Bone Stitch. When he was Ten Years of age he could play Chop-Sticks
                        on the Piano; his Ears were Translucent, and his Front Teeth showed like

                        was Older. They sent him to the Public Schools; they allowed him to roam at

                    <p>The Preacher wiped his Brow and said he had no Doubt that every one within
                        the Sound of his Voice remembered what Quarolius had said, following the
                        same Line of Thought. It was Quarolius who disputed the Contention of the
                        great Persian Theologian Ramtazuk, that the Soul in its reaching out after
                        the Unknowable was guided by the Spiritual Genesis of Motive rather than by
                        mere Impulse of Mentality. The Preacher didn't know what all This meant, and
                        he didn't care, but you can rest easy that the Pew-Holders were On in a
                        minute. He talked it off in just <pb id="VAA2418-074" n="[69]"/>

                        any and all Styles of Delivery. They held on to the Cushions and seemed to
                        be having a Nice Time.</p>
                    <p>The Preacher quoted copiously from the Great Poet Amebius. He recited 18
                        lines of Greek and then said: "How true this is!" And not a Parishioner
                        batted an Eye.</p>
                    <p>It was Amebius whose Immortal Lines he recited in order to prove the Extreme
                        Error of the Position assumed in the Controversy by the Famous Italian,
                        Polenta.</p>

                    <p>He had them Going, and there wasn't a Thing to it. When he would get tired of
                        faking Philosophy he would quote from a Celebrated Poet of Ecuador or
                        Tasmania or some other Seaport Town. Compared with this Verse, all of which
                        was of the same School as the Icelandic Masterpiece, the most obscure and
                        clouded Passage in Robert Browning was like a Plate-Glass Front in a State

                        hadn't been used before that Season. He grabbed a rhetorical Roman Candle in
                        each Hand and you couldn't see him for the Sparks.</p>
                    <p>After which he sunk his Voice to <pb id="VAA2418-077" n="72"/> a Whisper and
                        talked about the Birds and the Flowers. Then, although there was no Cue for
                        him to Weep, he shed a few real Tears. And there wasn't a dry Glove in the
                        Church.</p>
                    <p>After he sat down he could tell by the Scared Look of the People in Front
                        that he had made a Ten-Strike.</p>
                    <p>Did they give him the Joyous Palm that Day? Sure!</p>
                    <p>The Stout Lady could not control her Feelings when she told how much the
                        Sermon had helped her. The venerable Harness Dealer said he wished to
                        indorse the Able and Scholarly Criticism of Polenta.</p>

                        But no one had the Face to step up and confess his Ignorance of these
                        Celebrities. The Pew-Holders didn't even admit among themselves that the

                    <p>An elderly Man approached the Youth who had lately got next to the Rules of
                        Commerce. The elderly Man was a Yap. He wore a Hickory Shirt, a discouraged
                        Straw Hat, a pair of Barn-Door Pants clinging to one lonely Gallus and
                        woolen Socks that had settled down over his Plow Shoes. He was shy several

                        smelt like Burning Leaves in the Fall.</p>

                    <p>Brother Lyford came in from the East Eighty to get his Dinner, and there was
                        Jethro in the Hammock reading a Great Work by Archibald Clavering

                        for the Team, so the Side-Show Announcer, who was something of a Kidder and
                        had attended a Unitarian College, gave them Zoroaster and Zendavesta. They
                        were Stuck on it, and had a Job Printer do some Cards for them.</p>

                        Notice of the Night Owls' performance from a Programme brought to him by the
                        Head Usher at the Opera House, who was also Galley Boy at the Office.</p>
                    <p>Zoroaster and Zendavesta played the same Sketch for Seventeen Years and made
                        only two important Changes in all that Time. During the Seventh Season
                        Zoroaster changed his Whiskers from Green to Blue. At the beginning of the
                        Fourteenth Year of the Act they bought a new Slap-Stick and put a Card in

                        They never could Understand why the Public stood for Mansfield when it could
                        get Zoroaster and Zendavesta. The Property Man gave it as his Opinion that
                        Mansfield conned the Critics. Zendavesta said there was only one Critic on
                        the Square, and he was at Paducah.</p>
                    <p>When the Vodeville Craze came along Zoroaster and Zendavesta took their
                        Paducah Scrap Book over to a Manager, and he Booked them. Zoroaster assured
                        the Manager that Him and his Partner done a Refined Act, suitable for Women
                        and Children, with a strong Finish, which had been the Talk of all
                        Galveston. The Manager put them in between the Trained Ponies and a Legit

                    <p>Zoroaster and Zendavesta came on very Cocky, and for the 7,800th Time
                        Zoroaster asked Zendavesta:</p>
                    <p>"Who wuz it I seen you comin' up the Street with?"</p>
                    <p>Then, for the 7,800th Time, by way of Mirth-Provoking Rejoinder, Zendavesta
                        kicked Zoroaster in the Stomach, after which the Slap-Stick was introduced
                        as a Sub-Motive.</p>

                        They said it was no way to treat Artists. The Manager told them they were

                        the Docket was that of Flora Botts vs. Adolph Botts.</p>
                    <p>The Applicant, Mrs. Botts, and Adolph, the Other Half of the Domestic Sketch,
                        were already inside the Railing, each attempting to look the other out of

                    <p>It seemed that she alleged Cruelty, Neglect, Inhuman Treatment, Violent

                        belonged to the Peroxide Tribe. "Furthermore, we will take it for granted

                    <p>"My Parents were Poor, but Refined," said Mrs. Botts. "They gave me Every
                        Advantage. After I finished the High School I attended a Conservatory, and
                        every one said I had Talent. I should have been an Elocutionist. Once I went
                        to Rockford and recited "The Tramp's Story" at a Club Social, and I got a

                        God's Sake not to tackle anything Humorous, with a Conservatory Dialect to

                        to prepare the Book for a Comic Opera. A Friend of mine who works in a Hat
                        Store was to Compose the Music. I think he has more Ability than Victor
                        Herbert."</p>
                    <p>"Did this Friend think Well of your Libretto?" asked the Wise Judge.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, sir; he said it was the Best Thing that had been done since 'Erminie.'
                        In fact, everybody liked my Book."</p>
                    <p>"Except your Wife," suggested the Court.</p>
                    <p>"That's it, exactly. I wanted Sympathy and Encouragement and she gave me the
                        Metallic Laugh. There is one <pb id="VAA2418-107" n="102"/> Patter Song in
                        my Opera that Every One who comes to my House has been Crazy to hear.
                        Whenever I started to Sing it she would talk in a loud Voice. She never
                        seemed to Appreciate my Stuff. I think the Bleach affected her Head."</p>
                    <p>"Has the Opera been produced?" asked the Court, with Humane Hesitancy.</p>
                    <p>"No, the Eastern Managers were all tied up with Harry B. Smith," replied Mr.
                        Botts. "Then there's a Prejudice against Western Talent."</p>
                    <p>"Well, Mr. Botts, in View of all the Evidence, I have decided to give you a
                        Decree of Divorce from Flo of the Wheaten Tresses," said the Modern
                        Solomon.</p>
                    <p>"But look here!" exclaimed the Defendant, <pb id="VAA2418-108" n="103"/> "I
                        haven't applied for any Divorce."</p>
                    <p>"You don't have to. I give it to you anyway. As for you, Mrs. Botts, I will
                        give you a Decree also. The Alimony will be $25 per."</p>
                    <p>"Thanks."</p>
                    <p>"I don't think you grasp the Decision. When I say that the Alimony is $25
                        per, I mean that Mrs. Botts will be required to pay that Amount to Adolph
                        every week."</p>
                    <p>"Shameful!"</p>
                    <p>"Don't be too hasty. I further Decree that Mr. Botts must pay the same Amount
                        to Flora every Week."</p>
                    <p>"That simply makes it a Stand-Off," remarked Mr. Botts, who was puzzled.</p>
                    <p>"My idea of the Case, neatly expressed," <pb id="VAA2418-109" n="104"/> said
                        the Modern Solomon. "Each of you is Divorced from the Other, and if Either

                        sentenced to Ten Years of Hard Labor in some Penal Institution."</p>

                        told them to Leave Off breaking the Man's Fence. His Tone and Manner
                        irritated the University Men, who were not accustomed to Rudeness from

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">N</hi>OW it happens that in America a man who goes up hanging
                        to a Balloon is a Professor.</p>
                    <p>One day a Professor, preparing to make a Grand Ascension, was sorely pestered
                        by Spectators of the Yellow-Hammer Variety, who fell over the Stay-Ropes or
                        crowded up close to the Balloon to ask Fool Questions. They wanted to know
                        how fur up he Calkilated to go and was he Afeerd and how often had he did
                        it. The Professor answered them in the Surly Manner peculiar to Showmen
                        accustomed to meet a Web-Foot <pb id="VAA2418-116" n="112"/> Population. On
                        the Q. T. the Prof. had Troubles of his own. He was expected to drop in at a
                        Bank on the following Day and take up a Note for 100 Plunks. The Ascension
                        meant 50 to him, but how to Corral the other 50? That was the Hard One.</p>
                    <p>This question was in his Mind as he took hold of the Trapeze Bar and signaled
                        the Farm Hands to let go. As he trailed Skyward beneath the buoyant silken
                        Bag he hung by his Knees and waved a glad Adieu to the Mob of Inquisitive
                        Yeomen. A Sense of Relief came to him as he saw the Crowd sink away in the
                        Distance.</p>
                    <p>Hanging by one Toe, and with his right Palm pressed to his Eyes, he said:
                        "Now that I am Alone, let me Think, let me Think."</p>

                    <p>Presently he gave a sigh of Relief.</p>
                    <p>"I will go to my Wife's Brother and make a Quick Touch," he said. "If he
                        refuses to Unbelt I will threaten to tell his Wife of the bracelet he bought
                        in Louisville."</p>
                    <p>Having reached this Happy Conclusion, he loosened the Parachute and quickly
                        descended to the Earth.</p>

                    <p>He hated to Work and it hurt his Eyes to read Law, but on a Clear Day he
                        could be heard a Mile, so he became a Statesman.</p>
                    <p>Whenever the Foresters had a Picnic they invited him to make the Principal
                        Address, because he was the only Orator who could beat out the
                        Merry-Go-Round.</p>
                    <p>The Habit of Dignity enveloped him.</p>
                    <p>Upon his Brow Deliberation sat. He <pb id="VAA2418-120" n="116"/> wore a
                        Fireman's moustache and a White Lawn Tie, and he loved to Talk about the
                        Flag.</p>
                    <p>At a Clam-Bake in 1884 he hurled Defiance at all the Princes and Potentates
                        of Europe, and the Sovereign Voters, caught up by his Matchless Eloquence
                        and Unswerving Courage, elected him to the Legislature.</p>
                    <p>While he was in the Legislature he discovered that these United States were
                        an Asylum for the Down-Trodden and oppressed of the Whole World, and
                        frequently called Attention to the Fact. When some one asked him if he was
                        cutting up any Easy Money or would it be safe for a Man with a Watch to go
                        to Sleep in the same Room with him, he would take a Drink of Water and begin

                        said it was simply Impossible for such a Thunderous Patriot to be a Crook.

                    <p>In Due Time he Married a Widow of the Bantam Division. The Reason she married
                        him was that he looked to her to be a Coming Congressman and she wanted to
                        get a Whack at Washington Society. Besides, she lived in a Flat and the

                    <p>He arose and put his Right Hand inside of his Prince Albert Coat and
                        began.</p>
                    <p>"Madam," he said, "During a Long, and, I trust, a not altogether fruitless

                    <p>"Nix! Nix!" she said, rapping for order with a Tea-Cup. "Let go of the Flying

                    <p>He dilated his Nostrils and said: "From the Rock-Bound Hills of Maine in the

                    <p>"Forget the Everglades," she said, rapping again. "That Superheated

                        make a Showing, and there was nobody in Town qualified to give her a quiet
                        Hunch.</p>
                    <p>She got her Fashion Hints from a Trade Catalogue, and took her Tips on

                        whitewashed Dornicks in front of it, and a Wind-Pump at the rear. Father was
                        a good deal the same kind of a Man as David Harum, except that he didn't let
                        go of any Christmas Presents, or work the Soft Pedal when he had a chance to
                        apply a Crimp to some Widow who had seen Better Days. In fact, Daughter was

                        also that he wore a superb Ring. They strolled under the Maples, and he
                        talked what is technically known as Hot Air. He made an Impression
                        considerably deeper than himself. She promised to Correspond.</p>

                        Salesman, she reached for the Peau d'Espagne and sprayed herself.</p>
                    <p>One Day when the Tobacco Salesman came up Main Street with his <pb

                        through with his Work, got a Shave, changed ends on his Cuffs, pared his
                        Nails, bought a box of Marsh-mallows, and went out to the House.</p>
                    <p>Daughter was on the Lawn, seated under a Canopy that had set Father back
                        thirty-two Dollars. There was a Hired Hand sprinkling the Grass with a Hose,
                        and as Will, the Conversational Drummer, came up the Long Walk, Daughter
                        called to the Hired Hand, and said: "Johnson, there is a Strange Man coming
                        up the Walk; change the Direction of the Stream somewhat, else you may

                    <p>The Drummer approached her, feeling of his Necktie, and wondered if she <pb

                        Daylight. She didn't. Daughter allowed a rose-colored Booklet, by Guy de

                        at him, and said: "All Goods must be delivered at the Rear."</p>
                    <p>"Don't you Know me?" he asked.</p>
                    <p>"Rully, it seems to me I have seen you, Somewhere," she replied, "but I

                    <p>"Don't you remember the night I met you at the Lawn Fte?" he asked; and then,
                        Chump that he was, and all Rattled, he told her his Name, instead of giving
                        her the scorching Come-Back that he composed next Day, when it was Too

                    <p>Then she gave him "Some one's else," "Neyether," "Savoir-Faire," and a few

                    <p>Luella was a Good Girl, who had taken Prizes at the Mission Sunday School,
                        but she was Plain, much. Her Features did not seem to know the value of Team
                        Work. Her Clothes fit her Intermittently, as it were. She was what would be
                        called a Lumpy Dresser. But she had a good Heart.</p>
                    <p>Luella found Employment at a Hat Factory. All she had to do was to put Red
                        Linings in Hats for the Country <pb id="VAA2418-138" n="136"/> Trade; and
                        every Saturday Evening, when Work was called on account of Darkness, the
                        Boss met her as she went out and crowded three Dollars on her.</p>
                    <p>The other Sister was Different.</p>
                    <p>She began as Mary, then changed to Marie, and her Finish was Mae.</p>
                    <p>From earliest Youth she had lacked Industry and Application.</p>
                    <p>She was short on Intellect but long on Shape.</p>
                    <p>The Vain Pleasures of the World attracted her. By skipping the Long Words she
                        could read how Rupert Bansiford led Sibyl Gray into the Conservatory and
                        made Love that scorched the Begonias. Sometimes she just Ached to light out
                        with an Opera Company.</p>

                        The sagacious Proprietor of a Lunch Room employed her as Cashier. In a

                    <p>Marie was a Strong Card. The Male Patrons of the Establishment hovered around
                        the Desk long after paying their Checks. Within a Month the Receipts of the
                        Place had doubled.</p>
                    <p>It was often remarked that Marie was a Pippin. Her Date Book had to be kept

                    <p>A Credit Man from the Wholesale House across the Street told her that any

                    <p>They were Married, and went to live in a Flat with a Quarter-Sawed Oak
                        Chiffonier and Pink Rugs. She was Mae at this Stage of the Game.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after this, Wheat jumped twenty-two points, and the Husband didn't do
                        a Thing.</p>
                    <p>Mae bought a Thumb Ring and a Pug Dog, and began to speak of the Swede Help
                        as "The Maid."</p>
                    <p>Then she decided that she wanted to live in a House, because, in a Flat, One
                        could never be sure of One's Neighbors. So they moved into a Sarcophagus on
                        the Boulevard, right in between two Old <pb id="VAA2418-143" n="141"/>

                    <p>Mae bought an Automobile, and blew her Allowance against Beauty Doctors. The
                        Smell of Cooking made her Faint, and she couldn't see where the Working
                        Classes came in at all.</p>
                    <p>When she attended the theater a Box was none too good. Husband went along, in
                        evening clothes and a Yachting Cap, and he had two large Diamonds in his

                    <p>Sometimes she went to a Vogner Concert, and sat through it, and she wouldn't

                    <p>In the Hey-Day of Prosperity did Mae forget Luella? No, indeed.</p>
                    <p>She took Luella away from the Hat Factory, where the Pay was three Dollars a

                    <p>Inside of a Barricade were several Thousands of Men, Women and Children. They
                        were moving restlessly among the trampled Weeds, which were clotted with
                        Watermelon Rinds, Chicken Bones, Straw and torn Paper Bags.</p>
                    <p>It was a very hot Day. The People could not sit down. They shuffled Wearily
                        and were pop-eyed with Lassitude and Discouragement.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2418-146" n="144"/>
                    <p>A stifling Dust enveloped them. They Gasped and Sniffled. Some tried to
                        alleviate their Sufferings by gulping down a Pink Beverage made of
                        Drug-Store Acid, which fed the Fires of Thirst.</p>
                    <p>Thus they wove and interwove in the smoky Oven. The Whimper or the faltering
                        Wail of Children, the quavering Sigh of overlaced Women, and the long-drawn
                        Profanity of Men--these were what the Fool-Killer heard as he looked upon the
                        Suffering Throng.</p>
                    <p>"Is this a new Wrinkle on Dante's Inferno?" he asked of the Man on the Gate,
                        who wore a green Badge marked "Marshal," and was taking Tickets.</p>
                    <p>"No, sir; this is a County Fair," was the reply.</p>

                    <p>The Fool-Killer hefted his Club and then looked at the Crowd and shook his

                    <p>As he sat and Meditated, two Players passed him. They were going the Long

                    <p>They followed the Gutta Percha Balls with the intent swiftness of trained
                        Bird Dogs, and each talked feverishly of Brassy Lies, and getting past the

                    <p>As they did the St. Andrews Full Swing for eighty Yards apiece and then
                        Followed Through with the usual Explanations of how it Happened, the Caddy
                        looked at them and Reflected that they were much inferior to his Father.</p>

                    <head>THE FABLE OF THE BOHEMIAN WHO HAD HARD LUCK</head>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">O</hi>NCE upon a Time there was a Brilliant but Unappreciated
                        Chap who was such a Thorough Bohemian that Strangers usually mistook him for
                        a Tramp.</p>
                    <p>Would he brush his Clothes? Not he. When he wore a Collar he was Ashamed of
                        himself. He had Pipe-Ashes on his Coat and Vest. He seldom Combed his Hair,
                        and never Shaved.</p>
                    <p>Every Evening he ate an Imitation Dinner, at a forty-cent Table d'Hte, with a
                        Bottle of Writing Fluid thrown in. He had formed a little Salon of Geniuses,
                            <pb id="VAA2418-159" n="158"/> who also were out of Work, and they loved
                        to Loll around on their Shoulder-Blades and Laugh Bitterly at the World.</p>
                    <p>The main Bohemian was an Author. After being Turned Down by numerous
                        Publishers, he had decided to write for Posterity. Posterity hadn't heard
                        anything about it, and couldn't get out an Injunction.</p>
                    <p>He knew his Works were good, because all the Free and Untrammeled Souls in
                        the Spaghetti Joint told him so. He would read them a Little Thing of his
                        Own about Wandering in the Fields with Lesbia, and then he would turn to a
                        Friend, whose Face was all covered with Human Ivy, and ask him, point blank:
                        "Is it, or is it not, Better than the Dooley Stuff?"</p>

                    <p>"There is no Comparison," would be the Reply, coming through the Foliage.</p>
                    <p>Wandering in the Fields with Lesbia! Lesbia would have done Well. If he had
                        Wandered in the Fields at any Time he would have been Pinched on Suspicion
                        that he was out for Turnips.</p>
                    <p>The sure-enough Bohemian was a Scathing Critic. If Brander Matthews only knew
                        some of the Things said about him, there would be Tear Marks on his Pillow.
                        And Howells, too. Bah! My, but he was Caustic.</p>
                    <p>The way he burned up Magazine Writers, it's a Wonder they didn't get after
                        him for Arson.</p>
                    <p>One day, while standing on the Front Stoop at his Boarding House, trying to
                        think of some one who would submit to a Touch, a Flower Pot fell from a
                        Window <pb id="VAA2418-162" n="161"/> Ledge above him, and hit him on the
                        Head. He was put into an Ambulance and taken to a Hospital, where the
                        Surgeons clipped his Hair short, in order to take Three Stitches. While he
                        was still Unconscious, and therefore unable to Resist, they Scrubbed him
                        with Castile Soap, gave him a good Shave, and put him into a snowy-white
                        Gown.</p>
                    <p>His Friends heard of the Accident, and went to the Hospital to offer
                        Condolence. When they found him he was so Clean and Commonplace that they
                        lost all Respect for him.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">I</hi>N a certain Athletic Club which rented two rooms over a
                        Tin-Shop there was one Boy who could put it All Over the other Members.</p>
                    <p>He knew how to Jab and Counter and Upper-Cut and Bore in with the Left and
                        Play for the Wind. He had Lumps on his Arms and a good Pair of Shoulders,
                        and every one in the Club told him he had the makings of a World-Beater. He
                        used to coax Grocery Clerks and Grammar-School Children to put on the Gloves
                        with him, and then he would <pb id="VAA2418-164" n="164"/> go around them,
                        like a Cooper around a Barrel, and Trim them right and proper.</p>
                    <p>His friends would stand and watch him make Monkeys of these anmic Amateurs,
                        and gradually the Conviction grew within the that he could Lick anybody of
                        his Weight. The Boy believed them when they told him he ought to go after
                        the Top-Notchers.</p>
                    <p>He gave up his Job in the Planning Mill and became a Pugilist. The Proprietor
                        of a Cigar Store acted as his Manager, and began to pay his Board. This
                        Manager was Foxy. He told the Boy that before tackling the Championship
                        Class it would be better to go out and beat a lot of Fourth-Raters, thereby
                        building up a Reputation and at the same time getting here and there a Mess
                        of the Long Green.</p>

                    <p>In the same Town there was an Undertaker who had Sporting Blood in his Veins,
                        and he sought out the Manager and made a Match in behalf of an Unknown.</p>
                    <p>The boy went into Training in a Stable. He had a yellow Punching Bag, a
                        Sponge, a Bath-Robe and several Towels. Two Paper-Hangers who were out of
                        Work acted as his Trainers. They rubbed him with Witch Hazel all day, and in
                        the Evening the Boy stood around in a Sweater and Talked out of the corner
                        of his Mouth. He said he was Trained to the Minute, as Hard as Nails and Fit
                        as a Fiddle, and he would make Mr. Unknown jump out of the Ring.</p>
                    <p>As the Day of the Battle approached it came out that the Unknown was a <pb

                        <pb id="VAA2418-168" n="168"/> Scrapper who had been fairly Successful at
                        one Time, but had ceased to be a Live One several Years before. He was
                        imported especially for this Contest with the Coming Champion.</p>
                    <p>When he arrived in Town it was evident that he lacked Condition. He had been
                        dieting himself on Pie and Beer, and any Expert, such as the Cigar Store
                        Man, could tell by looking at him that his Abdomen was not hard enough to
                        withstand those crushing Body Blows such as the Boy was in the Habit of
                        Landing--on the Punching Bag. Accordingly the Word went around that the
                        imported Pug was too Fat and had bad Wind.</p>
                    <p>It began to resemble a Cinch.</p>
                    <p>The Manager went out and bet more Money, and the Coming Champion was <pb
                            id="VAA2418-169" n="169"/> Nervous for fear that he would kill the
                        Has-Been if he connected too strong on the Point of the Jaw. He thought it
                        would be better to wear him down with Short-Arm blows and make him Quit. He
                        had read that it was Dangerous to punish a Physical Wreck, who might have
                        Heart Trouble or something like that. The Boy was a Professional Pugilist,
                        but he had Humane Instincts.</p>
                    <p>When the Boy came to the Train which was to carry the Participants and the
                        Spectators to the Battle-Field he was attended by four Comrades, who had
                        Ice, Beef Tea, Brandy, Alcohol, Blankets and other Paraphernalia. They made
                        a Couch for him in the Baggage Car, and had him lie down, so that he might
                        conserve all his Strength and step into the Ring as fresh as possible. The
                            <pb id="VAA2418-170" n="170"/> so-called Unknown had no one to Handle
                        him. He sat Alone in the Men's Car, with a queer Telescope Valise on his
                        Knees, and he smoked a Cigarette, which was in direct Violation of all the
                        Rules of Training.</p>
                    <p>At last the Company arrived at the Secluded Spot, and a Ring was staked
                        out.</p>
                    <p>The Coming Champion was received with Loud Cheers. He wore a new Pair of
                        Gymnasium Shoes, spotless Trunks, and around his Waist was an American Flag,
                        presented by his Admirers in the Athletic Club.</p>
                    <p>In a few Moments the Imported Scrapper came into the Ring, attended by the
                        Sporty Undertaker. He wore an old Pair of Bike Shoes and faded Work
                        Trousers, chopped off at the <pb id="VAA2418-171" n="[171]"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2418-172" n="172"/> Knees, while his Belt was a Shawl-Strap. He
                        was chewing Gum.</p>
                    <p>After he put on the Gloves he looked over at the Coming Champion and remarked
                        to the Undertaker that he (the Coming Champion) seemed to be a Nice Young
                        Fellow. After which he Yawned slightly, and wanted to know what Time they
                        would get a Train back to Town.</p>
                    <p>The Bell rang, and there in the Center of the Ring stood the Tottering
                        Has-Been and the Coming Champion.</p>
                    <p>The Has-Been was crouched, with his Head drawn in, turtle-fashion, his Legs
                        spraddled, and oh, the hard, vicious Expression on that Face, as he Fiddled
                        Short and looked intently at the Coming Champion's Feet. This was a very
                        confusing and unprofessional Thing to do, as the Boy had not been accustomed
                            <pb id="VAA2418-173" n="173"/> to boxing with People who looked at his
                        Feet. He wondered if there was anything the matter with his Gymnasium
                        Shoes.</p>
                    <p>In a Moment or two he saw that the Physical Wreck was afraid to Lead, so he
                        did some nimble Foot Work, and his Gloves began to describe Parabolas--then
                        all at once somebody turned off the Sunshine.</p>
                    <p>They threw Cold Water on him, held a Bottle of Ammonia to his Nose and stuck
                        Pins in under his Finger-Nails.</p>
                    <p>At last his Eye-Lids fluttered, and he turned a dim and filmy Gaze on his
                        faithful Seconds gathered about him.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, how the Birds sing!" he murmured. "And see! The Aurora Borealis is
                        trying to climb over Pain's Fire-Works."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2418-174" n="174"/>
                    <p>"Cheer up!" said the Manager. "He took a Mean Advantage of you and Hit you
                        when you wasn't Looking."</p>
                    <p>"Ah, yes, it all comes back to me. Did I win?"</p>
                    <p>"Not quite," replied the Manager, who feared to tell him the whole Truth.</p>
                    <p>"You say he Hit me?" asked the Coming Champion.</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"With a Casting?"</p>
                    <p>"We couldn't tell. He was in such a Hurry."</p>
                    <p>All this Time the Victor was sitting on the Station Platform with the
                        Undertaker. He was Remarking that it seemed to be a very Purty Country
                        thereabouts, and he'd often wished he could close in on enough of the Gilt
                        to buy him a nice piece of Land somewhere, <pb id="VAA2418-175" n="175"/>
                        inasmuch as he regarded a Farmer as the most independent Man on Earth.</p>
                    <p>Next week there was a familiar Name back on the Time-Card at the Planing

                        Public for the Benefit of a Worthy Cause, there were many Schemes to induce
                        Visitors to let go of their Assets. One of the most likely Grafts
                        perpetrated by the astute Management was a Voting Contest to Determine who
                        was the Most Beautiful and Popular Young Lady in the City. It cost Ten Cents
                        to cast one Vote. The Winner of the Contest was to receive a beautiful Vase,
                        with Roses on it.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2418-177" n="178"/>
                    <p>A prominent Young Lawyer, who was Eloquent, Good Looking, and a Leader in
                        Society, had been selected to make the Presentation Speech after the Votes
                        had been counted.</p>
                    <p>In a little while the Contest had narrowed down until it was Evident that
                        either the Brewer's Daughter or the Contractor's Daughter was the Most
                        Beautiful and Popular Young Lady in the City. The Brewer and his Friends
                        pushed Ten Dollar Bills into the Ballot Box, while the Contractor, just
                        before the Polls closed, slipped in a Check for One Hundred Dollars.</p>
                    <p>When the Votes were counted, the Management of the Bazaar was pleased to
                        learn that the Sixty-Cent Vase had Netted over Seven Hundred Dollars. It was
                        Announced that the Contractor's <pb id="VAA2418-178" n="[179]"/>

                        Cents more Beautiful and Popular than the Brewer's Daughter.</p>
                    <p>Thereupon the Committee requested that the Eloquent Young Lawyer step to the
                        Rostrum and make the Presentation Speech. There was no Response; the Young
                        Lawyer had Disappeared.</p>
                    <p>One of the Members of the Committee started on a Search for him, and found

                    <head>THE FABLE OF THE TWO MANDOLIN PLAYERS AND THE WILLING PERFORMER</head>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">A</hi> VERY attractive Debutante knew two Young Men who called
                        on her every Thursday Evening, and brought their Mandolins along.</p>
                    <p>They were Conventional Young Men, of the Kind that you see wearing Spring
                        Overcoats in the Clothing Advertisements. One was named Fred, and the other
                        was Eustace.</p>
                    <p>The Mothers of the Neighborhood often remarked, "What Perfect Manners Fred
                        and Eustace have!" Merely as an aside it may be added that <pb
                            id="VAA2418-181" n="182"/> Fred and Eustace were more Popular with the
                        Mothers than they were with the Younger Set, although no onc could say a
                        Word against either of them. Only it was rumored in Keen Society that they
                        didn't Belong. The Fact that they went Calling in a Crowd, and took their
                        Mandolins along, may give the Acute Reader some Idea of the Life that Fred
                        and Eustace held out to the Young Women of their Acquaintance.</p>
                    <p>The Debutante's name was Myrtle. Her Parents were very Watchful, and did not
                        encourage her to receive Callers, except such as were known to be Exemplary
                        Young Men. Fred and Eustace were a few of those who escaped the Black List.
                        Myrtle always appeared to be glad to see them, and they regarded her as a
                        Darned Swell Girl.</p>

                    <p>Fred's Cousin came from St. Paul on a Visit; and one Day, in the Street, he
                        saw Myrtle, and noticed that Fred tipped his Hat, and gave her a Stage
                        Smile.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, Queen of Sheba!" exclaimed the Cousin from St. Paul, whose name was Gus,
                        as he stood stock still, and watched Myrtle's Reversible Plaid disappear
                        around a Corner. "She's a Bird. Do you know her well?"</p>
                    <p>"I know her Quite Well," replied Fred, coldly. "She is a Charming Girl."</p>
                    <p>"She is all of that. You're a great Describer. And now what Night are you
                        going to take me around to Call on her?"</p>
                    <p>Fred very naturally Hemmed and Hawed. It must be remembered that Myrtle was a
                        member of an Excellent <pb id="VAA2418-184" n="185"/> Family, and had been
                        schooled in the Proprieties, and it was not to be supposed that she would
                        crave the Society of slangy old Gus, who had an abounding Nerve, and
                        furthermore was as Fresh as the Mountain Air.</p>
                    <p>He was the Kind of Fellow who would see a Girl twice, and then, upon meeting
                        her the Third Time, he would go up and straighten her Cravat for her, and
                        call her by her First Name.</p>
                    <p>Put him into a Strange Company--en route to a Picnic--and by the time the Baskets
                        were unpacked he would have a Blonde all to himself, and she would have
                        traded her Fan for his College Pin.</p>
                    <p>If a Fair-Looker on the Street happened to glance at him Hard he would run up
                        and seize her by the Hand, and <pb id="VAA2418-185" n="186"/> convince her
                        that they had Met. And he always Got Away with it, too.</p>
                    <p>In a Department Store, while waiting for the Cash Boy to come back with the
                        Change, he would find out the Girl's Name, her Favorite Flower, and where a
                        Letter would reach her.</p>
                    <p>Upon entering a Parlor Car at St. Paul he would select a Chair next to the
                        Most Promising One in Sight, and ask her if she cared to have the Shade
                        lowered.</p>
                    <p>Before the Train cleared the Yards he would have the Porter bringing a
                        Foot-Stool for the Lady.</p>
                    <p>At Hastings he would be asking her if she wanted Something to Read.</p>
                    <p>At Red Wing he would be telling her that she resembled Maxine Elliott, and
                        showing her his Watch, left to him by his Grandfather, a Prominent
                        Virginian.</p>

                    <p>At La Crosse he would be reading the Menu Card to her, and telling her how
                        different it is when you have Some One to join you in a Bite.</p>
                    <p>At Milwaukee he would go out and buy a Bouquet for her, and when they rode
                        into Chicago they would be looking out of the same Window, and he would be
                        arranging for her Baggage with the Transfer Man. After that they would be
                        Old Friends.</p>
                    <p>Now, Fred and Eustace had been at School with Gus, and they had seen his
                        Work, and they were not disposed to Introduce him into One of the most
                        Exclusive Homes in the City.</p>
                    <p>They had known Myrtle for many Years; but they did not dare to Address her by
                        her First Name, and they were Positive that if Gus attempted any of his <pb
                            id="VAA2418-188" n="189"/> usual Tactics with her she would be Offended;
                        and, naturally enough, they would be Blamed for bringing him to the
                        House.</p>
                    <p>But Gus insisted. He said he had seen Myrtle, and she Suited him from the
                        Ground up, and he proposed to have Friendly Doings with her. At last they
                        told him they would take him if he promised to Behave. Fred warned him that
                        Myrtle would frown down any Attempt to be Familiar on Short Acquaintance,
                        and Eustace said that as long as he had known Myrtle he had never Presumed
                        to be Free and Forward with her. He had simply played the Mandolin. That was
                        as Far Along as he had ever got.</p>
                    <p>Gus told them not to Worry about him. All he asked was a Start. He said <pb
                            id="VAA2418-189" n="190"/> he was a Willing Performer, but as yet he
                        never had been Disqualified for Crowding. Fred and Eustace took this to mean
                        that he would not Overplay his Attentions, so they escorted him to the
                        House.</p>
                    <p>As soon as he had been Presented, Gus showed her where to sit on the Sofa,
                        then he placed himself about Six Inches away and began to Buzz, looking her
                        straight in the Eye. He said that when he first saw her he Mistook her for
                        Miss Prentice, who was said to be the Most Beautiful Girl in St. Paul, only,
                        when he came closer, he saw that it couldn't be Miss Prentice, because Miss
                        Prentice didn't have such Lovely Hair. Then he asked her the Month of her
                        Birth and told her Fortune, thereby coming nearer to Holding her Hand <pb

                        <pb id="VAA2418-191" n="192"/> within Eight Minutes than Eustace had come in
                        a Lifetime.</p>
                    <p>"Play something, Boys," he Ordered, just as if he had paid them Money to come
                        along and make Music for him.</p>
                    <p>They unlimbered their Mandolins and began to play a Sousa March. He asked
                        Myrtle if she had seen the New Moon. She replied that she had not, so they
                        went Outside.</p>
                    <p>When Fred and Eustace finished the first Piece, Gus appeared at the open
                        Window, and asked them to play "The Georgia Camp-Meeting," which had always
                        been one of his Favorites.</p>
                    <p>So they played that, and when they had Concluded there came a Voice from the
                        Outer Darkness, and it was the Voice of Myrtle. She said: "I'll tell you
                        what to Play; play the Intermezzo."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2418-192" n="193"/>
                    <p>Fred and Eustace exchanged Glances. They began to Perceive that they had been
                        backed into a Siding. With a few Potted Palms in front of them, and two
                        Cards from the Union, they would have been just the same as a Hired
                        Orchestra.</p>
                    <p>But they played the Intermezzo and felt Peevish. Then they went to the Window
                        and looked out. Gus and Myrtle were sitting in the Hammock, which had quite
                        a Pitch toward the Center. Gus had braced himself by Holding to the back of
                        the Hammock. He did not have his Arm around Myrtle, but he had it Extended
                        in a Line parallel with her Back. What he had done wouldn't Justify a Girl
                        in saying, "Sir!" but it started a Real Scandal with Fred and Eustace. They
                        saw that the only Way to Get Even with her was to go <pb id="VAA2418-193"
                            n="194"/> Home without saying "Good Night." So they slipped out the Side
                        Door, shivering with Indignation.</p>
                    <p>After that, for several Weeks, Gus kept Myrtle so Busy that she had no Time
                        to think of considering other Candidates. He sent Books to her Mother, and
                        allowed the Old Gentleman to take Chips away from him at Poker.</p>
                    <p>They were Married in the Autumn, and Father-in-Law took Gus into the Firm,
                        saying that he had needed a good Pusher for a Long Time.</p>
                    <p>At the Wedding the two Mandolin Players were permitted to act as Ushers.</p>

                    <p>After a prolonged Experience he came to know that every Specimen of Light
                        Reading belonged to one of the following Divisions:</p>
                    <p>1. The Book that Promises well until you reach the Plot, and then you
                        Remember that you read it Summer before last.</p>
