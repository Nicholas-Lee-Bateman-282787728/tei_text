                Paul V. McNutt and the American Legion, 1919-1932
                DEAN J. KOTLOWSKI
                Paul Vories McNutt was both a towering figure in Hoosier politics during the
                    1930s and a "substantial political figure in the Roosevelt Era."1 As governor of Indiana from 1933
                    to 1937, McNutt backed the New Deal while he revamped his state's
                    government, emerging as the

                            articles on politics, the presidency, and public policy. In 2005-2006 he
                            was Paul V. McNutt Visiting Professor of History at Indiana University

                     nation's strongest and best-known
                    governor in the mid-1930s. He later served under Presidents Franklin D.
                    Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman as federal security administrator (1939-1945),
                    high commissioner to the
                            Philippines (1937-1939 and 1945-1946), chair of
                    the War Manpower Commission (1942-1945), and ambassador to the
                            Philippines (1946-1947). McNutt saw himself as a
                    successor to FDR, until the president decided to run for a third term in 1940.
                    He then sought the Democratic nomination for vice president, until Roosevelt
                    declared his preference for Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace. A
                    possible candidate for president and a viable candidate for vice president,
                    McNutt showed what was and what might have been in American politics in the
                    mid-twentieth century.2 Yet, he still lacks a scholarly
                        biography.3
                Interestingly, McNutt did not enter public life through the traditional means of
                    partisan politics. He started out as an academic and a university administrator,
                    becoming a professor of law at Indiana University (IU) in Bloomington in 1919 and then serving as dean of
                    the IU School of Law between 1925 and 1933. More importantly, it was
                    veterans' politics in general, and the American Legion in particular, that
                    launched McNutt's political career. He won election as commander of the
                    Legion's Indiana Department in 1926 and became national commander of the
                    organization two years later. At the same time, the

                     American Legion's beliefs in patriotic
                    service, anti-pacifism and anti-communism, a strong national defense, and
                    benefits for veterans coincided with those of McNutt, who became one of the most
                    charismatic figures in the organization over its first two decades.
                The topic of McNutt and the American Legion is significant in two respects. In a
                    narrow, biographical sense, McNutt's rise in the organization exemplified
                    much of his life's pattern. He succeeded at winning offices in the Legion,
                    and that raised his confidence and fueled his ambition-his most commented-on
                    character trait. He also labored hard to promote the Legion's agenda. And
                    yet, McNutt advanced beyond the organization, into the realm of electoral
                    politics. Through the Legion, he learned how to express his intentions, mobilize
                    supporters, plot strategy, and prevail at conventions. At the same time, in a
                    much larger historical sense, McNutt's experience in the Legion allows one
                    to examine the internal politics, ideology, and early years of the best known
                    veterans' organization to emerge in the U. S.
                    following the Great War.
                Involvement in the Legion proved, for McNutt, a generally positive experience.
                    Joining the organization satisfied a range of personal needs, including an
                    ideological one. McNutt's experiences reinforced his realistic views on
                    foreign and defense policy, and may have encouraged his later embrace of the
                    welfare state. Moreover, the Legion, because of its youth, organizational
                    structure, and revolving-door leadership, became a road to distinction and later
                    on to a political career. McNutt's rise in the outfit made him a state and
                    national figure just as the Grand Old Party (GOP) was beginning to decline
                    politically in both Indianapolis and
                            >Washington, D.C.
                     The Legion played a vital role in McNutt's election as
                    governor of Indiana in 1932. Yet such successes also fed
                    McNutt's belief that, having advanced swiftly in the field of
                    veterans' politics, he could do likewise in national, elected office. That
                    did not happen.
                
                    MCNUTT AND THE AMERICAN LEGION
                    Paul McNutt was, at bottom, a striving midwesterner. A native Hoosier, he was
                        blessed with a range of talents and reared in a middle-class home that
                        valued hard work, education, and success. Born in 1891, Paul was the only
                        child of John C. McNutt, a lawyer and minor state official, and Ruth Neely
                        McNutt, a homemaker. Young Paul grew up in 
                                Indianapolis and then in
                                Martinsville, a county
                        seat town about twenty-five miles south of the state capital. His parents,
                        both former teachers, instilled in him the importance of books and learning.
                        Paul was the academic 
                        
                            Paul V McNutt in uniform c. 1917. McNutt volunteered for military
                                service while still an IU undergraduate, and he trained troops for
                                artillery duty at four camps in the South.

                         standout at Martinsville High School,
                        where he excelled in art, letters, theater, journalism, and campus politics.
                        He repeated those feats, in a much larger arena, at Indiana University, from
                        which he graduated with a B.A. in English in 1913. Thereafter, Paul, like
                        many ambitious midwestern youths, headed east; he enrolled in Harvard Law
                        School and earned his L.L.B. in 1916. Paul then returned to
                                Martinsville to become a
                        partner in his father's law firm. But after living near
                                Boston , he soon tired of life in his
                        hometown. The chance to become an instructor of law at IU, in the spring of
                        1917, offered him a means of escape, albeit only a temporary one.4
                    McNutt wanted to do something grand, and when America
                        entered World War I in 1917, he seemed to get his chance. While he had shown
                        little interest in the military, his family possessed a tradition of
                        service: his maternal (and favorite) grandfather, Jacob M. Neely, had fought
                        in the Civil War as a member of the Twenty-Second Indiana Volunteers.5 Not surprising, as the IU campus mobilized following
                        the declaration of war, McNutt volunteered for service. One of the so-called
                        ninety-day wonders, he entered the Second Officers Training Camp at Fort
                        Benjamin Harrison, near Indianapolis, on August
                        27, 1917, and left camp on November 27 as a captain in the field
                            artillery.6 By war's end, he had attained the
                        rank of major. Over the course of the war, McNutt trained men for the
                        artillery, moving from one base to another. He was stationed at Camp Travis,
                        Kelly Field, and then Camp Stanley-all in Texas-before
                        moving on to Camp Jackson in South Carolina. He exuded pride in his
                        contribution, although the war ended before he saw combat overseas. Like
                        many veterans, he became a member of the Legion in 1919.7

                    The American Legion that McNutt joined, and would one day lead, began as a
                        grassroots movement whose founders were nobodyod, and everybody."8 World War I had given American soldiers a common
                        experience and a sense of fraternity toward one another, and it was almost
                        inevitable that, as veterans, they would organize.9
                        Following the end of hostilities, a group of officers led by Lt. Col.
                        Theodore Roosevelt Jr., son of the former president, met in
                                Paris in 1919 to form what became the
                        American Legion.10 These officers were a highly
                        pragmatic group, founding the Legion out of the fear that "left-wing
                        doctrines might infect the restless troops" who would later "link
                        hands with dangerous 'bolshevik' elements at home."11 That did not happen. Instead, over the next two
                        decades, Legionnaires founded twelve thousand local posts, of varying sizes,
                        in locales across America .12 Each state
                        became its own department with its own commander, while an executive
                        committee and a national commander, elected for a one-year term, oversaw the
                        Legion as a whole.13 By the eve of World War II,
                        membership had swelled to over one million, meaning that more than one in
                        four veterans of World War I had joined the organization.14 The Legion was open to all veterans of the armed forces in the
                        First World War, whether or not they had experienced combat.15 This openness was crucial for McNutt, who had remained
                        stateside during the conflict. The refrain that McNutt was "the teacher
                        who never taught, the soldier who never fought, the lawyer who never tried a
                        case," would later be hummed by political opponents but not by rivals
                        in the Legion.16

                    As an institution, the American Legion managed to look backward, sideways,
                        and ahead all at the same time. Veterans' organizations had deep roots
                        in American history. The Legion, like the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR),
                        which had been formed by Union soldiers following the Civil War, strove to
                        maintain and to promote bonds between its members. Social functions cemented
                        Legionnaires together; despite the advent of Prohibition, alcohol flowed at
                        local, state, and national meetings.17 In the long run,
                        the culture of the Legion, with its mixture of spirits, revelry, and high
                        jinks, steeled by war stories and masculine bravado, enabled men of middle
                        age to revisit their youth and to escape "the routine of everyday work
                        and the constraints of community life."18 In the
                        short run, the organization was, as an early observer writing in a southern
                        dialect noted, "a young man yit." In other words, it was populated
                        by youthful veterans who mirrored the temper and aims of the newly founded
                        Legion itself-"a good, game scrapper, ready to fight for a cause he
                        considers just."19
                    A principal cause of the American Legion, as it had been for the GAR, was to
                        secure benefits for veterans.20 In this area, the
                        Legion's greatest victory came in 1924 when, over the objections of
                        business leaders who feared inflation, and over the veto of President Calvin
                        Coolidge who was determined to balance the federal budget, Congress passed a
                        bonus for those who had served in World War I. The bonus was really a life
                        insurance policy to be paid to the heirs of each veteran upon his death, or
                        to the veteran after twenty years. Although the bonus did not foreshadow the
                        social concern and federal activism of the New Deal, it did signal a major
                        financial commitment by Congress to a specific group during a period of
                        conservative governance.21 It also underscored the
                        Legion's belief in the power of lobbying and collective action by its
                            members.22

                    The Legion ventured beyond the issue of veterans' benefits when it
                        campaigned for "100 percent Americanism."23
                        This effort operated at three levels. First, the Legion strove
                        "'to inculcate a sense of individual obligation to the community,
                        state and nation.'" It did so by promoting public remembrance of
                        patriotic sacrifice.24 Second, the Legion sought to
                        protect the 
                                United States from external enemies through a
                        program of military preparedness. Lastly, the organization wanted to
                        safeguard America "from foes within."25 To assure the loyalty of the next generation, the
                        Legion favored displaying the Stars and Stripes on all school grounds,
                        teaching upbeat interpretations of American history-not fault-finding
                        revisionism-and offering military training in high schools and colleges.
                        Overall, the American Legion pledged fealty to "God and Country"
                        and to defend the Constitution of the United States.26
                    The Legion was unable to speak of American ideals without citing the need to
                        defend them. In the shadow of the Russian Revolution, strikes at home, and
                        the Red Scare of 1919-1920 (when the U. S. attorney general deported alien
                        radicals), the Legion attempted to silence the views of people whom it
                        deemed subversive or un-American.27 The organization was
                        not opposed to freedom of speech, just "un-American free speech."
                        As Theodore Roosevelt Jr. phrased it, free speech "simply means free
                        speech within given bounds."28 Communists emerged
                        as special targets for the Legion, as did pacifists, who rejected both
                        preparedness and military education. Of the two groups, pacifists enjoyed
                        far greater popular sympathy. In the aftermath of World War I, many
                        Americans, disillusioned that their nation had not achieved its wartime aims
                        to promote democracy and a lasting peace, turned toward isolationism and
                        against war.29 The Legion tried to counter such thinking
                        by memorializing its members' past service and by attacking
                        "professional"

                         pacifists as "either secret
                        Communists or unwitting dupes" for advocating disarmament despite the
                        presence of external threats.30 In 1933, for example,
                        the "Americanism" committee of the Legion's Department of
                                Illinois denounced the social reformer and
                        pacifist Jane Addams and the well-known defense attorney Clarence Darrow as
                        communists by virtue of their association with
                        "international-pacifist-defeatist organizations."31 "There is room in this country for only one
                        'ism,'" declared National Commander Frank N. Belgrano Jr. in
                        1934. "That is Americanism."32
                    The American Legion also became a venue for veterans to distinguish
                        themselves and to be active politically. To be sure, the Legion's
                        constitution defined the organization as "absolutely
                        non-political," and it forbade local posts from endorsing candidates
                        for elected office. Nevertheless, individual members saw nothing wrong with
                        engaging in partisan activities. In 1920, Theodore Roosevelt Jr. and a few
                        other Legion founders promoted Gen. Leonard Wood for the Republican
                        Party's presidential nominee. Four years later, Roosevelt and Hanford
                        MacNider, a former national commander of the Legion, formed the Republican
                        Service League to mobilize veterans to elect Coolidge. And the list of
                        national commanders who attained high office was long. It included the
                        junior Roosevelt, who was assistant secretary of the navy under President
                        Warren G. Harding and who ran unsuccessfully for governor of
                                New
                                York in 1924; MacNider, who served as assistant
                        secretary of war under Coolidge, and later as U. S.
                        minister to Canada; and Louis A. Johnson, assistant
                        secretary of war under FDR and secretary of defense under Truman. The number

                        anything, even greater. Perhaps for that reason, National Commander O. L.
                        Bodenhamer found himself warning, in 1930: "Probably the most serious
                        offense an American Legion post, department, or national official can commit
                        against his organization is to use his office in the Legion for partisan
                        political purposes."33

                    McNutt, for his part, became attracted to the American Legion for several
                        reasons. During World War I, Paul had longed to see combat overseas and
                        lamented that the war ended before he got the chance to go "over
                        there." After the war, he kept up his soldiery ties by accepting a
                        commission in the field artillery branch of the Officers Reserve Corps,
                        where he rose to the rank of colonel. He also entered the Reserve Officers
                        Association and even led the organization's Indiana department from 1923 to 1924.
                        Veterans' activities, moreover, were part of McNutt's family
                        history: Grandfather Neely had served as assistant adjutant general of the
                        GAR and later headed that organization's Indiana branch.34 Above all,
                        McNutt became a Legionnaire because he was a joiner. A profile, published in
                        1938, described the Hoosier as "a Methodist, a Mason, an Elk, a
                        Kiwanian, a Rotarian, a dean, a professor, [and] a colonel."35
                    The Legion also had strong ties to McNutt's native state. 
                            Indiana's capital city was home to the
                        leadership of the American Legion; at the organization's first national
                        convention in 1919, Hoosiers, aligned with delegates from the South and
                        West, were able to get Indianapolis, and not 
                            Washington D.C., selected as the location
                        of the Legion's national headquarters.36 This
                        success enabled the Legion to achieve "a high degree of
                        visibility" in Indiana and its members to become
                        a "political force" within the state. "Politicians,"
                        historian James H. Madison observed, "were particularly sensitive to
                        the voting strength of Hoosier veterans."37 During
                        the 1920s, the Legion had sufficient political muscle in 
                            Indiana to secure public funding for a state
                        headquarters, a building to house the national headquarters, and a monument
                        to honor veterans of the Great War-all in Indianapolis.38
                    Did McNutt join the Legion just to advance his political aspirations? Not
                        quite. When he became a member of Bloomington's post in 1919, he had behind
                        him one unsuccessful race for county prosecutor in Indiana in 1916, and only a few thoughts about
                        running for Congress in

                         1920. He knew the pitfalls of politics,
                        having watched his father run for local and state offices with little
                        success. Moreover, both the elder and younger McNutt were ardent Democrats
                        in a Republican state during a period of GOP dominance. For Paul, a
                        political career was hardly inevitable. And yet, he had long been interested
                        in electoral contests dating back to his undergraduate days at IU.39 In the 1920s, the Indiana Legion emerged as a
                        bailiwick for young Democrats and Republicans who, shut out of leadership by
                        more senior members of the parties, used the organization as a
                        "training ground and springboard" into public office.40 "They started in organizing Legion posts and
                        learning the ethics and primary purpose of politics," Harold C.
                        Feightner, a longtime Hoosier journalist, later explained. "There
                        [were] quite a few fellows who learned their Ps and Qs through the American
                            Legion."41
                    For McNutt, the Legion was at first a refuge, and only later a launching pad
                        to statewide office. He joined the organization following World War I, when
                        his future was unsettled. In the early 1920s, McNutt began to socialize with
                        Legionnaires over card games, as he grew restless with his life as a law
                            professor.42 Then, as McNutt clarified his
                        professional goals and decided to be something more than a faculty
                        member-securing the deanship of IU's law school in 1925-he showed
                        greater interest in the Legion. Like many Hoosier veterans, McNutt thought
                        that the local post was "a place to be active."43 Only later on, during 1927 and 1928, did he consider running
                        for governor of Indiana. By that point,
                        interestingly, he was deeply involved in the politics of the American
                            Legion.44

                    Ideals as well as ambition fed McNutt's interest in the Legion. He
                        shared the Legion's core values, especially concerning patriotic
                        service. Regarding the Officers Reserve Corps, of which McNutt was a member,
                        he wrote: "I want to see it live and prosper and I intend to do
                        everything in my power to help." He saw military service as a patriotic
                        duty and exhorted IU students to join the reserves.45
                        Consistent with the national mood, however, young people seemed
                        uninterested. Early in 1926, a debate erupted at IU over military training
                        through the school's Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC). Some
                        students asserted that this training ought to be made voluntary, while
                        others wanted it to remain mandatory.46 Those favoring
                        change drew inspiration from Frederick J. Libby, a well-known pacifist
                        leader, who was on a speaking tour that included stops in Indiana.47 At the same time,
                        around 600 students petitioned to retain compulsory military training. Their
                        chief supporter was William Lowe Bryan, the university's president.48
                    The debate escalated in March 1926, after Libby addressed an IU convocation.
                        Bryan did not attend the event, and neither did McNutt.49 In a speech a few days afterward, McNutt registered his
                        disapproval of pacifism, Libby-style. He reiterated that it was the
                        "duty of every American citizen to serve this nation in time of
                        war" and that military training was "an essential and proper part
                        of an adequate national defense."50 McNutt's
                        vehemence descended into an attack that both Libby and his supporters took
                        as a personal affront.51 McNutt charged Libby with
                        agitation and peddling subversive propaganda.52 The more
                        McNutt learned about the pacifists, the more he hated them. Six months
                        later, he accused "'leaders in many of the so-called peace
                        organizations'"

                        way for the revolution.'"53
                    On the whole, the crusade against pacifists and communists helped
                        McNutt's career, even though he was espousing a less-than-popular
                        cause. The first Red Scare was a fading memory and Americans, longing for a
                        lasting peace, were unlikely to respond to calls for military training.54 The Kokomo (Indiana)
                        Dispatch chided McNutt's speeches for being out of step with the times:
                             Mr. McNutt might find more wicked foes for his
                            thrusts than those he pleases to brand as pacifists. We need more of
                            their class of clear sighted citizens of the world. As for the
                            'reds'-well, we haven't seen one for a long time, though
                            perhaps Mr. McNutt sees them lurking in Indiana
                            cornfields and briar patches.55
                         But McNutt's denunciation of pacifists strengthened his
                        relationship with President Bryan, a defender of ROTC, and more importantly,
                        his anti-pacifism and anti-communism squared with mainstream thinking in the
                            Legion.56 McNutt's ideology and rhetoric, as
                        well as his rising visibility on the stump, proved useful as he energized
                        his local post and looked to win election as commander of the Indiana
                        Legion.

                    McNutt's ascent in the Legion began locally. In Bloomington, Legionnaires had founded the
                        Burton Woolery Post No. 18, named in honor of a local boy and IU student,
                        Henry Burton Woolery, killed in

                         action near Esperance Ferme,
                                France, in 1918.57 As the
                        post set out to elect a new commander in October 1925, McNutt disclosed that
                        friends were urging him to be a candidate. Although he professed uncertainty
                        about entering the race, he allowed his devotees "to make a quiet
                        canvass" of the membership.58 Such thinly veiled
                        ambition and maneuvering would be repeated in McNutt's later campaigns.
                        And it worked. The Bloomington post had
                        endured sharp fluctuations in its membership, and McNutt-young, dynamic,
                        attractive, smart, and accomplished-appeared to be just the person to shake
                        it from its doldrums.59 Legionnaires in
                                Bloomington  were
                        "flattered" that "such a big man as the dean of the law
                        school was willing to accept the command," and they elected him their
                            leader.60
                    With the prize won, McNutt launched his recruitment drive by distributing
                        lists of veterans to each of the post's eighty-seven members. Each man
                        then "had to sell [the] Legion to as many on his list as humanely
                            possible."61 McNutt exceeded his goal of
                        recruiting 250 new members; by the end of his term, the Burton Woolery Post
                        alone had 502 members.62 The jump made
                                Bloomington the second
                        largest post in its district and the third largest in the state, and
                        McNutt's stature in the Indiana Legion rose.63
                        Clarence A. Jackson, commander of the Department of Indiana, spread word of
                        McNutt's accomplishments, and the American Legion Weekly "carried
                        stories of the feat."'64

                    The cheering boosted McNutt's confidence as he eyed a higher office:
                        commander of the Indiana Legion. The state commander was elected to a
                        one-year term in much the same way that political parties selected nominees.
                        The next convention was to be held at Marion,
                                Indiana, in August 1926. In launching his
                        campaign, McNutt sounded like a U. S. politician of the previous century,
                        bashful about seeking office and insistent that friends were pushing his
                        candidacy. "I have been strongly urged to become a candidate for State
                        Commander of the American Legion," McNutt told one associate. "I
                        have no intention of entering any general scramble for the place because I
                        feel that, at this stage of the Legion's development the office should
                        seek the man rather than the man the office." Then he added: "I am
                        willing to serve if the members of the Legion want me."65 Such false modesty seemed to confirm an old adage about
                                Indiana , that "every Hoosier baby's
                        first words are: 'Although I am not a candidate for any public office,
                        if nominated by the people of my party and elected by the sovereign voters
                        of the great State of Indiana, I will serve to the best
                        of my ability."'66 Before the Department of
                        Indiana convened, McNutt was encouraging friends to canvass on his
                            behalf.67 He even tried to sow the idea that other
                        candidates might consider withdrawing.68 When that
                        failed, he communicated with Legionnaires in the districts of his rivals in
                        order to "break off" some of their support.69
                        McNutt also prepared well for the convention, and his local post nominated
                        him for state commander.70 Such happenings, combined
                        with endorsements from other posts, left the impression that McNutt was a
                        formidable candidate indeed.71
                    McNutt was no shoe-in to head the Indiana Legion. He was, after all, an
                        academic-an "ivory tower" type, sneered more "earthy"

                         veterans.72
                        Moreover, many former enlisted men disliked having "too many former
                        officers," such as McNutt, "in prominent places in the
                            Legion."73 And Republican Legionnaires were not
                        too fond of someone who was known as an "enthusiastic
                            Democrat."74 McNutt overcame these obstacles
                        through a combination of shrewdness, hard work, and luck. He arrived early
                        in Marion and met with his
                        managers-Bloomington Legionnaires who were all Republican and thus likely to
                        remove some of the stigma of his party affiliation. On their advice, McNutt
                        addressed as many district caucuses as possible, even on short notice. Such
                        impromptu speeches frequently ended in "a roar of applause."
                        Meanwhile, McNutt's aides searched for delegates to buttonhole.75 More than a few Legionnaires found this type of overt
                        campaigning annoying and at odds with their organization's
                            practices.76 McNutt also benefited from perceived
                        flaws in his rival, Eugene O'Shaughnessy of Lawrenceburg, Indiana. On the surface, O'Shaughnessy was a
                        strong candidate, better known than McNutt and part of a circle within the
                        Indiana Legion that saw the office of state commander as "an honor to
                        be conferred, not a prize to be contested." It was, this clique
                        thought, O'Shaughnessy's turn to be commander.77 Moreover, O'Shaughnessy was a skilled organizer and had a
                        following in his native southern 
                            Indiana.78 Yet, he also was
                        Roman Catholic and the owner of a distillery.79 Members
                        of the Ku Klux Klan, who hated alcohol as much as they hated Catholics and
                        who saw the one inevitably following the other, found
                        O'Shaughnessy's candidacy offensive. Their opposition proved
                        significant. "We must admit, however distasteful to us it is," one
                        of McNutt's supporters wrote, "that there is some very strong Klan
                        sentiment in the American Legion.""80

                    That sentiment ran true in the Legion's Department of Indiana. The Klan
                        and the Legion used the same slogan-"100 percent Americanism"-and
                        shared other similarities, including followings in the Midwest and
                        memberships that included professionals, merchants, and farmers. Around
                        300,000 Hoosiers joined the Klan in the 1920s.81
                        According to some Indiana Legionnaires, between twenty and fifty percent of
                        their compatriots were Klansmen.82 Both organizations
                        were avowedly patriotic, anti-radical, and unfriendly to immigration. The
                        Klan attacked immigrants as well as Catholics, Jews, and African
                            Americans.83 The Legion, for its part, lobbied
                        Congress to restrict the flow of immigration into the United States.84 That subtle difference regarding immigration
                        underscored other differences between the two organizations. The Klan
                        asserted that white, native-born Protestants were the only loyal and true
                        Americans. The Legion, in contrast, accepted into its ranks Jews, Catholics,
                        and foreign-born citizens, as long as they had participated in the Great
                        War. It also accepted African Americans, but confined them to segregated
                        posts. In sum, military service and adherence to the nation's founding
                        principles and its constitution defined the Legion's
                        "Americanism."
                    In the race to become state commander of the Legion, McNutt publicly kept mum
                        on the Klan, although he privately denounced its activities as
                            "pernicious."85 After eight ballots, the
                        professor from Bloomington prevailed over the distiller from
                                Lawrenceburg, with a
                        final vote of 206 to 176. A "howling" crowd carried the victor to

                         served those posts with relentless
                        energy. He stepped up his speaking; during one period in 1927, he spoke
                        sixty-one times over fifty-seven days.87 McNutt juggled
                        all this and his regular duties at the law school by making addresses at
                        night, on holidays, and after his classes had let out.88
                        He traveled 40,000 miles through eighteen states during his year-long
                            term.89 Those trips allowed McNutt to make new
                        friends. Before addressing the Department of Iowa in Mason
                                City, he stayed with the parents of Hanford
                        MacNider, a past national commander.90 After hearing
                        McNutt's speech, the editor of an Iowa newspaper
                        expressed the hope that "we'll be privileged to cast a unanimous
                        vote for Paul McNutt for national commander."91
                    The Indiana Legion thrived under McNutt. He accomplished statewide what he
                        had done in Bloomington-increase the
                        organization's membership. His speechmaking played a critical role, as
                        did his prodding of local posts to fill recruitment quotas.92 During McNutt's year as state commander, membership in the
                        Indiana Legion climbed from 18,336 to 25,505.93
                        Indiana, which had ranked thirty-eighth among
                        forty-eight states in Legion membership at the close of 1926, advanced to
                        sixth by the end of 1927.94 An Indiana Legionnaire
                        praised McNutt for placing himself at "the beck and call of every
                            post."95 According to one scholar, McNutt was
                        "one of the most active and successful Legion commanders the state ever
                            had."'96

                    BECOMING NATIONAL COMMANDER
                    If McNutt was good for the Indiana Legion, the Indiana Legion was also good
                        for McNutt in three respects. First, his leadership position in the
                        organization allowed him to travel to distant places. Late in 1927, McNutt
                        ventured beyond the American heartland when he and his wife, Kathleen,
                        attended the Legion's convention in Paris
                        .97 Second, the office of state commander
                        kept McNutt out of party politics, at least for a spell. After his election,
                        McNutt brushed aside pressure from Indiana Democrats to campaign for the
                        party's candidates in 1926.98 McNutt resolved that
                        "any partisan speeches" would have "an unfortunate
                        reaction" by turning wavering Legionnaires "against our
                            candidates."99
                    Lastly, the Indiana Legion provided McNutt with political contacts, and none
                        proved more precious than that of Frank M. McHale. At the time of
                        McHale's death, in 1975, Democrats and Republicans alike lionized him
                        as a giant in Indiana politics.100 Born to Irish immigrant parents, McHale graduated from the
                        University of Michigan and became a lawyer in his hometown of
                                Logansport,
                                Indiana. He served in World War I, organized
                        an American Legion post in Cass County, and rose in the Legion's
                        Indiana Department, serving on its legislative committee from 1919 to
                            1929.101 McHale's name became linked to
                        McNutt's star during their years in the Indiana Legion. McNutt
                        solicited his support in his campaign to be state commander.102 Although in that contest McHale supported O'Shaughnessy,
                        his fellow Irish Catholic, the paths of the two men continued to cross.103 In 1927, Hoosier Legionnaires, with McNutt's
                        blessing, elected McHale as their next state commander. The outgoing
                        commander had persuaded four other candidates-all Protestants-to 
                            97Barton to National Executive Committeemen,

                    In McHale, McNutt found a friend as well as an ally. The two men shared many
                        values, including a love of party, public service, and country. McHale, like
                        McNutt, had no use for those who sat on the sidelines, thinking them either
                        "selfish" or "cowardly."105 The two
                        men complemented each other quite well. McNutt was a show horse, the
                        candidate as matinee idol, while McHale was a workhorse, the unseen
                            strategist.106

                         It was McHale, as legislative leader of
                        the Indiana Legion, who helped persuade the state legislature to build the
                        War Memorial Plaza in Indianapolis, with its
                        limestone monument to veterans of the First World War. o' Yet it was
                        McNutt, as commander of the Department of Indiana, who presided over the
                        monument's dedication.108 Between 1928 and 1940,
                        McHale's skills as a political organizer, his wisdom, and his
                        occasional misjudgments would be the exclusive property of McNutt.
                    By 1928, the post of national commander of the American Legion was beckoning
                        to the increasingly ambitious McNutt. This office was, on one level, a safe
                        one to pursue. There had been calls for McNutt to run for governor of
                                Indiana in 1928. He demurred, however, for the
                        Democrats seemed likely to nominate for president, New York Governor Alfred
                        E. Smith. McNutt concluded that, given Hoosiers' "strong
                        prejudices," the Catholic Smith would drag the Democratic ticket in
                                Indiana down to defeat.109
                        At another level, the position of national commander was a natural fit for
                        McNutt, coming on the heels of his leadership of the Department of Indiana.
                        So, he began his campaign for national commander with trademark expressions
                        of modesty and behind-the-scenes maneuvering.110 He also
                        prodded district leaders in the Indiana Legion to line up behind his
                            candidacy.111" Then, after two posts endorsed McNutt
                        for national commander, he professed: "Naturally, I cannot disregard
                        such an expression of confidence."112
                    Securing the support of the Department of Indiana marked the first phase of
                        McNutt's campaign; lining up other departments in the Midwest was its
                        second part. McNutt's public speaking in states such as
                                Illinois, Wisconsin,
                        and Nebraska, certainly helped him.113 So, too,

                         did the lobbying of subordinates:
                        McHale, for example, "did some very effective work" on his behalf
                        at the Legion's convention in Michigan."114 McHale was
                        instrumental in managing the final phase of McNutt's campaign, the
                        period leading up to the national convention in San Antonio. He and McNutt
                        had their work cut out for them. The American Legion, not unlike its Indiana
                        Department, had been run by a clique that had secured the election of the
                        two previous national commanders. In 1928, this machine rallied around the
                        candidacy of John H. Ewing of Louisiana. In
                        response, seven independent candidates emerged as challengers, including
                            McNutt.115 The array of candidates did not bode well
                        for McNutt, who was still new as a leader within Legion circles. So, as he
                        had done when seeking election as state commander, McNutt took a stab at
                        some pre-convention maneuvering, proposing to meet with two of his rivals to
                        affect a "satisfactory settlement"-to the Hoosier, no doubt.116 This effort failed, and the field remained
                            crowded.117 McNutt therefore readied for a "dog
                        fight" in San Antonio.118
                    McNutt overcame his status as an outsider and an underdog with preparation,
                        organization, tireless speaking, and sheer effort. Not unlike the
                                
                                Marion convention in 1926, McNutt and his
                        advisers arrived in San Antonio a few days
                        early to survey the landscape.119 McNutt's advisers
                        called for the candidate to replicate his feat at 
                            Marion by addressing as many delegates as
                            possible.120 In the meantime, McHale lobbied state
                        leaders. He knew that, even if McNutt did not place among the top three

                         contenders on the early ballots, the
                        Hoosier still might win later on, if he could emerge as the second choice of
                        enough delegates.121
                    McHale fired the opening salvo of the battle on October 11, when he nominated
                        McNutt. He praised the Hoosier's army service, emphasized his
                        accomplishments as state commander, and even suggested that McNutt, rather
                        than himself, had secured the requisite funds to build the memorial plaza
                        near the Legion's national headquarters.122
                        Although the press had slighted McNutt's chances, the first round of
                        balloting put him in third place with 189 votes, behind Roy Hoffman of
                                Oklahoma, who had 245 votes, and the machine
                        candidate Ewing with 231 votes. On the second ballot, McHale's
                        "second choice" strategy appeared to pay off as McNutt got 213
                        votes, which placed him behind only Ewing with 245 votes.123 At that point, Ewing realized that he had peaked and withdrew
                        from the race. On the third ballot, Ewing's home state of
                                Louisiana cast its fifteen ballots for McNutt,
                        and the delegations from the large states followed suit. Hoffman performed
                        the final act, announcing Oklahoma's seventeen votes
                        for the Hoosier and urging that the vote now be made unanimous.124 It was, whereupon the Indiana delegation "paraded" to the
                        stage, waving its banner.125 Lurking beneath the
                        celebrations, however, was something worrisome. McNutt and his followers
                        showed a nascent confidence that, having prevailed at this convention, they
                        could do likewise at other conventions. "My Hoosier supporters,"
                        McNutt told a friend, shortly after his election, "are not lacking in
                        the rudiments of political strategy."126
                
                
                    NATIONAL COMMANDER, NATIONAL FIGURE
                    As national commander of the American Legion, McNutt saw his life change
                        dramatically and permanently. He became, as one of his staunchest supporters
                        in the Legion emphasized, a "national figure."127

                         McNutt's speechmaking continued,
                        but his audiences were now larger. The raised platform on which he stood
                        allowed him to refine his thinking on topics from patriotic service to
                        veterans' benefits to national defense. On that last issue, he
                        challenged a president of the United States. In fact, it
                        was during the late 1920s and early 1930s that McNutt began to think about
                        occupying the White House himself.128
                    The office of national commander gave McNutt his largest platform yet, and he
                        made the most of it. Looking at his nation in the 1920s, he denounced the
                        freewheeling frivolity and "sordid scramble for gain."129 Who should be blamed? Not American institutions,
                        McNutt explained to one audience: "The fault lies with our
                        people," whose problem was "selfishness."130 As a former soldier, McNutt looked back fondly on the
                        "great wave of patriotic fervor" that had swept the
                                 United
                                States during the Great War and had instilled
                        in his countrymen a sense of service to a greater cause. As a Legionnaire
                        during the Roaring Twenties, he now saw a nation uninterested in
                            sacrifice.131 In response, McNutt continued to extol
                        the virtues of America, the nobility of military service, and
                        the need to fight pacifists and to fund a strong national defense.
                    These were well-worn themes in McNutt's speeches, yet two things had
                        changed by this time. First, McNutt had honed his skills and was emerging as
                        a fine speaker. His oratory drew from his years as an undergraduate at IU,
                        where he had majored in English and had acted in plays, and from his
                        training as a lawyer, where he had been taught to be mindful of the facts.
                        One Bloomington resident remembered a McNutt
                        speech as "clear, forceful, and convincing, and yet so simple and
                        direct that all could understand."132 An
                        undergraduate at IU in the 1920s recalled him as a "marvelous"
                        speaker who could "move a crowd."133 For his
                        part, 
                            128After the convention in
                                        San Antonio, one
                                man wrote that someday he expected to vote for McNutt for president
                                of the United States. Fred R. Hill to

                                author, June 29, 2006, Bloomington, Indiana.
                        
                         McNutt worked hard at drafting speeches
                        and often delivered the same address, again and again.134
                    The second change was that McNutt, as national commander, had integrated his
                        ideas into a coherent train of thought. "The burden of war," he
                        stressed in one address, "falls upon the citizen soldier." He thus
                        pressed for a vigorous policy of preparedness to ensure that soldiers had
                        proper training and modern weapons. Such a program promised to reduce
                        casualties in wartime and to ward off aggressors during peace-time.
                        "Adequate national defense is necessary to command respect,"
                        McNutt asserted. To keep America fit and ready,
                        McNutt pushed the Legion's campaign to promote civic education.
                        "We are not paid propagandists," McNutt affirmed, in reference to
                        his fellow Legionnaires, "and we have no selfish interest."135 The conflict between selfishness and service became
                        personal for him. To one graduating class, McNutt declared: "Your
                        question is what can I do, not what is to be done for me." And yet, he
                        doubted whether his listeners would perform "unselfish service" to
                                
                                America.136
                    McNutt's low regard for human nature shaped his hardheaded views on
                        foreign and defense policy. One reason he disdained pacifists was that he
                        doubted that humans possessed sufficient goodness to achieve peace. The
                        reality was that "hate, fear, lust, greed, and envy" in
                        individuals filtered up to nations and their foreign policies.137 Wary of European nations beset by hunger, bankruptcy, and
                        jealousy of the United States, McNutt foresaw the emergence
                        of aggressive dictatorships and urged necessary preparations.138 Anticipating the global crisis of the late 1930s, he asked in
                        1925: "Would you clean up a gang of thugs and murderers by sending
                        peaceful citizens, unarmed, into their midst?"139
                        As national commander, McNutt vowed to "impress upon the general public
                        the importance of making adequate provision for our national

                         security.140 To be
                        sure, he did not oppose all international commitments and collective
                        security arrangements for the  United States. As a
                        Democrat and a Wilsonian, he backed U.
                            S. entrance into the League of Nations and the
                        World Court.141 But by the latter 1920s, McNutt was not
                        campaigning for these causes to which the public was, at best,
                            indifferent.142 He held an even lower opinion of the
                        Kellogg-Briand Pact, under which fifteen nations, including the
                                U.
                                S., agreed to renounce war as an instrument of
                        national policy. McNutt dismissed the treaty as a "gesture."143 "As long as individuals break promises, so will
                        nations," he emphasized.144 In contrast to the
                        toothless Kellogg Pact, McNutt favored "any enforceable agreement"
                        to bring about peace.145
                    In McNutt's opinion, the strength of such agreements rested on
                                America having adequate stockpiles of
                        weapons. In 1929, he prodded Congress to fund a set of new navy cruisers as
                        a way of "giving substance" to the Kellogg-Briand Pact.146 He went further, attacking past disarmament efforts,
                        in particular, the Five Power Pact, a product of the Washington Naval
                        Conference of 1921 which set a ratio of 5:5:3:1.75:1.75 on the tonnage of
                        capital ships for, respectively, the United
                                States, Great Britain,
                                Japan, France, and Italy. The
                        Legion's commander insisted that this pact had forced the
                                U.
                            S. to scrap "the most modern battle fleet in
                        the world." Accordingly, when President Herbert Hoover suspended
                        construction of three out of five new cruisers authorized by Congress,
                        McNutt wired the president to protest.147 In an open

                         letter, Hoover defended his decision by
                        asserting that the "disparity" in navies stemmed from
                        "competitive building" among nations and that negotiation
                        represented the best way to reduce armaments and restore parity at sea.
                        Hoover, a small-government Republican and a Quaker, believed that more arms
                        would lead neither to security nor peace but to "burdensome
                        expenditure" at home and "suspicion, ill will and
                        misunderstanding" abroad.48
                    McNutt's exchange with Hoover was significant for several reasons.
                        First, Hoover got the better of the argument in the short term, for his
                        position was in accordance with the mindset of the American public following
                        World War I. The Akron (Ohio) Beacon
                            Journal praised the president's "proper" rebuff to
                        "Commander McNutt" and reproached the Legion for encouraging
                                America to "squander" money on
                        "military machines" which yield "nothing but death."149 McNutt's exchange with a sitting president also
                        underscored the extent to which he was now on the national stage. Reporters
                        thought that Hoover had replied to McNutt, over other critics of his naval
                        policy, because of the "straight forward manner" in which McNutt
                        had made his case and the "splendid national publicity" that his
                        statement had garnered.150
                    The debate over cruisers also revealed that McNutt was willing to seek
                        federal support for projects he deemed worthwhile. The rehabilitation of
                        veterans and the provisioning of their orphans and dependents became his pet
                        projects. McNutt vowed not to rest until "every veteran disabled in the
                        World War receives the care and award to which he is entitled."151 To that end, he pressed Congress to build more
                        veterans' hospitals and to allow additional time for veterans of World
                        War I to demonstrate any physical handicaps which stemmed from their
                        military service.152 The plight of disabled veterans
                        touched McNutt in a most personal way. He was, after all, the grandson of a
                        Civil War soldier whose

                         family had struggled unsuccessfully to
                        have his annual veteran's pension increased.153 In
                        1928, McNutt jotted a Christmas message to former soldiers at hospitals,
                        exhorting them to "be of good cheer," praising their courage, and
                        pledging to work for them "every day of the year."154 One disabled vet heard McNutt speak and came away impressed
                        that he was "on the right side" of this issue.155 Even after he left the post of national commander, McNutt
                        still thought of veterans. As the Depression set in, he favored, for
                        "moral and economic" reasons, an immediate payout of the bonus to
                        veterans of the Great War. The money was due to them for their service, and
                        its prompt dispersal promised to provide relief by pumping dollars into the
                            economy.156
                    In McNutt's speeches on behalf of disabled veterans, one can see, to
                        some extent, the origins of his later embrace of the welfare state, as
                        governor of 
                                Indiana and as a member of FDR's
                        administration. McNutt, as national commander, did not see a federal answer
                        to most problems.157 But a concern for disabled veterans
                        led him to espouse, in a general sense, measures to provide care for those
                        whom he dubbed "the unfortunate products of modern civilization."
                        In an address before the Department of Massachusetts in 1929, McNutt praised
                        the Bay State for adopting forward-looking social policies that had gone
                        "a long way" toward providing some security for its poorer
                        citizens. "The answer to the question, 'Am I my brother's
                        keeper?'" McNutt averred, "is 'Yes,' whether we
                        like it or not."158 Once again, his vision was
                        steadily widening to consider issues of national relevance.
                    As Legion commander, McNutt was able to convey his thoughts to more people
                        than ever before. While visiting New York, he
                        spoke on the

                        miles as national commander, and had completed a second, more extensive trip
                        to Europe.160 McNutt led a delegation to Paris to
                        dedicate the headquarters of the Legion's Department of France and to
                        attend the annual nine-nation congress of the Allied Veterans Federation.161 The ceremonial nature of this visit, along with the
                        unique leadership position now occupied by McNutt, enabled him to represent
                        his nation and to meet with foreign leaders, including Pope Pius XI and
                        Premier Benito Mussolini of Italy.162
                    McNutt would have been unable to travel, speak, and lead the Legion without
                        the help of a competent staff at the Legion's headquarters. At their
                        first meeting, McNutt told James E Barton, the national adjutant:
                        "'Jim, you stay here and run things and I'll go out and put
                        on the medicine show.'"163 What McNutt did, on
                        an institutional level, was to insert himself into the existing bureaucracy,
                        traditions, and agenda of the American Legion rather than reform it. Elected
                        without the support of the organization's machine, McNutt might have
                        tried to change the manner in which the Legion selected its national
                        commanders. But there is no reason to think that he did so. By 1933,
                        MacNider complained to Theodore Roosevelt Jr., a fellow former national
                        commander, that the Legion was still in the hands of a few
                        "politicos" who "dictate absolutely every job in the
                            outfit."164 To be certain, such laments-from
                        one Republican to another-reflect the fact that several Democrats, including
                        McNutt and Louis Johnson, who served as national commander from 1932 to
                        1933, were rising to leadership offices within the organization.165 Nevertheless, there was a clear pattern to
                        McNutt's leadership, for he preferred to work within the system. As

                        ethics of his state by forming a political machine of his own and by
                        utilizing an unrepentant system of patronage.166
                    Although not a reformer, McNutt was, according to most accounts, a successful
                        national commander. By the end of his term, the Legion's membership had
                        grown by over 36,000-the organization's largest annual increase since
                        1921. Meanwhile, the Legion's lobbyists, no doubt directed by Barton,
                        were able to pry some legislation from Congress, including a
                        nine-million-dollar bill to improve veterans' hospitals.167 With such accomplishments, McNutt was hailed as a credit to
                        the Legion.168 A Legionnaire from Chicago praised his "dignity,"
                        "perfect poise," and "unceasing devotion" which had
                        given the Legion its "greatest year."169 If
                        McNutt used the organization to propel himself into a political career,
                        "[H]e certainly did the Legion no harm." That was the view of C.
                        A. Jackson, a former commander of the Department of Indiana, and many
                        members nationwide agreed.170 A Legionnaire in
                                Ohio assured McNutt that his state would
                        support him "in any enterprise."171 In
                                Bloomington, Legionnaires
                        and Rotarians had an inkling of what that enterprise should be. At a meeting
                        of both organizations held in November 1929, they nominated McNutt for
                        president of the United States.172

                    McNutt's experience in the Legion proved an asset as he made the
                        transition to elected politics. Although an ardent Democrat, McNutt, through
                        the Legion, had made a number of friends in the other party.173

                         To exploit McNutt's ties to
                        veterans, the chair of Indiana's Democratic Party, R. Earl Peters,
                        invited him to deliver the keynote address at the state party convention in
                            1930.174 McNutt responded with a "rousing piece
                        of oratory" that hailed the Democracy, assailed the Grand Old Party,
                        and closed with an appeal to independent voters.175 Such
                        a plea doubtless stemmed from McNutt's service in the
                        nonpartisan/bipartisan Legion, and it had a powerful effect. Journalist
                        Harold Feightner conjectured that the typical Indiana Legionnaire saw in
                        McNutt's budding career "a cause. . . to fight for."'76
                        Many agreed. A Republican friend of McNutt's wrote to him after reading
                        his address to the state's Democrats: "Few men, Paul, are able to
                        command the respect of the opposition ... as you do."177
                    When McNutt decided to run for governor in 1932, he was uniquely positioned
                        to win. That year, the state GOP, beset by a spate of scandals and the Great
                        Depression, was riding for a fall. Early in 1932, McNutt disclosed his
                        intentions, mobilized supporters, and triumphed in the Democratic primary.
                        Crucial to his successes was his experience in the American Legion, where he
                        had learned how to announce his candidacy for an office, enlist lieutenants,
                        plot strategy, and prevail at official gatherings.178
                        Moreover, Legionnaires formed a major component of McNutt's bid to
                        become governor.179 A trio of Legion members comprised
                        the campaign's brain trust: Bowman Elder collected financial
                        contributions; Pleas Greenlee served as secretary and oversaw the formation
                        of McNutt-for-Governor Clubs; and Frank McHale managed the enterprise as a
                            whole.180
                    The campaign staff's most notable innovation was the McNutt-for-Governor
                        Clubs, which they built outside the regular party outfit to

                            179McNutt remained conscious of the need to
                                avoid involving the American Legion, as an organization, in partisan
                                politics. For that reason, he declined an offer to announce his
                                candidacy for governor in the pages of The Hoosier
                                    Legionnaire. Blake, Paul V McNutt,

                         appeal to independents and Republicans
                        as well as Democrats.181 This sensible effort
                        nevertheless irritated older Democrats. Long-serving party chieftains held a
                        bifurcated view of these newcomers from the Legion, seeing them as
                        "engines of party victory" on the one hand, and as
                        "politically ambitious veterans" who were challenging "the
                        party's established order" on the other.182
                        Claude R. Wickard, a Democrat who won election to the state senate in 1932,
                        recalled the "McNutt group" as being "younger and . . . newer
                        and . . . more liberal than the old Democratic organization which had been
                        in control in the twenties."183 In the long run,
                        the Legionnaires who had infiltrated the state party became known, somewhat
                        disdainfully, as the "boy scouts."184
                        Nevertheless, in the short run, McHale and company had the organization and
                        the votes to nominate McNutt for governor, by acclamation, at the state
                        party convention in June 1932.185
                    The pique of many senior party officials was part of a larger phenomenon: the
                        rise of veterans as a force in the 1932 elections in Indiana. During that campaign, the GOP nominated
                        for governor Raymond S. Springer, who had been the first commander of the
                        Legion's Department of Indiana. 186 Such changes
                        suggested a generational shift in Indiana
                        politics. As the campaign drew to a close, Feightner, writing in the New York Times, contrasted young guard Democrat McNutt
                        with another statewide candidate, incumbent U. S. Senator (and Majority
                        Leader) James E. Watson, a quintessential partisan wheelhorse and an old
                        guard Republican.187
                    McNutt's status as a veteran and as a former national commander of the
                        Legion gave him a star quality, and he exploited it. In fact,

                         Feightner justified his comparison of
                        McNutt with Watson, and with not Springer, on the grounds that the one-time
                        Legion commander and the current Senate leader were both "nationally
                        known figures.188 McNutt's candidacy drew wide
                        interest. The Providence (Rhode Island) Journal sent a reporter to Indiana to cover the youthful
                        dean/Legionnaire/Democrat. This correspondent observed that McNutt was
                        engaging in a new manner of campaigning by making the candidate, rather than
                        the party and its symbols, the chief attraction.189 With
                        respect to politics in Indiana, such a strategy did not
                        hurt McNutt at all, for "even earthy Hoosiers were convinced that this
                        man was above the average politician in ability."190 In November, McNutt defeated Springer by winning fifty-five

                                Indiana.191
                     With respect to national politics, McNutt's experience as a national
                        commander of the American Legion hurt rather than helped him in 1932. After
                        McNutt won his party's nomination for governor, he began to think that
                        something bigger lay ahead. The Democratic National Convention opened in
                                Chicago in June, and the field was awash
                        with candidates for the presidential nomination. According to the
                        party's rules for gaining the nomination, the frontrunner, Gov.
                        Franklin Roosevelt of New York, had to win the votes
                        of two-thirds of the convention delegates-and he was short of that number.
                        McNutt, as the leader of the Indiana
                        delegation, decided to withhold his state's support from the Roosevelt
                        campaign and then wait to see what transpired in the Windy City.192 McHale and Elder concurred with those thoughts,
                        prompting Robert E. Proctor, the leader of FDR's campaign in
                                Indiana, to ask them: "What kind of meat
                        do you fellows eat that makes you so

                         strong?"193
                        The answer, simply stated, was the Legion. Their idea was to rally behind
                        some stalking horse, deadlock the party's convention, and affect the
                        nomination of McNutt for president, in an encore of the Legion's
                        convention three years earlier.194 In the words of
                        Wickard, McHale was "planning all the time to elect Paul McNutt
                        President of the United States" and remained hopeful that
                        McNutt "would get the nomination" in 1932.195
                    Unfortunately for the McNutt forces, the Democratic National Convention was a
                        larger and more complex affair-bringing together wily, veteran
                        politicos-than a Legion gathering of young, politically minded veterans. On
                        the fourth ballot, the Texas and California delegations switched their support to
                        Roosevelt, nullifying Indiana's resistance and
                        handing FDR the presidential nomination.196 After the
                        convention, James A. Farley, Roosevelt's convention manager and chair
                        of the party's national committee during FDR's first two terms in
                        the White House, never forgot the disloyalty of McNutt, whom he assailed as
                        "the 'platinum blond' S. O. B. from Indiana."197
                        McNutt's actions, ambition, and even arrogance at the 1932 Democratic
                        National Convention stemmed from a number of different experiences and
                        character traits. Yet, it is hard to believe that memories of the Legion
                        convention three years earlier, when the Indiana
                        delegation had triumphed against all odds, did not loom large in the minds
                        of McNutt and his managers.
                
                
                    RETROSPECT
                    McNutt's experience in the American Legion shaped his governorship and
                        his later career in three respects. First, McNutt brought the symbolic
                        trappings of the Legion to the statehouse. His inauguration as governor
                        brimmed with pomp and circumstance in part because the Legion was front and
                        center, with a band from 120 different posts playing

                         in tribute to their former national
                            commander.198 Not unlike McNutt's campaign for
                        governor, the ceremony was stage-managed to spotlight the new executive and
                        to signify a shift in state politics. Former Governor James P. Goodrich, a
                        Republican, wrote of the day: "McNutt inaugurated with a lot of fuss
                        and feathers for a Democrat."199
                    Secondly, McNutt drew upon his background in the military and the American
                        Legion as he sought to calm Hoosiers and rally their spirits during the
                        Great Depression. In his inaugural address, he acknowledged an economic
                        crisis "as grim and as real as any war" and called on the
                        "unselfish service, energy, intelligence and solidarity" of
                        Hoosiers to meet the challenges ahead, as they had during the First World
                            War.200 McNutt set the pace. Although tainted by
                        machine-style tactics, his administration reorganized the state's
                        government and reformed its tax system; tightened regulation of banking and
                        of liquor; passed pensions for the aged; centralized the state's
                        control over poor relief; and worked with FDR's government to provide
                        jobs to the unemployed and Social Security for the elderly.201 Although these programs cannot be traced directly to his years
                        in the Legion, those designed to help the needy were, in a very general
                        sense, consistent with his support of veterans' aid programs. Moreover,
                        as McNutt pushed through his agenda, he continued to invoke military-style
                        analogies. Even in hard times, he once insisted, "we can order a charge
                        and can move forward with courage."202
                    Thirdly, McNutt retained the same realistic outlook on foreign affairs that
                        he had exhibited as national commander of the Legion. After McNutt left the
                        governorship in 1937, he became, at FDR's invitation, U.S. high
                        commissioner to the Philippine Islands . There, he challenged the
                        administration's policy by advocating a reappraisal of Philippine
                        independence, set to take place in 1946. Instead, McNutt favored "a
                        permanent political and economic relationship" between the
                                United

                                islands in light of possible military threat from
                                        Japan.

                        further endangering world peace."204 World War II

                         security. "One cannot quarantine a
                        land against tyranny and persecution," he wrote in 1942. "The
                        world is one. If aggression stalks the people of the earth, no land, no
                        person is immune."205 Following the war's end,
                        McNutt supported policies, such as the Marshall Plan, to contain Soviet
                        power in Europe, and military actions, such as the United Nations
                        intervention in Korea, to repel communist advances in
                            Asia.206 His own contribution to containment and to
                                America's emerging defense perimeter in
                        the Pacific came at the close of his public career. While serving as U. S.
                        ambassador to the Philippines from 1946 to 1947, McNutt
                        successfully negotiated a treaty under which the United
                            States gained access to valuable military bases in
                        its former colony.207
                    Service in the American Legion helped give McNutt the major elements of his
                        political ideology, one that would dominate the years immediately following
                        World War II. By the late 1930s and early 1940s, McNutt might be described
                        as an early cold war liberal-a proponent of the welfare/warfare state who
                        wanted to promote economic security for Americans at home and national
                        security for America abroad.208 As
                        federal security administrator in the late 1930s, he oversaw much of
                        FDR's New Deal and was able to refine his thinking on the
                        responsibility of the state to its citizens.209
                        Meanwhile, his hatred for dictatorships remained intense, as did his
                        longstanding commitment to achieving a strong national defense.210 McNutt, not unlike Truman-another former
                        Legionnaire, a staunch anti-communist, and a fellow cold war liberal-

                                the natural resources"; "The security against major
                                hazards and vicissitudes of life"; and "The security of
                                better homes." "Address of Paul V. McNutt, Governor of

                         embraced a holistic view of security,
                        whereby the federal government would protect Americans from privation,
                        subversives, and predatory dictators. The liberal tradition would evolve in
                        new directions after 1945, embracing such issues as civil rights for racial
                        minorities. But the notion of security lay at the heart of the emerging
                        postwar consensus.211 Unfortunately for McNutt, a
                        succession of events beyond his control, such as FDR's decision to seek
                        a third term, prevented him from occupying the office to which Truman
                        ascended in 1945.
                    The American Legion proved a boon to McNutt, though only to a point. The
                        organization was, in many respects, made for him. It was inclusive-of
                        veterans of World War I, whether or not they had fought-patriotic,
                        service-oriented, and anti-radical. Such values mirrored McNutt's own.
                        Also, the Legion's structure and its revolving leadership, with
                        one-year terms for both state and national commanders, opened opportunities
                        for driven men, such as McNutt, to achieve distinction and to head an
                        institution. Leadership of the Legion alone was no royal road to securing a
                        spot on a national ticket-as McNutt discovered in 1932. But through it, as
                        McNutt's experience also showed, it was possible to gain both renown
                        and nomination to a lower level office, from which one might launch a
                        political career.

                WILLIAM HEATH
                In April 1882, Hiram W. Beckwith of Danville,
                            Illinois, received an unusual package: a
                    handwritten manuscript of twenty-eight pages of foolscap sent to him by S. A.
                    Gibson, superintendent of the Kalamazoo Paper Company.1 The
                    sheets, which appeared to have been torn from a larger manuscript, were part of
                    a bundle of old paper that had been shipped for pulping from
                            Fort Wayne, Indiana, to the
                    company mills in Michigan.2 Gibson must have realized that
                    the material was of historical interest when he sent it on to Beckwith, who was
                    known for his research into the frontier history of the Northwest Territory.

                            program at Hood College in Frederick, Maryland.
                            He is the author of a book of poems, The Walking Man,
                            and two novels, The Children Bob Moses Led and Blacksnake's Path: The True Adventures of William
                                Wells. The author is grateful for a fellowship at the Newberry
                            Library in Chicago, which led to
                            many of the findings presented in the essay.
                        1Hiram W. Beckwith (1830-1903) was Abraham
                            Lincoln's law partner from 1856 to 1861 and a close personal
                            friend. He edited several volumes in the Fergus' Historical Series
                            and served from 1897 to 1902 as president of the Historical Society of
                                    Illinois.

                            Manuscript." Although the text was printed without attribution to
                            an author, an advertisement in the back of the volume suggested that the
                            piece was written by early nineteenth-century Indian agent William
                            Wells.

                     included several speeches given by various Indian chiefs at two
                    councils held in the fall of 1811 at Fort Wayne
                    and a letter dated January 25, 1812, from the great Miami war chief, Little
                    Turtle, to Gov. William Henry Harrison.3 In addition, it
                    contained a brief historical account of various battles fought by Indians and
                    whites mainly in the Northwest Territory, starting with Pontiac's Revolt in
                    1763 and concluding with the battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. Finally, and most
                    importantly, the

                     manuscript included a description of the
                    Miami Indians' manners and customs, including their vision quests,
                    courtship and marriage rituals, adoption ceremonies, methods of warfare,
                    religious beliefs, forms of entertainment, and burial practices. In 1883,
                    Beckwith's edited version of "The Fort-Wayne Manuscript" appeared
                    in volume 26 of the Fergus' Historical Series, a set of volumes primarily
                    focused on the history of the Northwest Territory and published by the Fergus
                    Printing Company of Chicago . The first part of
                    volume 26 reprinted William Henry Harrison's 1838 Aborigines
                        of the Ohio Valley; the second part was Beckwith's "The
                    Fort-Wayne Manuscript," which was itself divided into two sections: the
                    first titled "Indian Speeches at Fort Wayne" and the second, "The
                    Manners and Customs of the North-Western Indians."
                In his introduction, Beckwith claimed the unnamed author of "Manners and
                    Customs" must have been "a well-informed and candid writer. His
                    statements of facts, dates, names, etc., harmonize in the main with creditable
                    works since in print.... He must have had an intimate and long acquaintance with
                    the Indians; and the information preserved in his manuscript...is, for the most
                    part, not only new, but valuable historical matter."4
                    Beckwith did not speculate about who might have written this valuable treatise
                    on Miami culture. However, the publisher's advertisement on the
                    volume's next-to-last page explicitly stated a connection between "The
                    Manners and Customs of the North-Western Indians" and one of the most
                    important participants in Indian-white relations in territorial
                            Indiana. It stated that the material had come
                    "from MSS., supposed to be in the handwriting of Capt. William
                        Wells."5 This supposition, however, was neither
                    confirmed nor denied, leaving the authorship of "The Fort-Wayne
                    Manuscript" unknown.
                More than sixty years before Beckwith's edited document, "The
                    Fort-Wayne Manuscript," two articles titled "Indian Manners and
                    Customs" and "Indian History" had appeared in the February and
                    May 1820 issues of The Western Review & Miscellaneous

                     authorship of each article was attributed
                    to former Indian agent William Wells. The first paragraph of "Indian
                    Manners and Customs" began:  The following account
                        of the manners and customs prevalent among the North Western Indians is
                        taken from a manuscript of Mr. William Wells, who was himself long among
                        them, and who obtained from personal observation a knowledge of most of the
                        facts he communicates.  The "Indian History" simply stated
                    it was "From the Manuscript of Mr. William Wells."
                Within the 1883 "The Fort-Wayne Manuscript" the two articles are found
                    as a single essay, the aforementioned "The Manners and Customs of the
                    North-Western Indians." The basic contents of "Indian History"
                    preceded that of "Indian Manners and Customs."
                Who, then, was William Wells, whose document was first published in 1820 and then
                    rediscovered and republished in a different form in 1883?
                William Wells was born in 1770 beside Jacobs Creek in western Pennsylvania, the son of Samuel Wells and Ann Farrow
                        Wells.6 In 1779, the family flatboated down the
                        Ohio to the Falls at
                            Louisville, Kentucky, and
                    lived in various nearby stations along Beargrass Creek. Ann died shortly
                    thereafter, and Samuel was killed in the Long Run massacre in September 1781. William was
                    placed under the care of William Pope, a prominent figure in
                            Louisville. In March 1784, Wells and three
                    other boys were camping and hunting at Robert's Pond, near the Ohio River, when they were
                    captured by Indians. Wells was taken to Snake-fish Town (Kenapakomoko) on the
                        Eel River, about five
                    miles north of present-day Logansport, Indiana. Wells, now named "Wild Carrot," was
                    adopted by the village chief, "The Porcupine." The boy was adept at
                    languages and assimilated quickly. Over the next few years, like Indian boys his
                    age, he learned to become a Miami: he blacked his face and fasted,

                            fought with them in several important battles. In later years, however,
                            he became an Indian Agent for the federal government.

                     experienced a vision quest and received the name
                    "Blacksnake," became a skilled hunter and warrior, took a wife, and
                    fathered a son. It is likely he participated in Harmar's Defeat in October
                    1790, when Little Turtle's Miami and their Delaware and Shawnee allies
                    defeated Kentucky militia and the U. S. Army,
                    first on the Eel River
                    and a few days later at Kekionga. The following
                    August, Gen. James Wilkinson attacked Snake-fish Town while Wells and most of
                    the other warriors were away, taking many captives including Wells's wife
                    and son. That fall, Wells took as his new wife Little Turtle's daughter,
                    Sweet Breeze.7 During the same period,

                    Clair's Defeat, on November 4, 1791.8 During the
                    following year, Wells went to Cincinnati
                    to free his first wife and son, along with the other captives. He accompanied
                    Gen. Rufus Putnam to Vincennes, where the Indians
                    signed a treaty that secured the release of the prisoners.9

                On a previous trip to Vincennes to sell furs, Wells
                    had come to the attention of the fort's commandant, leading to his brothers
                    Carty and Sam making contact with him at Snake-fish Town. Sam urged Wells to
                    come to see him in Kentucky; Wells visited but then
                    decided to return to his Miami family. Eventually Sam was able to convince him
                    to switch sides and offer his service to Putnam, who, following the treaty,
                    hired Wells to work for the United States. He left his
                    first Indian wife and his son with the Miami, taking with him Sweet Breeze and
                    their children. Wells went on several dangerous spying missions to Indian
                    councils in 1792 and 1793 before becoming head scout for Gen. Anthony Wayne. He
                    recruited an elite group of men, many of whom had lived among the Indians. They
                    ably performed their scouting missions, took prisoners for interrogation, and
                    made sure Wayne's army was not ambushed and destroyed as Harmar's and
                    St. Clair's had been. Shot in the wrist on one daring exploit, Wells ceased
                    his spying activities shortly before the decisive battle of Fallen Timbers on
                    August 20, 1794; however, he was still able to offer Wayne crucial strategic
                        advice.10 The following year Wells served as the
                    translator between Little Turtle and Wayne at the Treaty of
                            Greenville, which ceded all but the northwest
                    corner of 
                            Ohio to the settlers.11 During
                    these negotiations, and again later when Wells took a delegation of Indians to
                            Philadelphia to meet with President George
                    Washington, various Miami chiefs expressed the wish that Wells might become
                    their agent. For much of the rest of his life, Wells served as general advocate,
                    Indian agent, assistant agent, and translator for the Miami at
                            Fort Wayne. His career was controversial; he
                    offended many people and made numerous enemies, several of them in high places.
                    Although he was the agent to the Miami Nation, he clearly favored the Little
                    Turtle faction, and this caused many resentments. He and Little Turtle wanted

                                Greene Ville in 1795, culminating in the signing of the Treaty of
                                Greene Ville by General Anthony Wayne and the Indian chiefs of the
                                Old Northwest (1945; Dayton,

                     the Indians to learn to farm under their
                    leadership, which led to disagreements with the Quakers who directed the
                    government-funded program.12 In addition, John Johnson, the
                            Fort Wayne factor, accused him of various
                    nefarious schemes. It was Johnson who reported that Wells had gone on the
                    warpath as a young man with the Miami and used his white skin to lure flatboats
                    to the Indian side of the Ohio
                        River where they could be ambushed. He also said that Wells had
                    boasted about how many soldiers he had killed at St. Clair's Defeat.13 Since the Quakers were not having much success teaching
                    the Miami men to farm, they blamed Wells's complaints about the program for
                    its failure. At the same time the Shawnee Prophet began his campaign to get
                    Indians to return to their old ways, while his brother Tecumseh planned a
                    pan-Indian resistance to American incursions. Wells warned the secretary of war
                    of these developments on July 14, 1807, stating that the followers of the
                    Prophet were "religiously mad.14 His dire predictions,
                    along with accusations of corruption, further alienated him from his superiors
                    in  Washington, D.C. In
                    March 1809, Wells was fired as Indian agent.15
                Over the next three years Wells tried to regain his old position, but most of his
                    efforts proved futile. Wells found himself trapped between Tecumseh's
                    militant resistance and Gov. William Henry Harrison's insatiable greed for
                    more land concessions from the Indians. Wells cooperated

                     with Harrison on several treaties, gaining
                    government support for Little Turtle but alienating groups of Indians in the
                    process. He found himself hated by many of the warriors and distrusted by the
                    government, having pledged himself to serve policies he questioned.16 He stood on a shrinking middle ground, torn by
                    conflicting emotions, vacillating between either protecting the rights of the
                    long-suffering Indians or supporting the land-hunger of the rapidly advancing
                    settlers. As the Indian-white crisis deepened, Wells felt that his counsel was
                    increasingly ignored. Despite his frustration, Wells helped organize the
                    councils held in Fort Wayne in the fall of
                    1811. The transcripts show him working for peace and contain testaments to his
                    usefulness, such as Potawatomi chief Five Medals's statement: "Father,
                    if you should want to say anything to us, speak to us through our old friend,
                    Capt. William Wells, in whom we all have entire confidence, and then your words
                    will be attended to immediately.17
                At about this time, Wells must have begun to write down his memories of Indian
                    battles and the manners and customs of the Miami. After his death in the 1812
                    Fort Dearborn massacre, portions of Wells's writing were obtained by
                    William Gibbes Hunt, editor of The Western Review and Miscellaneous Magazine,
                    who, in 1820, published the material in two parts.18 Hunt
                    defended the accuracy of the first essay, "Indian Manners and
                    Customs," with an editorial paragraph (see page 161) in which he stated
                    that the account was "taken from a manuscript of Mr. William Wells...who
                    obtained from personal observation a knowledge of most of the facts he
                        communicates."19 The second, entitled "Indian
                    History. From the Manuscript of Mr. William Wells." presents a brief
                    history of the major Indian battles fought from Pontiac's Revolt (called
                    "Pantaock" in the essay) to the battle of Fallen Timbers. The

                                    Kentucky, in 1815, and in 1819 began
                            publishing The Western Review, which was closely
                            associated with Transylvania University and its celebrated polymath
                            professor Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, whose essay on "Fishes of
                            the River Ohio" is alternated with Wells's "Indian
                            Manners and Customs." Although the Western Review
                            lasted only two years, it "stands out as the best thing of its time

                     unembellished language, its uncorrected
                    grammatical and spelling errors, and its general air of authority appears to me
                    to confirm Hunt's attribution to Wells. Even the author's disavowal of
                    firsthand knowledge of certain events ("My knowledge of the actions that
                    were fought between [the Indians and the French and British] is derived from the
                    old Indians whom I have conversed with on that subject, and is perhaps not to be
                    depended on") suggests the perspective of a close observer such as
                        Wells.20
                While Hunt expressed no doubts about the manuscript's authenticity, he did
                    not state how he had acquired it. One possible clue appears in a footnote
                    included in an essay entitled "Harmar's Expedition," which
                    appeared in the April 1820 issue of Hunt's magazine, between the
                    publication dates of the two Wells pieces. The essay's author, known only
                    as "G," acknowledges receiving information from Wells, "who was
                    with the Indians at the time."21 If "G" had
                    been in direct contact with Wells before the latter's death, perhaps he was
                    the person who passed Wells's manuscript on to Hunt.
                Wells may have intended for his writings to form part of an autobiography.
                    Certainly he had a fascinating story to tell, and Hunt implied that the essays
                    had been drawn from a larger manuscript. John D. Hunter's captivity
                    narrative, published in 1823, combined an account of the "Manners and
                    Customs of Several Indian Tribes" along with the "Life of the
                        Author."22 Perhaps Wells had a similar plan in mind
                    for his manuscript. Except for a year or so of schooling in
                            Louisville before his capture, Wells was
                    self-taught. He had a gift for languages, however, and was capable of recording
                    the story of his remarkable life. Wells was a significant participant in major
                    events of his time and place, and he had the rare ability to see both the Indian
                    and white sides of issues. On the other hand, Wells's untimely death may
                    have robbed him of the chance to write a full account of his adventures.23

                And yet, as the advertisement in the back of the Fergus' Historical Series
                    volume 26 suggests, more of Wells's work may have survived than historians
                    have generally acknowledged. In spite of claims contained in Hunt's 1820
                    paragraph and in the 1883 advertisement, few historians of the period have made
                    significant use of the documents contained within "The Fort-Wayne
                    Manuscript"; none have linked its "The Manners and Customs of the
                    North-Western Indians" to Wells. The most recent study of Miami history and
                    culture, Stewart Rafert's The Miami Indians of Indiana,
                    makes no mention of Beckwith's 1883 work, although Rafert briefly refers to
                    Wells three times and makes extensive use of another reliable account from this
                    period, Meearmeear Traditions, compiled by C. C. Trowbridge
                    for Gov. Lewis Cass in 1825.24 Harvey Lewis Carter's
                    1987 book The Life and Times of Little Turtle, the standard
                    biography of the Miami chief and his son-in-law William Wells, also overlooks
                    "The Fort-Wayne Manuscript."25
                On the other hand, Carter does cite a source entitled "A discription of the
                    Emigration, Habits, &c. of the N. Western Indians, As Received from the Most
                    Intelligent and Ancient Indians"-written in 1817 by an author who called
                    himself William Turner of Wellsington-which includes a number of details to be
                    found (albeit with different wording) in the Western Review
                    articles of 1820.26 Further, the typescript of Turner's
                    manuscript, held at the Newberry Library in Chicago, is
                    similar to, but not exactly the same as, "The Fort-Wayne Manuscript."
                    The three sources are almost certainly related to one another. Who then was
                    William Turner, and what was the relation of his 1817 work, either to the 1820
                    articles or to the later Fort Wayne Manuscript?
                In 1810, William Turner arrived at Fort Wayne as a surgeon's mate. During
                    the Indian councils of September 11 and October 2, 1811, he

                     served as a witness and made a faithful
                    transcription of Wells's translation of the Indian speeches at the council
                    as they were given. The year after Wells was killed, Turner resigned his
                    commission and began a campaign to obtain Wells's old job as Indian agent
                    for the Miami at Fort Wayne. In 1815, Turner
                    married Wells's and Sweet Breeze's daughter, Anne. He began to style
                    himself William Turner of Wellsington, after the formal name given to
                    Wells's extensive land holdings in Fort Wayne.
                    In letters to her sister, Anne expressed dissatisfaction with her life,
                    lamenting Turner's frequent absences, his excessive spending, and his
                    drinking. Despite his shortcomings, Turner managed to be named secretary to the
                    Treaty of St. Mary's in 1818, and shortly thereafter he was finally
                    appointed Indian agent for the Miami. However, this long-sought position was
                    short-lived; in 1820 he was fired for "unsatisfactory conduct" and he
                    died in 1821, no doubt as a direct result of his heavy drinking.27 Like many frontiersmen of his time, Turner was a man on the make,
                    determined to get what he wanted by whatever means necessary. He did possess
                    some degree of knowledge about Miami life and customs, through his work with
                    Wells.
                Based on my study of the documents, I believe that, following his marriage to
                    Anne Wells in 1815, William Turner came into possession of a copy of the Wells
                    manuscript from which the 1820 Western Review articles were drawn. In 1817,
                    probably in order to enhance his qualifications as Indian agent, he claimed
                    authorship for himself, revising phrasing, correcting diction, and changing
                    details. Then, some time between 1817 and his own death in 1821, Turner
                    apparently made a few further revisions in the manuscript, which was finally
                    published anonymously as "The Fort-Wayne Manuscript" in 1883.28
                In the pages that follow, I have reproduced the first printed versions (1820) of
                    "Indian Manners and Customs" and "Indian History,"

                            has information on William Wells's children, including
                            Turner's marriage to Anne, 40-63. Much information about the family
                            can be found in the Wells Family Papers File, Fort Wayne Historical
                            Society, and the Wolcott Family Files, the Wolcott House Museum Complex,

                        28A comparison of the handwritten versions of the
                            Turner manuscript and the FWM yields inconclusive results. In my amateur
                            opinion, the calligraphy is similar but not exactly the same; and
                            neither provides a perfect match with Wells's letters to the
                            secretary of war, circa 1812. The essential issue, of course, is to
                            establish that Wells was the author of the original manuscript published
                            in The Western Review.
                    
                     since they appear to present Wells's
                    authentic work and voice, supplementing those texts with certain selected
                    historically significant paragraphs from the Turner manuscript of 1817 (within {
                    } marks) and "The Fort-Wayne Manuscript" of 1883 (within [ ] marks). I
                    have also inserted explanatory footnotes for clarification.
                Reading these materials together, and at least tentatively ascribing to Wells
                    their common origin, improves our understanding of Indian-white relations in
                    early Indiana in several ways. The first part of
                    Wells's account is illuminating in relation to Indian battles, especially
                    those of the 1790s in which Wells participated; the second part on "Manners
                    and Customs" richly supplements Trowbridge's seminal document by
                    providing first-hand observations of how the Miami lived in the late eighteenth
                    and very early nineteenth centuries. Wells's knowledge was based on his
                    life among them from 1784 to 1792, as well as on his subsequent twenty years of
                    service mainly at Fort Wayne. Trowbridge's
                    account relied almost exclusively on his interviews with two elderly chiefs, Le
                    Gros and Jean Baptiste Richardville (Peshewa, "The Wildcat"), during
                    the winter of 1824-25. Therefore, when the two accounts are in conflict,
                    Wells's statements might be more reliable than those found in Trowbridge,
                    since the Miami were clearly suffering considerable dissolution at the time of
                    his interviews and his informants were very old. Le Gros, for example, says that
                    nowadays "children abuse their parents and very often when intoxicated,
                    beat them," and "now nothing is more common, particularly when they
                    are drunk, to abuse & sometimes beat their wives."29 On the other hand, Meearmeear Traditions has much more information
                    on women than does Wells's account; it includes detail on the role of women
                    chiefs, females going on the warpath, mourning rituals, adoption ceremonies, the
                    naming of children, courtship rituals and marriage practices, women's work,
                    as well as the men known as "White Faces," who assumed the roles of
                    women-all material covered only sketchily by Wells.30
                    Obviously, the advantage of a amalgamated version of the "Indian Manners
                    and Customs" section of "The Fort-Wayne Manuscript," is that
                    scholars of the period now have two invaluable sources to consult when they
                    study Miami history and culture during this fascinating period.

                    From the Manuscript of Mr. William Wells.31
                    The French was the first nation of white people that ever was known among the
                        north western Indians. When the British and French commenced a war against
                        each other in North America, the north western Indians joined the French,
                        and several of the six nations joined the British.32 My
                        knowledge of the actions that were fought between them is derived from the
                        old Indians whom I have conversed with on that subject, and is perhaps not
                        to be depended on.
                    After the British got possession of this country from the French, a Tawway
                        chief, by the name of Pantaock,33 renewed the war
                        against them, and took in one day all the posts that were occupied by them
                        on the Lakes and their waters, Detroit excepted, by stratagem. After this,
                        in 1774, the war broke out between the north western Indians and the Whites.
                        The principal action that was fought between the parties was at the mouth of
                        the great Kanhaway.34 There were three hundred Shawanees
                        and Delawares, and a few Miamies, Wyandots, and Mingoes, commanded by the
                        celebrated Shawanee chief, called Comstock. This was the war which ended at
                        the treaty of Greenville.35 Although, at different
                        times, individual nations of Indians would treat, or pretend to do so, with
                        the Americans, it was only a temporary thing, for it frequently happened,
                        while a party of Indians was treating with the whites, that

                                largely a response to Indian resentment that their principle

                            34Lord Dunmore's War of 1774 had its
                                origins in the cold-blooded killing of Chief Logan's relatives
                                near Mingo's Bottom on the Ohio River. In retaliation,
                                Logan's men raided the settlers in the area. At the battle of
                                Point Pleasant, October 10, 1774, the Shawnee chief, Cornstalk, was
                                heard urging his warriors to "Be strong! Be strong!" This
                                hard-fought struggle, which lasted much of the day, was decisive in
                                terms of the settlement of Kentucky. The site of the battle is near

                                summer of 1795. Wells apparently saw the war for the West as a
                                sustained twenty-year struggle, which, following a period of peace,
                                was then renewed by Tecumseh.

                        killing those with whom their chiefs were treating.36
                    The Indians, who opposed general Sullivan [in 1799], were the combined forces
                        of the Six Nations. Their numbers, and by whom they were commanded, I do not
                            know.37 The Indians that defeated general Crawford
                        at Sandusky were the Wyandots, Delawares, and Shawanees, and a few of the
                        Six Nations or Senecas, Potawatamies, and Ottoways, said to be eight hundred
                        in number.38 I never heard who commanded them. As the
                        Indians always keep the number of their killed and wounded as much secret as
                        possible I shall not undertake to say what number fell in either of the
                        actions above mentioned.
                    Bowman's campaign was against the Shawanees on the Little Miami
                        river. I am not acquainted with any of the particulars of the
                        action that took place between him and the Indians.39 My
                        knowledge also of the different campaigns carried on against the Shawanees
                        on Mad River and Big Miami by general Clark is not to be depended on.40
                    
                        36The Treaty of Paris, September 3, 1783,
                            considered the Indian allies of the British as defeated peoples,
                            although no chiefs were consulted or present. When they learned the
                            terms, the Indians of the Midwest took great offense. A series of
                            treaties relating to land along the Ohio River at Forts Stanwix (1784),
                            McIntosh (1785), Finney (1786), and Harmar (1789) were signed by peace
                            chiefs who often did not speak for the warriors; the Miami did not sign
                            any of the treaties. They did agree to a treaty with General Putnam at
                                    Vincennes in 1792,
                            which recognized the right of individual Indian nations to sell or not
                            sell their lands, but it was rejected by the United States
                            Senate.
                        37The campaign of Gen. John Sullivan of
                                    New Hampshire in the
                            summer of 1779 mainly attacked the Cayuga and Seneca along the Chemung and Genesee Rivers.
                            Captain John Butler of the British Indian Department and Chief Joseph
                            Brant tried to ambush the Americans and fought several skirmishes with
                            them, but in their relentless campaign the Americans burned every
                            village they could find and destroyed a huge quantity of Indian corn.
                            This was a severe blow to the Six Nations, who had for some two hundred
                            years often controlled the balance of power between British and French
                            settlers in the Northeast. Colin C. Calloway, The American

                            attacked Blackfishs village, Old Chillicothe, on May 29, 1779. The
                            Shawnee chief was mortally wounded in the battle; the Americans lost ten
                            men.

                                River. In November 1782, Clarks Kentuckians attacked and

                    When general Harmer arrived at the Miami town he sent Colonel Hardin in
                        search of the Indians with a body of men.41 When he met
                        three hundred Miamies on the head of Eel River, commanded by the celebrated Miami
                        Chief, Little Turtle, an action took place, the whites were defeated, and
                        the Indians had one man killed and two wounded. The Indians that fought the
                        troops under the command of colonel Hardin, in the Miami town, were the
                        three hundred above mentioned, and commanded by the same chief, also a body
                        of five hundred Indians, composed of Shawanees, Delawares, Chippeways,
                        Potawatamies, and Ottoways. The Shawanees were commanded by their own chief,
                        Blue Jacket, the Delawares by Buckingeheles, and the Ottoways and Chippeways
                        by Agashewah, an Ottoway chief. The Indians say they had fifteen killed and
                        twenty five wounded.42 General Scott's Campaign was
                        against the Weas Town on the Wabash,43 where he met with little or no
                        opposition, as the warriors of the Weas expected that he was going against
                        the Miami Town, and had all left their own village to meet him at that
                        place. Eight men and two women were killed by the troops under general
                        Scott. The number of women and children, taken prisoner by him at the Weas,
                        I do not remember.
                    General Wilkinson's campaign was against the Eel River town, where there were but a few
                        women and children, ten old men, and three young ones who made no defence;
                        four men and one woman were killed, the number of women and children taken
                        not recollected.44 In the 
                            41Wells's account of Harmar's
                                Defeat, October 19-22, 1790, is especially valuable; he probably had
                                firsthand knowledge of what happened. When General Harmar and over
                                1,000 men arrived at Kekionga on October 18, they found the
                                extensive Miami settlement abandoned and the log buildings on fire.
                                Assuming that the Indians had fled, on the next day John Hardin led
                                150 Kentucky militia and 50 regulars
                                toward the Eel
                                    River in search of stragglers; instead they were
                                ambushed by Little Turtle, whose small village was nearby, and lost
                                about 60 men. Three days later Harmar stopped his homeward march to
                                send 400 men to attack the Indians who had returned to
                                        Kekionga, but he
                                was outsmarted once again by Little Turtle, reinforced by Blue
                                Jacket's Shawnee and Buckongahelas's Delaware warriors. In
                                this even larger defeat Harmar lost at least another 120 men.
                                Wells's account reaffirms that Little Turtle was a master at
                                improvising on the spot. Sword, Washington's

                            42Turner's account expands the Indian
                                casualties to 25 killed and 50 wounded.
                            43On June 1, 1791, Gen. Charles Scott and his
                                Kentuckians attacked Ouiatenon, the main Wea town near present-day
                                        Lafayette,
                                        Indiana, and the Kickapoo
                                village on the opposite bank of the Wabash. They killed about 40
                                Indians in all and took over 100 women and children captive.
                            44On August 7, 1791, a Kentucky force led by the notorious
                                Gen. James Wilkinson attacked Kenapakomoko (Snake-fish Town) where
                                Wells was brought as a captive in 1784 and adopted.
                        
                         autumn of 1790, an army of Indians,
                        composed of Miamies, Delawares, Shawanees, and a few Potawatamies, three
                        hundred in number, commanded by Little Turtle, attacked
                        Dunlap's Station, on the Big Miami
                            River. This post was commanded by lieutenant Kingsbury.45 The Indians had ten killed and the same number
                        wounded.
                    There were eleven hundred and thirty three Indians in the army which defeated
                        general St. Clair in 1791. The number of different tribes is not
                        recollected. Among them were Miamies, Potawatamies, Ottoways, Chippeways,
                        Wyandots, Delawares, Shawanees, and a few Mingoes and Cherokees.46 Each nation was commanded by its own Chief, and the
                        Chiefs appeared to be all governed by Little Turtle, who
                        made the arrangements for the action, and commenced the attack with the
                        Miamies under his immediate command. They had thirty killed, and, it is
                        believed, fifty wounded.47
                    In the autumn of 1792, an army of three hundred Indians, under the command of
                            Little Turtle, composed of Miamies, Delawares,
                        Shawanees, and a few Potawatamies, attacked colonel John Adair under the
                        walls of fort St. Clair, where they had two men killed.48
                    On the 30th of June 1794, an army of Indians, composed of 
                            45Dunlap's Station was a ten-cabin
                                settlement defended by a low palisade and blockhouses. Lt. Jacob
                                Kingsbury commanded fewer than forty able-bodied men. On January 8,
                                1791, the Indians captured Abner Hunt, but failed to set the station
                                on fire with flaming arrows. After a siege of some twenty-four hours
                                the warriors tortured Hunt to death and left. Whether Little Turtle
                                or Blue Jacket or someone else was the commander during this failure
                                to take such a small fort is in dispute. Sugden, Blue
                                    Jacket, 110-111.
                            46The site of St. Clair's Defeat is
                                present-day Fort Recovery,
                                        Ohio. St. Clair's force camped
                                for the night, mistakenly thinking they were a day's march away
                                from Kekionga. Wells
                                participated in the battle; his sharpshooters concentrated on
                                killing the army's artillerymen. At dawn on November 4, 1791,
                                Little Turtle attacked the Kentucky militia, who fled in panic into
                                the main camp, causing general confusion. The rest of the Indians,
                                led by their war chiefs, attacked from all sides, throwing back
                                various counterattacks before overrunning the American position.
                                Remnants of St. Clair's men broke through a thin place in the
                                Indian encirclement and retreated pell-mell to Fort Washington in
                                        Cincinnati.
                                Official casualties were 632 killed and 264 wounded, which
                                represented two-thirds of St. Clair's more than 1,000 regulars
                                and 200 militia. An estimated 100 wagon men and female camp
                                followers were also killed. Sword, Washington's

                            47Turner expands this figure to 40 killed and
                                75 wounded.
                            48On November 6, 1792, Col. John Adair and
                                about 100 men were ambushed near Fort St. Clair; most of Adairs men
                                fled back to the fort, and Little Turtle's men captured over
                                150 horses. Six soldiers were killed, including Col. Richard Taylor,
                                father of Zachary Taylor. Years later Little Turtle met Adair in
                                        Frankfort,
                                        Kentucky, and jokingly
                                reminded him, "A good general is never taken by surprise."

                         Ottoways, Chippeways, Miamies,
                        Wyandots, Pottowatamies, Shawanees, and Delawares, with a number of French
                        and other white men in the British interest, attacked Fort
                                Recovery.49 The Indians
                        were commanded by the Bear Chief, an Ottoway. The white men attached to the
                        Indian army, it is said, were commanded by Elliott and M'Kee, both
                        British officers: the garrison was commanded by captain Gibson of the fourth
                            sublegion.50 The Indians have told me repeatedly
                        that they had between forty and fifty killed, and upwards of one hundred
                        wounded, a number of whom died. This was the severest blow I ever knew the
                        Indians to receive from the whites. The Indians that fought general Wayne on
                        the 20th of August were an army of eight hundred, made up of Wyandots,
                        Chippeways, Ottoways, Delawares, Shawanees, Miamies, and Potawatamies, with
                        a number of white traders from Detroit.
                        The Indians were governed by British influence, and had no commander of
                        their own; consequently they made but little resistance. It is said they had
                        twenty killed and fifteen wounded.51 This battle was
                        what may be called the finishing blow, as no action of consequence has taken
                        place between the whites and Indians since that time.
                    The Indians that fought the troops under the command of Governor Harrison, on
                        the 7th of November, 1811, were composed of Shawanoes, Puttawatamies,
                        Kickapoos, Wyndbagoes, Taways, and a few Muscoes, amounting in all to one
                        hundred and fifty, agreeable to the most correct information that could be
                        procured from the Indians that 
                            49Following their victory of November 4, 1791,
                                the Indians hid the cannon they had captured nearby. When Wells
                                switched sides and became a scout for General Wayne, he pointed out
                                where several of the cannon were hidden; these became a crucial part
                                of the defenses of Fort
                                        Recovery, which was built on the
                                site of the battle and placed under the command of Capt. Alexander
                                Gibson. In spite of Little Turtle's advice to ambush only
                                wagon-supply trains traveling between American outposts, the Lake
                                Indians led by the Bear Chief of the Ottawa insisted on attacking
                                the fort on June 30, 1794, and suffered a costly defeat that
                                undercut the entire Indian effort to resist the advance of
                                Wayne's well-trained legion.
                            50Matthew Elliott and Alexander McKee, both of
                                whom were married to Shawnee women, had great influence with the
                                Indians of the Northwest Territory and encouraged them to resist the
                                Americans. Larry L. Nelson, A Man of Distinction among
                                    Them: Alexander McKee and the Ohio Frontier, 1754-1799

                            51Wells, as head spy for Wayne, played a
                                prominent role in this campaign. Blue Jacket had replaced Little
                                Turtle as the commander of the Indian force, and he made the
                                decision to place his warriors among fallen timber left by a
                                tornado. This fortified position limited the Indians' ability
                                to maneuver against Wayne's bayonet charge, and support from
                                British troops in nearby Fort
                                    Miami never materialized. Although
                                Indian losses were low, the defeat was decisive. Sugden, Blue Jacket, 172-87.
                        
                         were in the action.52 The Indians lost twenty-five men killed in the action. The
                        number of wounded has not been ascertained. This is the last action that was
                        fought between the Indians and the whites.53
                    The Indians and whites lived in peace and friendship from the treaty of
                        Greenville, which was held in 1795, until the first raising of the Shawanoe
                        Prophet, which was in 1807, from that time until the 7th November, 1811, the
                        time that the Prophet's followers fought the troops under the command
                        of Governor Harrison; that treacherous and nefarious scoundrel has been
                        fostered by the British Government, and caused a considerable number of the
                        North-Western Indians to be unfriendly toward the United States, and
                        occasionally committed depredations of murder on our Western frontiers.
                    There was not always a separate cause for each campaign of the Indians
                        against the whites.54 The war, which began in 1774,
                        caused by the ill treatment the Indians received from the whites on the
                        frontiers of the white settlements, was continued by the Indians owing to
                        the great influence the British had among them. This influence was kept up
                        by the large supplies of arms and ammunition the Indians received from the
                        British government every year. From this it is evident that if the
                                United
                                States had got possession of the posts on the
                        Lakes, which the British government agreed to deliver up to them in 1783,
                        there would have been no Indian war after that time.55
                    
                        52This paragraph appears in Turner and the FWM,
                            but not Wells's published account of 1820. The heightened rhetoric
                            and different spellings of tribal names suggest that Turner embellished
                            a sketchy account left behind by Wells, perhaps as an addendum to his
                            original manuscript. Wells was not present at Tippecanoe, but his brother Sam led
                            the Kentucky militia. The statement of 150
                            warriors involved, while lower than most estimates, is supported by some
                            Indian testimony. Sugden, Tecumseh, 231-32.
                        53When Tecumseh went south to recruit more men,
                            Harrison moved against Tippecanoe, or Prophetstown, where the Shawnee
                            Prophet held sway. Although Tecumseh had instructed his brother to avoid
                            hostilities, when Harrisons force of about 1,000 men arrived, the
                            Prophet told his men that they would be victorious if they attacked at
                            night and killed Harrison. After several hours of fierce fighting in the
                            dark, the Indians were defeated and dispersed and Harrison burned the
                            town. It is revealing of Turner's limited expertise that he made no
                            effort to update Wells's manuscript by adding information about the
                            War of 1812.
                        54This paragraph resumes the 1820 account.
                        55According to the Treaty of Paris, the British
                            were to cede their frontier forts and the Americans were to compensate
                            the Tories for their lost property. Both sides reneged on the agreement.
                            Wells, in his letters to the secretary of war, frequently cited
                            "the intrigues of British agents." For the tendency of
                            Americans to blame all their troubles with the Indians on the British,

                    INDIAN MANNERS AND CUSTOMS
                    The Miami Nation is composed of the oldest inhabitants of this country.
                        Whence they emigrated is not known. The Eel River tribe, the Weas, Piankishaws and
                        Kaskaskias, are branches or tribes of the Miami nation, and all speak one
                            language.56 The Delawares emigrated to this country
                        from the east and are called by the other Indians Elinohbah, or people from
                        the sun rise. The Shawanees came from the west or from Florida. The Wyandots, Chippewas, Ottowas,
                        Pottowatamies, and Kickapoos emigrated from the north and north west. The
                        Winnebagoes and Melomanees, who inhabit the west side of Lake Michigan,
                        emigrated from the west, the Sacks, Foxes, Jawwees, Emassalees, and
                        Nawtowessees, also from the north west.
                    Though there is a great difference in the languages of these Indians, there
                        is but little difference in their customs and manners. They are warm friends
                        and determined enemies: they will go great lengths to serve their friends,
                        and equally far to punish their enemies. The men are trained to hunting and
                        war, whilst all the menial work is left for the women.
                    Each nation is divided into villages, and each village has one or more chiefs
                        according to its size, who keep their servants in order by persuasion, as
                        arbitrary power is never used except in cases of murder. There are but few
                        chiefs whose influence extends farther than among the people of their
                        respective villages.
                    The bodies of the children, both male and female, are early inured to
                        hardships by their being compelled to fast and to bathe their bodies every
                        day in cold water. The time a child must fast is regulated by its age. Thus
                        a child of eight years old will fast half a day and one of twelve or more
                        will go without food and drink all day. The child, while it is fasting, has
                        its face blacked and is made to wash before eating. The face of the male is
                        blacked all over; that of the female on the cheeks only. The male quits this
                        practice at the age of eighteen years, and the female at the age of
                        fourteen. When the boy arrives at the age of eighteen, it is said by his
                        parents that his education is complete and that he is old enough to be a
                            
                            56Turner says, "...with a slight
                                variation speak the same language." Turner, "A
                                Discription," 39. He also identifies where the various tribes
                                are located, circa 1817, although he mistakenly places the Miami on
                                the Wabash
                                and Mississippi, when he probably means the Mississinewa River. Trowbridge in his prefatory
                                letter to Gen. Lewis Cass notes that, "the Miamies understand
                                perfectly the Kaskaskias, Peorias, Weas & Piankeshaws, because
                                these tribes have all descended from them." MT, 2.
                        
                         man. His face is then blacked for the
                        last time; he is taken a mile or two from any house, where he has a small
                        hut built for him out of bushes or weeds. After this he is addressed by his
                        father or guardian in the following words: "My son, it has pleased all
                        the great spirits that dwell above the skies and those that dwell on the
                        earth that you should live to see this day: they have all seen your conduct
                        since I first blacked your face: they know whether you have at all times
                        strictly adhered to the advice I have given you; and I hope they will reward
                        you accordingly. You must remain here until myself or some other friend
                        shall come for you." The man then returns home, takes his gun, and goes
                        hunting while his son is left five or six, and sometimes eight, days without
                        any thing to eat or drink. When the father has procured meat for a feast, he
                        invites some of his neighbours to come and partake of what he has: they
                        accompany him to where his son has been for days: the boy is then taken home
                        and bathed in cold water, his head shaved all over except a small part on
                        the top. Food is then given him which had been prepared in a separate vessel
                        for that purpose. After he has done eating, a looking glass and a bag of
                        vermillion or paint are given him.57 He is then told by
                        the company that he is a man and he is ever afterwards considered as such by
                        the people of the village. Immediately after an Indian boy's face is
                        blacked, which is at day break, he takes his bow and goes to the woods, and
                        does not return until the usual time for him to wash his face and get
                        something to eat.
                    I have frequently accompanied Indian boys when their faces were blacked and I
                        never knew a single instance of their eating or drinking while they were in
                        that situation or without the knowledge of their parents. Their minds are
                        operated on by fears: they are made to believe that if they should eat or
                        drink with their faces blacked it would be followed by immediate punishment
                        from the great spirits who watch strictly over their actions.

                        cattenenia commences, she is separated from the family, and a small hut is
                        built for her some distance from the house where her parents reside. She is

                                vision quests in less detail than Wells, but he does concur that
                                "this change of the paints is considered an important era in
                                the life of an Indian." MT, 56, 67-8.
                        
                         the menstrual discharge ceases, during
                        which time but a small quantity of nutriment is allowed, and no person is
                        permitted to visit or associate with her.
                    During this state of nature call, her provisions are prepared in a separate
                        dish at a fire made for that purpose. Her clothing and cooking utensils
                        during this time are considered unclean, and after this call of nature
                        ceases, she is directed to bathe herself in cold water; after which a sweat
                        house is prepared; she is taken into it by her mother, or some female
                        friend, and is scarafyed on her legs and arms with a sharp flint; after this
                        operation is over they conceive her system perfectly purified, she is then
                        admitted into the family as purified for association. This practice prevails
                        and is strictly adhered to by the females of all ages.
                    It is from these early habits, that the system of the Indians are prepared to
                        endure the fatigues, hardships, and inclemencies to which they are always
                        subject.
                    If a female is pregnant when traveling, and her time of parturition comes on,
                        she will at the call of nature stop at the first convenient stream or pool
                        of water, where she will be delivered; she will then wash her child in cold
                        water, and wrap it in her blanket, or any old cloths she may have: she will
                        then wash herself, and in two hours, be prepared to proceed on her journey.
                            }58
                    Polygamy is permitted among the Indians.59 A man may have
                        as many wives as he pleases, and young men are instructed by their parents
                        to get as many as they can, but by no means to involve themselves or friends
                        in any quarrels with their neighbours. The marriage ceremonies observed
                        among the Indians are of three different sorts. 1st. When the parties can
                        agree, no farther [sic] ceremony is necessary. 2nd, when a
                        young man is fond of a young woman, and she will not consent to have him
                        unless he first obtains the consent of her parents, which must be attempted
                        by a present suited to the character and condition of the girl. If the
                        present is received the marriage is completed; if it is returned, it is
                            
                            58These four paragraphs are from Turner's
                                1817 manuscript; they also appear, with variations, in the FWM. This
                                additional material is worth including because it appears to offer
                                relatively valid information about Miami female customs. Trowbridge
                                provides no comparable information on the taboos related to the
                                menstrual cycle.
                            59Trowbridge discusses courtship and marriage,
                                noting that "An Indian is allowed to have as many wives as he
                                can maintain," adding that one of his informants, Le Gros,
                                "once knew a woman to have two husbands at the same time and to
                                live with them both happily." MT,
                                41-46.
                        
                         understood that they will not consent
                        to the match. But the third mode is considered the most honorable, and most
                        binding upon the parties concerned. When an Indian has a son whom he wishes
                        to see married to some good woman, he assembles his friends and relations
                        and advises with them what woman his son shall marry. When a choice is made,
                        the relations of the young man collect what presents they think sufficient
                        for the occasion, go to the parents of the intended bride, make their wishes
                        known, leave the articles they take with them, and return without waiting
                        for an answer.
                    The relations of the girl then assemble and consult on the subject, and, if
                        they agree to the match, they collect suitable presents, dress the girl in
                        her best clothes, and take her to those who made application for the match,
                        when it is considered that the marriage is completed. If on the contrary she
                        or her friends disapprove the match, the presents from the friends of the
                        young man are returned, which is considered as a refusal.
                    When an Indian wishes to go to war, he informs one or two of his most
                        intimate friends of his intention, and asks them if they will go with him.
                        The party is then made up by their informing as many as they wish. Their
                        intentions are kept a secret from all others, as the man who is to command
                        wishes to have those only who will at all times cheerfully obey his orders.
                        The party always leaves the villages in the night secretly. When they encamp
                        the captain places the oldest in front and the youngest in the rear. The
                        former do all the hunting for the party and keep a strict watch for the
                        enemy: the latter cook, make fires, and mend the moccasons [sic] of the
                            party.60
                    Every war party has a small budget called the war budget, which contains
                        something belonging to each of the party, and representing some animal, as
                        for example a snake's skin, a buffalo's tail, a wolf's head,
                        a mink's skin, or the feathers of some extraordinary bird. This budget
                        is considered sacred, and is carried by some person chosen for that purpose,
                        who always marches in front, and leads the party to the enemy. He is never
                        passed on the march by any of the party, while he has the budget on his
                        back. When the party halts, the budget is laid on the ground in front of
                        them, and no person is permitted to pass it without orders from 
                            60Trowbridge adds that the elder men camp on
                                the south side of the fire and are called "Those who are
                                respected," while the young men sit on the opposite side and
                                are called "Those who respect." MT,
                                20.
                        
                         proper authority.61
                        No one is allowed to lay his pack on a log, nor is any one suffered to talk
                        about home or about women while the party is going towards the enemy. When a
                        four-legged animal is killed by the party, the heart is carefully preserved
                        by a person appointed for that purpose. When they encamp, a fire is built by
                        the side of the war budget, and the heart of the animal slain is cut up into
                        small pieces and burnt. The sticks intended to roast meat on are formed with
                        a slit, in which the meat is placed: the other end being sharpened for the
                        purpose of sticking them in the ground.62 No person is
                        allowed to step across the fire: every one must go round it and always in
                        the same direction with the sun.
                    When the enemy is to be attacked the war budget is opened, and each man takes
                        out his emblem and ties it to that part of his body directed by his
                        ancestors. An Indian when he attacks his enemy is generally nearly naked,
                        and his body is painted with different colours, commonly red. After the
                        action is over, each person returns his war bag to the commander of the
                        party, who wraps them all up carefully and gives the budget to the man who
                        has taken the first prisoner or scalp and he is entitled to the honor of
                        leading the party home in triumph. The war budget is then hung in front of
                        the door of the person that carried it on the march against the enemy, where
                        it is left hanging for thirty or forty days, and some one of the party sings
                        and dances near it. When the man who commanded thinks proper, he assembles
                        the party and a feast is prepared for the people of the village, who sing
                        and dance all night. Those of the party who injured the enemy most serve out
                        the feast to the people. The war budget is then opened by the man that
                        commanded, each of them takes his war bag, and the party is dissolved.
                    Every Indian has one or more of the skins or images, which are called in
                        Miami Corpennah, and which they continually worship.63 They say that when the creator formed them he gave
                        them those things, and 
                            61Turner says "a war budget is formed of
                                a leather bag." Trowbridge states that "They always march
                                in single file and never pass the carrier of the medicine bag."
                                He even cites rare instances where a female seeking to avenge the
                                death of her friends is allowed to carry the war bundle. Turner,
                                "A Discription," 51; MT, 20, 26.
                            62Turner elaborates, "The stick is
                                pealed, sharpened at one end only, it is then split half its length,
                                in which split the meat is placed and the sharp end of it stuck in
                                the ground for the meat to cook. They never cook the meat entirely
                                done on their march towards the enemy; as they conceive the more
                                blood they eat, the more heroic and vicious they will be in
                                battle." Turner, "A Discription," 52.
                            63Turner spells this word
                                "Corpenyomer"; it is also spelled that way in the
                                FWM.
                        
                         told them that if they would worship
                        them, they would live to an old age and be happy. Some member of every
                        family therefore worships these instruments regularly every month, sometimes
                        oftener, by preparing a kettle full of victuals and a few pipes of tobacco,
                        and singing all night the songs he has been taught by his ancestors, which
                        may be called religious songs. He invites his neighbours to come and eat the
                        victuals, and when they are assembled states the cause of his calling them
                        together, after which they proceed to eating with a great deal of ceremony.
                        Each person throws a little of the victuals into the fire before he puts any
                        in his mouth. Few Indians will give an opinion respecting a future state of
                        existence. They say that those things are only enquired after by fools and
                        white men. Some of them have told me that there were two other worlds to
                        which the ghosts of this world go; one the place of residence of the great
                        and good spirit, and the other that of the bad, that the ghosts of good men
                        live with the good spirit and the ghosts of bad men with the bad spirit.64 When asked what qualities are necessary for a good
                        man, they would reply, to be a good father, a good husband, a good warrior,
                        and a lover of his nation. The Indians generally appear to care but little
                        about a future state of existence and only appear to be anxious to live to
                        old age. When an Indian dies, his relations black their faces and fast for a
                        certain time fixed by the head of the family. The neighbours assemble and
                        bury the dead, after which the heads of those families who are friendly
                        towards the family of the deceased take some article of clothing and go and
                        address the friends of the deceased in the following words: 'Friends,
                        we are sorry that it has pleased the great spirit to call one of your family
                        from you, but this is not uncommon among us people of this world. Our friend
                        is only going on his journey a few days before us. We have come therefore to
                        invite you to mourn no longer, and to cover the body of our departed
                            friend.'65 They then return, and the articles
                        of 
                            64Trowbridge states that "They do not
                                universally believe in the existence of a Supreme and ordinary
                                deities, as do the other Indians." As to the afterlife, he
                                finds that "They entertain no doubt of a future state of
                                rewards and punishments, correspondent to their good and evil
                                conduct on this life," but he later adds that "They have
                                no ideas respecting a final judgment," MT,
                                51, 53, 56.
                            65The phrase "to cover the body"
                                generally refers to appropriate gifts and rituals at the time of a
                                death. Trowbridge quotes a similar speech that says the dead go on a
                                journey to the west where they will be joined "at an appointed
                                time" by the people who are still living. MT,
                                30-34.
                        
                         clothing they left are preserved for
                        the person that is to be adopted in the place of the deceased.66
                    When an Indian loses one of his friends by death, he believes that if the
                        place is not supplied by adoption, more of his friends will die.67 Should the deceased be a male, the most intimate male
                        friend is chosen to fill his vacancy: if a female, her most intimate female
                        friend is chosen. If the deceased be a person of respectability it
                        frequently happens that two persons are chosen to fill the vacancy.
                    When every thing is ready, the person or persons are sent for, and the
                        ceremony begins. If the deceased were a warrior, the adoption is exhibited
                        by the warriors of the village who assemble at the house of the deceased,
                        dance the war dance, and sing the war song in rotation. The warrior goes
                        through all the actions he performed when he was engaged with his enemy,
                        after which he repeats to the assembly the number of actions he has been in
                        and the number of scalps he has taken, occasionally giving the same yells
                        and using the same words he uttered when he was in battle. During all the
                        time there is a constant yelling of the war whoop by the assembly. When the
                        warrior has gone through such of his war exploits as he thinks proper, he
                        hands the war club to some other warrior, and sits down: the other rises and
                        repeats as many of his war exploits as he thinks proper in the same way, and
                        thus the dance is continued until each warrior of the village is called on
                        to relate his war exploits. Some are even called on two or three times. The
                        assembly is then dismissed by the speaker of the friends of the deceased,
                        who declares that their hearts are glad. The person adopted, who during the
                        dance sits among the relations of the deceased, is then moved by his new
                        relations to a private room, where he receives every thing that belonged to
                        the deceased, as well as the articles of clothing that had been received
                        from the neighbours. He is then told that he is one of the family and is
                        considered as such, and that he is entitled to the same authority in the
                        nation as the person whose place he fills.
                    When a common man, woman, or child dies, the adoption is exhibited by a few
                        people of both sexes playing some favourite game of the deceased.
                    When an Indian goes to the grave of his friend or relation he addresses
                        himself to the grave as though the corpse were living, and 
                            66Wells, who was captured and adopted, would
                                know this at first hand.
                            67Trowbridge discusses adoption ceremonies,
                                especially "the Discovery dance," MT,
                                34-37.
                        
                         relates every misfortune that has
                        happened in the family since it was buried. He then leaves there a piece of
                        tobacco, some victuals or spirituous liquors, if he have any, and
                        departs.
                    The Indians are an indolent people, and are therefore fond of any kind of
                        amusement that may serve to pass away time and make them merry. They have a
                        variety of games too tedious to mention,68 and are
                        remarkably honorable in paying their gambling debts.69
                        They have a variety of dances. The morning dance begins in the evening and
                        continues until morning when the feast is served up to the company. Another
                        dance is performed by a certain society. Each member of the society is
                        supposed to possess secret arts by which he can destroy the life of his
                        neighbours when he pleases, without its being known to them or any one else.
                        Persons of both sexes are adopted into this society with a great deal of
                            ceremony.70 When they dance it is common for each
                        person to have an otter skin. The oldest members place themselves in the
                        middle of the floor, and the dance begins by their singing the songs of the
                        society. A circle is formed around the singers and each person commences
                        dancing with his otter skin in his hand. After a few minutes some one of the
                        company makes a noise like an otter, shakes his skin and walks or dances
                        round the inside of the circle, suddenly making a motion with his skin at
                        some one of the company, who screams out and falls as if he had been shot.
                        In a few moments he recovers and in his turn loads his otter skin,
                        pretending to cough up the ball he was just shot with. When it appears that
                        the ball is in his mouth, he puts the nose of the otter skin to his mouth
                        and his piece is loaded. He then goes round the circle as was before done,
                        and shoots any one he pleases.71 In this way the dance
                        is 
                            68Turner adds: "Their games are cards,
                                Moccasin, shooting, sliding a crooked stick on the snow or ground
                                throwing a small stick out of the hand, and a variety of others too
                                tedious to mention." Turner, "A Discription," 53-54.
                                The FWM notes that "the game of Moccasin is most generally
                                practiced among them," FWM 94. Trowbridge describes the
                                moccasin game in detail, which involves competing teams guessing
                                which moccasin hides a bullet. MT, 61.
                            69Trowbridge provides descriptions of various
                                Indian games, but he does not agree with Wells that Indians were
                                "honorable" when it came to gambling: "They often bet
                                so high & lose so much that quarreling & bloodshed are
                                consequences of this game [Bowls], simple as it is." MT, 59-65.
                            70Trowbridge's informant, Le Gros, gives
                                an elaborate account of a Medicine Society, sometimes referred to as
                                a Man-Eating Society, which formerly flourished among the Miami. MT, 77-90.
                            71Trowbridge also describes this curious
                                custom, stating that "they go through the ceremony of shooting
                                each other with skins of animals, as has been seen." MT, 22.
                        
                         continued for such a length of time as
                        the managers think proper. No person can quit the dance until it is broken
                        up by them. The members of this society were formerly much feared by their
                        neighbours, but are now treated with great contempt.
                    The begging dance is performed by young men and boys, who dress like warriors
                        and go about through the village singing war songs and dancing. It is
                        customary for the heads of families, at whose house they dance, to give them
                        something. This is the dance they generally exhibit among white people.
                        There are a number of other dances, such as the bear dance, the turkey
                        dance, the new corn dance, and pipe dance, &c.
                    When business of importance comes before an Indian chief, he calls a council
                        of the heads of each family of his village, and lays the business before
                        them on which he means to deliberate.72 An orator then
                        rises, and, after stating the importance of the business, gives his opinion
                        to the council. Should the council concur with him, nothing more is said,
                        but the council is adjourned by the chief. Should a difference of opinion
                        prevail among the counselors, the subject is debated by the different
                        parties, after which the chief adjourns them as before. When the chief gives
                        his final answer to any thing that is thought of importance, it is done in
                        the presence of his counsellors. No business is done by him privately. No
                        crime among the Indians is punished with death, excepting murder; in which
                        case the chiefs and old men assemble and inquire into the nature of the act,
                        and if, after they are informed of the particulars of the transaction, they
                        are of opinion that the accused acted in his own defence, or that there was
                        something that authorised him to kill the other, they make a present to the
                        friends of the deceased, and tell them they have wiped away the blood, but
                        that if they are the cause of spilling more blood, the vengeance of the
                        village will fall on them. If, on the contrary, they find the person has
                        been murdered without cause, they say nothing to his relations, but leave
                        them to punish the murderer as they think proper, which is generally with
                        death.
                    The Indians live in villages from April to November, during which time the
                        women cultivate corn, beans, potatoes, pumpkins, and other common
                        vegetables. The men seldom assist their women in farming. Little Turtle and
                        a young Weas chief are the only two Indians that I know 
                            72The next three paragraphs are completely
                                missing from Turner and the FWM.
                        
                         of that use the plough. The remainder
                        of the year is spent in hunting. The Indians appear to decrease in number,
                        particularly those who live nearest the white settlements, perhaps in
                        consequence of the scarcity of game and their continual intoxication. The
                        Indians divide the time as the whites do, by moons, and into four seasons,
                        autumn, winter, spring and summer. January is called Buck moon, February the
                        Bear, March the Young Bear, April the Crow, May the Crane, June the
                        Whippoorwill, July the Cornhilling moon, August the Roasting Ear, September
                        the Hard Corn, October the Little Fire, November the Big Fire, and December
                        the Young Buck moon.73
                    The Indians hold property individually, but are not so fond of it as the
                        whites are. They are much kinder to their neighbors and to strangers than
                        the whites are.
                    The Indians have no laws, no coercive power, nor any kind of government.
                        Their only contracts are their manners and customs, and that moral sense of
                        right and wrong, which, like the sense of tasting and feeling in every man,
                        makes a part of his nature. An offence against them is punished with
                        contempt and exclusion from society, &c.
                    The Indians believe that the thunder and lightning and other disturbances of
                        the natural world, are independent and distinct powers or beings, and
                        worship them occasionally.
                    The Powwowers or Priests were formerly in high estimation, as it is believed
                        that they are the agents of the different powers, or great spirits that
                        govern the universe, and that they have power to kill or cure as they think
                        proper. They generally act as doctors, and sometimes go through the village
                        early in the morning preaching, and tell the people what to do during the
                            day.74 They are not so much respected now as they
                        formerly were. I have never understood that the North Western Indians buried
                        their dead in any other way, than as at present. Some lay the dead body on
                        the top of the ground, make a crib or pen over it, and cover it with bark.
                        Others dig graves and lay the corpse in, and cover it first with bark and
                        then with earth. Others still make a coffin out of strong boards, 
                            73Wells and Trowbridge generally agree on the
                                Miami moons, although Trowbridge calls September "Elk"
                                instead of "Hard Corn" and November "Running moon-for
                                Deer" rather than "Big Fire." MT,
                                50.
                            74The FWM adds: "Those supposed inspired
                                beings generally act as doctors, and it is not uncommon for them to
                                extract a hair ball on the whisker of a bear, a wolf, or a panther,
                                from the body or joint of their patients (or at least make them
                                believe so)." FWM, 95.
                        
                         in which they put the corpse and hang
                        it up in the top of a tree. It is customary to bury as much of the
                        deceased's property with the body as can conveniently be put into the
                        grave with it. [They frequently put a piece of bread or meat and a carrot of
                        tobacco under the head of the person to be interred, as they believe they
                        will be in need of some refreshment on their journey. They generally
                        celebrate the death of a distinguished chief or warrior by drinking,
                        feasting, dancing, and singing.
                    The Indians are subject to all the different diseases that the whites are
                        (the gout not excepted).]75
                    
                    
                        75Wells may have added this material following the
                            death of Little Turtle, July 14, 1812, who suffered from the gout. Or
                            Turner, who was a doctor, may have added it. When told that gout was a
                            gentleman's disease, Little Turtle replied, "I have always
                            believed that I was a gentleman." Young, Little
                                Turtle, 150. A century later, in July 1912, the grave of Little
                            Turtle was discovered at 634 Lawton Place in Fort
                                    Wayne. His grave goods, now on display
                            at the Fort Wayne History Center, included a dress sword, which was sent
                            to him by President Washington, and the following items of silver: eight
                            armlets, two anklets, three medals, six pendants, two bead necklaces,
                            twenty-three crosses, four brooches, and a pair of large ear hoops.
                            Trowbridge notes that "it is not common to see large quantities of
                            silver works placed in a grave." MT, 33. Other
                            grave goods included a pocketknife, a clasp knife, a drinking cup, a
                            spoon, a pair of scissors, a hammer, a gun, a bullet mold, a pistol, a
                            flintlock, an axe, a tomahawk, a pair of steel spurs, three large
                            skinning knives, a copper kettle, a flask, and a bottle of vermillion
                            paint. Carter, The Life and Times of Little Turtle,

                Tales of the Tribe of Ishmael
                A Research Note
                BRIAN SIEGEL
                Recent publications by Brent Ruswick, Elsa Kramer, and Nathaniel Deutsch1 suggest that my interest in Indianapolis's Tribe of Ishmael is more
                    widely shared than I had imagined. These scholarly studies, like others before
                    them, build their conclusions upon the evidence left in four different sources
                    of information about the Tribe-in chronological order, the writings of Rev.
                    Oscar C. McCulloch,2 a leading advocate of the organized
                    charities movement; James Frank Wright,3 a retired
                    newspaperman and child welfare agent; Arthur H. Estabrook,4

                        Leaming,5 an original revisionist historian. By drawing
                    at various times from one or another of these separate versions of the
                    Ishmaelites' story, and by treating as fact details that do not stand up to
                    independent verification, scholars seeking to understand the Tribe's
                    significance to the development of eugenic thought have at times confused rather
                    than clarified the story. I have studied the Ishmaelites for some time, and hope
                    that my findings might save other scholars time and energy.
                According to his diary, McCulloch discovered the Tribe on January 18, 1878, just
                    ten weeks after he and Rev. Myron Reed had read and preached upon Richard
                    Dugdale's The Jukes (1877). 6 The
                    book became the inspiration for McCulloch's study of the Tribe. McCulloch
                    wrote three accounts of his first encounter with seven desperately poor people
                    -a man, his mother, two younger women, and three children-and each account is
                    slightly different.
                The second account, the first public mention of the Tribe, is in McCulloch's
                    1880 paper to the National Conference of Charities and Correction. The account
                    resembles that found in his diary, but subtle changes have been introduced. The
                    man who had been described as half-blind is no longer so. The second woman,
                    first identified as his wife's sister, is now his sibling, and her child is
                    reported to be the result of incest. McCulloch also altered his diary, reducing
                    one of the women's offspring from four children to two. In the third
                    account, the two younger women's (now) three children switched mothers, and
                    the woman previously identified as the man's sister again became his
                    wife's sibling. These inconsistencies are odd, and one suspects that they
                    were invented, claims-making accounts. The same suspicion arises over
                    McCulloch's ever larger and more alarming counts of the Tribe's
                        numbers.7

                When McCulloch went to the township trustee, he found the original seven people
                    listed as Ishmaelites, a.k.a. the "pesthouse" mob.8 This is quite plausible, because twenty-seven of the thirty
                    addresses given for George Ishmael in the 1874 to 1923 city directories were in
                    the old City Hospital or pesthouse neighborhood,9 that is,
                    the Fall Creek bottomlands below the 1910s landfill that lies underneath the
                    current IUPUI medical campus. The census records and city directories document
                    the occupational shifts of the illiterate family members from ash- and
                    swill-collecting laborers and teamsters to junk dealers by 1910. However, as
                    Nathaniel Deutsch demonstrates, McCulloch's history of the Ishmael family
                    is largely fictitious.
                In the pages of the IMH, Brent Ruswick asserts that
                    McCulloch's attitude toward the Tribe softened over time, and that while he
                    began with hereditarian remedies for their pauperism, he eventually shifted to
                    environmental ones. Yet, unlike Dugdale, McCulloch never pondered the relative
                    importance of hereditary versus environmental determinants of the
                    Ishmaelites' pauperism. 10 It was, after all, a family
                    trait. At a time when even biologists were Lamarckians, 11
                    it was common for social reformers such as McCulloch "to confuse social and
                    physical heredity, and to assume the physical inheritance of complex cultural
                        characteristics." 12 McCulloch went on to father
                    the Center Township Board of Children's Guardians and the State Board of
                    Charities, but his disciples-

                     Alexander Johnson, Ernest P. Bicknell, and
                    Amos W. Butler (the first three secretaries of the State Board of
                    Charities)-became professed eugenicists and supported the state's 1907
                    eugenic sterilization law.
                While elements of McCulloch's history suggest a drift away from biological
                    determinism, he also believed that children had to be removed from their
                    families to escape hereditary pauperism. And his 1891 presidential address to
                    the National Conference of Charities and Correction advocated the creation of a
                    national registry of the dependent, defective, and delinquent classes.13 His attitude toward the Tribe was fundamentally
                    ambivalent.
                When I arrived at the Indiana State Library in early 2003, Robert Horton's
                    articles had already convinced me that the Tribe of Ishmael, McCulloch's
                    intermarried "pauper ganglion," was a hoax.14 I
                    shared this conviction with a librarian, and was then shown the 1822 probated
                    record of Benjamin Ishmael's 1813 will,15 which lists
                    most of the same children as J. Frank Wright's manuscript on the Tribe. I
                    turned to the city directories and census records, and found the historical
                    Ishmaels of Indianapolis.
                Much of what we think we know about the Ishmaelites derives from Wright's
                    unpublished manuscript and its seductive, anecdotal accounts of the seamy side
                    of life. Kramer and Deutsch, in particular, have depended upon the Wright
                    manuscript as a basis for their own interpretations.16
                    Wright's account, however, is problematic as a primary source. He had
                    prepared it for Arthur H. Estabrook, who then left it with Amos Butler before
                    leaving Indianapolis. Yet just like the names on
                    Wright and Kate Parker's genealogical diagram of the Tribe for
                    McCulloch's 1888 paper,17 the characters in his
                    manuscript are probably fictitious. Robert Horton, while still at the Indiana
                    State Archives, discovered that the real Robert Ross was not Wright's
                    diseased dodger who

                    prostitutes, but the worthiest charity applicant known to his physician and
                        employer.18
                Still other examples of Wright's fictitious characters are Hiram and Melinda
                    Rogers and their family. Wright claimed that the Rogers were early settlers of
                            Marion
                            County, and that their sons were ruined for
                    civilian life by the Army's paternalistic care.19 Yet
                    the 1860 census reveals that the real Hiram and Melinda were twelve-year-old
                    twins on their parents' farm, and that two of their alleged sons were their
                    six- and eight-year-old brothers. Wright's manuscript contains the names of
                    real people, but assigns them fictitious histories, dates, and states of origin.
                    There is an entirely appropriate sense of irony in Dr. Thurman B. Rice's
                    judgment that "Many of the statements made by Mr. Wright are amazing beyond
                        belief."20
                It should be noted that the final pages of Wright's notes for Estabrook
                    include a pointed critique of eugenics theory, which begins: "Physical and
                    mental conditions are inheritable conditions; morals are no more a matter of
                    inheritance than shoes."21 Wright (1851-1927) almost
                    certainly knew his contemporary, George Ishmael (1849/50-1926). They may have
                    met in 1881, when the city directory listed Wright as the proprietor of a feed
                    and seed store at 178 Indiana Avenue, adjoining the City Hospital neighborhood.
                    Whatever the case, the "notorious wandering family, well named
                    Ishmael" had already appeared in the 1902 and 1911 published summaries of
                    Wright's work on the early slums of Indianapolis.22
                Wright evidently joined Estabrook's study of the Tribe in 1916 at age
                    sixty-five. The city directory for that year listed Estabrook as an
                    "inspector" and Wright as an "investigator." Wright's
                    obituary says that his health had failed while an agent for the Carolina child

                            January 19, 1884, p. 4, which Estabrook's manuscript (p. 149)
                            implies was written by his assistant, James Frank Wright.
                    
                     boards, and forced his return to
                            Indianapolis.23 Estabrook
                    was pursuing several projects. He probably welcomed assistance from one who had
                    assembled the Tribe's genealogical diagram, and the compensation Wright
                    received from his typewritten sketches must have helped make ends meet. The
                    directories list no occupation for Wright from 1917-18, when Estabrook was away
                    in the Army. Wright was a watchman from 1919-20, and an elevator operator from
                    1921 until his death in 1927.
                Estabrook, the author of two earlier studies of cacogenic families,24 came to Indianapolis in 1916 as an
                    agent of Amos W Butler's Society for Mental Hygiene to assess the size of
                    the state's mentally defective population.25 In
                    addition, Charles B. Davenport, director of the Eugenics Record Office, wanted
                    Estabrook to resurrect the study of the Tribe of Ishmael, and Harry L. Laughlin,
                    in 1921, asked him to investigate a possible test case for a new state eugenic
                    sterilization law.26
                Rather than being, as some have suggested, a second, independent sociological
                    study of the Tribe of Ishmael, Estabrook's unpublished 1922 work draws
                    freely from Wright's manuscript, and Estabrook acknowledges the assistance.
                    In fact, nine (60 percent) of Estabrook's fifteen families are obvious
                    rewrites of Wright's sketches. Apart from a stress upon feeblemindedness
                    and attention to the Tribe's occupations and the Ishmael family's junk
                    business, there is little new material of any kind. But there is, as Kramer
                    notes, a distinct shift in tone. Estabrook's descriptions are less
                    outrageous than Wright's. Not surprisingly, however, the eugenical
                    fieldworker found a rate of feeblemindedness three times higher-16 percent
                    versus 5 percent-than Wright suggests, and he did so without actually testing
                    any of his subjects.
                It was Estabrook's army service that allowed him to perform his behavioral
                    assessments of the Ishmaelites' intelligence. Estabrook's time in
                            Indianapolis was interrupted by World War I
                    and his service at Camp

                     Gordon, Georgia, as a
                    psychological officer with the Robert M. Yerkes Army Sanitary Corps. From April
                    to September 1918 he helped identify feebleminded inductees by administering the
                    celebrated Army Intelligence Tests; thereafter he was engaged in "advising
                    and lecturing to officers on methods of [troop] training."27 In doing so, he must have utilized Yerkes's new scale of
                    occupational intelligence grades. Engineer officers were assigned an A level
                    (very superior) intelligence, whereas laborers or teamsters (like the Ishmael
                    family men) received a C minus level, indicating low average intelligence.28 Estabrook employed the same scale to study the Tribe,
                    based solely on members' reported behavior.
                Estabrook's study of the Tribe was never published. Harry L. Laughlin had
                    replaced Charles B. Davenport as head of the Eugenics Record Office in 1921.
                    Davenport had been interested in cacogenic families and the Tribe of Ishmael,
                    but Laughlin was interested in more practical issues such as eugenic
                    sterilization, racial integrity laws, and immigration restriction. Thus
                    Estabrook left Indianapolis in 1922 to
                    assemble evidence for the sterilization of Carrie Buck, and to defend
                            Virginia's racial purity law with his expose
                    of the Monancan Indians' tri-racial ancestry, Mongrel
                        Virginians (co-authored with Ivan McDougle in 1926).29
                The last of the four tales is Hugo P. Leaming's Tribe of Ben Ishmael. Like
                    his posthumously published dissertation, Leaming's 1977 paper found it
                    "necessary to extrapolate a good deal from little evidence."30

                     Leading's Ishmaelites, who allegedly
                    settled the White River valley in the early 1800s, were a freedom-loving band of
                    hereditarily nomadic, Muslim hunter-fishers who refused to seek wage labor
                    slavery, and so were persecuted by McCulloch's charities and the
                    eugenicists who followed. Leaming's Tribe then migrated to
                            Chicago and Detroit, where
                    they helped form Timothy Drew's Moorish Science Temple, a predecessor of
                    the Nation of Islam.
                There is no evidence for these claims, other than the fact that three of George
                    Ishmael's cousins moved to Marion,
                            Indiana, by 1910. The census records repeatedly
                    classified the real Ishmaels as illiterate whites, and suggest that they were
                    still in Nicholas County, Kentucky, when
                    Indianapolis was founded. No one like
                    Leaming's Ishmaelites, whom he described as a mixed race people including
                    "remnants of destroyed Native Americans," appears in books about the
                    Delaware or Miami Indians, or the Conner brothers. While some would say this
                    lack of evidence suggests that these Ishmaelites did not exist, Leaming
                    attributes it to "mass social amnesia."31
                Leaming's brand of revisionist history walks a fine line between outright
                    fiction and a parody of the eugenics literature. It is also oddly personal, for
                    one of his admirers tells of this white Unitarian Virginian's 1989 address
                    to his African American congregation in Chicago:
                    "Proudly wearing the fez of the Moorish Science Temple, he stood before us,
                    a pale-skinned man of 'tri-racial' Chickahominy Indian stock, and
                    delivered his moving sermon, 'My African Ancestry.'"32
                In sum, the trash-collecting and junk-dealing Ishmael family did exist; the
                    intermarried pauper ganglion called the Tribe of Ishmael did not; and the tales
                    told about either of them by McCulloch, Wright, Estabrook, and Leaming are not
                    to be trusted. These tales tell us more about social history and shifting
                    intellectual fashions than their largely fictitious subjects.

                T. C. Steele and the Society of Western Artists,
                    1896-1914 By Rachel Berenson Perry (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2009. Pp.
                    249. Illustrations, appendices, notes, index. $49.95.)
                Today, the term "Western artists" typically evokes painters and
                    sculptors such as Frederick Remington and Charles Russell, both especially known
                    for their romantic post-Civil War images of cowboys, Indians, and the Rocky
                    Mountains. But as Rachel Berenson Perry reminds us, many people who lived in
                            Illinois, Indiana,
                            Michigan, Missouri, and
                            Ohio in the late nineteenth century saw this
                    landscape and themselves as fundamentally "Western," as the citizens
                    of an American region-we call it the Midwest today-that they believed was
                    distinctive from both the East Coast and the "far" West.
                Cultural recognition was central to this demarcation of regional distinctiveness,
                    and various initiatives were undertaken to alert the rest of the nation about
                    how the Middle West was "hospitable" to the "cultivation of fine
                    arts" (p. 2). These included organizing cultural institutions like art
                    museums (Chicago's Art Institute was established in 1879, and the Detroit
                    Museum of Art opened in 1885), hosting world's fairs (such as the Columbian
                    Exposition in Chicago in 1893, and the St. Louis
                    World's Fair in 1904), and forming artist collectives like the Society of
                    Western Artists, which Indiana artist Theodore Clement
                    Steele (1847-1926) and a group of other midwestern painters founded in 1896.
                    Although private art galleries existed at the time, artist-run groups were
                    especially responsible for exhibitions, sales, and critical reputation,
                    basically serving as the primary entree to art world success. This beautifully
                    illustrated book, which accompanied the 2009 exhibition "Making It in the
                    Midwest: Artists Who Chose to Stay" at the Indiana State Museum
                            (Indianapolis), charts the ambitious annual
                    shows that the Society of Western Artists held for nineteen years, and their
                    concerted efforts to promote themselves and their art.
                
                Most members of the society painted landscapes, rendered in an American style of
                    Impressionism that embraced a loose approach to light and color but remained
                    solidly rooted in the designs and details of the material world. Trained in
                    Europe, Steele's earliest work consisted mainly of portraits, but he became
                    a leading figure in the "Hoosier Group," a group of Indiana painters
                    whose "plein air" landscapes (basically, paintings produced outside
                    rather than in a studio) won acclaim at an exhibition in Chicago in 1894. Although not infrequently
                    accepted into the annual juried shows of the National Academy of Design (and
                    elected a member of the New York-based Academy in 1913), Steele was adamant
                    about galvanizing public and critical support for regionally themed pictures of
                    middle-western America.
                The society that Steele helped organize was especially intent on increasing art
                    sales, and to that end its annual exhibition of the paintings, prints, and
                    ceramics of member artists traveled for six months each year to cities including
                            Chicago, Cincinnati,
                            Cleveland, Detroit,
                            Indianapolis, and St.
                        Louis. The shows were often well received and at
                    the society's peak, new venues in Columbus,
                            Pittsburgh, and Toledo were added to the exhibit rotation. Sales,
                    however, were never spectacular and over time many of the group's artists
                    turned to other cultural organizations and institutions for critical and
                    financial sustenance. Moreover, as the twentieth century progressed, the
                    society's Impressionist style of landscape painting was increasingly out of
                    sync with the new modes of modern art displayed at blockbuster events like the
                    1913 Armory show. Finally, in 1916, the artist group disbanded. Featuring
                    detailed information about the society's annual exhibition catalogs,
                    membership lists, exhibition venues, annual prize winners, and works exhibited
                    by Steele, Perry's book provides a much needed account of the aspirations
                    and achievements of this pioneering midwestern cultural institution.

                Hard News, Heartfelt Opinions A History of the Fort Wayne
                        Journal Gazette By Scott M. Bushnell (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2007. Pp.
                    xii, 197. Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. $19.95.)
                Long-time journalist Scott Bushnell has written a lively history of the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette, a newspaper that emerged during
                    the Civil War in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and has since grown to be the major newspaper
                    of the area. Yet, this is much more than a history about a newspaper; it also
                    tells the story of the Fort Wayne community the paper
                    has served since 1863.
                Politics was the major impetus behind the Journal
                    Gazette's founding, and politics continued to drive and define the
                    paper over the next century-and-a-half. One of the Journal
                        Gazette's creators, David W. Jones, wanted a newspaper "that
                    would support the policies of President Abraham Lincoln," a risky
                    proposition since the Democratic Party held sway in Allen
                        County and most citizens in this conservative region
                    either accepted the system of slavery, or at least agreed that African Americans
                    (freed or fugitive) should not reside in Indiana (p. 1).
                    Their views were reflected in the state's constitution, which in 1851
                    prohibited African Americans from settling in the Hoosier state.
                Jones and his partner, Republican attorney Isaac Jenkinson, faced competition
                    from other local newspapers that opposed abolitionism; indeed, the Fort Wayne Weekly Sentinel was a vehement critic of Lincoln. The
                    bitterness over the eventual election of Lincoln (Allen
                        County went for Senator Stephen Douglas) only increased
                    after Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863. Democrats
                    warned of a "black wave" of "paupers, idlers, and thieves"
                    swarming into Indiana, while Republicans uneasily supported the
                    new policy (p. 11). In fact, there was so much opposition to Lincoln in
                            Fort Wayne, especially after Congress passed
                    the national conscription act that spring, that "some state and national
                    officials" worried about "another rebellion and act of secession, with
                    portions of the Old Northwest" leading the way, a course of action that was
                    at least tacitly justified by the  Fort Wayne Sentinel (p.
                    17). Two months later, in this highly politically charged atmosphere, the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette rolled off the press for the first
                    time.
                Bushnell continues to trace the Gazette's history through
                    the tumultuous nineteenth century and into the next, placing in context the
                    newspaper's many changes in owners, editors, and publishers, as well as its
                    financial problems, technological advances, and competition from other papers.
                    The Journal Gazette remained staunchly Republican until the
                    paper was sold in 1899 to the Democratic Party's mouthpiece, the Fort Wayne Journal.
                
                Presidential candidates from all political parties made Fort Wayne a stopping
                    point on the campaign trail. William Jennings Bryan "captured the
                    imagination" of Fort Wayne and
                            Allen
                            County, which voted for the congressman from
                            Nebraska three times (p. 63). Theodore Roosevelt
                    and Franklin D. Roosevelt paid visits, as well as Charles Lindbergh,
                    spokesperson for the America First Committee (whose isolationist views the Journal Gazette sharply disagreed with). The newspaper also
                    took on the Ku Klux Klan. Indiana was the most powerful Realm in the Invisible
                    Empire, and most of the state's newspapers, as Bushnell notes, were either
                    sympathetic to or silent about the Klan's intolerance and racism. Not so
                    with the Journal Gazette, which sharply criticized the hooded
                    order and "openly campaigned" against it (p. 112).
                The Journal Gazette continued to espouse views that were
                    contrary to the more conservative climate of Fort
                            Wayne. As the twentieth century marched on, the
                    newspaper supported civil rights, women's rights (including the right to an
                    abortion), affirmative action, and gun control, and criticized American
                    involvement in the Vietnam War. Bushnell's research is extensive and he
                    tells a good story. Hard News, Heartfelt Opinions is an
                    excellent starting point for an area that has been long neglected in
                            Indiana history.

                The North American Journals of Prince Maximilian of
                    Wied Volume I, May 1832-April 1833 Edited by
                    Stephen S. Witte and Marsha V. Gallagher (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2008. Pp.
                    xlii, 467. Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. $85.00.)
                German naturalist Prince Maximilian of Wied's North American expedition of
                    the upper Missouri
                        River regions in 1832-34, renowned through the work of Swiss
                    artist Karl Bodmer, represented the first exploratory scientific survey since
                    Lewis and Clark's journey several decades earlier. Stephen S. Witte and
                    Marsha V. Gallagher's visually stunning University of Oklahoma Press
                    publication, in three collector-quality oversized edited volumes illuminated by
                    the Maximilian-Bodmer Collection at the Joslyn Art Museum in
                            Omaha, Nebraska,
                    encompasses the most complete English record of the expedition. The art,
                    descriptive detail, and  annotation of these
                    volumes will aid historians' and other scholars' research of the Old
                    Northwest, the West, Native Americans, and more. This review evaluates the first
                    volume which spans the period May 1832 to April 1833 and includes
                    Maximilian's voyage from Europe to Boston; stays in
                            Boston, New York, and
                            Philadelphia; excursions into the
                            Pennsylvania countryside; andthe four-and-one-half
                    months stay in the former communal society at New
                    Harmony, Indiana, before
                    journeying to St. Louis to jump off into
                    the American West.
                By the time of his North American expedition, Prince Maximilian had already
                    undertaken two voyages to the Americas; this time he was accompanied by Bodmer
                    and Wied hunter and taxidermist David Dreidoppel. Maximilian's wide-ranging
                    observations extend beyond the natural sciences and will captivate the reader.
                    From the group's Fourth of July landing in Boston in 1832 amidst
                    festivities and fear of cholera, to physical descriptions of urban life in
                            Boston, New York, and
                            Philadelphia juxtaposed with those of the
                    agrarian landscape, this is in many important ways a social history of the early
                    republic. Travel conditions, the strong German influence in Pennsylvania, local rural customs and food culture,
                    and comparative farming practices all share the spotlight with Maximilian's
                    identification of the flora and fauna. Yet this is prelude to his eager
                    anticipation of studying Native Americans, which is covered in the remaining
                    volumes.
                Indianans might be particularly interested in the lengthy section on
                    Maximilian's stay in New
                        Harmony, from October 20, 1832, to March 15, 1833.
                    His observations are a window into this Wabash River town and surrounding area, its
                    activities, as well as many of its local luminaries, such as
                            Philadelphia scientist Thomas Say, French
                    naturalist and illustrator Charles A. Lesueur, and Robert Owens's family.
                    Maximilian noted six hundred inhabitants, steamboat and flatboat activity, a
                    stage that came three times a week from Mount
                        Vernon on its way to Vincennes, and U.S. mail and newspapers that came
                    once a week. Perhaps of more interest than the classifications of local plant
                    and animal species are the largely negative characterizations of the local farm
                    people and their farming practices. He describes their appearance and manners in
                    terms like "dirty," "crude," "shabby," and
                    "very bad" (p. 235). He was even less impressed with what he believed
                    was negligent care of livestock, a primitive interest in cattle breeding, and a
                    crippling focus on raising Indian corn and hogs which foraged everywhere.
                    Nevertheless a great deal about early nineteenth-century southern Indiana life
                    can be gleaned from this volume.
                In its presentation and remarkable detail, this volume represents the best of
                    scholarly publications. Yet it also exemplifies what can go wrong when too much
                    attention is paid to  aesthetics and not
                    enough to the vital areas of copyediting and proofing. There is great
                    inconsistency in the formatting of each chapter's chronology-including a
                    glaring error at thefront of chapter four noting the year as 1833, when it is in
                    fact 1832. Thepotential problems arising from research based upon this volume
                    areobvious.

                Canal Fever The Ohio & Erie Canal from Waterway to
                        Canalway Edited by Lynn Metzger and Peg Bobel
                            (Kent, Ohio: Kent State
                    University Press, 2009. Pp. x, 382. Illustrations, maps, bibliography, index.

                Ohio has been fortunate in the number and quality of
                    writings on its canal heritage. These works include Harry N. Scheiber, Ohio Canal Era: A Case Study of Government and the Economy,
                        1820-1861 (1969); Jack Gieck, A Photo Album of Ohio's
                        Canal Era (1988); and Ronald Shaw,  Canals for a Nation:
                        The Canal Era in the United States, 1790-1860 (1990). To that list of
                    worthy studies on Ohio canals should be added Canal Fever, a
                    collection of essays about the first, longest, and most important of its
                    man-made waterways.
                This significant account explores the ongoing impact of the Ohio & Erie Canal, now in
                    a new phase as the venue for a "canalway," which connects the past,
                    present, and future in a corridor extending from the mouth of the Cuyahoga River at
                            Cleveland some 110 miles south through four
                    counties. The route, now officially recognized as a National Scenic Byway, seeks
                    to combine "the natural, historic, and recreational resources" along
                    its line (p. 356).
                This story is told in great, sometimes even excessive detail, by various
                    qualified historians, preservationists, civic leaders, and canal enthusiasts,
                    all (with possibly one exception) happily self-confessed carriers of a
                    contagion-canal fever. That exception would be railroad historian H. Roger
                    Grant, whose valuable summary of the development of Ohio's outstanding railroad network that forced the
                    canal system into obsolescence, is often disparaging toward the Ohio & Erie Canal, which
                    he refers to simply as a "ditch" (pp. 162, 164, 176).
                The book, organized in three parts, opens with an excellent overview of the
                    history of the 309-mile-long canal, as it snaked its way across the state from
                            Cleveland, over summits at
                            Akron (which means high  point) and Newark, and then
                    all the way south to the Ohio
                        River at Portsmouth. Inspired by the
                    example and engineering expertise of New York's
                        Erie Canal, the Ohio waterway, constructed between 1825 and
                    1832, helped transform the state's economy into the 1850s and beyond. This
                    story is told by national park historian Sam Tamburro and photojournalist Frank
                    Gieck, and is buttressed by a new translation of the wonderful account by German
                    explorer and naturalist Prince Maximilian of Wied, of his trip along the entire
                    length of the canal in 1834. Other chapters on early canal history include
                    outstanding sections on the people who actually built the waterway, mainly Irish
                    immigrants, but also some local farmers and convicts. In addition, this book
                    contains excellent descriptions of technical matters, such as puddling, lock
                    construction and operation, surveying tools and procedures, and the importance
                    of water-resistant Portland cement.
                Another section reviews the canal's years of neglect and decline, the
                    devastating impact (in Ohio and elsewhere) of enormous flood
                    waters in 1913, and the remarkable way a few visionaries kept the waterway from
                    complete abandonment. Among those who loved the canal and helped preserve its
                    memory and its existence were folklorist and songwriter Pearl Nye, who called
                    the canal he grew up along his "Little Silver Ribbon" (the title of
                    one of his many songs), and journalist Al Simpson, whose collected newspaper
                    columns were published in Along the Towpath: A Journalist
                        Rediscovers the Ohio & Erie Canal (2003), and who earlier helped
                    persuade Ohio congressmen John Seiberling and Ralph Regula
                    to seek legislation preserving this invaluable property.
                Lastly, in a section as much hortative as historical, the editors are major
                    contributors to chapters that explain how the waterway became a canalway, which
                    is now part of the national park system, and what its presence as a nature
                    preserve, historical site, trail (for hiking, biking, and riding), and community
                    resource means to current and future generations of Ohioans and Americans.
                One wishes for more and better illustrations to this book, footnotes rather than
                    end-of-chapter notes, and, perhaps, an annotated bibliography. Nevertheless, Canal Fever deserves a place in the library of state and canal
                    historians, preservationists eager to know how to proceed in protecting their
                    artifacts, and others interested in American transportation and environmental
                    history.

                America's Main Street Hotels Transiency and Community
                        in the Early Auto Age By John A. Jakle and Keith A. Sculle
                            (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press,
                    2009. Pp. xxi, 218. Illustrations, notes, bibliographic references, index.

                The importance of the hotel to understanding American cities and life is now
                    widely acknowledged. From their inception in the early nineteenth century,
                    hotels were not only emblems of the rise of urban centers, they were essential
                    instruments in making urban growth a reality. Beyond accommodating the fast
                    increasing number of travelers, early hotels were important gathering places for
                    the local elite. The progress and potential of a community were judged to a
                    significant degree by the extent and character of its hostelries. Major cities
                    set the standard, the emulation of which became a ubiquitous phenomenon in
                    smaller cities and towns nationwide. Hotels also served as catalysts to
                    stimulate city building in communities where settlement was in its infancy. Ever
                    bigger and better hotels remained central definers of downtown
                            America into the mid-twentieth century.
                Despite its historical value, the hotel has attracted less scholarly attention
                    than it deserves. The horizon has been substantially expanded by some recent
                    work, including A. K. Sandoval-Strausz's path-breaking cultural survey, Hotel: An American History (2007). His and the few other key
                    studies have focused on work in the metropolis. John Jakle and Keith Sculle, on
                    the other hand, explore new territory by addressing developments in smaller
                    communities during the first half of the twentieth century. Drawing from an
                    array of period sources, the authors have organized the text in six chapters:
                    physical attributes, development, management, clientele, dining and drinking
                    facilities, and modernization. The content affords a solid introductory
                    perspective. For those examining the history of hotels or the morphology of
                    small cities and towns in the U.S. during the twentieth
                    century, America's Main Street Hotels will be a useful
                    reference indeed. And because such hostelries remain threatened in many
                    communities, as the authors emphasize in the epilogue, the book should boost
                    efforts to preserve the many remaining examples.
                For all its virtues, Jakle and Sculle's volume skirts some basic issues.
                    What do mainstream examples tell us that those in major cities do not? If
                    "Main Street" hotels of the twentieth century were fashioned after
                    their big-city cousins, did they differ in significant ways? And how do early
                    twentieth-century examples differ from their forebears? The authors minimize
                    physical change over time, when the evidence they offer suggests that cumulative
                    change was substantial in planning and amenities. Despite the book's  subtitle, very little of its content
                    addresses factors pertaining to automobile travelers until the final chapter,
                    and then the treatment is sporadic. Little fieldwork appears to have been done
                    in the course of this project. Had the authors been more ambitious in this realm
                    they might have uncovered examples such at the Hotel Wareham in
                            Manhattan, Kansas, constructed
                    in response to the designation of the town's main street as U.S. 40. The
                    Wareham boasted a two-story, full-service garage (topped by a ballroom!) as a
                    rear annex as well as its own filling station and car lot. Or perhaps the Pierce
                    Pennant Motor Inn (1929) near Columbia,
                            Missouri, also built along U.S. 40, with an
                    underground garage and landscaped grounds-as if a resort. Or, the Hotel Stafford
                    (1931-32) along U.S. 1 on the northern edge of Fredericksburg, Virginia, with even more pretentious aspirations to be
                    a fine resort. Fieldwork might also have underscored the stunning variety of
                    design treatments given to downtown hostelries in the 1920s and revealed some of
                    the new hotels-from Hutchinson, Kansas,
                    to Columbia, South
                        Carolina-built in the business core after World War II
                    in a concerted, if vain, effort to maintain that core's dominance. Yet if
                    this book lacks the richness and depth for which one might hope, it has opened
                    the door to a subject that demands our further attention.

                There are Jews in Southern Indiana The Bloomington
                    Story By Katie Himm and Lana Ruegamer Eisenberg. Indiana Jewish
                    History Publication No. 38 (Fort Wayne:
                    Indiana Jewish Historical Society, 2009. Pp. 112. Illustrations, notes, index.
                    Paperbound, $10.00. )
                This small volume is packed with information on the history of the Jewish
                    presence in Bloomington,
                            Indiana, and Monroe County. Early
                    chapters cover the first Jewish families to arrive in the town, including the
                    Kahns in the 1840s and the Becovitz family from Eastern Europe in 1887. The
                    authors discuss at length the central role of the Hillel organization, begun in
                    1938, for the university and for the larger Jewish community. History from the
                    1950s onward covers the discrimination and lack of accommodation through the
                    1950s and 1960s; the first local minyan begun in 1964; the Jewish Community
                    Center begun in 1970 and its transition to a synagogue in the 1980s; the 1983
                    arson fire of the center later traced to two white supremacists; and the history
                    of the rebuilt Congregation Beth Shalom up to the present day. The book is
                    generously illustrated, and anyone interested in the history of the city and
                    county, as well as those interested in the history of Jews in the Midwest, will
                    find much of interest here.

                This book offers a complete reprint of a 1931 master's thesis, written by
                    Donald E Carmony, one of the twentieth century's foremost experts in
                            Indiana history. In his introduction, State
                    Supreme Court Chief Justice Randall Shepard reminds readers of the historic
                    importance of the state's second constitution, which pointed to the growing
                    need (among Hoosiers and others, including the citizens of 
                    Ohio and Kentucky) "to
                    change their constitutions to better reflect the growing democratization in
                    American society and politics" (p. v). Carmony's thesis provides eight
                    chapters of analysis, including the issues that led up to the convention; the
                    political, social, and economic changes brought about by the new constitution;
                    and public reaction to the document. The thesis concludes with five appendices
                    of primary source material, including the 1851 document and later comments by
                    several convention delegates. The editors have added an up-to-date list of
                    recommended readings to Carmony's original bibliography, as well as subject
                    and name indexes.
                Historic Photos of Indiana By Scott M. Bushnell
                            (Nashville, Tenn.: Turner
                    Publishing, 2009. Pp. x, 206. Illustrations. $39.95.)
                This coffee-table book divides its photographic collection into four historical
                    periods, covering the 1850s through the 1960s, and focuses on architecture,
                    transportation, business, leisure, and famous Hoosiers. Among the unusual photos
                    from the nineteenth century are those of a wedding party on a large boat on the
                        Wabash & Erie
                        Canal and an 1892 view of several men in suits, ties, and bowler
                    hats field testing the Kleen Klipper lawn mower manufactured by Hoosier company
                    Dille & McGuire. Readers can see early twentieth-century views of a circus
                    parade in Peru; the city of Gary being built
                    by U.S. Steel; and a Hoosier reunion of Grand Army of the Republic veterans.
                    Photographs from the 1920s through the 1940s include a Gennett Records recording
                    session; a troop of Boy Scouts placing markers along the Lincoln Highway; and
                    women workers in the Fort Wayne General Electric plant during World War II. The
                    book concludes in the 1960s, with photographs including a view of Robert
                    Kennedy's 1968 campaign swing through the state.
                Indiana's War The Civil War in Documents Edited
                    by Richard E Nation and Stephen E. Towne (Athens: Ohio University Press, 2009. Pp. xi, 252.
                    Maps, timeline, discussion questions, notes, selected bibliography, index.
                    Paperbound, $18.65.)
                Part of the ongoing "Civil War in the Great Interior" series, this
                    volume will be of interest to those who know little about the state's war
                    history and those who have read much. The editors provide over 120 excerpts from
                    private letters and diaries, official military and government correspondence and
                    documents, and newspapers to expose readers to "the diverse voices of Civil
                    War Indiana," both the "obvious
                    protagonists" and the "nearly forgotten from all walks of life and
                    political persuasions" (p. xvii). Each section begins with a concise but
                         informative two- to four-page
                    introduction; each excerpt bears its own brief introduction as well. The editors
                    organize the volume topically, covering slavery, elections and state government,
                    the front lines and the home front, war's end, and the more specific topics
                    of the Emancipation Proclamation and Morgan's Raid. With a set of
                    discussion questions and a select bibliography, the book will be useful for
                    advanced high school and college classrooms, as well as adult education
                    groups.
                By Freedom's Light By Elizabeth O'Maley
                            (Indianapolis: Indiana Historical Society
                    Press, 2009. Pp. 188. Illustrations, select bibliography. Paperbound,
                    $7.95.)
                In this young-adult novel, O'Maley weaves fiction and truth to educate
                    readers on Indiana's part in the Underground Railroad. Through the young
                    heroine's interactions with locals in a small settlement ten miles north of
                            Richmond, the book examines the role of
                    Quakers, slave hunters, and slavery itself in rural society. Written as a
                    historical narrative, the work also contains pictures and illustrations that can
                    help young readers visualize life in pioneer Indiana.
                Indianapolis Motor Speedway 100 Years of Racing By
                    Ralph Kramer (Iola, Wisc.: Krause Publications, 2009. Pp. 256.
                    Illustrations, bibliography, index. $30.00.)
                Anyone who has grown up in Indianapolis with fond
                    memories of listening to "the race" on the radio at the end of every
                    May and all those fans who have come year after year to the Indy 500 or the
                    Brickyard 400 will love this coffee-table book issued for the centennial of the
                    Motor Speedway. Although photographs predominate, many reproduced here for the
                    first time, fascinating text runs through every chapter. The book begins with
                    the first race in 1909-a motorcycle race-and then moves into the eight-abreast
                    first car race in the same year. There are photographs of the paving process
                    that turned the track into the Brickyard, and of a 1911 "Reservation
                    Chart" that lists the one dollar admission charge along with ticket prices
                    ranging from fifty cents to four dollars. There are photographs of drivers, car
                    owners and track owners, races and wrecks, pit areas, spectators and stands and
                    infields, and festival parades. Most of the book is devoted to the Indianapolis
                    500 but two final sections also cover the NASCAR Brickyard 400 and the U.S.
                    Grand Prix race.
                
                Hoosier Justice at Nuremberg By Susanne S. Bellamy
                            (Indianapolis: Indiana Historical Society
                    Press, 2010. Pp. viii, 118. Photographs, notes, bibliography, index. Paperbound,
                    $6.95.)
                In this short volume, Susanne Bellamy examines the roles played by former Indiana
                    Supreme Court justices Frank Richman of Columbus,
                            Indiana, and Curtis Shake of
                            Vincennes, Indiana, in the
                    postwar Nazi tribunals at Nuremberg. Although Bellamy
                    gives the reader a glimpse of the early lives of Richman and Shake, the bulk of
                    the story focuses on the years following World War II. By 1947, both justices
                    had retired from the higher court and begun to settle into civilian life when
                    they were called upon to serve as judges in the crimes against humanity trials
                    of leading German industrialists, Friedrich Flick et al of
                    Flick KG and Carl Krauch et al of IG Farben. The impact of
                    these Hoosier justices, who judged the defendants with American fairness, will
                    continue to resonate through time.
                Rockne The Coach, the Man, the Legend By Jerry
                    Bronfield (1976; Lincoln: University of Nebraska
                    Press, 2009. Pp. xii, 271. Paperbound, $17.95.)
                Bronfield covers the entirety of Knute Rockne's time at the University of
                    Notre Dame, beginning with his contribution as a student and ending with
                    Rockne's tragic death. Though the book is based upon Rockne's
                    relationship with the university, the most interesting and insightful anecdotes
                    come from his actions outside of the stadium. All in all, Rockne will most
                    likely be remembered for leading his team to five undefeated seasons, but here
                    Bronfield asserts that football is only one facet of Rockne's well-deserved
                    legacy.
                Ross-Ade Their Purdue Stories, Stadium, and Legacies
                    By Robert C. Kriebel (West Lafayette,
                            Ind.: Purdue University Press, 2009. Pp. xi, 408.
                    Bibliography, index. Paperbound, $22.95.)
                The names David Ross and George Ade will certainly strike a bell for the students
                    and alumni of Purdue University. For some, that bell may only recall the
                    memories of a stadium and football season, for others it brings to mind two men
                    who dedicated their lives and fortunes to their beloved alma mater. In another
                    installment of Purdue University Press's Founders Series, Ade and
                    Ross's relationship with Purdue University is thoroughly chronicled from
                    their lives as undergraduates to the latest renovation on their final legacy,

                            Berne, Indiana,
                    Bachmann-Geiser's work details the history, customs, and life of the Amish
                    still living in the Indiana town to this day. The author
                    traces the origins of songs, dress, and religious traditions, and their
                    evolution over time, to create an accurate image of the life of one group of
                    Indiana Amish. Not strictly academic, the book is full of interesting details
                    and anecdotes which portray the Amish as an intellectual subject as well as a
                    people.
                Uncommon Defense Indian Allies in the Black Hawk War
                    By John W Hall (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2009. Pp. 367. Maps,
                    notes, index. $29.95.)
                In this exploration of the political forces behind the Black Hawk War, the author
                    examines not only the principal players, Black Hawk's British Band and the
                    United States Army, but also the Indian tribes caught in the crossfire. Focusing
                    primarily on tribes bordering Wisconsin and Illinois- the Ho-Chunks, Potawatomi, and
                    Menominee-Hall investigates and unravels the motivations and consequences of the
                    shifting tribal alliances. Through his examination of the intertribal factors
                    affecting the Black Hawk War, Hall uncovers an interesting and engaging story
                    that aids in understanding this historical event as a whole.

                As the title suggests, this work is a comprehensive look at the military make-up
                    of the United States Army in the War of 1812. Fredriksen provides brief
                    biographies of the commanders, including President and Commander-in-Chief James
                    Madison, nine major generals, and twenty seven brigadier generals, as well as
                    the constitution of over sixty artillery, cavalry, and infantry regiments.
                    Written in an encyclopedic format with an extensive bibliography, the book is
                    helpful as a research guide, scholarly reference, or conduit to further
                    reading.
                
                Millennial Praises A Shaker Hymnal Edited by
                    Christian Goodwillie and Jane E Crosthwaite (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2009.
                    Pp. xiii, 298. Notes, bibliography, index, compact disc. $50.00.)
                Scholars who study the religious revivals that swept the American frontier at the
                    beginning of the nineteenth century have conducted some studies of the "new
                    repertory of folk hymnody" (p. ix) which emerged at the time, but this book
                    should convince them that their studies are incomplete without a consideration
                    of early Shaker hymnody in general, and the first published Shaker hymnal, the
                    1813 Millennial Praises, in particular. In excellent
                    introductory essays, the editors discuss the role of music and dance in early
                    eastern Shaker development, the rise of the hymn tradition in the younger
                    western Shaker communities, and hymn texts as a source of early Shaker theology.
                    The final essay reveals how the texts (which were printed by themselves in the
                    original hymnal) were paired with the tunes (often more than one to each text)
                    that appear in this volume. Anyone interested in the musical history of early
                            America should be fascinated by this meticulously
                    produced volume.

                    212. Notes, select bibliography. Paperbound, $19.95.)
                Written in a similar vein as works by James Fenimore Cooper, James Hall's
                    collection of short stories provides readers with rich fictional portrayals of
                    the western frontier. A prolific writer and politician from the early nineteenth
                    century, Hall depicted conflicted heroes, humanized Indians, and often violent
                    adventures on the Illinois frontier. Though less
                    influenced by truth than by fiction, Hall's short stories are easy to read
                    and certainly entertaining.
                Kentuckians in Gray Confederate Generals and Field Officers of
                        the Bluegrass State Edited by Bruce S. Allardice and Lawrence Lee
                    Hewitt (Lexington: University of
                    Kentucky Press, 2008. Illustrations, index. $40.00.)
                Those who understand the complicated place Kentucky held in
                    the war between North and South will appreciate this thoughtful examination of
                    the conflicted loyalties of the people and their state. In an effort to keep the
                    state neutral, officials failed to satisfy anyone and frustrated many who
                    considered the state critical to the outcome of the war. Even when the state
                    chose to follow Lincoln, its  citizens often
                    chose to fight for the Confederate Army. This volume contains mini-biographies
                    of the generals and field officers from the Bluegrass State who dared to fight
                    against their president, their state, and their neighbors. Kentuckians and Civil
                    War historians and enthusiasts will be delighted to have this complete resource
                    at their fingertips.
                Wanted-Correspondence Women's Letters to a Union
                        Soldier Edited by Nancy L. Rhoades and Lucy E. Bailey
                            (Athens: Ohio University Press, 2009. Pp. xx,

                At the age of twenty one, Edwin L. Lybarger was mustered into the Forty-Third
                    Ohio Infantry during the Civil War. Like many soldiers, he received letters from
                    home; however, the letters he wrapped in a ribbon and kept in the attic the rest
                    of his life were not from his family, as one might expect, but from a number of
                    young ladies. At its basic level, the collection of 168 letters published in
                    this volume shines light on the indispensable role letter writing played during
                    the Civil War. Fortunately for those interested in civilian life during this
                    period, the editors have provided us with a much richer analysis, from the roles
                    these letters played in war to the insight they provide of changing social
                    culture. In their introductory essay, the editors argue that young women's
                    letters to soldiers helped to relieve the "burden of camp life and terror
                    of battle" (p. xv), give the men higher status among their peers, and
                    connect the men with a life beyond the battlefield. While letters illustrated
                    the growing pains of young women faced with an uncertain adulthood, they also
                    served to highlight larger contextual issues and themes, such as "shifts in
                    women's access to and engagement with education, and events on the
                            Ohio home front" (p. xv). Scholars will be
                    pleased with the extensive secondary and primary research that supports this
                    highly readable volume.
                Lincoln's Political Generals By David Work
                            (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009.
                    Pp. ix, 287. Illustrations, notes, index. $34.95.)
                David Work sets out to examine the success of Abraham Lincoln's appointment
                    of political generals-men who represented their political party and important
                    constituencies, some with military experience, but none a graduate of West Point
                    or a career officer-throughout the Union Army. Lincoln deliberately chose men
                    from both major parties and from various ethnicities (in particular, German and
                    Irish). The author takes a sample of sixteen men-eight Democrats and eight
                    Republicans  from different regions of the
                    nationand follows them through the war, taking "into account all of their
                    activities" (pp. 3-4) in the administration of the war as well as in
                    battle. Four midwestern generals-Illinois Democrats
                    John A. Logan and John A. McClernand; Illinois 
                    Republican Stephen Hurlbut; and Ohio Republican Robert Schenck-are among the
                    sixteen in this study. Based upon all of his evidence, Work concludes that,
                    although few of his subjects distinguished themselves as battlefield commanders,
                    most of the political generals "provided capable and necessary
                    service" which "more than justified" Lincoln's policy (p.
                    234).
                A Republic in Time Temporality and Social Imagination in
                        Nineteenth-Century America By Thomas Allen
                            (Chapel
                        Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2008. Pp.
                    xiii, 275. Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. Clothbound, $59.95;
                    paperbound, $22.95.)
                Most works devoted to the development of our nation during the nineteenth century
                    have concentrated on the geographic movement that expanded our borders westward.
                    In this compelling work, Thomas M. Allen argues that spatial transformation was
                    less important in the imagining of America by its people than the
                    perception of time. By examining artifacts such as clocks, paintings,
                    literature, and scientific treatises, Allen contends that time was imagined in
                    three ways: a technological "clock time" that drove the newly
                    industrialized culture; a geological "deep time" that accompanied the
                    shift from biblical chronology to a much longer natural history supported by
                    Darwin and other scientists; and finally, romantic historical time that ushered
                    in the nineteenth century. This shift in thinking opens the reader to envision
                    more complex, and at times competing, ideas of what nationhood meant to
                    Americans during this period.

                Part of the "Very Short Introduction" series by the Oxford University
                    Press, this volume will be of interest to those seeking an concise overview of
                    Progressivism in America. Former University of Notre Dame and
                    Indiana University professor Walter Nugent provides readers with an engaging
                    overview of the origins, guiding principles, major leaders, and major
                    accomplishments of the Progressive Era. Lasting from the late 1890s through the
                    early 1920s, the reform movement associated with those decades was seen as a
                    reaction to the unchecked excesses of the Gilded  Age. Social activists, national leaders, and
                    investigative journalists such as Jane Addams, Theodore Roosevelt, William
                    Jennings Bryan, and Ida Tarbell, sought to improve the lives of the people by
                    fighting for increased workers' rights and better living conditions; they
                    designed and enforced anti-trust laws, ensured women's suffrage, and
                    ultimately created the foundation on which FDR's New Deal would later
                    rest.

                The author, an Indiana guardsman who served as a radio operator
                    with the Headquarters Company of the 150th Field Artillery during WWI, writes an
                    engaging day-to-day journal of his time as a soldier. Aided by the editor's
                    small additions of historical facts about troop movements and the war effort,
                    readers are treated to not only an individual's experience, but also the
                    history of World War I as a whole. The diary will captivate readers of all
                    genres of history.
                Unknown Soldiers The American Expeditionary Forces in Memory
                        and Remembrance Edited by Mark A. Snell
                            (Kent, Ohio: Kent State
                    University Press, 2008. Pp. xvi, 274. Illustrations, maps, notes, index.
                    $34.95.)
                Retired Army officer and history professor Mark A. Snell has edited this
                    intriguing volume of essays dedicated to the memory and remembrance of Gen. John
                    Pershing's American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) from World War I. Divided
                    into three sections, the book first examines how Americans have remembered,
                    commemorated, and interpreted the battles and soldiers that were part of the
                    AEF's history. The second section focuses more on the soldiers' own
                    experiences and the evolution of myths and legends created by post-war memories.
                    The last section explores the ways in which the AEF has been remembered in
                    popular culture. Snell's own chapter "The Price was Made and the Price
                    was Paid" highlights controversial and bitter moments in the construction
                    of memorials around the nation. One particularly harsh example was the funding
                    of the Indiana War Memorial Plaza, first created to memorialize veterans of the
                    Great War. However, the "Indiana legislature paid for the
                    memorial with funds intended for First World War veterans' bonuses"
                    (p. 22). Snell's scholarly volume is a valuable addition to any
                    library.
                
                The American Suburb The Basics By Jon C. Teaford
                            (New
                            York: Routledge, 2008. Pp. xvi, 271. Notes,
                    index. Clothbound, $95.00; paperbound, $24.95.)
                Jon C. Teaford's thoughtful overview of America
                    suburban culture explores the evolution of suburbia, acknowledging its
                    diversity, commerce, and governance, as well as the residential and planning
                    issues that often breed conflict within these liminal spaces. Teaford attempts
                    to deconstruct the myths and negative stereotypes that often plague perceptions
                    of suburban life. Those who reside in the northwestern part of
                            Indiana or around Indianapolis will particularly relate to the
                    author's discussion of housing prices, the socioeconomic differences
                    between suburbs, and the uneven tax burdens assumed by cities such as Hammond
                    and Whiting. Although this volume will appeals to scholars of twentieth-century
                    American life, it is engaging and easily accessible for those simply interested
                    in learning more about the urban sprawl that surrounds us.
                Fighting the Unbeatable Foe Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, the
                        Washington Years By Tom Diemer (Kent,
                            Ohio: Kent State University Press, 2008. Pp. xvi,
                    264. Illustrations, notes, bibliographies, index. $34.95.)
                With the rivals, campaigns, and ever-changing alliances that dominate politics,
                    Tom Diemer's biography of Ohio Senator Howard Metzenbaum captures
                    a compelling career and man. Known for his role as "Senator No,"
                    Metzenbaum persevered through his battles and achieved a long list of
                    accomplishments through this policy. Though focused on the senator's
                    political races in Ohio, Diemer also explores Metzenbaum's
                    position on such social issues as abortion rights and gun control. This is an
                    interesting story for anyone who enjoys Ohio history and
                    politics.
