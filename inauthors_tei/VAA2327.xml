                    <p TEIform="p">THE bachelor is held up to contempt because he has evaded the draft. He is a slacker.
                        He has side-stepped a plain duty. If he lives in the small town he is fifty per cent, joke and
                        fifty per cent, object of pity. If he lives in a city, he can hide away with others of his kind,
                        and find courage in numbers; but even in the crowded metropolis he has the hunted look of one
                        who knows that the world knows something about him. He is led to believe that babies mistrust
                        him. Young wives begin to warn their husbands when his name is mentioned. He is a chicken hawk
                        in a world that was intended for turtle doves. It is always taken for granted that the bachelor
                            <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">could</hi> have married. Of course, he might not have netted the
                        one he wanted first off. It is possible that, <pb id="VAA2327-010" n="2" TEIform="pb"/> later
                        on, circumstances denied him the privilege of selection. <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">But</hi> it
                        is always assumed by critics of the selfish tribe, that any bachelor who has enough money in the
                        bank to furnish a home, can, if he is persistent, hound some woman into taking a chance.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Undoubtedly the critics are right. When we review the vast army of variegated males
                        who have achieved matrimony, it seems useless to deny that the trick can be turned by any man
                        who is physically capable of standing up in front of a preacher or whose mental equipment
                        enables him to decide that he should go into the house when it rains.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">If Brigham Young, wearing throat whiskers, could assemble between thirty-five and
                        forty at one time, how pitiful becomes the alibi of the modern maverick that he never has
                        managed to arrive at any sort of arrangement with a solitary one!</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">We know that women will accept men who wear arctic overshoes. Statistics prove that
                        ninety-eight per cent, of all those you see on station platforms, wearing "elastics" on their
                        shirt-sleeves, have wives at home.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The whole defense of bachelorhood falls to the ground when confronted by the evidence
                            <pb id="VAA2327-011" n="3" TEIform="pb"/> which any one may accumulate while walking through
                        a residence district. He will see dozens of porch-broken husbands who never would have
                        progressed to the married state if all the necessary processes had not been elementary to begin
                        with, and further simplified by custom.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Even after he is convinced, he will stubbornly contend as follows: "Possibly I am a
                        coward, but I refuse to admit that all these other birds are heroes."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">At least, he will be ready to confess that any one can get married at any time,
                        provided the party of the second part is no more fastidious and choosey than he is.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">These facts being generally accepted, the presumption of guilt attaches to every
                        single man beyond the age of thirty. And if, as the years ripen, he garners many dollars, and
                        keeps them in a hiding place which is woman-proof, he slowly slumps in public esteem until he
                        becomes classified with those granite-faced criminals who loot orphan asylums or steal
                        candlesticks from an altar.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Finally he arrives at a state of ostracized isolation. He has every inducement to be
                        utterly miserable, and probably would be so, except for frequent conversations with married men.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2327-012" n="4" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">At this point we get very near to the weakest point in the general indictment against
                        bachelors: Is it generally known that bachelors privately receive encouragement and approbation
                        from married men?</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Not from all married men, it is true. Not, for instance, from the husband of any
                        woman who happens to read these lines. But they do receive assurances from married men, of the
                        more undeserving varieties, that matrimony is not always a long promenade through a rose bower
                        drenched with sunshine. The word "lucky" is frequently applied to single men by the associate
                        poker players who are happily married.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The difficulty in rescuing the hardened cases of bachelorhood is that the
                        unregenerate are all the time receiving private signals from those supposed to be saved, to lay
                        off and beat it, and escape while the escaping is good. Many of them would have fallen long ago
                        except for these warnings.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">There are times when the most confirmed, cynical, and self-centred celibate,
                        influenced by untoward circumstances and unfavourable atmospheric conditions, believes that he
                        could be rapturously content as a married man, and that he <pb id="VAA2327-013" n="5"
                            TEIform="pb"/> is cheating some good woman out of her destiny. Conversely, the Darby who
                        wants the world to know that his Joan is a jewel and his children are intellectual prodigies and
                        perfect physical specimenseven this paragon, who would shudder at mention of a divorce court,
                        tells his most masonic friends that it must be great to have your freedom and to do as you darn
                        please.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">No matter which fork of the road you take, you will wonder, later on, if the scenery
                        on the other route isn't more attractive.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The bachelor, being merely a representative unit of weak mankind, isn't essentially
                        different from the Benedict. Probably at some time or other he wanted to get married and
                        couldn't. Whereas, the married one didn't want to get married and was mesmerized into it by a
                        combination of full moon, guitar music, and rolyboly eyes.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">A poor wretch who had lived under the stigma of bachelorhood for years once confided
                        to several of us that he was all ready to be married at Columbus, Ohio, in 1892, and then
                        learned that it would cost at least eight dollars to put the thing over.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Bachelors are willing to be segregated or even <pb id="VAA2327-014" n="6"
                            TEIform="pb"/> separately taxed, but they don't wish to be branded with too hot an iron.
                        They come to regard themselves as potential married men who never received notice of their
                        inheritances. Married men are merely bachelors who weakened under the strain. Every time a
                        bachelor sees a man with an alpaca coat pushing a perambulator, he says, "There, but for the
                        grace of God, goes me!"</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Whatever excuses the bachelor may secrete in his own mind, the following definite
                        counts have been drawn against him:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">1st. It is the duty of every good man to become the founder of a home, because the
                        home (and not the stag boarding-house) is the cornerstone of an orderly civilization.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">2d. It is the duty of every high-minded citizen to approve publicly the sacrament of
                        marriage, because legalized matrimony is the harbour of safety. When the bachelor ignores the
                        sacrament, his example becomes an endorsement of the advantages offered to travellers by that
                        famous old highway known as "The Primrose Path."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">3d. It is the duty of every student of history and economics to help perpetuate the
                        species and protect the birth rate.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2327-015" n="7" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">These are the damning accusations. Any representative woman's club, anywhere, would
                        bring in a verdict of "guilty" against a notorious bachelor, in two minutes, without listening
                        to witnesses.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The moment a man marries, the indictment is quashed. For the time being, he is snow
                        white. A little later, after the divorce proceedings, he may become speckled, but he never sinks
                        quite back to the degraded estate of bachelorhood.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">He tried to be a good citizen.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Having an altruistic and almost Chautauquan regard for home and the marriage
                        sacrament, and feeling that someone had to step forward and save the birth rate, he put aside
                        all considerations of personal convenience and, like a sun-kissed hero, stepped to the edge and
                        jumped over the precipice.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Yes, he did! You know he did!</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Here is what happened:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The dear old goof found himself in immediate juxtaposition to The Most Wonderful
                        Woman in All the World. When she smiled at him, his blood pressure went up twenty points. When
                        she appeared to forget that he was among those present, he wanted to rush into the street and
                        lie down in front of a. He hovered <pb id="VAA2327-016" n="8" TEIform="pb"/> near her, every
                        night, until ordered out. Then he reeled back to his den, stepping from one cloud to another. He
                        sat up in the still hours of the morning to write notes which elected him even if, later on, he
                        had wanted to welch. He arrived at his office without remembering what had happened since he
                        left home. He tried to dictate letters, and nothing came from him except gurgles. He wondered
                        what was happening to Her. In the telephone booth only about eight cubic feet of airpartial
                        asphyxiation after twenty minutes. But who wouldn't be willing to die, with the sound of that
                        Voice strumming in the ears, like an Eolian harp hanging in the gateway of Paradise?</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Now, when Waldo finally got married, does any one really insist that he did it
                        because he was prompted by a sense of his duty to provide food and lodging for a member of the

                    <p TEIform="p">Did he calmly decide to give his endorsement to the sacrament of marriage and to help

                        Those who like to refer to "my man" are compelled to get new ones every few weeks. Probably the
                        lonesomest job in the world, next to taking care of a lighthouse, is to valet an unmarried man

                        every bachelor knows a few married women; but these women are not pursuing him that is, not all
                        of the time. Once in a while they pursue him in order to find out what has become of their

                    <p TEIform="p">The bachelor is a polite outcast, and he knows it. The married folks tell stories
                        about him, and it is all for the best that he never hears them. For instance: "I helped him off
                        with his overcoat when he came in. We wondered why he didn't follow us into the living-room. I
                        went back and found him standing in the hallway. Yes, indeed, waiting for his check! When the
                        children came in to meet him, he trembled like a leafthought they were going to kiss him. When
                        he sat down for dinner he inspected the knife and then wiped the plate with his napkin. After
                        dinner the maid found a quarter on the tablecloth."</p>

                        brother-hood of man and go to the mattress at night knowing that you have rendered service to
                        some of the fellow travellers. The more you camp by yourself the more you shrivel. The curse and
                        the risk of bachelorhood is the tendency to build all plans around the mere comforts and
                        indulgences of the first person singular.</p>

                        The most fatiguing <pb id="VAA2327-029" n="21" TEIform="pb"/> activity in the world is that of
                        roystering. It is terrible to be fed up on roystering. Almost any group of case-hardened

                    <p TEIform="p">Bachelors do not regard their respective caves and caverns as modified cabarets.
                        Their so-called home life is merely a recognition of the physical fact that no one can entirely

                    <p TEIform="p">The "jolly bachelor" in his own retreat is often just as jolly as a festoon of crape.
                        He is not discontented. He is calmly reconciled. But not celebrating.</p>

                        on a lonely island and not a sail in sight.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The bachelor doesn't have to watch the clock, and no one is waiting to ask him where
                        he has been; but how about that rapidly approaching day when he will not findin all the world
                        ham and eggs that are cooked just right or coffee fit to drink?</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">As the autumn days grow shorter, and each milestone begins to look more like a
                        tombstone, the bachelor becomes less and less declamatory regarding the joys of single

                        these and thirty other good reasons made il utterly impossible for him even to think of playing
                        such a ghastly joke on a nice woman.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">He is there with a defense; but when you ask him to add up the net blessings and

                    <p TEIform="p">SOME people think that the first purpose of motoring is not to travel but to arrive.
                        The driver who carries his help-less victims from Buffalo to Albany in one day goes about
                        accepting congratulations, whereas he should be hauled into court.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Nothing emitted herewith must be regarded as a narrow-minded, pedestrian protest
                        against motoring in general. The joys of life may be made to increase with the multiplication of
                        cylinders. The privilege of cutting across country and the diversion of travel from stiff and
                        straight rail lines to shadyby-waythese are real boons.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Attack is being made only on those motorists who are obsessed with the belief that
                        because a car can hit up fifty-five an hour, it is hanging back when it does a measly
                        thirty-five, and who further count up the result of their tours by the miles instead of by the
                        smiles. The main idea with the road-whippets seems <pb id="VAA2327-035" n="27" TEIform="pb"/> to
                        be the necessity of registering at some far distant point within a highly sporting time limit.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Probably the man at the wheel gets most of the zest to be derived from the
                        performance. He feels that exultation which accompanies the controlling and directing of mighty
                        energies. By hanging over the gear he steadies himself physically, and he finds mental
                        employment in repeatedly solving the problem of how to avoid sudden death.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">If you like that kind of motoring, by all means claim the privilege of driving. Then,
                        when the car turns turtle, you will have some-thing to hang on to besides a Blue Book.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">If you are a back-seat passenger, with a cargo rating the same as that of a suitcase,
                        a thermos bottle, or a golf bag, you will find yourself rock-a-byed through whirling landscapes,
                        and realize all the time that you are merely a limp Some-thing, riding on the winds of Chance.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The driver seems grimly confident that he can always zip within eight inches of the
                        car which comes tearing head oninsanely seeking a collision. How superb of him not to give more
                        roadway than the other fellow gives! And will it be a first-page story, with photographs and the
                        names in black caps? Or will it be bunched <pb id="VAA2327-036" n="28" TEIform="pb"/> with the
                        other casualties of a busy day on the bloody highways?</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It seems that the driver himself is never frightened. He is too busy boring a hole in
                        the atmosphere to consider the other people in the car. Their nerves may be kinked into hard
                        knots, and their eyes may be protruding, and their hearts may be suspending action for thirty
                        seconds at a stretch, but what wots it? The delirious chauffeur is having the time of his young
                        life.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Usually, one of the sufferers is the owner of the car. He is simply excess baggage.
                        His only privilege is to produce more money at regular intervals.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Besides, he knows that a classy driver and a high-powered car are both deeply
                        insulted at the very mention of a speed limit. If held down to twenty-five miles an hour, they
                        feel that they have been demoted and had their stripes cut off. They are publicly shamed when
                        they take the dust of cars costing one thousand dollars each, or even less. What is the use of
                        going on the road unless all of the white-faced spectators along the route can be properly
                        impressed?</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">These must be the facts, because we know that only a few persons, possessed of
                        abnormal <pb id="VAA2327-037" n="29" TEIform="pb"/> cravings, <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi"
                        >like</hi> to travel at top speed. Yet the rarest sight in the world is a long-waisted,
                        ex-pensive car moving through a rural district at a sane and safe and sensible pace. It is
                        always trying to arrive at some point, one hundred miles ahead, before six o'clock in the
                        evening.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Among the back-seat victims may be found at least one Invited Guest. When he is asked
                        if he objects to stepping along on high, he supinely answers, "No."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">To be auto-shy and favour a moderate gait is evidence of moral inferiority, the same
                        as being seasick or wearing woollen underwear.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Probably persons really alive never come so near to being dead as when they fall out
                        of a motor car at the end of a jolly 200-mile spin.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">"Spin" is the word. They know how it feels to be a gyroscope. The blood of each is
                        congealedpartly because he has been folded away in a cramped posture, and partly because he has
                        been visualizing himself as the central attraction of a large funeral. The intellect and the
                        emotions are in a totally benumbed state. Memory is a mere blur of shimmying houses and reeling
                        telephone poles.</p>

                        stay-at-homes that, after taking a late luncheon at Upper Swattomy, he arrived at Manchester in
                        time for dinner.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">When a person travels at the speed rate or dained by all high-salaried drivers, he
                        sees nothing much except the roadway. So far as relaxation and instruction and gentle diversion
                        are concerned, he might as well be put into a hollow projectile and fired out of a big Bertha
                        from one city to another.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">If he could take a large sleeping powder and lie down in the bottom of the car, after
                        leaving a call, he would be in better condition at the end of the run, because he would not be
                        compelled to put in several hours unspiralling his nerves.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It is well known that the start of a long run is always delayed. Every car that you
                        see burning up the pike is in danger of being late at the next important destination, thereby
                        losing caste.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">We spill the golden hours with prodigal fool ishness, until we find ourselves in an

                        are tense. They stare straight ahead through the disfiguring goggles. They are halfcrouched, to
                        fight more successfully the onrushing current of air.</p>

                        against dare-devil drivers. It should be oath-bound and effective, the same as the Ku Klux Klan.
                        Declaration must be made that the purpose of motor touring is to bring enjoyment to all
                        occupants of the car, even if the driver does earn the contempt of Ralph de Palma and Barney
                        Oldfield.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The maximum rate of speed should be thirty-five miles an hour. The moment the

                        been used professionally in all of our large cities since the world was made safe for democracy.
                        Just as the indicator passes the thirty-five-mile mark, each passenger will take a firm grip on

                    <p TEIform="p">WHEN a man cannot be anything else, he can be dignified. Dignity is the sure-fire
                        asset of the twenty-two calibers.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The physiognomy must be stern and rock bound. It is better to wear dark clothes. The
                            <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">vox bumana</hi> should be keyed low.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">All horse-doctors, phrenologists, and justice! of the peace are dignified. Also the
                        head floor walker. Also the village embalmer.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">In every community there are citizens who are useful only as background to a public
                        speaker. The visiting celebrity and the pitcher of water are at stage-centre, and the local
                        examples of Dignity are in minstrel formation hinda massive border of self-conscious rectitude
                        and wisdom. They have brain-lobes exactly the same chemical composition as kohlrabi. But they
                        look like the Council of the League of Nations.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">All during the vocalizing they gaze at the <pb id="VAA2327-051" n="43" TEIform="pb"/>
                        speaker with a heavy and frowning simulation of interest. Each smile bestowed upon a pleasantry
                        is painful compromise.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">They have been hand-picked to provide a draping of gloom to the proceedings, and they
                        never wander from the assignment.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Sheathed in the armour-plate of Dignity, many a counterfeit travels undetected from
                        the grammar-school to the grave. Probably no one, except his wife, is ever on to him.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Nine times out of ten, a godlike demeanour may be regarded as the facade of a Greek
                        tem-pie opening abruptly into a one-room bungalow.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Dignity was invented to mask the absence of I works.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Some men are silent while brooding over the solemnities of life and others are silent
                        because I they haven't anything to pass out through the I window.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Profound calm and an air of abstraction may I prove that the subject is meditating on
                        the I Lodge theory of life beyond the grave or they I may indicate that a short circuit has been
                        established between the cerebellum and the I medulla oblongata and all the cylinders are I
                        missing.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2327-052" n="44" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">Only those who have moral courage can stand out in the presence of Dignity and be
                        frivolous and deliberately normal. The man who fights off the temptation to be dignified must
                        expect an inferior rating. Only the connoisseurs will identify him as a hero.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Nevertheless, avoid the blight of Dignity. Don't use any of it. The whole
                        world-supply is needed in Great Britain.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Dignity received a body-blow when the frock coat went out.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The dancing-craze, and golf, and Roosevelt, and the Eighteenth Amendment, and other
                        influences have weakened the cult. Bourbon whisky supplied many an old-time lawyer with the
                        Dignity which is supposed to impress juries,</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Doctors are no longer identified by their whiskers, and college professors are
                        becoming approximately human. Is it not true that the young man in the box-office at the theatre
                        is less like King Solomon than he was a few years ago? Piano-tuners are more affable. There is
                        hope.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">For a grand total of forty-five years I have been revising my judgments and watching
                        the parade.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">What a privilege to happen along just when things are eventuating! All the early
                        regrets at having missed the Civil War are forgotten, now that I have lived to know Theodore

                    <p TEIform="p">The period between 1871 and 1916 has been so full of readjustments and rapid
                        adaptations, one is ready to believe that for fifty years before the dawn of this golden era
                        people did nothing much except sit around and wait.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It is all so wonderful that I feel like telling the story to the dear young people
                        who never saw bustles or box-toed boots, and possibly never heard a throaty tenor, with oil on
                        his hair, sing "Juanita."</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">When we regard the long and unvaried existence of the Democratic party or a redwood
                        tree, we know that a very brief span has elapsed since Horace Greeley thought he was running
                        against U. S. Grant, and yet that campaign seems almost as remote as the Punic Wars.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">All that we cherished in '72 has been moved to the attic.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">So far as I can testify, and as I do verily believe, nothing much happened previous
                        to 1870. The world at that time was all prairie and cornfields, except for the white houses of
                        the county seat and a dark line of timber against the horizon.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">There was a railway in front of our house at the edge of town. Beyond the railway ran
                        a country lanegray and rutty in dry weather, black porridge every spring.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">As for the railroad, the soft metal of the rails was dreadfully snagged, and the
                        locomotive was mostly smokestack.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Wagons, canopied with white, toiled through the mud, all headed for Kansas and
                        Populism.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It was only a short cut across fields to unbroken prairie that never had been touched
                        by plough.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Every township in the Middle West should <pb id="VAA2327-056" n="48" TEIform="pb"/>
                        have reserved and parked one square mile of the prairie, leaving it just as the settlers found
                        it. It was a grassy jungle matted with flower gardens. Tall perennials shot up their gummy
                        stalks and waved broad, fibrous leaves. A traveller leaving the beaten road found himself
                        chin-high in a rank growth of blue and yellow blooms.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">We have gasolene chariots now, and clothes ordered from the catalogue, but the glory
                        of the open country has departed, save for a vivid patch here and there at some neglected
                        corner.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">When I was a boy, the explorer could start from anywhere out on the prairie and move
                        in any direction and find a slough. In the centre, an open pond of dead water. Then a border of
                        swaying cat-tails; tall rushes; reedy blades, sharp as razors, out to the upland, spangled with
                        the gorgeous blue and yellow flowers of the virgin plain.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">A million frogs sang together each evening, and a billion mosquitoes came out to
                        forage when the breeze died away.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Did you ever try to elude the man-eating gallinipper by sitting in the smoke of a
                        "smudge"? A smudge was an open fire, smothered with damp leaves or fresh grass.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">Anopheles</hi> mosquito, purveyor of malaria, <pb

                        fever entered into the programme of every life; but those who chattered thought they were being
                        jounced by the hand of Providence.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The "smudge" is gone, and quinine is no longer a staple.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The sloughs have gone, and after years of tile drainage and the levelling processes
                        of cultivation, the five-acre pond on which we skated is just a gentle swale in a dry and tidy
                        cornfield.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Thirty dollars an acre is no longer a boom price. Offer the man two hundred, and you
                        fail to interest him.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Geese and brant, mallards and red-heads, prairie chickens and quailso plentiful that
                        the hunters brought in wagon loads. We used to tire of quail potpie and long for meat from the
                        butcher's.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This is not Saskatchewan or Oklahoma that we are describing. This country of croaking
                        frogs and black mud and myriad flocks of wild fowl was so near Chicago that one night in
                        October, just as far back as I can reach into the past, we sat on the fence and looked at a blur
                        of illumination in the northern sky and learned <pb id="VAA2327-058" n="50" TEIform="pb"/> that
                        the city which we had not seen was burning up in a highly successful manner.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Squeaking loads of grain filed by our place on their way to the elevator. Many of the
                        drivers wore army overcoats of ultra blue.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Coming out from town, it was a sportive custom to gallop the horses, while the driver
                        stood erect in his wagon box and let out staccato yelps. In those days the rural desperado drank
                        his whisky undiluted and sent a periodical defi to the town marshal.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Some of the old comrades held on to their blue overcoats for an incredible number of
                        years, but now both the comrades and the blue capes have been laid away, and the country saloon
                        has been killed dead by the church women, and there is no bottled nourishment left anywhere
                        except in the quiet cellars of the well-to-do.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It was only a few ticks back on the long clock of eternity, and yet it was an era of
                        melodeons, tin lanterns, clumsy vehicles, and stick candy striped with cinnamon.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The first lessons learned were those of political hatred. We studied our Nast
                        cartoons before we tackled the primer. I know now that Samuel J. Tilden was a courtly old
                        gentleman who lived in Gramercy Park, but in '76 he was <pb id="VAA2327-059" n="51" TEIform="pb"
                        /> a snorting demon with eyeballs like coals of fire.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">How our elders held to the old grudge against Copperheads and Knights of the Golden
                        Circle! The traitors attended church and travelled the straight and narrow, but they could not
                        cover the blackness of their souls with boiled shirts.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">We believed that if the Democrats won, the blacks would be returned to slavery, the
                        rebels would be pensioned, the earth would slip on its axis and the whole solar system would be
                        disarranged.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">What has become of the partisan who wore the oilcloth uniform and carried the smoky
                        torch? He is circulating a subscription list and trying to get the Chautauqua back next year.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Where are the girls who wore the white dresses and rode on the decorated hay wagon
                        and squealed for Hayes and Wheeler? They are in session at the assembly room of the Carnegie
                        Library, trying to follow Amy Lowell.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Between 1870 and 1880 1 came to know a small town dropped down in the comparative
                        lonesomeness of the corn belt. That is why I find myself setting two pictures side by side.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">One is the town of the seventies. It was garnished with mud, bordered by wooden
                        sidewalks and dimly marked against the night by coal-oil <pb id="VAA2327-060" n="52"
                            TEIform="pb"/> lamps. The general store was a congress of odours emerging from open crates
                        and barrels. The front of every cubical house was a sealed tomb, with lace curtains mercifully
                        screening the gilt frames and varnished monstrosities.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Against this picture I set the sophisticated county seat of to-day. To begin with:
                        Pavements, curbs, and hard sidewalks, because we learned twenty years ago that these, and not
                        literary clubs, are the primary essentials of civilized existence. The motor cars whiz by each
                        summer nightan endless parade under the arc lights. The show windows and shops are expositions
                        of decorative art. The house shaped like a cube has grown wings and borders, and has a roomy,
                        vine-draped veranda.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">When one is looking back from fifty, no doubt he should mark the growth of tolerance,
                        the quadrupled interest in books and magazines, the slow death of political hatreds, the gentle
                        evaporation of religious bigotry, the laudable craving to know more about the rest of the world
                        (either by travel or hearsay), the reversal of the verdict on higher education and scientific
                        methods, and all those side-lines of evolution which have converted the simple villager into a
                        keen little cosmopolite.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2327-061" n="53" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">The change is there, and those who don't think so are invited to visit a small town
                        and try to put something over.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">But when I motor past the old corners, the never-ending surprise is to find these
                        people, who camped out among the swamps a few years ago and led a sort of skillet and axe
                        existence, now placidly enjoying their kitchen cabinets, cream separators, phonographs,
                        telephones, tractors, pumping engines, threshers that feed the sheaves and stack the straw and
                        measure the grain, running water at the kitchen sink and a bathtub upstairs, R. F. D. boxes, and
                        whole flocks of automobiles, and not seeming to know they are implicated in a set of miracles.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">If the boys of to-day are going to look down from their biplanes in 1950 and pity the
                        pioneers of 1916, the question is, how far do we go before we slow up?</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">In the eighties I came to know the inland college and tasted the excitements of a
                        town large enough to have a Grand Opera House.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The school at which I served my term called itself a university, because it was not a
                        college. Later on it became important, but thirty years ago, borrowing some scornful descriptive
                        from an Eastern educator, it did nothing <pb id="VAA2327-062" n="54" TEIform="pb"/> much except
                        issue catalogues and gasp for breath.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The sequestered college of the eighties calls for a bit of looking back. We thought
                        we were about six feet behind Yale and Harvard, but we didn't even have a yell. The equipment
                        was meagre and, although we could show some first-class men in the faculty, the curriculum had
                        not yet developed to the specializing stage, and we took our medicine from a few large bottles
                        bearing stock labels.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Student life was almost primitive. We lived in a dormitory and roached our hair and
                        went to "literary" meetings. We had no organized athletics with coaches and trainers and a
                        modern gym. The clubs and frats in their spacious homes, the daily paper, the bulky "annual,"
                        the glee club, dramatic clubs, May festivals, the university band, the student union, and the
                        twenty other activities that now complicate an undergraduate career were all in the future
                        tense.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The photograph of the senior wearing the single-breasted "Prince Albert" and the
                        gates ajar collar and the quilted cravat is like a message from another world.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Since I took my degree, the young men, not <pb id="VAA2327-063" n="55" TEIform="pb"/>
                        only in colleges but also in the large and small towns and the cities, have been going keener
                        and keener on outdoor life and organized sport. The young fellow who expects to inherit some
                        money from his father finds himself out of the fashion if he puts in too many hours at the
                        pool-room. He tries for some sort of team if he has the ghost of a chance, and he must slam a
                        fairly good game of tennis and be somewhat better than a duffer in golf.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">When an old grad takes me by the arm and says, "I want you to meet my kid," I take it
                        for granted, in advance, that the youngster will be deeper in the chest and squarer at the
                        shoulders and more of a husky in general than Dad used to be in the days when our principal
                        daily exercise was popping corn over a gas jet.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Here is a change in which we may take real satisfaction. The child of fortune is no
                        longer flabby, and he has stopped using perfumery.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">If I had to select one adjective to describe the rounds of existence in the smaller
                        settlements thirty years ago I think I should favour the word "mopey." I mean the ante-trolley
                        days, when gasolene was used for removing grease spots and the Acme Photo-Play Theatre was still
                        a feed store.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2327-064" n="56" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">I seem to have progressed on the decimal system. From '70 to '80 I was a small-town
                        question mark. Between '80 and '90 I wore tight trousers and began to see the great world. From
                        '90 to 1900, I did exactly ten years on a Chicago newspaper. During the next ten years I
                        travelled to far-away countries, beyond the circulation of newspapers containing reviews of the
                        plays I had written. If we are going to be geological, I suppose the ten-year stratum now being
                        laid would be classed as the serene period of agriculture and golf.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">In 1890, Chicago was a mining camp, five stories high. It was owned by the gamblers.
                        What I seem to remember most clearly of that all-night and wide-open time is that the minor
                        courts were controlled by agents of crime. The poor man, unprotected by an alderman, was
                        helpless when the vultures swooped down on him. No wonder we had anarchists.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">I knew my Chicago twenty-five years ago, and it was some laboratory! New England
                        still regards it as an area unrelated to the study of botany, but the Chicago of to-day, as
                        compared with the Gomorrah of World's Fair year, is a cross-section of the millennium.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The courts are beyond the reach of the crooks <pb id="VAA2327-065" n="57"
                            TEIform="pb"/> The night life consists mostly of going to one's room and reading a book. The
                        voters want good government, whether they get it all the time or not.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">I am not disposed to brag of the spindly skyscrapers, but it is worth noting that
                        Chicago, by persistent and conscious effort, has made Michigan Boulevard one of the show streets
                        of the world, and is going ahead with big plans for cleansing and beautifying a huge and
                        unwieldy town.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Looking back from fifty, it seems that every year has been kicked full of dust by our
                        efforts to improve physical conditions.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The times show an easier standard of morals and, strangely enough, a better average
                        of behaviour. People are dancing more and drinking less. It is no longer sinful to play cards or
                        go to the theatre, which looks ominous to some of the old-timers, but while we have been
                        yielding to the lure of bridge and musical comedy we have evened up the score by forgetting all
                        about original sin, predestination, and babies being toasted on pitchforks.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">We discuss in books and portray on the stage the secrets of anatomy, physiology, and
                        hygiene. Young women with tortoise-shell glasses gather <pb id="VAA2327-066" n="58" TEIform="pb"
                        /> around a samovar and tackle topics which a man would have been afraid to mention to his
                        doctor thirty years ago. And I am sure that in the glad Victorian days of what-nots and
                        hair-cloth furniture the spooning couple never got around to eugenics.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Let us not worry. It is a cleaner, bolder, more candid, less hypocritical world than
                        it was in the days of the yappy seventies.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The most popular occupation seems to be fighting some kind of disease. Every active
                        man gives part of his time to outside work which is quite unselfish. The fact that many appeals
                        are being made and that you and I respond to them, as people have never got together before,
                        ought to encourage us to believe that we are not as depraved as our relatives believe us to be.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Our country's unselfish work in the Philippines, Porto Rico, Cuba, and Panama has
                        been one of the amazing and soul-warming exhibits of our time. Several nations calling
                        themselves highly civilized, and regarding Americans a mercenary Yankee traders, did not believe
                        that a powerful Government could deal with a humble and unprotected race except for purposes of
                        exploitation. Even now they think there is a catch or a trick somewhere and that we are nursing
                            <pb id="VAA2327-067" n="59" TEIform="pb"/> in the background some vast scheme for making
                        money out of our little black and brown brothers. Uncle Sam made up as Santa Claus does not
                        strike them as a convincing characterization.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The trouble is, they do not know us. While we were pulling for France and Great
                        Britain and the perpetuation of democracy, we were supposed to be getting rich making shrapnel.
                        And yet, 999 out of every 1,000 Americans wouldn't know shrapnel from scrapple if they saw it in
                        a show window.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">I have put in most of my fifty years getting acquainted with my fellow citizens. I
                        have seen them at home and abroad, scattered and bunched. A good many of them are provincial,
                        especially congressmen, and a lot more have been fed on misinformation; but, take them as they
                        run, they are kindly and fair-minded and always trying to work back to the main road.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">There is more brotherhood of man at large than ever before. That is my conclusion,
                        looking back from fiftywar or no war.</p>

                        clothes. The minute they get out of the range of a throbbing orchestra they begin to bleach,
                        fade away and shrivel to the relative unimportance of a goldfish floating on its back.</p>

                        so the popular song and the light opera were invented. As the musical taste of succeeding buyers
                        developed and improved, light opera became lighter and lighter until at last they had to weight
                        it down keep it on the piano. There came a time when the manufacturers were prohibited under the
                        Pure Food Law from using the opera label. They had to call the output something or other, so
                        they compromised on "musical comedy."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Musical comedy has done a great deal for our fair land. It has depopulated the
                        laundries, reduced the swollen fortunes of Pittsburgh, and bridged the social chasm between the
                        honest working girl and the pallid offspring of the captain of industry.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It has taught William Shakespeare how to take a joke. It has developed a colony of
                            <pb id="VAA2327-072" n="64" TEIform="pb"/> angels and incidentally it has given the
                        foot-power piano an excuse for being.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">A good musical comedy consists largely of disorderly conduct occasionally interrupted
                        by talk. The man who provides the interruptions is called the librettist. I would advise any man
                        who hasn't the nerve to be a foot-pad or is too large to get through a transom, to become
                        librettist.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">The so-called music of musical comedy must be the kind that any messenger boy can
                        learn to whistle after hearing it twice. At the same time it must satisfy the tall-browed critic
                        who was brought up on Tschaikowski and Bach. As for the dialogue, it must be guaranteed to wring
                        boisterous laughter from the three-dollar patron who has a facial angle of thirty degrees, and a
                        cerebellum about the size of an olive; also it <pb id="VAA2327-073" n="65" TEIform="pb"/> must
                        have sufficient literary quality and subtle humour to please the dead-head who is sitting in the
                        fourth row with a hammer in one hand and a javelin in the other.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Every young man who goes into the libretto business thinks he is going to
                        revolutionize the American stage. He is going to begin where W. S. Gilbert left off. He gets a
                        fountain pen, a pad of paper, and a few pounds of opiate, and then he dreams it all out. He is
                        going to write a musical play with a consistent and closely connected plot, an abundance of
                        sprightly humour and nothing said or done that would bring the blush of shame to the cheek of
                        the most sensitive manager.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">His getaway is usually very promising. By way of novelty he has an opening chorus. A
                        lot of people are standing around in aimless groups there in the green sunshine. Occasionally
                        the green sunshine changes to amber. They tell all about themselves and explain their emotions.
                        Then the principals begin coming on and tell why <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">they</hi> are
                        present, and the wedding is announced and the people in front begin to get a faint outline of
                        plot. This goes on for about ten minutes until a beautiful blonde, who was educated for grand
                        opera and then changed her <pb id="VAA2327-074" n="66" TEIform="pb"/> mind, suddenly says,
                        apropos of nothing in particular, "Oh, I am so happy to-day I could sing my favourite song,
                        'Won't you be my little gum-drop?'"</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">That is what is known as a "music cue." That is where the author goes into the side
                        pocket and the producer becomes the whole proposition.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">First the beautiful blonde sings it all by herself. Then the beautiful tenor with
                        talcum powder all over his face comes out and helps her. Then the refined comedian, recently
                        graduated from vaudeville, breaks in and they do the gum-drop number as a trio. The soubrette
                        arrives, merely by accident, and the song regarding the gum-drop now becomes a quartette. Then
                        eight young ladies in Spanish costumes come out and sing it, introducing a dance. Then eight
                        young ladies in white are lowered from the flies and they sing it while hanging in the air. Then
                        the lights are turned out and the entire company sings it in the moonlight. Then the sunshine is
                        turned on again and all sing it by daylight.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The man who leads the orchestra is a mindreader. He knows that the public wants more
                        verses of the gum-drop song whether it applauds <pb id="VAA2327-075" n="67" TEIform="pb"/> or
                        not. This is what is known as the "noiseless encore." The reason he is so willing to respond to
                        encores is that he wrote the song.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">At last, after the entire company has sung and danced itself into a state of
                        staggering exhaustion, and even the iron-handed ushers have become satiated, the whole covey
                        disappears and that grand old annoyance who shows up in every musical play, the bride's father,
                        wanders on the stage and tries to collect the shattered fragments of plot. Of course nobody pays
                        any attention to him. All the people in front are lying back limp and groggy, trying to recover
                        from the excitement of that gum-drop affair. They have forgotten all about the fragment of
                        "story" that showed up a half hour before. Father, however, starts in to remind the audience of
                        the wedding day and the bride and the birth-mark and the picture in the locket and the other
                        essentials, and just about the time he is getting a foothold the Egyptian dancers glide on and
                        everything is once more floating upside down in the air. The morning newspapers say that the
                        plot did not seem to be well sustained.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">Musical comedy has educated the public. When it was first introduced the American

                        You'll Remember Me," "When the Corn is Waving, Annie, Dear," and "The Gypsy's Warning." The

                        on a roof, with songs which would be suppressed by the police if the police could fathom the

                        He had a genius for character acting. As a storyteller he was delightful beyond all description.
                        Whenever he appeared on a rostrum, the auditorium was jammed with well-dressed people leaning
                        forward. His readings brought him many dollars and gave happiness to the kind of "folks" for
                        whom he had an affection. And yet, for many years, he refused to go on tour.</p>

                        deliver the show, and then drift back to the hotel and go to bed, I wouldn't mind the trouping.
                        The trouble is, in every town the arrangers get hold of me. They are the nicest people in the
                        world and they are bursting with unselfish designs. They surround me with committees and exhibit
                        me. They put me into clammy spare bedrooms and tempt me with huge portions of rich food. They
                        keep me up at night. They crowd in on me and talk to me about the pieces I have written. They
                        smother me with kindness. I never have discovered any tactful method of convincing them that 1
                        would like to be let alone. After enduring all forms of hospitality, I have learned that to
                        escape the horrors of being entertained, I must remain in quarantine."</p>

                        the arteries and enthusiasms begin to harden, and the joints to creak, and the diet list is more
                        important than the dance programme, judgment is inclined to warp at the edges; and charity,
                        instead of falling like the gentle dew from heaven, has to be applied with a force pump.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This is no attempt to give a clean bill to the crabbed elders. Let us even admit that
                        a prejudiced statement is about to be made to a prejudiced jury. Mark off forty per cent, on

                        contrast between the rising generation of now and the simple urchins of then, so far as
                        environment and daily experiences are concerned, is simply a book of miracles.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">In the first place, the young ones of fifty years ago who lived in the small towns or
                        out in the farming regions were really in the country. Not only geographically, but removed from
                        urban influences.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Nowadays we haven't any out-in-the-country. The telephone, the R. F. D., and the
                        motor car have cooperated to cut out distance, until every villager lives just across the street
                        from the city fellow, and every farmer lives next door to the villager. Also, there is the
                        radio.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">If you were to take an average working girl of Boston, a girl of corresponding social
                        importance from a small city in Ohio, and the daughter of a well-to-do farmer in the corn belt,
                        and stand the three of them in a row, attired in their most circus regalias, each of them
                        short-skirted and <pb id="VAA2327-096" n="88" TEIform="pb"/> high-heeled and hair-dressed
                        according to her own specifications, you couldn't tell which was which, unless the country girl
                        should betray herself by putting on too much face powder.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Political economists and legislators are worrying because there is a steady movement
                        of population from the farming regions to the cities. But the real phenomenon is the
                        citification of all the country people. You can sell more gold bricks in upper Broadway now than
                        you can in Nebraska, and the more careful students of big-league averages are the boys who loaf
                        around the grain elevator. Why shouldn't the farm hand be as slick as the floorwalker? He sees
                        the same moving pictures.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Let us get back to the boys and girls of fifty years ago. Except for a few
                        silverspoon favorites in a few residence avenues in a few cities, the young folks were not
                        acquainted with luxuries. Take any one of my colleagues as a fail sample. In the summer he wore
                        as few clothes as possible, went barefoot until the meadows were silvered with frost, fished in
                        tiny "cricks," and splashed in muddy swimming holes, picked up an occasional nickel as a reward
                        for unwilling labour, and came to regard a stick of candy or a bag of peanuts as a kind of
                        holiday spree.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2327-097" n="89" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">Rural communities were not organized for recreation and entertainment in those days.
                        No Chautauquas, no band concerts, no intertown ball leagues, no community coliseums, no
                        basket-ball games, no high-school track meets.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Far apart on the map were county fairs. One circus a summer was a high average.
                        Christmas tree at the church, firecrackers on the Fourth, a magic lantern show at the town hall
                        these helped to add an occasional high spot to the monotonous level of village life.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">For weeks at a time every country lane and every town street would be a mush of mud
                        or a jumble of frozen ruts. The speed rate of wheel vehicles was three or four miles an hour.
                        The town ten miles away was off in another world. We were a race of snails and lived mostly in
                        our shells. As nearly as can recall, the adult population devoted all summer leisure to sitting
                        Bon porches and all winter leisure to sitting by red-hot stoves.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">In cold weather we boys went about in bob-tailed suits and Eskimo caps, and warped
                        boots which failed to join up with the "pants." The homemade yarn "comforter" exploded into
                        bright colours at each end, and the mittens were connected by a cord hung around the neck.</p>

                        a profound ignorance, but he understands from those who were there, that the wildest dissipation
                        of the offspring of wealth was going to dancing school, while the other young ones were not so
                        different from those of us out in the villages, except that they could look at the Indians in

                        that the greatest pageant of progress and the most terrific conflict of forces ever witnessed by
                        man have been staged for our especial benefit. Villages have grown to cities, and each city has
                        become a metropolis. The material devices which transform all the routine of life have been
                        crowded into just a few decades. We have been kept busy for a half-century providing storage
                        space for long-distance 'phones, arc lights, giant locomotives, talking machines, half-tone
                        printing processes, mail-order catalogues, refined vaudeville, the merchandising methods of
                        great department stores, the Bessemer process of making steel, skyscrapers, motor cars, flying
                        machines, wireless telegraphy, golf, the germ theory of disease, telepathy, the enfranchisement
                        of women, and so on for a couple of pages.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Back yonder we had in our home a "what-not," a couple of sea shells, a melodeon, some
                        hair-cloth furniture, a wood-burning cook stove, and a few other incidentals, including the
                        bootjack. Now, every modern home is a museum of wonders; a complex demonstration of what may be
                            <pb id="VAA2327-100" n="92" TEIform="pb"/> achieved by the ingenuity, the imagination, and
                        the skill of the cleverest people in the world. Just around the corner is the moving-picture

                        the war, the complicated developments of the silent drama, a working knowledge of sports and
                        pastimes, a list of the modes and fashions, all the popular songs which pour out of the

                    <p TEIform="p">Second: In any city above 100,000, the haircut is more important than a consciousness

                    <p TEIform="p">Putting up a front involves:</p>

                        hinterland do not see the real New York. We arrive in a jam and remain in a bedlam, surrounded
                        by squealing orchestras, lolling loungers who live to dance or dance to live, jabbering waiters,
                        pages who look like mechanical toys, while all of the intervening spaces are filled in with
                        non-residents who have temporarily lost the importance which attaches to them at their various

                        and supping and roof-gardening and play-going and shopping into one short week disarrange our
                        temperaments and disqualify us to render cold judicial opinions; granted that the cosmopolitan

                        similar premise, and still the question is: "Why should New York City be classified as the

                        the doorkeepers at the clubs can be dated back to little New England towns or Western farms. The
                        streams of business activity converge toward the great seaport, and they were wise enough to set
                        their nets where the waters meet.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">But the Great Myth is not founded upon New York's importance as a merchandising
                        centre. It assumes that the only true happiness in the U. S. A. is to be found lurking somewhere
                        between the Battery and Yonkers. We who live outside are supposed to believe that life without
                        cabarets is drab indeed. How far away St. Louis seems when one is almost in the immediate
                        presence of the latest discovery in show girls! And what a line upon the general New Yorkness of
                        things to reflect that only a few years ago this same reigning queen was a waitress in St.

                        ragged-edgers and almost-somebodies than we may ever hope to assemble in our inland cities.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Why does New York get them? Because they are the willing victims of that ancient and

                        window and there are no turnstiles guarding the primrose path.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">They find it convenient to get into an atmosphere where front may be made a

                    <p TEIform="p">Constantly they delude themselves into believing that they are finding the thing they
                        seek. The hallucination that New York <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">must</hi> be the nearest earthly
                        approximation to Heaven has been so hammered into them that they are afraid to deny it, even to
                        themselves. When they are walking on their spats and waiting anxiously for luncheon invitations,
                        they continue to be grateful that they are not back in Grand Rapids.</p>

                        financiers, and keen professional men and clever, publicspirited women who give the metropolis
                        its real fibre. Quite true. The real New York is a wonder. The men and women who actually direct
                        the mainspring influences of New York are well-dressed, well-mannered, well-poised, and
                        acquainted with the rules for good living.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Many of them are self-centred, except when a great upheaval, such as the recent war,
                        gets them out of their narrow orbits. Most of them are inexcusably ignorant regarding their own
                        country. They share, with the polite riffraff and the uncounted thousands of city yaps, a serene
                        belief that Providence has been kind to them in permitting them to live in New York. Newspapers
                        and magazines and plays have fed them the same insidious propaganda that lures the village
                        Keller who thinks he is a twelve-o'clock feller in a nine-o'clock town.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">If a man goes to New York because he can make more money there than anywhere else,
                        that fixes his alibi, but does not touch upon the real merits of the case.</p>

                        indignant denials will come not only from Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, but there will be
                        shrieks of protest from New Orleans and San Francisco, and even Chicago may refuse to remain
                        silent.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The truth is, there has been a standardization of first-class hotels and restaurants
                        throughout the world. Catering is no longer an old-world secret. There are competent managers
                        and trained chefs and luxurious suites in dozens of growing cities which the stay-at-home New
                        Yorker still classifies as frontier towns with dance halls and shooting affrays.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Furthermore, the Eighteenth Amendment has been a great leveller. Even while the chief
                        asset of Gomorrah is disappearing, the true champion of New York boasts that those who are known
                        to Henri, the head waiter, can get it in a tea cup for $1.50. And after you have enveloped it,
                        you hold on to the table and wonder whether you will try another dance or take a little ride in
                        a white ambulance.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">Most New Yorkers travel in the wrong direction. And in making up their estimates they
                        too often overlook the fact that inland America is now fairly crowded with people who know their
                        New York and their London and Paris and Rome.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Furthermore, the New Yorkers who have unlimited money and leisure spend at least
                        eighty per cent. of their time at country places, down in Florida, or over on the Riviera. These
                        trunkdwellers use New York principally to go to once in awhile and to refer to all of the time.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Having delivered these spiteful slams and side swipes, let us revert to the original
                        proposition: New York City is <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">immense,</hi> in the full significance
                        of the wordour prize exhibit in the way of cities and the logical destination of every
                        tall-grasser who has a bank roll and an aching desire to throw it at something.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">We who live out where the plaster is green on the walls and the original settler is
                        still talking politics, derive a very sentimental satisfaction from rambling into the corners of
                        New York which are redolent of history. Even the comparatively modern structures are Parthenons
                        to us. We do not require a Fraunce's Tavern or the house in which Aaron Burr <pb
                            id="VAA2327-123" n="115" TEIform="pb"/> courted one of his many widows. City Flail means
                        more to us than it does to Tammany.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The cottage in which Poe lived, and Gramercy Park, and the beautiful old Brevoort
                        House, where Jenny Lind came out and sang for the college students, are shrines to the
                        provincials, even if they are only street numbers to the people who ride by reading their
                        newspapers.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Above all else, possibly we remember New York as an embarrassment of riches.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">And the theatres! There are several hundred show-shops, each with coaxing lights in
                        front of it, and at least a dozen of the new things have been especially recommended. Ziegfelds
                        to right of us, Dillinghams to left of us, and a lot of Barrymores in between.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Because a town is big and alluring is no reason why it should he regarded as the best
                        sort of home. The spirit of neighbourliness seems frozen out of the air in New York City. The
                        stranger doesn't feel that he is getting any friendly glances. He wonders what would happen to
                        him if he should drop dead. Probably <pb id="VAA2327-124" n="116" TEIform="pb"/> the people
                        would step over him and grumble a little at the obstruction.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">New York is full of underlings who are frightened to death if you step up and address
                        them as human beings. They have been dehumanized and put into the white-rabbit division under
                        slow pressure from imported customs, snobbish practices and false systems of classification.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">In New York, more than in any other large city in the world, wealth is over-manicured
                        and perfumed and too freely decked with gauds. It is more Oriental than Yankee.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Once more, no one denies the presence in New York of a substantial filling population
                        which is representative of all the best qualities of the best American citizenhood. But the
                        flash, vulgarity, and self-advertising of new wealth are more in evidence than are the rugged
                        New England traits.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">That is why it is such a relief to escape, after a week or ten clays, and get out

                        of the evidences that an overwhelming majority of the residents are not getting very much out of
                        life.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">We can find no satisfaction in regarding a juvenile population compelled to use the
                        streets as playgrounds. We would not be comfortable in such a mess of stunted and warped and
                        disproportioned lives.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The most ignorant and inert persons I have ever encountered in North America live in

                        introduction. For the first time it occurs to him that he might have burned the letter. He
                        wishes that he had done so.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">No one knows who laid down the rule, but it is sacred and binding! He who comes with

                        degree of wealth and social position and previous conditions of provincialism.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The United States of America is the only country producing farmers, small-town
                        merchants and schoolma'ams who have the ambition and the courage to exchange their hard earnings
                        for the benefits of foreign travel. In all other lands, motor cars and steamship tickets are
                        outward evidence of wealth. Can you imagine an English governess or a French peasant farmer
                        drawing all the money from the bank and going on a spree of spending?</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The whole of our domain was settled by intrepid pioneers who picked up and left
                        stagnated communities somewhere east of us. The wanderlust is a rightful heritage. Furthermore,
                        we have the money with which to make our dreams come true, provided we do not dream on too large
                        a scale.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">But, when we go moving about by the thousands and hundreds of thousands, we certainly
                        do provide entertainment for the side lines.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">We start out with an over-developed reverence for landmarks and traditions. Each
                        pilgrimage is apt to take on the hue of a business proposition. <pb id="VAA2327-137" n="129"
                            TEIform="pb"/> We must load up on assorted facts and "broadening influences" each day, so as
                        to get our money's worth. All ways and means are permissible when one is eagerly searching for
                        knowledge and "local colour" and has a time limit hanging over him.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Therefore we see Presbyterian matrons, who will not attend the movies back home,
                        calmly sizing up the wicked antics of a Moulin Rouge, and never a flutter. We must not conclude
                        that travellers leave their morals at home. They are simply playing the game from all angles,
                        and sightseeing covers a multitude of irregularities.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Are most travellers ill-mannered? Nojust a little fussed-up by the consciousness that
                        they are giving the party and someone is holding out on the refreshments.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The American traveller who battles at all times for value received is a rarity. Our
                        British cousin has been acknowledged champion in getting everything that his ticket called for,
                        and a little plus. Sometimes he seemed to feel that the seat by the window and the luggage racks
                        were his because Britannia rules the Waves. That logic does not always appeal to a Yank who is
                        already wearing the black-and-blue souvenirs <pb id="VAA2327-138" n="130" TEIform="pb"/> of a
                        jolly outing. Whereupon, the <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">entente</hi> is strained and a second
                        battle of Bunker Hill seems impending. It takes more than a world war to get that fifty-fifty
                        idea accepted by one type of traveller.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The average American on tour is reasonably patient and trying to worry himself into
                        having a good time. One trouble with him is that he tries to be friendly with subordinates who
                        are accustomed to crisp commands. He has not acquired the adamantine "front," combined with the
                        oleaginous <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">savoir faire,</hi> which enables the crafty old-timer to
                        get what he wants without wrestling for it.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The American away from home is said to be a braggart. This is one of those
                        crystallized misconceptions, the same as the side whiskers of the Englishman and the ruffled
                        shirt of the Frenchman. When an American <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">does</hi> speak up for his
                        native land, perhaps he has been goaded beyond endurance. For every voluble person there are
                        three or four who are tongue-tied and lonesome and completely out of war paint.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Women get more enjoyment and profit out of travel than the men get. Perhaps the very
                        best example of tourist is the woman who has prepared for the outing by years of inquiry
                        regarding <pb id="VAA2327-139" n="131" TEIform="pb"/> history, languages, customs, art,
                        architecture, and music. The only Americans who can speak the foreign languages so as to get
                        along are the women and the college girls. Their French is not the boulevard article, but they
                        make it work. As for dear old Father, he cannot understand "<hi rend="i" TEIform="hi"
                        >Outi.</hi>" He has been joking Mother for years about her club activities, but when she gets
                        him into the old cities she shows him up. At least she knows Michael Angelo was not Irish, and
                        can pronounce the name of the hotel so the driver will compranay.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">"Don't Worry" should be painted on every piece of luggage. Travelling together
                        through the dark woods of an unfamiliar region is the supreme test of compatibility. Prolonged
                        propinquity induces irritability. Solitary confinement with another person present is a terrible
                        punishment. The greatest risk of travel arises from too much forced companionship. Happy and
                        much out of the ordinary is the wanderer who doesn't get fed up on his playmates.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">We feel compelled to travel in groups, and the members of the party are literally
                        thrown upon each other for hours and hours at a time. Someone has to manage and be spokesman,
                        and if he can hold the job to the satisfaction of all <pb id="VAA2327-140" n="132" TEIform="pb"
                        /> the persons concerned, he is a seven-times wonder.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">If there is a "Wait-a-Minute" in the bunch, he or she can organize a constant strain
                        of ill feeling. Have you ever met Mr. or Mrs. or Miss Wait-a-Minute? The whole expedition is set
                        and ready to move and the marching order is given, and then there is a jam and a maddening
                        delay. The Wait-a-Minute, after sitting around for thirty minutes and doing nothing whatsoever,
                        has suddenly discovered that the post cards must be mailed, the camera loaded, and the shoes
                        brushed up, and the handkerchief of yesterday exchanged for a fresh one, and the guide book
                        unpacked, etc., etc.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">If travellers act loony (and they do) probably two thirds of the afflictions which
                        threaten to unhinge reason are wished upon them by friends and relatives. Every clay a hundred
                        petty problems present themselves. They are of no importance whatever except to an overchafed
                        imagination. Regard them with smiling indifference, and you ride over without a bump. Keep on
                        tearing the hair and wringing the hands and, after a while, every mole hill will look like the
                        Himalaya Mountains.</p>

                        friend and travel mate and say, "Comrade, I have inspected you at close range until your
                        well-known personality has lost all the charm of novelty. I could write a book on the technique
                        which you employ in opening eggs. The slightly audible effects which you originate when
                        gathering coffee from the cup have ceased to be music to my ears. I know that your character is
                        still unimpeachable and you have lost none of the rugged virtues which give you a high standing
                        in our golf club at home, but I am dead weary of seeing your Adam's apple in action. In other
                        words, dear friend, you have got on my nerves, and I have no doubt whatever that you would be
                        happy to gaze at a landscape once in awhile without discovering me in the foreground wearing the
                        same old suit of clothes. Therefore I suggest that, at the next stop, you go to the Continental
                        and I will go to the Bris<hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">tol</hi> and each will do as he blame pleases
                        for three days, and then, when we get together again, we can look at each other without
                        shuddering."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The tantrums which the amateur traveller exhibits when he is far from home could be

                        omit the tin megaphone. Many of the ladies living in Europe twitter instead of talk. We haven't

                    <p TEIform="p">Returning to the woman who was wearing her winter stuff in Singapore. Somewhere back
                        yonder she had been a small-town pillar of society. The recently departed had left her in
                        possession of a comfortable house of the Hayes and Wheeler period. She had money in the bank and
                        was a guiding influence in club life and her spiced watermelon rinds had received many
                        encomiums.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">She was a reader of books and magazines and <pb id="VAA2327-148" n="140" TEIform="pb"
                        /> was not entirely numb to the calls of romance and adventure. She had aspirations. A woman
                        without positive aspirations never would have arrived at the Raffles Hotel, Singapore.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It has become quite the fashion for those who think they are sophisticated travellers
                        to rag and ridicule the bewildered first-timers who are stumbling their way through foreign
                        lands.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">"Where do they come from?" you hear. "Why does it happen that all the yaps in the

                        that way? We never see such freak specimens back home!"</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The answer being, of course, that they are not freaks or yaps until they are
                        violently separated from the local routines, the established connections, the fixed habits of
                        eating and drinking and recreation, and all the other regularities of some placid and
                        wind-shielded community.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">But remember this: When you bump against the American barbarian in Tokio or Cairo or

                        ahead and make real sacrifices and endure hardships in order to travel and find out <pb

                        he wouldn't be there at all!</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The woman at Singapore was a comedy figure, but also she was the emblem of blasted
                        hopes. The rating which she had laboriously established back in Whiffletree did not help her
                        when she joined the other circumnavigators. They never had seen her house with the pillars in
                        front or read the evening paper accounts of the fetes on her "spacious lawn." When the factions
                        began to form, she was marooned. Finally, the travellers became so weary of looking at one
                        another and putting up with the maddening social errors of their unspeakable countrymen, that
                        they revolted and demanded refunds, and every separate group hied off by itself, leaving the
                        haggard manager and the panic-stricken widow camped on the veranda of the Raffles Hotel.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">He offered her money and transportation, but she refused them. She could not travel
                        alone. She had been promised an escort to protect and advise her, so she sat and wept and held
                        out for the terms of the contract. When we sailed for Hong Kong she was still there, and the
                        manager was waiting for a steamer and gradually submerging his Chautauqua habits under Scotch
                            <pb id="VAA2327-150" n="142" TEIform="pb"/> whisky. That's no way to wind up a story, but
                        the point of the episode is that the woman was a picturesque and aggravated example of the
                        Yankee abroad.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">She never had coached herself to be adaptable and accept new conditions with an
                        amiable philosophy.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">She found herself computing by the Adams County standards of weights and measures.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Every new traveller far from home is a victim of Fear. That is why his manners and
                        his mental processes become temporarily abnormal and he falls under the ridicule of those who
                        are sitting at ease, in their accustomed environment, watching him perform.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">One kind of traveller yields abjectly to this fear engendered by strange
                        surroundings. He acknowledges the hopelessness of the situation, and becomes dumb and
                        unresisting. He holds out a handful of money to the shopkeeping bandit and says: "Take what you
                        want."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Another kind tries to hide his fear under a loud combativeness. Battling with strange
                        weapons, and not knowing any of the rules of the game, he still hopes that he may exhibit enough
                        of the conquering American spirit to save him from utter humiliation. He demands <pb
                            id="VAA2327-151" n="143" TEIform="pb"/> itemized statements, and is much given to putting
                        down in a small book the names and numbers of cab drivers who overcharge him. He tells those who
                        are plucking him that he knows the American consul. They are seldom thrilled by the information.
                        He gives himself a good many unhappy minutes and loses more battles than he wins, but, at least,
                        he is entitled to the credit of trying to prove that not over ninety-nine per cent, of the
                        migratory Americans are movable targets and that any one is welcome to take a shot.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Then there is the kind who tries to conceal all the misgivings and trepidations under
                        an hysterical affectation of gayety. The kind who speaks out freely in order to prove that he or
                        she is not to be smothered under the formalities of the <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">table
                        d'hote.</hi> Whereupon, the French eyebrow is elevated and the mackerel eye of Merrie England
                        becomes even more glazed than usual, and the speaker is classified "as one of those dreadful
                        Americans."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">As a matter of fact, the speaker isn't dreadful at all. Just a little agitated and
                        beating against the bars. Indulging in a high-strung reaction against the chilling regulations
                        of an over-ripe civilization.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">The American in a strange country is certainly a ruffled-up and fluttery bird of
                        passage. But, like the erring sister in the sentimental song, he is "more to be pitied than

                        carries a gun. The coercive methods of the Anti-Saloon League were effective because congressmen
                        and state legislators were deadly afraid of the weapons carried by the League. And they wouldn't
                        have been afraid of these weapons if they hadn't already checked up the sentiment regarding
                        "booze" in every precinct which they represented. They signed any kind of a pledge put in front
                        of them because they had the trembles every time they thought of the farmer vote and the church
                        vote and the imminent votes for <pb id="VAA2327-159" n="151" TEIform="pb"/> women. A lot of them
                        would just as willingly have voted for wood alcohol in order to save their various little

                        vitality than the flat-dwellers of the cities. Look at the mortality statistics. Study the death

                        substitute for the shower bath. Most of our country relatives who are walking with canes and
                        praying for relief from racking pains are simply in need of the dentist.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">No man ever acquired bodily vigour by remaining away from the cities. And no other

                        loses his hold on outdoor activities and starts to take things easy. He will become fat and slow
                        and ponderous and creakyenjoying no intermediate stage between youth and old age.</p>

                        enough to have a couple of movie theatres and paved streets. It is a good town, but it is set to
                        a slow tempo. The prominent citizen we are <pb id="VAA2327-164" n="156" TEIform="pb"/>
                        considering will live three or four blocks from his place of business. If he walks down town in
                        the morning the chances are that he will adjust himself to the moping gait of those who are
                        headed in the same direction. Or he may, in order to avoid even the pretense of limbering up,
                        ride down in the family "jit" and leave it parked out in front. He visits the post-office and
                        pauses on the corner to talk about nothing in particular. His principal occupation during the
                        whole day, next to that of garnering a few dollars, is to avoid getting his blood into
                        circulation. If it is winter, his office will be frightfully overheated, and he will intensify
                        the atmosphere of comfort by smoking a few cigars. His days are devoted to heavy sitting around
                        indoors. Does he tramp across country with a gun, or heroically work in the garden whenever he
                        can, or go horseback riding? Not one in one hundred does anything of the sort. He is too busy
                        laying the foundations of "rheumatism" and "stomach trouble"twin Bolsheviki of the corporeal

                    <p TEIform="p">One of the reasons why golf is going to the small towns, to remain there, is that
                        countless thousands of small-towners need it, and it is the only open-air game which will appeal
                        to them forever and ever.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">You have heard it called a "rich man's game." That is because so many clubs adjacent
                        to big cities have to use a lot of fancy real estate, and are extravagant in the management of
                        the clubhouse and the course, and pay fancy salaries. The dues and assessments in many of these
                        clubs have terrified the player of moderate means. In the meantime, the little ninehole clubs in
                        the smaller towns have continued to do business. The public courses, operated by municipalities
                        and usually charging a small playing fee, are congested with players from dawn until dusk.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">In Scotland the clerk or mill hand returns from his work at 5:30 p. M. or
                        thereabouts, has his tea and seed cake, and goes out on the "links" and plays 18 holes, for the
                        twilight does not thicken until after nine o'clock. He has his supper after the game. A set of
                        clubs <pb id="VAA2327-166" n="158" TEIform="pb"/> will last him for years. He will average
                        several rounds to every ball used up. Would Scotland tolerate a game intended for spendthrifts?
                        Don't ask foolish questions.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">With the gradual cutting down of the working day in America, the Saturday
                        half-holidays, the dull intervals in both factory and farm towns, when all business is condensed
                        into a few "rush hours" each week, don't you see that we have thousands of men and women of all
                        ages who will be candidates for golf every summer afternoon and evening? Furthermore, for these
                        house dwellers to get into the free open, with the springy turf under their feet, and the green
                        stretches ahead of them and the ecstasy of contest tugging at their heartsit will be a God's
                        blessing to every one of them.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The hard roads and the multiplication of moderate-priced cars have squeezed the rural
                        communities into a close brotherhood. Every man who lives within twenty miles of a golf course
                        can get from his desk to the first tee within an hour. The city man with membership in a
                        suburban or country club will average at least an hour from his office to the clubhouse.
                        Therefore, when you figure on supporting memberships for clubs that will soon be organized <pb
                            id="VAA2327-167" n="159" TEIform="pb"/> you must understand that the town fifteen miles away
                        is just the same as across the street.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">And when golf once gets into a community it isn't a flare-up that fades away, like
                        archery or ping-pong. It becomes as intrinsic as the mating instinct and as perennial as the
                        Masonic fraternity. The blamed thing isn't a "game" at all. It is a life work. When a man
                        consecrates himself to it, he is liable to slacken up on all other obligations. That is why it
                        is in order to announce: "Look out for your husbands! Golf is coming."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Returning to our text and hammering it in, point by point, after the manner of
                        theologians, golf is going to take up a permanent residence in the provinces, because there
                        aren't any provinces any more. The boulevard highways and the wife-driven flivvers, to which
                        reference has been made, and the long-distance phone and the R. F. D., and the mail-order
                        catalogues, have made every farming township a suburb of the city. The man in the country who
                        has money will spend it for electric lights, tailor-made clothes, grapefruit, Galli-Curci
                        recordsalso fancy chocolates and bonbons mixed at one dollar per throw. When it becomes evident
                        to him that golf is a reasonable luxury to which he is <pb id="VAA2327-168" n="160" TEIform="pb"
                        /> entitled, he is not going to balk because of money considerations.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Don't overlook the fact that the folks who live in the small towns are more closely
                        upon the heels of new events than ever before. One month after Mr. Ziegfeld produces a new
                        "Follies" in New York, all of the young folks in our neighbourhood will be dancing to the latest
                        tunes invented by Gene Buck and Irving Berlin and appraising their relative merits.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Do you know that late in the nineties there was a sudden and terrific increase in
                        attendance at all colleges and universities, especially west of the Alleghanies? There are five
                        times as many college-bred men and women living in the rural communities of America as there
                        were in 1890. In the townships near my post of observation there must be ten times as many. Most
                        of these ex-collegians do not believe that they must move into the cities in order to be
                        successful and happy. A great many of them are farming, on a large scale and according to most
                        revolutionary methods. They are just as alert and up-to-date and receptive to live propositions
                        as their classmates who took to the large cities. They read magazines of the right kind. They
                        know what is happening in all parts of the <pb id="VAA2327-169" n="161" TEIform="pb"/> world.
                        Any one who classes them as "yaps" proves that he has a Sunday supplement education.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Now, the fact that community leaders everywhere have begun to inquire about the
                        Scotch invasion, and to wonder if it will take in their neighbourhood eventually, is the best
                        possible evidence that golf courses will hereafter multiply on an increased ratio. Those who do
                        not wish to be tempted and fall must refrain from flirting with golf even in their day dreams.
                        The investigator first endures, then pities, and then falls hard. The tantalizing cajoleries and
                        postponed realizations can hardly be described to those who know of golf merely as a sweeping
                        blow at a small ball with a slender implement made of iron and wood. They must find out for
                        themselves, and then it will be too late. Fooling with golf is like taking hypodermic injections
                        of morphia just to find out if there is a resulting sensationonly you finish in a lockerroom
                        instead of a sanitarium.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Golf is catholic in appeal, the same as ragtime, high-heeled shoes, and chewing gum.
                        It is like the black locust, growing bravely wherever it is planted.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">In any community that has a population of <pb id="VAA2327-170" n="162" TEIform="pb"/>
                        regular human beings who are not hard up for money, and who can steal a little time from the
                        treadmill, the conditions are already ripe for the organization of a country club which shall be
                        a live social centre and a grand rejuvenator for all those who are becoming attached to their
                        shells and sufferings from atrophy of the spirit of youth.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The greens are eighty per cent, of a golf course. You can have a tall flag pole, and
                        a pillared palace for your social doings, and a Scotch "pro" with knotty wrists and a Harry
                        Lauder dialect, and the most beautiful young women of the countryside pouring tea on the
                        veranda, and comfortable benches at every tee, and alluring vistas of trees and water and
                        spangled wild flowers, but if you haven't true and velvety greens on which the little pellet
                        will speed straight from the club without jump or deviation, you will have no moral right to
                        advertise your social organization as a golf club. You will simply be a promoter of profanity
                        and a procurer for the lower regions.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">On every course the tees should be neat and well surfaced, the boxes cleanly painted
                        and always supplied with good sand, the direction flags fresh every season, the greens ready for
                            <pb id="VAA2327-171" n="163" TEIform="pb"/> putting. When a man is playing golf he shouldn't
                        be called upon to look at anything displeasing, except the fellow who is licking him.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">To make the turn at the far end of a golf course and then, starting homeward, to look
                        out across the spread of vivid green, the matted hillocks gleaming on one side and shadowed On
                        the other, the trim fairways contrasting sharply with the jungled neglect of the "rough," every
                        line of vision saved by some attractive interruption before it dares to become monotonous; just
                        enough movement by white-clad players to put a touch of life into an otherwise sleeping
                        panoramait is great! It is, unless you happen to miss your drive, in which case the whole
                        picture resembles one of Gustave Dore's illustrations of Dante's "Inferno."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">If you are going in for golf, and of course you are if you get a chance, use your
                        influence to make the local course a delight to the eye. Golf is play, even if it does look like
                        work, and the scientists are right in urging that we keep our souls in condition by leaning up
                        against the true and the beautiful. The confirmed golfer feels a boyish happiness when he stands
                        at the first tee of a well-planned and well-maintained course. He is impatient for the feel of
                        the turf under his <pb id="VAA2327-172" n="164" TEIform="pb"/> heavy shoes and the unfolding
                        charms of the successive avenues, each picturesquely different from the preceding, and arousing
                        within him a tingling hope of glory to be achieved.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It is true that he may come in a couple of hours later walking on his knee caps and
                        putting the duffer's curse on Saint Andrew, but all that temporary grief is merely incidental to
                        the career. The heartbreaks are quite transitory, and next day the struggler is back in the
                        lockerroom putting on his gayest duds and straining at the leash, because at last the day has
                        arrived on which he is going to sting the ball and give it a ride, somewhat after the manner of
                        Harry Vardon.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The man who wrote "The Pleasures of Hope' must have been an early golfer. Likewise,
                        the writing person who said something about Of all sad words," etc., might have received his
                        inspiration by listening in at the nineteenth hole.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It is a game of restraint, of relaxation, of calm concentration, of easy and
                        deliberate planning, instead of mere smashing through by youthful strength. That is why the man
                        of seventy will often trim his grandson of twenty, who prides himself on being an "athlete." You
                        can't get anywhere in golf merely by having lumps on <pb id="VAA2327-173" n="165" TEIform="pb"/>
                        your arms. You need a judgment of distance, a sense of rhythm, the temperament of a Chinaman and
                        a trained cordination of muscles and nerves.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The man who has played for thirty years still feels that he is standing on the
                        outskirts of golf waiting for someone to hand him a ticket of admission.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Because golfing skill is elusive and usually in the future tense, the game never
                        loses zest and no one ever put it aside as something accomplished and done with.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">And then, best of all, coming back to the principal asset of the gameit is the only
                        outdoor pastime which middle-aged and elderly men may play with abiding interest for hours at a
                        time at almost any season of the year.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It is the only game which is an absolute diversion. The player who follows that ball
                        down the course, eager to get it into that tricky little cup, forgets everything else except the
                        methods to be employed in arriving at the flag. If he has a note falling due next day and sinks
                        a putt from off the green, he feels just as happy as the man who is holding the notepossibly
                        happier. Golf leads one away from domestic vexations and business worries. Sometimes the remedy
                            <pb id="VAA2327-174" n="166" TEIform="pb"/> is almost as agonizing as the ailment, but at
                        least the game differentiates our tribulations and adds the spice of variety.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Even those who become hopeless addicts are seldom able to explain why golf has such a
                        grip on them. One reason, as already suggested, is that the student is constantly drugging
                        himself with the belief that he is about to attain the unattainable. Nirvana is always about two
                        holes ahead. He never catches up with it, but he continues the chase until he holes out in a
                        cemetery.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Isn't it possible that another important secret of the game's popularity is that it
                        permits the player to progress, literally and geographically, instead of compelling him to
                        remain in one spot doing the same fool thing over and over again? Put a regular golfer on the
                        croquet grounds or in a tennis court, and he feels as if he were locked up in a prison cell. He
                        wants the big open spaces and plenty of elbow room.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Golf is a long journey on foot, with the fatigues and monotonies of pedestrianism
                        miraculously extracted.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It gratifies the instinct, which every man has kept over from his primitive
                        forebears, to get beyond the house walls and fences, and scout <pb id="VAA2327-175" n="167"
                            TEIform="pb"/> around bareheaded through fields and forests and along meandering "cricks."
                        It combines a communing with nature and the lust for victory, and that, it will be conceded, is
                        some combination.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It inveigles and wheedles and seduces lazy men into working like galley slaves and
                        forgetting that they are tired, so long as they have a chance to lug home the bacon.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">If you will watch the foursome holing out at the home green, you will notice that
                        when the last ball has blopped into the cup, the players suddenly come back to themselves. With
                        sagging shoulders and dragging footsteps and gusty sighs and laboured breathing they move
                        wearily toward the clubhouse, proclaiming to the blue sky above and the green grass all around
                        that they are dog-tired and all in. And the nineteenth hole has nothing on except Orange Pekoe!
                        Oh, well, perhaps it's for the best!</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">But they are going to get even with you country people for taking their Scotch away
                        from them. They are going to wish on to you a lot of drivers and brassies and spoons and middies
                        and mashies and jiggers and goose-necks and pulls and slices and tops and founders and skies and
                        sclaffs and dubs and chips and lofts and <pb id="VAA2327-176" n="168" TEIform="pb"/> run-ups and
                        bogies and pars and birdies and eagles. Don't you know what these words mean? Be patient. You

                    </head>
                    <p TEIform="p">INDIANA has a savour not to be detected in Ohio. It is decidedly un-Michigan-like.
                        Although it tinges off toward Illinois on the west and Kentucky on the south, the community is
                        neither nebulous nor indefinite. It is individual.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Indiana is not Out West or Way Down East or Up North or south in Dixie.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It is true that, west of the Platte River, Indiana is supposed to be under the wither
                        and blight of Eastern decay. Conversely, as one leaves Columbus, Ohio, and moves toward the
                        region of perpetual sea-food, he encounters people to whom Terre Haute and Cripple Creek are
                        synonymous.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The Hoosier refuses to be classified by those who lack information. He knows that his
                        state is an oasis, surrounded by sections. Our people are clotted around the exact centre of
                        population. Boston is not the hub. It is a repaired section of the pneumatic rim.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2327-181" n="173" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">When a state is one hundred years old (Indiana is beyond the century mark) it escapes
                        the personal recollections of the pioneer, and is still so young that newspapers do not burn
                        incense before the grandchildren of eminent grandparents.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">We have grown some ivy, but we have not yet taken on moss.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Indiana has made history, but it figures that the present and the future are more
                        worthy of attention than a dim and receding past.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Indiana has cemeteries and family trees, but does not subsist on them.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">If the Hoosier is proud of his state, it is because the state has lived down and
                        fought down certain misconceptions. Even in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the fact that Indiana
                        produces more gray matter than hoop-poles is slowly beginning to percolate.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">For a long time the Hoosier was on the defensive. Now he is on a pedestal.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Forty or fifty years ago the native son who went travelling owned up to an indefinite
                        residence somewhere between Chicago and Louisville. To-day the Hoosier abroad claims Indiana
                        fervently, hoping to be mistaken for an author.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2327-182" n="174" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">The Indiana man respects his state because it has grown to importance and wealth
                        without acquiring a double chin or wearing a wrist watch.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The sniffy millionaire and the aloof patrician do not cause any trembles in the state
                        of Indiana.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Even our larger cities have no thoroughfares shaded by the gloomy strongholds of
                        caste. Some of the more enterprising comrades are unduly prosperous, but they continue to reside
                        in homes.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The state is short on slums and aristocratic reservations. In other words, we are
                        still building according to specifications.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The number of liveried servants residing within the boundaries is incredibly small
                        and does not include one person born on the banks of the Wabash.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">We have a full quota of smart alecks, but not one serf.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Because Indiana is not overbalanced by city population and is not cowed by arrogant
                        wealth and has a lingering regard for the cadences of the spellbinder, an old-fashioned
                        admiration for the dignified professions, and local pride in all styles of literary output, the
                        Hoosier has achieved his peculiar distinction as a mixed type <pb id="VAA2327-183" n="175"
                            TEIform="pb"/> a puzzling combination of shy provincial, unfettered democrat and Fourth of
                        July orator. He is a student by choice, a poet by sneaking inclination, and a story-teller by
                        reason of his nativity.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Indiana has been helped to state consciousness because a great man arose to reveal
                        the Hoosiers to themselves. The quintessence of all that is admirable in the make-up of the
                        native was exemplified in James Whitcomb Riley.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">No wonder he was beloved and has become the central figure of our Walhalla. Why
                        shouldn't we be proud of our own kin?</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The state is full of undiscovered Rileys, inglorious but not necessarily mute.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Your passer-by looks out of the car window and sees the Hoosier on the depot
                        platform, necktieless and slightly bunched at the knees. According to all the late cabaret

                        migrations early in the nineteenth century. From the seaboard there was a movement to the west.
                        From the Carolinas and the mountain regions there was a drift northward across the Ohio River.
                        Indiana was settled by pioneers <pb id="VAA2327-185" n="177" TEIform="pb"/> who had the
                        enterprise to seek new fields and the gumption to unpack and settle down when they found
                        themselves in the promised land.</p>

                        promoters and professors, stock-breeders and Chautauqua attractions, cornfields and campuses. It
                        grows all the crops and propaganda known to the temperate zone.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">And the newspapers! The editor started in with "hell-hound" and worked up from that.
                        Indiana was the hottest cauldron in the national kitchen because the result of each campaign was
                        in doubt. Grant carried the state in 1872; Tilden captured it in 1876; the Republicans stormed
                        it in 1880 under the leadership of Garfield, and kept their banners planted on the dark and
                        trampled ground until 1884 when the Democrats made a furious charge under Cleve-land and
                        Hendricks and regained the position, holding it until 1888, when Benjamin Harrison and his home
                        guard repelled the foe. They were driven out in 1892 but the Republicans came back again in 1896
                        and clung for sixteen years!</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">In each presidential year there was a state election in October. The result of this
                        election was supposed to have an immense moral influence upon other wavering states. The

                        whirligig right in the heart of the raging storm. It was called the "pivotal" state. It began to
                        pivot early in the spring of each presidential year and kept on pivoting until snowfall.</p>

                        establishments of the comparative chances of the giants who were striving for the presidential
                        nomination. The newspapers, which from one year's end to another had no editorial policy except
                        to heap fulsome praise upon all representatives of their own party and throw poisoned javelins
                        at leaders of the corrupt and venal opposition, would begin breaking into italics and

                        unknown. If you lived in Indiana, you had to be a Republican, a Democrat, a floater, or a
                        helpless <pb id="VAA2327-196" n="188" TEIform="pb"/> female. The greenbackers, a hybrid growth

                        were plucked and put back where they belonged. By the way, "belonged" is the word. Every man
                        "belonged" to a party and loved to say so, in a loud and penetrating voice, while standing in
                        front of the drug store. The voter who never had scratched his ticket was a wayside hero and
                        sang his own praises. This is how he told it: "I'll vote for a yellow dog if he's runnin' on our

                        with a fluffy plume, and a torch shaped like a ballot-box. In the moneyed centres, such as
                        Lafayette and Terre Haute, the business men's club would go in for flambeaux, white plug hats,
                        and star-spangled umbrellas. All this was in June, mind younot September.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Campaigns were not engineered by chairmen in those delirious days. The voters
                        manufactured their own excitement. Party leaders simply galloped along the side lines and tried

                        and counter-marched until he was in a trancified condition, the same as a whirling dervish or a

                    <p TEIform="p">A county-seat rally in those days was ostensibly called for the purpose of gaining
                        votes. In reality it was a noisy demonstration of con-tempt for the opposition. It gave the
                        frantic <pb id="VAA2327-199" n="191" TEIform="pb"/> partisans a chance to get together and
                        further inflame their minds and nourish their prejudices. They wanted to hear the campaign
                        orator who could say the most scalding and vitriolic things about the contemptible and cowardly
                        marplots of the opposition.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The farmers drove for miles and miles across the prairie dirt roads to attend these
                        hate-feasts. Each wagon had a spring seat in front. Behind it were boards laid across, and
                        there, in the tail end, was a rocking chair for some withered grandpa or grandma whose remaining
                        vitality was still being exerted in the right direction. Down the dusty roads they came, wagon
                        after wagon, the men in dark store clothes of grotesque misfit, the women baggily gowned, and
                        the young folks rigged out in fearful and wonderful costumes of home manufacture. Usually each
                        township came as a solid delegation a long row of wagons decked out with branches of trees and
                        strings of cheap bunting, a martial band thumping away in one of the wagons, hand-painted
                        banners of a highly insulting character hoisted above others, probably one "float" built up from
                        a hay rack, with girls in white dresses and tri-coloured sashes to represent the states of the
                        union, and high in the <pb id="VAA2327-200" n="192" TEIform="pb"/> centre the goddess of
                        liberty, grinning benignly.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The heated imagination of those clays ran to allegory. I have seen as many as twenty
                        floats at a country rally, one representing a brutal Southern master flogging a Negro, another
                        showing gruesome figures of the Ku Klux, an-other depicting a boy in blue upholding the banner
                        of our candidates, and so on, all tending to keep alive the bitterness of the wartime and reveal
                        in picture form the malign schemes of the enemy.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">At a Republican rally the Democrats lined up to welcome these tableaux and jeer at
                        them. The repartee was usually direct and intensely personal. The town marshal and his
                        assistants had a busy time untangling the belligerents. By day the speechmakers shouted and the
                        glee clubs sang, while fifes and drums kept up their tedious but exhilarating thump and tootle.
                        By night the uniformed clubs trailed in torch-light parades, and when it was all over the
                        delegations rode homeward making night interesting with their whoops and howls.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">These rallies represented in the aggregate a tremendous expenditure of time, money,
                        vocal energy and spiritual essence, without changing very many votes. Probably ninety-eight per
                            <pb id="VAA2327-201" n="193" TEIform="pb"/> cent. of the voters in Indiana were rock-ribbed
                        in their adherence to one party or the other. They were almost equally divided. The election
                        went to the party that could capture the "floaters" or could rush illegal voters across from
                        Kentucky or by night train down from Chicago. The "floater" was usually an unlettered son of the
                        hazel brush, a village loafer or a large town hobo who craved either personal solicitation or
                        currency, and usually both. The "floater" held aloof from either party and pretended to be much
                        in doubt as to whither the call of duty led him. He felt flattered and saw himself in a new
                        importance when he could induce men of large affairs and tremendous standing in the community to
                        coddle him, hand-shake him and take him out for long walks at night.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">On election day the floater sat on a fence near the polling place and waited, still
                        pondering on affairs of state; still holding his head and trying to come to some decision. He
                        would be approached by a party worker, to whom had been assigned the delicate task of getting
                        Bill. Something like the following dialogue would ensue:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">"Hello, Bill."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2327-202" n="194" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">"How are you, Cap?"</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">"Voted yet?"</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">"Nope."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">"How you goin' to vote?"</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">"Well, I can't just make up my mind. Good many people been talkin' to me. Don't know
                        as I'll vote at all," and he looks down street, evading the gaze of the determined "Cap."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">"Bill?"</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">"Yep"</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">"I'd like to see you for a minute."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">"All right, Cap."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">He detaches himself from the fence with some difficulty and follows "Cap" across the
                        street and down the alley into a secluded poultry house, trailed at a not very respectful
                        distance by two or more gentlemen wearing badges that are not similar to the badge worn by
                        "Cap."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">What happens in the poultry house will never be known until the practical politicians
                        of Indiana begin writing their secret memoirs. But when "Cap" comes out holding Bill by the arm,
                        Bill has a ballot folded in his right vest pocket. "Cap" takes him on a dog trot to the polling
                        place. The friends of "Cap" block and interfere when opposition tries to crowd up and rescue
                        Bill; the "floater" is pushed in front of <pb id="VAA2327-203" n="195" TEIform="pb"/> the open
                        window; the ballot comes out of the vest pocket and is poked through the window. The judge
                        announces in a loud voice that Bill has voted.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Men of the "Cap" variety had a lot to do with carrying Indiana for one party or the
                        other until the Australian ballot law began to hamper individual enterprise.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Then the "floater" began to lose his relative importance. He could be fixed, but he
                        couldn't be delivered.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">New issues and new methods have gradually eliminated the old-time political madness.
                        At one time campaigning was the only form of public entertainment known in our state. Now we
                        have the movie theatre, the coloured supplement, the radio ear-muffs, the street carnival,
                        baseball, and band concerts. The bitterness of the war period has evaporated and newspapers try
                        to soothe rather than to agitate. Republicans no longer hate Democrats. They do not so much as
                        pity them. They simply regard them as the less interesting features of the landscape.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">MEN and women in all parts of our spread-out domain, the men especially, cherished a
                        private affection for Mark Twain. They called him by his first name, which is the surest proof
                        of abiding fondness. Some men settle down to kinship with the shirt-sleeve contingent, even when
                        they seem indifferent to the favour of the plain multitude.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mark Twain never practised any of the wiles of the politician in order to be cheered
                        at railway stations and have lecture associations send for him. He did not seem over-anxious to
                        meet the reporters, and he had a fine contempt for most of the orthodox traditions cherished by
                        the people who loved him. Probably no other American could have lived abroad for so many years
                        without being editorially branded as an expatriate.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">When Mr. Clemens chose to take up his residence in Vienna nobody hurled any William
                            <pb id="VAA2327-212" n="204" TEIform="pb"/> Waldorf Astor talk at him. Everyone hoped he
                        would have a good time and learn the German language. Then when the word came back that he made
                        his loafing headquarters in a place up an alley known as a <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">stube</hi>
                        or <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">rathskeller,</hi> or something like that, all the women of the
                        literary clubs, who kept his picture on the high pedestal with the candles burning in front of
                        it, decided that <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">stube</hi> meant "shrine." You may be sure that if
                        they can find the place they will sink a bronze memorial tablet immediately above the principal
                        faucet.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Of course, the early books, such as "Innocents Abroad," "Roughing It," and "The
                        Gilded Age," gave him an enormous vogue in every remote community visited by book-agents. The
                        fact that people enjoyed reading these cheering volumes and preserved them in the bookcase and
                        moved out some of the classics by E. P. Roe and Mrs. Southworth in order to make room for "Tom
                        Sawyer" and "Huckleberry Finn," does not fully account for the evident and accepted popularity
                        of Mark Twain. Other men wrote books that went into the bookcase, but what one of them ever
                        earned the special privilege of being hailed by his first name?</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Is it not true that when a man has done his <pb id="VAA2327-213" n="205" TEIform="pb"
                        /> work for many years more or less under the supervising eye of the public, the public learns a
                        good many facts about him that are in no way associated with his set and regular duties as a
                        servant of the public? Out of the thousand-and-one newspaper mentions and private bits of gossip
                        and whispered words of inside information, even the busy man in the street comes to put an
                        estimate on the real human qualities of each notable, and sometimes these estimates are
                        surprisingly accurate, just as they are often sadly out of focus.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Joseph Jefferson had a place in the public esteem quite apart from that demanded by
                        his skill as an actor. Players and readers of newspapers came to know in time that he was a kind
                        and cheery old gentleman of blameless life, charitable in his estimates of professional
                        associates, a modest devotee of the fine arts, an outdoor sportsman with the enthusiasm of a
                        boy, and the chosen associate of a good many eminent citizens. When they spoke of "Joe"
                        Jefferson in warmth and kindness, it was not because he played "Rip Van Winkle" so beautifully
                        but because the light of his private goodness had filtered through the mystery surrounding every
                        popular actor. William H. Crane is another <pb id="VAA2327-214" n="206" TEIform="pb"/> veteran
                        of the stage who holds the regard of the public. It knows him as a comedian and also it knows
                        him as the kind of man we would like to invite up to our house to meet the folks. The sororities
                        throb with a feeling of sisterhood for Maude Adams because the girls feel sure that she is
                        gracious and charming and altogether "nice."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mark Twain would have stood very well with the assorted grades making up what is
                        generally known as the "great public" even if he had done his work in a box and passed it out
                        through a knot-hole. Any one who knew our homely neighbours as he knew them and could tell about
                        them in loving candour, so that we laughed at them and warmed up to them at the same time,
                        simply had to be all right. Being prejudiced in his favour, we knew that if he wanted to wear
                        his hair in a mop and adopt white clothing and talk with a drawl, no one would dare to suggest
                        that he was affecting the picturesque. He was big enough to be different. Any special privilege
                        was his without the asking. Having earned one hundred per cent. of our homage he didn't have to
                        strain for new effects.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">His devotion to the members of his family <pb id="VAA2327-215" n="207" TEIform="pb"/>
                        and the heroic performance in connection with the debts of the publishing house undoubtedly
                        helped to strengthen the general regard for him. Also, the older generation, having heard him
                        lecture, could say that they had "met" him. Everyone who sat within the soothing presence of the
                        drawl, waiting to be chirked up on every second sentence with a half-concealed stroke of
                        drollery, was for all time a witness to the inimitable charm of the man and the story-teller.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Furthermore, is it not possible that much of the tremendous liking for Mark Twain
                        grew out of his success in establishing our credit abroad? Any American who can invade Europe
                        and command respectful attention is entitled to triumphal arches when he arrives home. Our dread
                        and fear of foreign criticism are still most acute. Mrs. Trollope and Captain Marryat lacerated
                        our feelings long ago. Dickens came over to have our choicest flowers strewn in his pathway and
                        then went home to scourge us until we shrieked with pain. Kipling simply put us on the griddle.
                        Even to this day, when a frowning gentleman surrounded by shawls and Gladstone bags is
                        discovered on the Cunard pier, we proceed to search him for vitriol. George Bernard Shaw peppers
                        away at long range and <pb id="VAA2327-216" n="208" TEIform="pb"/> the London <hi rend="i"
                            TEIform="hi">Spectator</hi> grows peevish every time it looks out of the window and sees a
                        drove of Cook tourists madly spending their money.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It is a terrible shock to the simple inlander who has fed upon Congressional oratory
                        and provincial editorials, when he discovers that in certain European capitals the name
                        "American" is almost a term of reproach. The first-time-over citizen from Spudville or Alfalfa
                        Centre indicates his protest by wearing a flag on his coat and inviting those who sit in
                        darkness to come over and see what kind of trains are run on the Burlington. The lady whose
                        voice carries from a point directly between the eyes, seeks to correct all erroneous impressions
                        by going to the table d'hte with fewer clothes and more jewels than any one had reason to
                        expect. These two are not so much in evidence as they were twenty years ago but they are still
                        gleefully held up by our critics as being "typical."</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Probably they are outnumbered nowadays by the apologetic kindthose who approach the
                        English accent with trembling determination and who, after ordering in French, put a finger on
                        the printed line so that the waiter may be in on the secret.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">There are Americans who live abroad and <pb id="VAA2327-217" n="209" TEIform="pb"/>
                        speak of their native land in shameful whispers. Another kind is an explainer. He becomes
                        fretful and involved in the attempt to make it clear to some Englishman with a cold and
                        fish-like eye that, as a matter of fact, the lynchings are scattered over a large territory and
                        Tammany has nothing whatever to do with the United States Senate and the millionaire does not
                        crawl into the presence of his wife and daughters and the head of the House of Morgan never can
                        be King and citizens of St. Louis are not in danger of being hooked by moose. After he gets
                        through the Englishman says "Really?" and the painful incident is closed.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Once in a while an American, finding himself beset by unfamiliar conditions, follows
                        the simple policy of not trying to assimilate new rules or oppose them, but merely going ahead
                        in his own way, conducting himself as a human being possessed of the standard human attributes.
                        This unusual performance may be counted upon to excite wonder and admiration. Benjamin Franklin
                        tried it out long ago and became the sensation of Europe. General Grant and Colonel Roosevelt
                        got along comfortably in all sorts of foreign complications merely by refusing to put on
                        disguises. But Mark Twain <pb id="VAA2327-218" n="210" TEIform="pb"/> was probably the hest of
                        our emissaries. He never waved the starry banner and at the same time he never went around
                        begging forgiveness. He knew the faults of his home people and he understood intimately and with
                        a family knowledge all of their good qualities and groping intentions and half-formed plans for
                        big things in the future, but apparently he did not think it necessary to justify all of his
                        private beliefs to men who used five thousand miles away from Hannibal, Missouri. He had been in
                        all parts of the world and had made a calm and unbiased estimate of the relative values of men
                        and institutions. Probably he came to know that all had been cut from one piece and then trimmed
                        variously. He carried with him the same placid habits of life that sufficed him in Connecticut
                        and because he was what he pretended to be, the hypercritical foreigners doted upon him and the
                        Americans at home, glad to flatter themselves, said, "Why, certainly; he's one of us!"</p>

                        his own judgment, you will get credit for having warned him. If he succeeds, he will be tickled

                        adjusted to seasonal conditions in India. Only in winter may the tourist in Agra, Jaipur, and
                        Benares find protection under a pith helmet. Therefore, when two of us planned to go around the
                        orange, following the most beaten track to the east, we began guessing at dates and destinations
                        and learned that we would have to make an early start to avoid being trapped by the deadly heat
                        so picturesquely advertised by Mr. Kipling.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">All this copious prelude so that you may understand why we found ourselves in London
                        at Christmas time. One needs an alibi in a case of that kind. Do you remember the melodrama,
                        "Alone in London"? We appeared in it.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">London on Christmas Eve was abuzz with gaiety (modified British gaiety) and crowds.
                        We awoke on Christmas morning to find that during the night the human race had evaporated.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2327-226" n="218" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">We got this first at the egg ceremony in the lonesome grill. It was repeated by the
                        field marshal who stood at the main entrance. Also, this particular Christmas was spoken of very
                        highly by the musical comedy hero who assigned the rooms.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Taking one 25th of December with another and striking an average, we would have said
                        that this London Christmas was not even a dismal suggestion of the real thing.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">A soft gloom covered the earth. The sky was a sombre canopy, compromising between a
                        gray and a dun. If you should mix battleship colour with the shade used in painting refrigerator
                        cars, you might get an approximation of the effect. The light came from nowhere. Not freezing
                        weather, but in the sluggish air a chill which cut right through top-coats.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">But a jolly Christmas, nevertheless, because the fog had lifted and no rain was
                        falling.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Probably we had been spoiled in the matter of Christmases. Our romantic
                        specifications called for white draperies on the hillside, feathered plumes surmounting each
                        thicket, the smoke from every chimney going straight up, and a steel-cold sun hanging in
                        burnished splendour overhead, <pb id="VAA2327-227" n="219" TEIform="pb"/> We had made no plans
                        for the day, somehow feeling that every Christmas works out its own programme. Certainly we had
                        looked forward to being in London on the day which English-speaking people have garlanded with
                        so much of homely sentiment.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Probably we had a lot of Dickens still lurking in our systems. We-rather hoped to
                        find, in London at Yuletide, the carols ringing out on the frosty air, while the backlog roared,
                        the punch-bowl was wreathed with spicy vapours, the boar's head smiled from its pillow of holly
                        and, on every hand, crabbed old gentlemen melted perceptibly before the good cheer of the
                        blessed day and began giving money to crippled children.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It may be that the English Christmas is just what has been represented to us in song
                        and story, but the homeless transient sees no part of it.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">As we walked forth that Christmas we found that the metropolis of the world had
                        become merely an emptiness of walls and shutters. If machine-guns had been planted at Trafalgar
                        Square to sweep each radiating thoroughfare, there would have been no fatalities.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Probably behind the high walls (spiked with <pb id="VAA2327-228" n="220" TEIform="pb"
                        /> broken glass) and the drawn shades, the nuts were being cracked and cobwebby bottles of old
                        port were being tenderly operated upon, and Uncle Charleys with shining faces were proposing
                        toasts.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">But even a prohibition agent, intent upon compelling merrymakers to find their
                        wassail in grape juice, would have been deceived by the outward solemnity of Christmas in
                        London.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It seems to be the one day in the calendar on which every Englishman retires into his
                        own home and pulls up the drawbridge. Those who have country places go to the country and those
                        who know people having country places put in acceptances weeks ahead. At every hearth-stone the
                        relatives who have been shunned during the previous 364 days are stuffed with warm food.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">So we were told.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">By noon we decided to escape from our hotel. It was so near the Thames that we dared
                        not trust ourselves.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">We learned of an old tavern, miles up the river, where a special dinner was served on
                        Christmas Day. Sure enough, we found a bed of coals in a grate, a Pickwick sort of person
                        sitting in front of it, and a head waiter with apologetic side-whiskers.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">The ordinary man we pass in the street carries probably $75 worth of merchandise. The
                        guess is low rather than high, because we have to take into account a suit of clothes, a hat, a
                        pair of shoes, various undergarments, buttons made of a precious metal, and possibly some
                        expensive fillings in the teeth.</p>

                        because we cannot slather money as we did in 1919, it may help if we reflect that, at least,
                        each of us has a mattress at night, meals as usual, books to read, and some sort of
