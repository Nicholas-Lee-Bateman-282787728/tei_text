                <head>PREFACE,</head>
                <lg>
                    <l>&quot;Of all the fools, who with ill stars are curst,</l>
                    <l>Sure scribbling fools, called poets, are the worst,</l>
                    <l>For they&apos;re a set of fools which fortune makes,</l>
                    <l>And after she had made them fools, forsakes.&quot;</l>
                </lg>
                <lg>
                    <l rend="ti-2">&quot;Still many a sad and weary heart</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">That treads a noiseless way apart,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Has blest the humble poet&apos;s name,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">For fellowship refined and free,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">In meek wild-flowers of poesy</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">That ask&apos;d no higher fame!&quot;</l>
                </lg>
                <p>In launching this little waif on the great sea of poesy, strewn as it Is with the
                    debris of the numerous wrecks that have pre- ceded it, I make no pretention to
                    anything more than to com- ply with the request of a few friends, whose love is
                    to me of more value than the gold of Ophir or the diamonds of Golconda; but if
                    what I have written here shall cause one human being to be better or happier I
                    will feel myself well rewarded for my labor, which has been resorted to only as
                    a favorite amuse- ment for idle hours, I being so constituted as to have no
                    relish for what the world is pleased to call amusement.</p>
                <p>If some of these poems may seem frivolous or humorous, it must be remembered
                    that--</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>&quot;A little nonsense now and then,</l>
                    <l>Is relished by the best of men.&quot;</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Or if any one who reads this little book shall wonder why I have written so much
                    about death and heaven, my only apol- ogy is the fact that I know I shall soon
                    fall a victim to the one, and hope then to become a citizen of the other.</p>

                    <head>The Devil on the Steps of a Fashionable Church.</head>
                    <lg>
                        <l>The minister went on his summer vacation,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">The weather was hot and his arduous toil</l>
                        <l>Called loudly for rest with combined recreation,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Lest his health such continuous labor might spoil.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>So he hied him away and his Church was neglected,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">There was none for the spiritual body to care;</l>
                        <l>But his sal&apos;ry went on and was duly collected</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">The same as if constantly he had been there.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>First he thought he &apos;d go sailing far over the ocean</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And get a good sniff of the pure salty breeze;</l>
                        <l>But prayerfully thinking, he soon changed his notion</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And thought &apos;twould be nicer among the green
                            trees.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>So off soon he went to the lakes and the forests,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Communing with nature in nature&apos;s own fane;</l>
                        <l>There by joining the songs of the sweet feathered chorists.</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Give strength to the body and rest to the brain.</l>

                        <l>Tho&apos; his calling was sacred, demanding devotion</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Of body and soul to the work, yet alas,</l>
                        <l>For the pleasures of earth still he had such a notion</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">He left fishing for souls to go angling for bass.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>But the time of vacation at last having ended,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">He came back to his charge to resume the control</l>
                        <l>Of the place he had left, and his people attended</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">In quest of some food for the famishing soul.</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>As he drew near his Church with glad step and light- hearted,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Now eager again to his work to return,</l>
                        <l>At the sight of a form on the doorstep he started--</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">&quot;It&apos;s the devil,&quot; he said,
                            &quot;if I rightly discern.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>When he had come near the complacent newcomer.</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">&quot;How d&apos;ye do,&quot; said the devil;
                            &quot;I thought it no crime,</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">For me to stay here and put in the odd time.&quot;</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>For the devil, more faithful, his post ne&apos;er deserted</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Through all the long weeks the divine was away;</l>
                        <l>But by law of preemption his rights he asserted,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And said to the pastor, &quot;I&apos;m here now to

                        <l>That caused a trembling in my knees,</l>

                        <l>Has struck my sense with such appall,</l>
                        <l>As did the sight of that rough wall,</l>

                        <l>Where still remains a little mound,</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>Where stood the chimney built of sticks,</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>A log cut out on either side,</l>

                        <l>Than did those greasy paper panes,</l>
                        <l>Where first I taxed my youthful brains</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>In puzzling o&apos;er that mystic book,</l>

                        <l>To learn to spell and then to read:</l>
                        <l>Herculean task it seemed indeed.</l>

                        <l>A knowledge of their books to gain.</l>

                        <l>That makes him but a stupid bore,</l>

                        <l>A swaggering fool, plain truth to speak.</l>

                        <l>Winter&apos;s coming now for certain,</l>
                        <l>And the cold north-western blast,</l>
                        <l>Like a roaring whirling blizzard,</l>
                        <l>Chills us to the very gizzard,</l>
                        <l>As it goes careering past.</l>
                        <l>Signs are creaking, doors are knocking,</l>
                        <l>Windows shaking, shutters rattling,</l>
                        <l>As with Boreas they are battling,</l>
                        <l>Nerves of timid people shocking,</l>
                        <l>All their hopes of comfort mocking,</l>
                        <l>While these piercing northers blow.</l>

                        <l>Sun is hidden by a curtain</l>

                        <l>And pedestrians scudding fast,</l>
                        <l>As they shivering homeward go,</l>
                        <l>Prove that winter&apos;s come at lat.</l>
                        <l>Tramps around steam-boilers swarming,</l>

                        <l>Sheltered from the howling storm;</l>
                        <l>But the house with windows grated,</l>
                        <l>They regard with jealous eye--</l>

                        <l>Young dudes make their love advances,</l>
                        <l>While their best girls eat ice cream.</l>
                        <l>Piercing winds come in profusion,</l>
                        <l>Pinching us so very sore,</l>

                        <l>Hoping better things to-morrow.</l>

                        <l>Of all the diseases that doctors combat,</l>
                        <l>There&apos;s no one so hard of removal as that</l>
                        <l>One so many now have, though they never complain--</l>
                        <l>A disease that&apos;s called insects, or fish on the brain.</l>
                        <l>One sore case I witnessed, I ne&apos;er shall forget.</l>
                        <l>The patient so fond of a butterfly pet,</l>
                        <l>Was our entomologist, Doctor L*****e.</l>
                        <l>For a time, from his actions and all that he said,</l>
                        <l>&apos;Twas evident something was wrong in his head,</l>
                        <l>And the symptoms increased from one day to another,</l>
                        <l>Till he could no longer their violence smother.</l>
                        <l>In such fits he goes hunting for spiders and bugs,</l>
                        <l>Or to catch a poor butterfly manfully tugs;</l>
                        <l>So out went our hero with net on a pole,</l>
                        <l>To engage in the sport, the delight of his soul.</l>
                        <l>As alone on the bank of the river he wandered,</l>
                        <l>Of spiders and butterflies deeply he pondered;</l>
                        <l>When all of a sudden a poor butterfly,</l>
                        <l>On its tri-colored velvet wings came flitting by;</l>

                        <l>Quick up went his net and the hot chase began,</l>
                        <l>Nor ended till plump o&apos;er the steep brink he ran</l>
                        <l>Souse into the river, all foaming and deep,</l>
                        <l>Quite down to the depths where the mud-suckers keep;</l>
                        <l>And as I just caught the last glimpse of his heels,</l>
                        <l>I thought &apos;twas his new way of bobbing for eels;</l>
                        <l>But he swam out with ardor, cooled down to a shiver,</l>
                        <l>And vowed &apos;twas the last time he&apos;d hunt by the
                            river;</l>
                        <l>And that night in his dreams he was tortured with pain,</l>
                        <l>From the crashing of battle where thousands were slain;</l>
                        <l>But waking, he found &apos;twas all bugs on the brain;</l>
                        <l>So he woke in the morn, burned his pole and his net,</l>
                        <l>And peace was proclaimed &apos;tween the bugs and L*****e.</l>

                        <l>The refrain being trilled by the shrill piping cricket,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">When evening its stillness o&apos;er nature had
                            flung.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>The knoll in the orchard where lonely are sleeping</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">My kindred now past from their labors away,</l>
                        <l>I bid all adieu while my eyes dim with weeping;--</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">O, stranger, tread lightly above them, I pray.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>I leave these enchantments in strange lands to wander</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Perhaps I may never behold them again;</l>
                        <l>And it saddens my spirit to sit here and ponder</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">On childhood&apos;s bright dreams and how fleeting
                            they&apos;ve been.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>But now these loved haunts are the home of another,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">The ones that so loved me I see here no more;</l>
                        <l>My silv&apos;ry haired father and dear sainted mother,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Long since found a home on a far brighter shore.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Then why should I wish that my stay could be longer,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Since all is now gloomy that once was so dear;</l>
                        <l>For though by long absence the passion be stronger,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">The dear ones I loved never more can be here.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Then a last long adieu, but I ever shall cherish</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">The mem&apos;ry of joys that attended me here;</l>
                        <l>Nor never till love in my bosom shall perish,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Will earth have a spot to my mem&apos;ry so dear.</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>Our old Gov&apos;nor came down like a wolf on the fold,</l>
                        <l>His blue-gray eye beaming defiant and bold;</l>
                        <l>All blust&apos;ring and boisterous as gov&apos;nor could be,</l>
                        <l>Like gov&apos;nor Willard when out on a spree.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Like the grass on the prairie in midsummer seen,</l>
                        <l>The old punkin-head dotard looked awfully green;</l>
                        <l>For when he saw Lawrence stretched out on the lawn,</l>
                        <l>He found to his sorrow his courage was gone.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>For there the darned yankees stood gaping around,</l>
                        <l>Not an effort was made for defending the town;</l>
                        <l>And the phiz of the rascals looked tauntingly wise,</l>
                        <l>As sly twinkles provokingly danced in their eyes.</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>And there stood the gov&apos;nor his nostrils spread wide</l>
                        <l>As down his dry throat rolled of whisky a tide;</l>
                        <l>And he frothed and he foamed and he slobbered with rage,</l>
                        <l>Like a mammoth wild lion confined in a cage.</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>And there was the soldier all frolic and fun,</l>
                        <l>With a brick in his hat and no load in his gun;</l>
                        <l>But he said &apos;twas a shame to be thus made the tool</l>
                        <l>Of that old granny, Walker, the tarnal old fool,</l>

                        <l>There too lay the colonel his death-dirge unsung,</l>
                        <l>His brain had got foggy his joints were unstrung;</l>

                        <l>Till the battle waxed fierce and the conflict was dire,</l>

                        <l>We all have our troubles of various kinds,</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">But to suffer vexation is every one&apos;s fate;</l>
                        <l>There&apos;s music, good music, I love it so well,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">But a medley discordant is always a bore,</l>
                        <l>And grates on my ear like a gong or a bell,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Such music there comes from my neighbors next door.</l>
                    </lg>

                        <l>On an ancient piano they thump and they beat,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And a puppy&apos;s refrain often burdens the air,</l>
                        <l>Till sick and disgusted I fain would retreat</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">Into my doomed ears there continues to pour</l>
                        <l>A racket would put a Comanche to shame,</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">So I meekly submit to whatever must be,</l>
                        <l>But with no good will for the sweet mincing miss,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Who&apos;s constantly causing such torture to me,</l>
                        <l>I sigh for a season of quiet and peace,</l>

                        <l>&apos;Tis the eighteenth of November,</l>
                        <l>And the chill autumnal blast</l>

                        <l>Sweeps the dry leaves from the trees;</l>
                        <l>And snow flakes, as in December,</l>
                        <l>Fill the air like swarms of bees.</l>
                        <l>On they hurry, leaves and snow-flakes,</l>
                        <l>Leaves and snow-flakes all together,</l>
                        <l>Thick as flies in summer weather.</l>
                        <l>What a din this storm of snow makes.</l>
                        <l>Now again the wind blows fiercer,</l>
                        <l>Fiercer than it did before;</l>
                        <l>Drives the sleet against the casement,</l>
                        <l>Drives the sleet against the door,</l>
                        <l>And the house reels on its basement,</l>
                        <l>Till it shakes the very floor;</l>
                        <l>This November is s piercer.</l>
                        <l>Hurley-burley! pans and baskets,</l>
                        <l>Pelmell in a heap they go;</l>
                        <l>&apos;Tis no use to try to mask it</l>
                        <l>Winter&apos;s here before we ask it;</l>
                        <l>Fall the crystal flakes of snow,</l>
                        <l>Like gems spilt from heaven&apos;s casket.</l>
                        <l>Whew! there goes the pails and wash-tubs,</l>
                        <l>Pails and wash-tubs in a pile;</l>
                        <l>All the world seems in a hub-bub.</l>
                        <l>Tommy&apos;s cap flies o&apos;er the stile.</l>
                        <l>Still the storm gets higher, higher,</l>

                        <l>To the barn the cow draws nigher,</l>

                        <l>Howls the bleak wind through the forest;</l>
                        <l>Through the forest brown and sere;</l>
                        <l>Like the wail of night-hag chorist,</l>
                        <l>Falls the sound upon the ear.</l>
                        <l>Making all without appear</l>
                        <l>Gloomy, dark and doubly drear.</l>
                        <l>Doors are creaking, windows knocking,</l>
                        <l>Snap the clothes upon the line,</l>
                        <l>These November storms are shocking,</l>

                    <head>The Wolf in Sheep&apos;s Clothing.</head>
                    <lg>
                        <l>A wolf in sheep&apos;s clothing, a butternut bold,</l>
                        <l>Through our state to the devil had better be sold,</l>
                        <l>So he with his jackals concocted a plan</l>
                        <l>For making the transfer, and chose for their man</l>
                        <l>To serve as accomplice in driving the trade,</l>
                        <l>(When they&apos;d get the plot all successfully laid,)</l>
                        <l>One Jefferson Davis, a wily old sinner,</l>
                        <l>The chosen high priest of hell&apos;s temple the inner,</l>
                        <l>Where the incense he burns has a sulphurous smell,</l>
                        <l>And the light of the flame gives a blue tinge to hell.</l>
                        <l>No man could be chosen more fitted than he,</l>
                        <l>&apos;Tween parties so august the umpire to be;</l>
                        <l>So the wolf (his slim chance of success to increase)</l>
                        <l>Just labeled his plot &quot;A proposal for peace;&quot;</l>
                        <l>A proposal for peace with those dark, sooty regions</l>
                        <l>Where wolves in sheep&apos;s clothing are counted by legions.</l>
                        <l>Where treason&apos;s the shibboleth, watch wordand crown.</l>
                        <l>Of wolves of all shades, be theyNi-black or Brown</l>
                        <l>To convince the dear people he meant them no harm,</l>
                        <l>He drew up resolutions as long as his arm.</l>
                        <l>Then he rose in the senate and read them aloud,</l>
                        <l>As though of his mission he felt very proud;</l>
                        <l>And to prove to the Hoosiers their country was lost,</l>
                        <l>He feigned to count up what to save it would cost,</l>
                        <l>And argued that rather than suffer such evil,</l>
                        <l>&apos;Twere better by far to be sold to the devil;</l>
                        <l>For, said he, it is plain to a man of good sense,</l>
                        <l>That to go to the devil would be less expense;</l>
                        <pb id="VAA3928-154" n="153"/>
                        <l>Besides, &apos;twill be seen that from that happy day</l>
                        <l>We could all have our niggers, for which let us prey.</l>
                        <l>Then the wolves of all colors set up a loud howl,</l>
                        <l>&apos;Bout how pleasent &apos;twould be with Jeff. Davis to
                            prowl</l>
                        <l>Round the homes of the Yankees to kidnap all niggers,</l>
                        <l>To consign to the rice swamps, mosquitoes and chiggers</l>
                        <l>Of South Carolina that quarrelsome state,</l>
                        <l>That&apos;s kicked up a muss in the fam&apos;ly of late;</l>
                        <l>And the balance of Dixie, the fire-eater&apos;s home,</l>
                        <l>Where none but the chivalry ever may come.</l>
                        <l>One lupus as Ni-black as &apos;tis safe to be</l>
                        <l>And claim any rights in &quot;The Land of the Free,&quot;</l>
                        <l>Thought our old constitution by and by they&apos;d amend;</l>
                        <l>And use that as means to accomplish their end.</l>
                        <l>But to making their project most certain to pay,</l>
                        <l>Some serious impediments stood in their way,</l>
                        <l>One a stiff-backed old governor, loyal and true,</l>
                        <l>Beneath a starred banner of red white and blue;</l>
                        <l>Besides there came thundering up from afar</l>
                        <l>A warning that seemed their bright prospects to mar--</l>
                        <l>The sound of all others that traitors abhor,</l>
                        <l>A voice from the red fields of grim-visaged war,</l>
                        <l>Where traitors by thousands are laid in the dust,</l>
                        <l>As a merited doom for betraying their trust,</l>
                        <l>Then there&apos;s given the hint that whatever may come,</l>
                        <l>A traitor&apos;s no less for being at home;</l>
                        <l>And that come when it may, whether early or late,</l>
                        <l>Wherever they&apos;re found they must share the same fate.</l>

                    <head>The Oil Spot.</head>
                    <p>[The &quot;Oil Spot&quot; is situated ten miles south of Sabine Pass,
                        into which flows the Sabine river to the: Gulf of Mexico. The river forms
                        the boundary between Louisiana and Texas. The &quot;Oil
                        Spot&quot;&apos; extends two miles along the shore and seaward about
                        three-quarters of a mile. A storm from the Northwest by East to Southeast
                        has a sweep of from three to seven hundred miles across the Gulf of Mexico
                        into this mystic haven. During a gale this spot is wonderfully defined.
                        Looking seaward the scene is grand. An acre of towering foam marks the
                        abrupt dissolution of the lashing seas as they thunder toward the shore.
                        This occurs in about eighteen feet of water, from which the <pb
                            id="VAA3928-198" n="196"/> storm-driven craft, creaking and straining in
                        every timber, emerges, and suddenly finds herself reposing like a child
                        rocked in its mother&apos;s arms, hemmed in by a wall of wrath, where
                        the weary mariner can be lulled to rest by the roar of the wind and waves.
                        The place is termed the &quot;Oil Spot,&apos; not from any known
                        analysis of its nature, but simply from its condition; it has no troubled
                        water.]</p>

                        <l rend="ti-2">Weird river, what magic lies hid in thy waves,</l>

                        <l>At the end of the course an &quot;Oil Spot&quot; for the

                        <l rend="ti-2">A haven of safety &apos;round which in their rage,</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">Where tho&apos; all his demons the storm-king engage,</l>
                        <l>The waves in that haven no entrance can gain.</l>

                        <l>And our bark is so fragile, so easy to sink.</l>

                        <l>Before the day ends and we&apos;re left in the dark.</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">That haven is found in the far-away land,</l>

                        <l>But carelessly answered the sweet pleading child,</l>

                        <l>Still waiting she gazed on the scene for awhile,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Unwilling to leave him, afraid to remain.</l>
                        <l>Go home and don&apos;t bother me, gruffly he said,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">As he looked at the child with a cold vacant stare;</l>
                        <l>Go home to your mother and all go to bed,</l>

                        <l>And as she went out, down her cheek stole a tear,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">But she braved the cold blast with the storm-driven
                            sleet;</l>
                        <l>With her heart full of sorrow and trembling with fear,</l>

                        <l>But soon she returned to the trial once more,</l>

                        <l>Our home was so happy, she tenderly said,</l>

                        <l>And you know that dear mamma is always afraid</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">At night time, dear father, whenever you&apos;re

                        <l>Then he slowly raised up and stood musing awhile,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">As if of the matter to take time to think;</l>
                        <l>And then stooping down whispered low to the child,</l>

                        <l>Which the eternal God did from infinity of mind evolve?</l>
                        <l>These are his tho&apos;ts as there, alone, he deeply meditating

                        <l>Like some weird phantom; and wonders if in other lands</l>

                        <l>Has it in the earth gone out as silent as it came?</l>

                        <l>He stands, a man with hoary locks and beard thick, long and flowing;</l>
                        <l>A naked rock it is on which he stands; no tree</l>
                        <l>Nor shrub nor flower to cherish vision is there growing</l>
                        <l>On all that vast extent of land behind; and on the sea before</l>
                        <l>Was seen of commerce not a sign-one swelling sail</l>
                        <l>Of ship, nor smoke of steamer through the water plowing as of yore,</l>
                        <l>Tho&apos; anxious looks he, vision-strained, still does he fail</l>
                        <l>Of life one sight to see, tho&apos; gazing long on ev&apos;ry

                        <l>O&apos;er barren wastes of rocks and land and o&apos;er ocean

                        <l>A silence so profound it fills his longing soul with fear;</l>
                        <l>A dread of something, but of what &apos;tis not within his power to
                            tell,</l>
                        <l>But there he stands mid silence so profound his tho&apos;ts he almost

                        <l>The gentle breeze from oceanward he used to love so well</l>

                        <l>Striving with what tact they had a place too large to fill.</l>
                        <l>So acted each a part as best they could, then passed away;</l>
                        <l>When stepping off the stage a vacancy to leave, but still</l>
                        <l>Come others closely treading on their heels from day to day.</l>
                        <l>Thus empty stage was never seen, till now the play is done,</l>
                        <l>And I upon the stage to act a single part am left alone,</l>
                        <l>This rock my stage, my audience the universe of empty space,</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>O, Boston ! Poor Boston: who&apos;ll care for you now,</l>
                        <l>Since your garland of victory is torn from your brow ?</l>
                        <l>Your hero is beaten, and laid on the shelf</l>
                        <l>For the rest of his life to go on by himself;</l>
                        <l>And you for an idol may look but in vain,</l>
                        <l>For John L. can never his prestige regain;</l>
                        <l>Tho&apos; you still have your culcha, of which you may boast,</l>
                        <l>It can never fill the place of the idol you&apos;ve lost,</l>
                        <l>Or, to keep up your fame. if you&apos;ve no other means,</l>
                        <l>You may challenge the world on your famous baked beans,</l>
                        <l>That through all time&apos;s changes tenacious remain,</l>
                        <l>Giving strength to the muscle and food to the brain.</l>
                        <l>But muscle and culcha are far different things,</l>
                        <l>And diff&apos;rent the glory that each of them brings;</l>
                        <l>And then just to think &apos;twas a son of John Bull</l>
                        <l>Filled the cup of your sorrow clean up to its full.</l>
                        <l>No more will the ladies his muscles admire,</l>
                        <l>To view beaten muscles they have no desire;</l>
                        <l>One time to admire him they thought it was fit,</l>
                        <l>But Johnny is now a &quot;dead cock in the pit,&quot;</l>
                        <l>And all of his backers are humbled in dust,</l>

                        <l>While they worshipped a brute, thought they called him a man.</l>
                        <l>Because he was built on the two-legged plan.</l>
                        <l>But your idol is vanquished, your money is lost,</l>
                        <l>And your glory has been bought at too heavy a cost;</l>
                        <l>And though it seems hard, to your fate you must bow,</l>

                    <head>The Cyclone.--A Parody.</head>
                    <lg>
                        <l>The heat was oppressive--a burden to bear--</l>
                        <l>A closeness most stifling pervaded the air,</l>
                        <l>While thick clouds, and gloomy, hung low o&apos;er the scene,</l>
                        <l>With an ominous surface of dull, murky green.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>&apos;Twas a signal foreboding that danger was near,</l>
                        <l>The brutes were all restless, excited by fear;</l>
                        <l>Not a breeze stirred the forest, nor scarcely a sound</l>
                        <l>Was heard to disturb the dread stillness profound.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>When the cyclone came down like the wolf on the fold,</l>
                        <l>And no mercy it showed to the young or the old,</l>
                        <l>As in its mad fury resistless it whirled</l>
                        <l>Till to utter destruction all objects were hurled.</l>
                    </lg>

                        <l>The landscape presented a heart-cheering scene</l>
                        <l>Of fields waving full of the bright, golden grain,</l>

                        <l>With a power for mischief no mortal could stay;</l>
                        <l>But it swept on its course, its dire vengeance to take,</l>
                        <l>&apos;Till death and destruction was left in its wake.</l>

                        <l>When the storm-king had emptied his vials of wrath,</l>

                        <l>Then deep lamentations were borne on the air,</l>
                        <l>Of people left homeless in helpless despair.</l>

                        <l>And learned that all nature is ruled by a God,</l>

                    <head>For What Are We Thankful?</head>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Your question propounded: my question is why</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Are we placed in this world of contention and strife ?</l>
                        <l>We come in so helpless--our first act a cry--</l>
                        <l>Our whole life a struggle, and though we may try</l>
                        <l>To make it a success, disappointed we die,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Complaining of fate and disgusted with life.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>&apos;Tis true we have battled with dust and with heat,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And that every day brought its cares and its toil,</l>
                        <l>That we the cold winter with plenty might meet;</l>
                        <l>But our arduous labor but made our sleep sweet.</l>
                        <l>Enhancing our relish for all that we eat;</l>
                        <l>Nor are our hands empty, nor bleeding our feet,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">But we&apos;re paid for our labor in fruits of the
                            soil:</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>For the fields yielded plenty of bright golden grain,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">The meadows abundance of grasses supplied;</l>
                        <l>And just when was needed came sunshine and rain,</l>
                        <l>With soft, balmy breezes that followed in train,</l>
                        <l>No pessimist surely could ever complain</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">That any great blessing to us is denied.</l>
                    </lg>

                        <l rend="ti-2">To do as they please while they please to do right:</l>
                        <l>So prisons are never a terror to me,</l>
                        <l>And I am content with whatever may be</l>
                        <l>My lot in this world, but how many I see</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Who can but blame themselves for their indigent plight.</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">Were not you once a babe keeping mother awake</l>
                        <l>Through the long hours of night that so lazily creep ?</l>
                        <l>And was not her affection so fervent and deep.</l>
                        <l>That she nightly vigils was willing to keep,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And sacrifice rest for her dear baby&apos;s sake ?</l>

                        <l>&apos;Tis the wisdom and mercy of God to deraign,</l>
                        <l>That we&apos;re doomed to labor our living to gain,</l>
                        <l>For that is far better for us in the main,</l>

                        <l>A voyager on a stormy sea,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">I started out with swelling sail,</l>
                        <l>Not knowing in what part &apos;t would be</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Where I at last should canvas brail.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>The storm that raged when leaving shore,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Though sometimes varied by a lull,</l>
                        <l>Returned more angry than before,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And time-waves chafed my fragile hull.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Oft when these waves ran mountain high,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">My craft would ride the highest crest;</l>
                        <l>Then in despair would sink till I</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Would feel all courage leave my breast.</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>But then would hope assert its power,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And rouse anew the fainting soul,</l>
                        <l>To struggle on, though dark the hour,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Till I should reach the wished for goal.</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">I battled with the fretted sea;</l>
                        <l>And still my onward course pursued,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And strove to gain some sheltered lee.</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>As on my varying course I went,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">If fortune frowned, or if she smiled,</l>
                        <l>I to my task with ardor bent,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Though wave lashed wave in tumult wild.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>My time-worn bark is growing frail,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And soon this stormy voyage must close,</l>
                        <l>And I shall furl my tattered sail,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">But in what port no mortal knows.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>But I must toss from wave to wave,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And be by freaks of fortune driv&apos;n,</l>
                        <l>Till I my dust give to the grave,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And rest my weary soul in heav&apos;n.</l>

                        <l>Our world without song would be lonely and drear,</l>

                    <head>The Long Ago.</head>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Not long ago I visited my early childhood home,</l>
                        <l>To view the mem&apos;ry cherished spots where once I loved to
                            roam;</l>
                        <l>To see again the lofty trees, the tangled underwood,</l>
                        <l>And shady dells where I had played near where our cottage stood.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>I wished to see the limpid stream, the little babbling brook,</l>
                        <l>Where often I for hours had fished with bent pin for a hook;</l>
                        <l>When if I caught a minnow once it gave my heart such joy</l>
                        <l>As I have never felt since when I was a fisherboy.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>But O, how changed the scene that there presented to my eyes,</l>
                        <l>A change, for which though well prepared, was still a great surprise;</l>
                        <l>The grassy lane so ample then where I foot-races ran,</l>
                        <l>Seemed to have dwindled half in width since I became a man.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <pb id="VAA3928-301" n="299"/>
                    <lg>
                        <l>The orchard where so oft I played nor knew of want or care,</l>
                        <l>Now but a few old half-dead trees of wonted fruit were bare;</l>
                        <l>But on the highest knoll there stood the same white marble stones,</l>
                        <l>Beneath them resting there in peace my long-lost loved ones&apos;
                            bones.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>The first grave in that hallowed spot was for my mother made,</l>
                        <l>And there by kindly neighbors&apos; hands my truest friend was
                            laid,</l>
                        <l>And there sleeps still the one I loved all else on earth above,</l>
                        <l>For I had learned to know the worth of a good mother&apos;s love.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Then one by one went others, too, the household growing less,</l>
                        <l>Some far away in parts remote without love&apos;s last caress;</l>
                        <l>Till few are left of all that group who were so happy there,</l>
                        <l>When living in that humble cot a mother&apos;s love could share.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>The farm o&apos;er which in youthful days &apos;twas my delight
                            to roam,</l>
                        <l>Divided now by stranger hands no longer looked like home;</l>
                        <l>But still I hoped from mem&apos;ry&apos;s book my favorite haunts
                            to trace,</l>
                        <l>The time to me now seemed so short since last I saw the place.</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>But forests that I once had loved were changed to fields of grain,</l>
                        <l>And I those noble, giant trees shall never see again;</l>
                        <l>But sadder change than all beside &apos;twas very plain to see,</l>
                        <l>In once black hair now turned to gray, but still belongs to me.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Ah, how on their swift noiseless wings the years go flitting by,</l>
                        <l>We scarce can learn to live till we must also learn to die;</l>
                        <l>&apos;Tis thus by time&apos;s unresting wheels we toward the
                            grave are borne,</l>
                        <l>And every day confirms the truth that &quot;man is made to
                            mourn.&quot;</l>

                    <head>Written on the Sand.</head>
                    <p>[Walking across the sandy beach we saw two beatified crea- tures slowly
                        walking toward where the band was playing. My companion said they could not
                        be bride and groom, they were too young and too happy. But she had been
                        writing on the sand with her parasol, and when we came to the spot we
                        stopped to see the tracings. There they were-&quot; H. W. B. and E. F.
                        B.&quot; &quot;That tells the story,&quot; said my friend, and
                        began writing on the sand himself.]</p>

                        <l>Ah! thoughtless creature, dost thou know</l>

                        <l>Come murky clouds that give us warning</l>
                        <l>Of a coming winter storm;</l>
                        <l>Next the snow, like feathers flying,</l>
                        <l>Fills the crisp and chilly air,</l>
                        <l>Whirling here and drifting there,</l>
                        <l>In our faces--everywhere,</l>
                        <l>All pretense of spring belying,</l>
                        <l>When for comfort we are trying,</l>
                        <l>All our efforts still defying,</l>
                        <l>Till it makes the wicked swear.</l>
                        <l>Winter in your lap is sitting,</l>
                        <l>While the days are by us flitting,</l>
                        <l>And we&apos;re longing for the spring,</l>
                        <l>That should be so warm and pleasant,</l>
                        <l>But your storms are more benefitting</l>

                        <l>Winter days than yours at present,</l>
                        <l>While you to winter habits cling;</l>
                        <l>But we can&apos;t blame you altagether,</l>
                        <l>For this ever changing weather;</l>
                        <l>Since you must be the go-between</l>
                        <l>Of the spring and winter season,</l>
                        <l>It would seem sufficient reason</l>
                        <l>Why you can not be serene,</l>
                        <l>But your storms will soon be over,</l>
                        <l>And we&apos;ll have warm April sun;</l>
                        <l>Then will growing wheat and clover</l>

                    <head>Address to My Sick Bed.</head>
                    <lg>
                        <l>My dear old couch on which so often I have lain</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">My weary limbs, and sought and found much needed rest,</l>
                        <l>Nor dreamt such pleasure could so soon be changed to pain,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And banish sleep, to come no more to be my welcome guest.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>&apos;Tis not thy fault; I feel the fault is all in me,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Thy down is just as soft, thy blankets warm, as when</l>
                        <l>My body from this fever and these pains was free;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">But O! how harder seems thy surface now than then.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Keep still, O mind! Thou mystery, that. like the stream of time,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">That, uncontrolled by human art, flows on forever and
                            forever,</l>
                        <l>And to the lowest things can sink, or rise to things sublime,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And active always, night and day, but stopping never.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Keep still awhile, till in the arms of Morpheus wrapt</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">I may short respite find, oblivious to all terrestial
                            things,</l>
                        <l>Before the silver cord, too tensely strained, be snapt,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">With such disaster sore as such o&apos;er tension
                            brings.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>But O, those horrid, dreary nights that seemed would never end!</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Each hour, as lazily it crept, seemed longer than a day;</l>
                        <pb id="VAA3928-346" n="[]"/>
                        <l>O if I had some true and trusted wizzard friend,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">So skilled in wizzard lore could some elixir make to drive
                            this spell away.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Daylight, how oft thy coming has been all too soon,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And called to duties of the day when I another hour would
                            gladly sleep,</l>
                        <l>And felt to me &apos;twould be a rich and priceless boon,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">But then it ushered in unbidden, it didn&apos;t wait or
                            creep.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Be patient, suffering body, nor dare for once to at thy fate
                            complain,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">There&apos;s balm in Gilead, and soon thy sufferings will
                            be o&apos;er--</l>
                        <l>These fever fires burned out, like morning mist be vanished all thy
                            pain;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Yes, gone tho&apos; not forgotten, but gone, forever
                            gone, to come no more.</l>
