            <byline>AGNES M. MURRAY</byline>
            <p>Hoosier pioneers have often been branded as an ignorant and backward race totally lacking in
                    intellectual ambition. When one investigates the truth of the matter, how-ever, one finds that from
                    the earliest days of American settlement there was, contrary to popular belief, genuine intellectual
                    advancement and literary interest within Indiana not only in the passive matter of reading but in
                    the form of original composition by the pioneers themselves. There seems to have been no printer in
                    Indiana Territory in 1802, since the territorial laws had to be printed in <placeName>

                    published the laws and statutes of the District of <placeName>

                    pamphlets and broadsides. The subject matter was militia orders, minutes of church and society

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> which was noted for its fine work in printing and lithographing. Several books of an
                    advanced nature were published there including an illustrated edition of <hi rend="i">American

            <p>Until newspapers became business enterprises, editors were important as state builders on account of
                    their influence upon public opinion. Elihu Stout, the first printer, was also the first newspaper
                    editor in Indiana. He started the <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi> at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> on July 4, 1809.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">Western Eagle,</hi> founded in 1813, was the first local journal to gain a footing
                    outside of the cultural cradle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After that, the birthrate of newspapers increased rapidly. By 1820, fifteen had been
                    inaugurated in ten towns, in the southern part of the state. The next decade saw four started in the
                    New Purchase where most of those of the thirties and forties originated. Before the middle of the
                    century, some two hundred fifty Hoosier newspapers had been founded. That they were often
                    short-lived and poor in quality is less important than the fact that their very presence shows an
                    urge for information and cultural advancement among some, at least, of the pioneers. It was
                    difficult to run a newspaper on the frontier. Subscribers were few and far between, money was
                    scarce, mails were often delayed leaving the editor at a loss for news, and paper was so difficult
                    to obtain that sometimes only a half sheet could be sent out. In 1832, the <hi rend="i">Dog-Fennel
                        Gazette</hi> was printed on one side of the page only and the subscribers had to send it back to
                    get the next week's news printed on the reverse side. By 1840, however, the population had
                    increased considerably, money was somewhat more plentiful, the mail service was more regular, and
                    there were three paper-mills in the state so some newspapers were able to assume a more metropolitan
                        air.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>Like those of other states in the same period, Indiana newspapers were generally weekliese<hi rend="sup">8</hi> and almost wholly political organs. Long articles on political questions,

                    political matters were of major importance to the pioneer. There was always some space given to
                    literary matter, how-ever, both poetry and prose, some of which was indigenous and some of which was
                    reprinted from the English classics. The absence of international copyright laws made it an easy
                    matter for the editor to have whatever he wanted in the way of imported selections. Regional pride
                    would not allow foreign material to usurp the space which might be given to local talent, however,
                    and Hoosier authors could always find some paper which would print whatever they wrote, a fact made
                    clear by the caliber of very many of the "gems" accepted. Local papers were

            <p>Just as in the eastern states, almanacs had a wide circulation among the farmers who accepted their
                    contents verbatim. Bibles and religious books were also widely read in rural areas where they were

                    women are among the best known, they are by no means the only poets among the pioneers of Indiana.

                    the first half of the nineteenth century were Hoosiers. As is usually the case with minor writers,
                    their successes were ephemeral. Prhaps one of the chief reasons for this was, that, instead of
                    showing the life they knew and creating a new literature in a new land, they preferred to escape the
                    crude realities of the life around them by imitating the sentimentalism of the second-rate eastern
                    and European writers. John Finley's poem, "The Hoosier's Nest,"
                    and Hall's <hi rend="i">The New Purchase</hi> are isolated exceptions to this rule,
                    otherwise it was almost the end of the nineteenth century before Edward Eggleston and James Whitcomb
                    Riley appeared to prove that Indiana provided not only readers and writers, but also a literary
                    material worthy of note. The early poetry generally took the form of melancholy ballads which often
                    had death as their main theme after the fashion of the folk songs of the southern mountains,
                    although there was also some political verse and occasional scholarly translations from the classics

                    admitting, however, that, as soon as Indiana pioneers had any leisure at all, they became interested
                    in the intellectual stimulation of reading and writing to a degree which was highly praiseworthy
                    considering their remoteness from all centers of literary development. Far from being an ignorant

                    superior, to that of other states during the territorial period and the early years of

                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>. There are a number of stone chimneys, as there are fireplaces in every room on the
                    ground floor. Above each of the deep-set, small-paned windows are smoothly serviced stone
                    entablatures, or lintels, that are said to have been hoisted up in wheelbarrows from below, that
                    being the only feasible way of elevating them at that time.</p>
            <p>The house was built about 1857 by Robert Glenn who came over from <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName> in 1816. The stone and timber<hi rend="sup">1</hi> were all found on the place. The
                    carpenters and masons were men of the neighborhood, John Tait, of a Scotch pioneer family, being the
                    head workman. After the foundation of the house was laid, it was allowed to settle for two years
                    before anything further was done. The farm of three hundred fifty acres was purchased at a
                    government land office, the patent being signed by President Andrew Jackson. Only two families have
                    owned the land, as it passed from Robert Glenn to his son who sold it to David H. Boyle, father of
                    the present owner, in 1904.</p>
            <p>The original owner, when a boy, saw a man on the streets of <placeName>

                    flavor that he made a vow then and there—he would have all the apples he could eat when
                    he grew to be a man. He made his dream come true, and his Indiana apple orchards were a source of
                    great pride to the sturdy Scot. He built a fireplace in his cellar to insure his fruit against
                    freezing and each year sorted and stored his fruit crop carefully. He <list type="footnotes">

                    front gable through which he drove his applecart and after emptying it, turned around and drove out.
                    The door is now blocked up.</p>
            <p>Robert Glenn was an interesting and kindly gentleman. During his life time, his home was a social
                    center for the people of the ‘kirk’ as well as for those more jovially minded.
                    He seems to have kept open house for family and friends. During one whole winter, he is said to have
                    harbored seven-teen guests beneath his hospitable roof.</p>
            <p>There is no front entrance to the mansion, but doors on both sides of the house near the front
                    corners, one opening from the east and one from the west. Across broad, deep, worn, old stone steps,
                    one may enter either door into an interior full of charming antiques. The reception room leads into
                    a broad hall that opens into a sunny kitchen that extends across the back of the house. On the left
                    of the hall is a small parlor with deep, old fashioned stone fireplace in which burned a cheerful
                    wood fire at the time of the writer's visit. An organ, divans, rose-backed, cane-stated
                    chairs and rockers furnish this apartment. On the opposite side of the hall is a square dining room
                    with a door to the kitchen. Priceless china and old glass adorn a corner cup-board. A cherry
                    writing-desk of antique pattern, a hanging bookcase and the tall press that flanks the mantel, are
                    outstanding attractions in this room. Radio and telephone add modernity while a large fern gives a
                    graceful touch.</p>
            <p>Back of the central hall is the parlor bedroom with its great bedstead, wardrobe, bedside table of
                    cherry, and high wooden mantel surmounted by a great <placeName>

                    old quilt with gorgeous pattern and tiny stitches covers the bed. Here the visitor is shown an old
                    Bay State shawl of great size and thickness. When worn by the owner to church one morning, its
                    crimson color acted as a challenge to her turkeys and they followed her <hi rend="i">en masse,</hi>

                    houses, and the window sills are twenty-one inches deep. An intriguing stairway of easy tread leads
                    to the upper floor <pb n="336" id="VAA4025-036-4-012"/> and another large hall, from which doors
                    open into four bedrooms, one of which is seventeen by twenty-four feet. Under the stairway is the
                    expected entrance to steps leading down into the cellar.</p>
            <p>The reception hall has a grandfather clock, pedestaltable of cherry, lovely old divans and

            <head>Clark's Conquest of the Northwest</head>
            <byline>MAJOR JOSEPH I. LAMBERT, UNITED STATES CAVALRY</byline>
            <p>In writing of a military leader as successful as George Rogers Clark, one is naturally interested in
                    his previous training and preparation, but one looks in vain for any noticeable amount of study or
                    experience in war. He was too young to have taken part in the French and Indian War where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> received much of his training. Clark did learn to be a surveyor and thus became
                    acquainted with details of terrain. Little is known of the part that he took in the Dunmore Indian
                    War just preceding the Revolution, but he was either a company commander or served on Lord
                    Dunmore's staff. At the termination of hostilities, he was offered a commission in the
                    British service but declined. For several years preceding the conquest of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> country, he had spent much time going back and forth between his home in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and the new land of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> where he took part in several Indian skirmishes. At this time, he was primarily
                    interested in acquiring land for him-self and others in the new country.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During his travels west of the mountains, Clark conceived the daring scheme of wresting the country
                    north of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River from the British. There was a British garrison at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> consisting of about three hundred regulars, besides six hundred French militia, and
                    Indian allies. From Michilimackinac to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River there was militia in varying degrees of organization. At <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>

                    </placeName>, Philippe de Rocheblave, the commandant, organized the inhabitants into military units.
                    The purpose of these organizations was for protection against the Indians as well as for service
                    under the British. The French had taken the oath of allegiance to Britain but their patriotism to
                    that country was questionable. There were approximately eight thousand Indian warriors in the

                    </placeName> for prisoners, and the Americans accused him of also paying for scalps, thus giving him
                    the name "Hair-Buyer." During the year 1778, Clark investigated thoroughly the
                    strength and organization of the enemy by sending spies into the country. It was his opinion that he
                    could conquer it, including <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with five hundred men.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> He was counting on persuading the French
                    and some of the Indians to join him against the British.</p>
            <p>Although Clark's education was quite limited, he must have possessed persuasive powers of a
                    high order, for he soon convinced Governor Patrick Henry of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and his councillors of the feasibility of an expedition to conquer the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> country. He was given power to enlist men and an order to gather supplies from Fort
                    Pitt. He soon recruited a sizeable force in the backwoods country, but on account of the jealousy of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and the opposition to sending men so far away, the numbers were reduced to one hundred
                    fifty. He was also expecting two hundred men from the Holston River country to join him in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, but politics played a strong role here too in persuading many not to serve. Clark
                    finally set out from Redstone, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, on May 12, 1778, traveling by boat, mostly at night to elude the Indians. His ability
                    to pick highly competent subordinates was proved by the fact that the four company commanders were
                    Joseph Bowman, Leonard Helm, William Harrod, and John Montgomery, each of whom had previously proved
                    exceptional ability as an Indian fighter and leader.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    Keeping in mind his military mission, Clark refused to pursue them for fear the results would

            <p>Clark had received two sets of instructions from Governor Patrick Henry, a public one which he used
                    for his authority to enlist men and gather supplies, and a secret one which he showed to no one
                    until he reached the Falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The public document merely stated that he was to proceed to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> with his army, while the instructions ordered him to attack the enemy posts. When he
                    informed his men that they were to proceed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>

                    enemy. Clark tells us that at this time he began to use discipline of a stricter order. He placed
                    guards over the boats, and patrolled the camp, in order to prevent the escape of those wishing to
                    desert. Actually, a few did escape but some of them were brought back and forced to go along. Nearly
                    all Clark's men, it should be stated, were willing to risk their lives in the unknown
                    wilderness, and cheerfully followed the great leader in the cause of the Revolution.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> While at the Falls, Clark received word of the alliance between the <placeName>

                    which could be carried on the men's backs. There is very little available information to

                    of themselves in the wilderness. As Clark was a natural leader, he soon impressed his personality

            <p>Traveling in flatboats, with the oars double-manned, the little expedition dropped down the river.

                    persuaded them to join his band. The party proceeded about ten miles down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    Following in trice of each other Indian style, they started out after resting one day at the old
                    fort.</p>
            <p>Clark chose a difficult and unfrequented route overland to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a distance of about 120 miles to the northwest on the <placeName>

                    fatigued. At this time, they came out upon a prairie where there was much danger of being discovered
                    on account of the open nature of the terrain. On the third day, John Saunders, the guide, became
                    confused and for a few hours it looked as if the expedition would fail for want of knowledge of the
                    proper route to follow. Clark was deeply worried, fearing that the <list type="footnotes">

                    The guide was told positively that he would be sent out under guard to find the trail and if he did
                    not do so in a few hours he would be put to death. The trail was soon found and thereafter the only
                    other thing to mar the march was the scarcity of game owing to a drought. On the evening of July 4,
                    1778, after six days on the march, the last two without food, the command reached the <placeName>

                    here and found out that the militia of the village were well organized but did not suspect his
                    presence. He soon found plenty of boats in which to transfer his men to the other side of the <placeName>

                    war—surprise. In addition, he succeeded through careful planning of details, such as
                    creating the impression that resistance was useless because he was attacking with large numbers.
                    Since all of the surrounding country was inhabited by Indians who were friendly to the French, it is
                    difficult to understand how the Americans actually entered the town and fort before their presence
                    was known. A good explanation is that some of the most famous scouts of the day, such as Simon
                    Kenton, accompanied the expedition. About midnight, they were across the river and ready to attack.
                    Clark divided his force into two parts, one half to attack the town and the other to capture Fort
                    Gage which was just below the town.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> He commanded the detachment directed
                    against the Fort, where the men arrived without the knowledge of the militia. The gate was open and
                    unguarded and the Americans proceeded to take possession. The commander of the fort, Philippe
                    Rocheblave, a Frenchman, was rudely awakened and made a prisoner, preparatory to sending him to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, since he was known to encourage the Indians to kill and capture Americans in the
                    frontier country. The other half of the command marched into the town where it was divided into
                    groups of four or five men to each group to patrol the streets. The soldiers warned all inhabitants
                    that anyone found outside the houses would be shot. Within fifteen minutes, Clark <list type="footnotes">

                    bloodless victory be gained.</p>
            <p>Clark was great as a diplomat as well as a soldier. He realized that his force was not sufficient to
                    hold the country occupied by a hostile population. At first he encouraged the people to believe all
                    of the wicked stories the British had told them of the ferocious Long Knives, the name given to
                    Americans. After terrifying them to the point of begging for their lives, he announced that he would
                    spare them if they would take the oath of fidelity to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, which everyone promptly did. He obtained their loyalty further by notifying them of
                    the alliance between America and <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, and by assuring them that they would be free to worship according to their own
                    religion. In order to retain the submission of the natives and Indians, Clark used another stratagem
                    during the whole campaign of telling them that he had in reserve a large army at the Falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. In truth, the only persons left there were a few families who volunteered to guard the
                    supplies left at the little fort while they cultivated land in the vicinity.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To push further his plan of surprise, Clark sent Captain Joseph Bowman with thirty men, mounted on
                    horses gathered locally, to continue speedily the conquest of other villages to the northward.
                    Starting out on the day following the arrival at <placeName>

                    had not yet spread of the arrival of the Americans. Bowman used the well known military principle of
                    never allowing enemy civilians to precede the army. On the next day, the little force rode into
                    Cahokia, sixty miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Clark gained his whole-hearted support of the American cause.</p>
            <p>Spies were sent eastward to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the large French village on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> River, and it was determined that there was no British garrison at the place. From the
                    first, Clark had the support of Pierre Gibault, the priest at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and decided to send him to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to gain the support of the inhabitants. In a short time, Gibault returned saying that
                    the American flag was now waving over Fort Sackville at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Captain Leonard Helm was sent there to organize the militia. The wooden fort which was
                    in a good state of repair stood on the bank of the river. The four bastions, standing twelve feet
                    above the wall, were each surmounted by three guns.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was necessary for Clark soon to turn his attentions to his own men. Theirs was the same story that
                    occurred in all of our early wars. Their short enlistments were up and they wanted to go home.
                    Although Clark had just conquered an empire, he was about to find himself without an army to hold
                    it. Troops had been promised him from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, but none had arrived. He had all but performed miracles with the few men who came with
                    him but he was on the verge of losing this small number. Finally, he persuaded one hundred of the
                    men to remain for eight more months, and, in addition, enlisted a company of French natives. The
                    reorganized force started a rigid system of regular training and in a short time Clark tells us no
                    garrison could boast of better order or a finer set of men. To deceive the inhabitants and Indians,
                    especially the British spies, in regard to his real strength, Clark never permitted his men to
                    parade in public. The men to be discharged were sent back to the Falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        accessible.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                    </placeName> owing to the fact that the Indians working for the British had captured all of the

                    to recover the post was characteristic of the man. He called a conference of his leaders and they

                    companies, two of which were native militia, the whole amounting to about 130 men. When it is
                    remembered that Clark had conquered these people only the previous summer, it is remarkable that he
                    had already won their loyalty to such a degree that he had no trouble getting volunteers to fight

                    During the first six days of the march, that is, from February 7 to 12, they covered 174 miles, or
                    twenty-eight miles per day, which is remarkable even in good weather and over smooth roads. Although
                    the weather was not freezing, it rained nearly every day. In fact, there had been so much rain that

                    through rain and water. The men were amused by the little drummer floating on his drum. The food was

                    decided to resort to a trick. Wetting his hands and pouring some powder in them he rubbed his face
                    to blacken it. He told the men to do like-wise, and, before they could question him, he plunged into
                    the water and everyone followed. As the water was deep, they made only three miles this day. Before
                    leaving camp on the twenty-third Clark made a speech to his men, but to make sure that everyone came
                    along on the march, he ordered Captain Bowman with twenty-five picked men to bring up the rear and
                    to shoot anyone who tried to go back. The water was so deep that it was necessary to have the canoes
                    move along with the column to pick up men who were weakened from fatigue. The exhausted column
                    finally reached a dry spot about noon. A canoe with Indian squaws came along and from them Clark got
                    a half-quarter of buffalo meat for his starving men. After a short rest, they plunged again into the
                    cold water and arrived at Warrior's Island during the afternoon. This Island was only two
                    miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in plain sight of it. The men passed from complete exhaustion to elation and wished
                    to push on at once to the fort.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While still concealed behind the hill, Clark's men noticed toward the town several duck
                    hunters on horse back. One of them was brought in without arousing the suspicions of the others.
                    From him, information was obtained that the British were still unaware of the approach of the
                    Americans. He also stated that the fort had been repaired, and that there were a good many Indians
                    in town. Clark's situation was serious unless he could obtain provisions at once. From
                    information at hand he believed that most of the French inhabitants were friendly and likewise some
                    of the Indians. Since the <hi rend="i">Willing</hi> had not arrived, he was without cannon. He was
                    also short of powder on account of part of it getting wet while his force crossed the flooded
                    lowlands. He believed that he could get both powder and food in the town, which he soon did. He
                    decided, before attacking, to warn <list type="footnotes">

                    believe the British would gain an advantage in case they found out about his approach as he was now
                    such a short distance away. After the message was sent, he decided to give an effect of large
                    numbers in his force by marching his men in such a way as to show them at the same spot several
                    time. As some of his militia brought guidons, he displayed them above the hill to indicate that he
                    had several companies. Further to conceal his true strength, he waited until dark to attack.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Clark maneuvered to bring his force to the opposite side of the town from the fort. Once more wading
                    through water breast high, they entered the town at eight o'clock in the evening, still
                    without the knowledge of the British as the inhabitants had not notified them of the arrival of the
                    Americans. The Indians upon hearing of the pending fight between the Long-Knives and the red-coats
                    hastily decamped. Lieutenant John Bayley, with fourteen men, was sent to at-tack Fort Sackville,
                    while the remainder of the command was distributed through the town to watch the people and obtain
                    supplies and munitions. The surprise was so complete that when fire was first opened on the fort the
                    British did not reply as they thought the Indians were shooting their guns to celebrate. After a
                    reconnaissance of the area, Clark ordered Bowman's company to dig entrenchments about the
                    fort. As most of Clark's men were soon ordered to attack the stockade there was brisk
                    firing on both sides. The British cannon were located in the blockhouses eleven feet above the
                    ground and could not be used to shoot at anyone near the walls. The Americans soon found this out
                    and some crawled up as close as thirty yards. In this position, they were safe from the enemy cannon
                    and could see the gunners operating the guns. Several of those operating the cannon were killed or
                    wounded, which was, according to <hi rend="i">Bowman's Journal</hi>, "fine sport
                    for the sons of liberty". It became necessary for the portholes to be closed in order to
                    avoid more casualties. Every time a porthole was opened in order to fire a cannon, several marksmen
                    fired into the opening. Clark's men were warned to take no chances of being <list type="footnotes">

                    wounded. A party of thirty men from the fort returned to the edge of the town during the night from
                    a scouting expedition. Iri order to prevent them from going among the hostile Indians and bringing
                    reenforcements to the fort, Clark decided to draw off some of his men in their vicinity and allow
                    them to re-enter the fort.</p>
            <p>At daylight, the Americans near the walls were withdrawn to the entrenchments in order to keep down
                    casualties. Firing was heavy from now until about nine o'clock when Clark sent a message to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> demanding the surrender of the fort. During the truce on the twenty-fourth, the men had
                    their first regular meal since the eighteenth. At the interview between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Clark, the latter explained that if the fort was not surrendered at once his men
                    would storm it and probably kill everyone there. After thinking the matter over <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> capitulated with the honors of war, giving in his report his reasons as "the
                    remoteness from succor, the state and quantity of provisions, the unanimity of officers and men on
                    its expediency, the honor-able terms allowed, and lastly, the confidence in a generous
                    enemy." The British marched out and laid down their arms the next day, February 25, 1779.
                    The British officers and a few of the soldiers were sent away to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, as
                    prisoners of war, and the French partisans were paroled and sent back to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> where Clark knew they would create a favorable feeling for the Americans.</p>

               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been expecting a convoy of boats with provisions from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> about this time. On February 26, Clark sent Captain Helm with fifty men to intercept
                    them. The convoy was surprised a few miles south of Ouiatenon, near the present <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the entire force of forty-seven men and seven boats laden with supplies was
                    captured. This booty, valued at $50,000, was distributed among the soldiers. As the
                    captured property at Fort Sackville was disposed of in a similar manner, Clark's followers
                    were now "rich," except the officers who were not allowed to share in the spoils.
                    Three days after the capture of Fort Sackville, the <hi rend="i">Willing</hi> arrived, the crew much
                    chagrined that they were unable on account of delays to take part in the capture of the Fort.</p>
            <p>The achievement of Clark's army is one of the finest in <pb n="350" id="VAA4025-036-4-026"/>
                    history. Confronted by apparently insurmountable difficulties, it won complete success in the end.
                    On an incredibly miserable march of 240 miles from <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> the men showed a perseverance that won them permanent fame. To Clark must go the credit
                    for victory in the entire campaign, for it was his leadership, daring, and resourcefulness that kept
                    the army moving toward its goal. Although the number of men in the expedition was small, they were
                    handled in such a way that we recognize in Clark a military commander of a high type. There was
                    coupled with his tactical knowledge a sense of strategy, that brought him to the right place for
                    victory. He must also be given credit as a diplomat for he won over to his cause the loyalty of
                    French-men and Indians wherever he went. His ability to understand the mind of savage or Creole won
                    him support throughout the northwest. Clark's love for the land pictured the country that
                    he fought for filled with settlers, but his military instinct showed him how it could be won. To him
                    and the brave men who followed him must be given the credit for performing the first necessary
                    exploit in the winning from the British the area included in what is now more than five states.</p>

            <head>Chapman Denslow and His Family</head>
            <byline>HUGH TH. MILLER</byline>
            <p>Chapman Denslow was born in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
               </placeName>, on June 22, 1772. He was my
                    great-grandfather—the father of my paternal grandmother, Gertrude Denslow Miller. Two
                    years after the death of my grandfather, John Smith Miller, my grandmother married the Rev. Aaron
                    Farmer. Three years later, in 1839, this second husband died, but my grand-mother lived until 1882.
                    Many years passed before it was possible to learn either the date or the place of Chapman
                    Denslow's birth. My grandmother lived either alone or with one of my aunts in the later
                    years of her life, and she died when I was fourteen years old. Up to that time, I did not take the
                    interest in genealogy that I did later on. As a consequence, I have regretted ever since that I did
                    not seize the opportunity to ask her many questions about facts, dates and places that, forty or
                    fifty years later, seemed al-most unanswerable. My maternal grandmother lived with us during her
                    later years, and my awakening interest in my ancestors was satisfied by her excellent memory of the
                    history of my mother's side of the house. I finally bought a blank book and wrote down
                    laboriously the names of all my cousins and aunts and uncles, as well as those of many of their
                    forbears, only to find, in 1888, that John Calhoun Garr, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName>, had covered all the ground in his monumental <hi rend="i">Garr Genealogy</hi>, which
                    contains the names of more than fifteen thousand of my mother's relatives, all descended
                    from Andreas Gar of Bavaria, who came to the new world towards the end of the German immigration
                    which peopled interior <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and parts of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and the Carolinas. It was in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> that Andreas Gar settled.</p>
            <p>For many years, the only data or traditions about Chapman Denslow that came to my attention were: the
                    fact that he was a "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> Yankee;" that he married into one of the Dutch families settled along the
                    upper Hudson; that this Hogeboom family into which he married was connected in several ways with the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Ness families; that he came to Indiana early and lived first in Clark and then in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jennings County</region>
                    </placeName>; and the fact that he was in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> campaign in 1811. There was a more or less vague tradition that he had the title of
                    major from this <pb n="352" id="VAA4025-036-4-028"/> service. This was all that I knew or could find
                    out about Chapman Denslow before I started to work. My grandmother and one of her sisters whom I saw
                    when I was a very small boy, for one afternoon only, were the only persons whom I had ever seen who
                    had personally known Chapman Denslow. The census of 1790 did not record his name either in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>I saw one day in a book review the name of Professor <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren Denslow of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University and immediately wrote him through his publishers to learn if he knew
                    anything of the Denslow history. He replied that he knew nothing of the family, but that George
                    MacKenzie Roberts, who was then treasurer-general of the Sons of the American Revolution, was a
                    Denslow descendant and knew about the history of the family. I wrote to Mr. Roberts immediately at
                    the address Professor Denslow gave me and was quite thrilled to find that he was almost as glad to
                    make my acquaintance as I was to make his. He knew that there was a Chapman Denslow but knew little
                    or nothing of his family. Mr. Roberts had become the literary heir of a relative of the preceding
                    generation, had amplified very extensively the data turned over to him and had a most interesting
                    and almost complete history of the Denslow line in America. We both set to work to learn more about
                    my great-grandfather, and I obtained from old residents of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jennings County</region>
                    </placeName>, with the help of Judge John W. Carney of Vernon, the names of Chapman
                    Denslow's numerous children. Mr. Roberts and I assumed that he was the youngest son of
                    Samuel Denslow, Jr., of Windsor, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, but we soon saw that this would make him rather an old man to endure the rigors of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> Campaign. In this campaign, however, as I learned from another source, he spent some
                    time in the camp hospital, presumably from malaria, which was quite prevalent while the army was
                    being assembled and before the fall frosts killed the mosquitoes. My late brother, John F. G.
                    Miller, who lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and later in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, became interested at this point and, through his own researches and the assistance of
                    genealogists in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, gave us material aid. We soon found that Chapman Denslow was the <hi rend="i">grandson</hi>, not the <hi rend="i">son</hi>, of Samuel Denslow, Jr., and son of Benjamin Denslow
                    who lived in Windsor, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, and who went westward to Flanders, or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>

                    Thompson in 1771 and their first child was Chapman Denslow. It was interesting to note that another
                    son was born on July 4, 1776, who died in infancy. Bejamin Denslow himself died soon after, on
                    August 8, 1776, and his widow, who remarried, survived him sixty-one years, dying at the age of
                    eighty-four on May 22, 1837. The boy, Chapman Denslow, apparently did not get along very well with
                    his half-brothers and half-sisters nor with his step-father. It is possible that his mother did not
                    take his side in this disagreement, for, at the age of eighteen, he asked for a guardian outside of
                    the family, which petition was granted.</p>
            <p>About the time that Chapman Denslow came of age, it is apparent that he left <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>

                    </placeName>, to Claverack Township, where, in a few years, he married Sarah Mathilda Hogeboom,
                    daughter of Johannes Hogeboom and Gertrude Muller. The Hogeboom family had been living near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> for a century and a half, the first of the name having come over from Holland in 1651
                    with the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Rensselaers. Sarah's mother was a descendant of an old French Huguenot family
                    that had fled to Holland at the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The family wrote the
                    name <hi rend="i">de Muldor</hi> at first which now-a-days is written <hi rend="i">Miller</hi>. It
                    is through Sara Hoge-boom's paternal grandfather, Johannes Hogeboom, Sr., that the
                    descendants of Chapman Denslow inherit their title to membership in the D.A.R. and S.A.R. Chapman
                    Denslow's father died at the very outset of the Revolutionary War, and Sarah
                    Hogeboom's father, blessed with a house full of small children, was not called to service,
                    but Johannes, Sr., al-though at the three-score-and-ten mark, seems to have been a vigorous old
                    gentleman for he enlisted promptly. He was quite a man of the world, having for many years kept a
                    tavern on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> post-road and having been fined on one occasion for playing golf on Sunday.</p>
            <p>On their farm at Claverack, four children were born to Chapman and Sarah Denslow before the urge to
                    move west overtook them. These children were John, Benjamin, Gertrude (my grandmother, born May 4,
                    1801), and Sarah. In 1805, Chapman Denslow, traveling in a covered wagon, made his way with his
                    family to the headwaters of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, where he constructed a flatboat and drifted down past Marietta, <pb n="354" id="VAA4025-036-4-030"/> the old capital of Northwest Territory, to the mouth of the Scioto,
                    which he laboriously ascended to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chillicothe</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the capital of the new state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Finding the choice land about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chillicothe</settlement>
                    </placeName> already taken up, he went eleven miles north to Circleville (in 1806) and remained
                    there two years. At that time, there was no <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the north of Circleville. In 1808, hearing of the lands that were being purchased
                    from the Indians in Indiana Territory, he floated down the Scioto to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and on to the falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to settle in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, eight years before Indiana became a state. I have so far been unable to
                    locate the exact spot of his settlement, as Clark county was originally granted to the soldiers of
                    George Rogers Clark for service in the capture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and their title deeds consisted in many cases of certificates, which they carried
                    about with them and did not take the trouble to have recorded. These were simply endorsed over from
                    seller to purchaser, like a note. When they were finally recorded, the intermediate names were not
                    indexed, so that it is practically a hopeless task to try to find one of the endorsers of such a
                    certificate. The dates of Chapman Denslow's journeys to the West, I found in the papers of
                    my cousin, the late John Miller Rose-berry, of Des Moines, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, who was the first of his generation to become interested in our family history.</p>
            <p>I was unable to verify the connection of Chapman Dens-low with the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> campaign until Colonel William M. Cockrum published his very interesting book,
                    containing the roster of Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew</region>
                    </placeName>'s Indiana militia. I was once more thrilled to find the name of Chap-man
                    Denslow as sergeant-major on the staff of Colonel <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew</region>
                    </placeName>. It is evident that in those days the sergeant-major was given the title of major by
                    courtesy, just as now-a-days, a lieutenant-colonel is often referred to as colonel.</p>
            <p>The Pigeon Roost Massacre occurred only a few miles to the north in 1813, and the Denslow family
                    presumably fled to one of the numerous block houses in Clark and Jefferson counties, as did other
                    settlers. Chapman Denslow moved over into the southern part of Jennings county, near the Graham fork
                    of the Muscatatuck River, where he entered land in 1815. When the county was organized in 1817, he
                    was elected one of the associate judges. Under the first constitution of Indiana, two laymen,
                    usually farmers, were <pb n="355" id="VAA4025-036-4-031"/> made associate judges for each county, to
                    discharge routine duties of the circuit court, especially probate matters, and to try persons
                    accused of misdemeanors. Criminal cases and other more important matters awaited the arrival of the
                    judge who rode the circuit of several counties with his train of lawyers. Chapman Denslow was chosen
                    associate judge and probate judge of the county at successive elections until his death in 1834. The
                    court record is the only means we have of knowing just when his death occurred and this shows that
                    it must have been in August, 1834, when he was sixty-two years old. The facts about his service in
                    the circuit court were obtained from the valuable work of Judge Leonidas Monks. I have tried in many
                    ways to find the exact date of Chapman Denslow's death, but none of the files of old papers
                    in southern Indiana has so far yielded any information on this subject. The farm on which he lived
                    is now owned by Mr. Sam Deputy, who took me to the spot where the house was and showed me the two
                    graves of Chapman Denslow and his wife Sarah, who survived her husband some fourteen years. The
                    graves are a few hundred feet from the house in the pasture which slopes down to a little stream.
                    The graves are marked simply by pieces of rough limestone, so that no names or dates are preserved.</p>
            <p>There is an unconfirmed family tradition that Chapman Denslow taught school after he came to Indiana,
                    and it might well be that he had a literary bent, as three of his chilren were named Cassandra,
                    Lucinda, and Zerelda. Those names certainly did not come from his Dutch wife's ancestors
                    nor from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> Denslows. I was confused for a time with the record of the birth and christening of a
                    son Benjamin born in Claverack, and a son Benjamin born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> in 1807. This date came from descendants of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Benjamin and is apparently incontestable. Later research developed the fact that the
                    Benjamin born in Claverack died in infancy and the name, which was that of Chapman
                    Denslow's father, was given to the son born in 1807.</p>
            <p>Chapman Denslow's eldest son, John H. Denslow, inherited his father's pioneer
                    instincts and, in 1849, when it was announced that gold had been discovered in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, he sold his farm in Jennings county, loaded his family and house-hold goods in a
                    covered wagon and started for the western coast. When he arrived at the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> River, where the <pb n="356" id="VAA4025-036-4-032"/> city of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> now stands, he found there a swarm of like-minded adventurers, who were unable to cross
                    the wide, deep, muddy river then at flood tide. This group with its lack of organization and neglect
                    of sanitation soon became a hot bed for disease, and the dread scourge of cholera appeared. John
                    Hogeboom Denslow was swiftly carried away, and his widow was left among strangers with a large
                    family of children and a multitude of counsellors. She took the advice of those who recommended to
                    her the fertile prairie lands of the new state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, which had been admitted to the union only three years before. Here she settled at once
                    and reared her family. Descendants of this family are to be found in several states of the Trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> region. John's brother Benjamin followed his relatives to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> a fgw years later and lived there to a good old age, leaving one son. Chapman Denslow
                    had eleven children in all. In addition to those already named there were: Sarah, named for her
                    mother, Harriet, named for another Dutch relative, Charlotte and Mary.</p>
            <p>Sarah Mathilda Hogeboom, who became the wife of Chapman Denslow, was a typically industrious,
                    spotlessly clean, courageous Dutch maiden. There is a family tradition that in the last days of the
                    Revolutionary war, when Sarah was just about grown, a foraging party of British soldiers appeared
                    suddenly one day near Claverack. Sarah looked on while the soldiers appropriated some feed for their
                    horses, but when they approached the precious fruit cellar, dug in the side of a hill, lined with
                    stone and straw, and filled with apples, turnips, carrots, beets, and other precious vegetables
                    which gave variety to her diet, Sarah sprang to life. She grasped a pitch fork and took her station
                    in front of the fruit cellar door and defied the enemy to come on. The officer in charge of the
                    party burst into a hearty laugh at the defiance of the little Hollander, and he and his men rode on
                    to another farm where the folks were not so belligerent.</p>
            <p>Gertrude Denslow, eldest daughter of Chapman and Sarah Denslow, was born in Claverack township, on
                    May 24, 1801. She was not very tall and weighed only a little over one hundred pounds, but from her
                    blue eyes there could flash the same Dutch courage which her mother had shown in the incident just
                    related. She was only twelve years old when the family had to take refuge in a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName> blockhouse <pb n="357" id="VAA4025-036-4-033"/> at the time of the Pigeon Roost
                    Massacre, which occurred a few miles away. She shared the anxieties of the house-hold during her
                    father's absence in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> campaign against the Shawnees. She learned all the arts of the pioneer woman, and, when
                    she married John Smith Miller, on March 20, 1823, she felt no fear as they went on horseback into
                    the wilderness of the new county named Johnson. The territory embraced in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>

                    had been surveyed in 1819 and 1820, and the lands were placed on sale in 1821. On August 31 of that
                    year, John Smith Miller bought the first tract of land taken up in what is now <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township. He spent the spring, summer and fall of 1822 clearing a field and building a
                    small log cabin. He had chosen the highest hill in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township in order to be able to live above the mosquito-infested lowlands of the East

            <p>John Smith Miller was the oldest son of a Scotch-Irish immigrant, John Miller, who arrived in America
                    in 1767 from Ulster. As a child, with his father of the same name, he settled in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, near Rutherfordton. John Miller, Jr., at the close of the war of 1812, took his wife
                    and family of fourteen children across the mountains into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, but, finding the best land of that area all taken, proceeded in 1815 to Indiana, where
                    he settled in Jennings county in the year that the county was organized (1817). He and his wife
                    (Jane Smith, daughter of John Smith), for whom the eldest son was named, are buried in the old
                    Graham Presbyterian Churchyard west of Dupont. The church is named for the Graham Fork of the

            <p>John Smith Miller's younger brother, Uriah Robertson Miller, walked across the hills and
                    enrolled as a student in <placeName>

                    </placeName> College when that institution was first opened. His college life was cut short,
                    however, by typhoid fever, which carried him away in the fall of 1829. Another brother of John Smith
                    Miller was William, who married Rhoda Thomas of Jefferson county. When Rhoda was a small child, she
                    was a source of wonderment and fascination to roving Indian hunters, who, since they lived entirely
                    surrounded by brunettes, never tired of admiring the blonde curls and blue eyes of the little white
                    girl. In fact, so persistent were their admiration and offers to buy her for a high price, that her
                    mother kept the child constantly in her sight, and, when the other children found their way through
                    the dense forest to the neighborhood school, the mother would not allow Rhoda to go with them. She
                    felt sure that the Indians would like nothing better than to carry her off, as they did a number of
                    children in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. When the Indians left Indiana, Rhoda had
                    become such a big girl that she was ashamed to start with the beginners and so never received a book
                    education, although she became most proficient in in all the arts of the housewife. When the Civil
                    war came, two of her stalwart sons went to the front and letters soon began arriving from them.
                    After being compelled to rely on other members of the family to read them to her, Rhoda (Thomas)
                    Miller, then fifty years old, determined to read and write her own letters. She obtained the primary
                    books and carried them about the house with her while at her daily tasks and was soon able to write
                    to her soldier sons and to read their replies as many times as she liked without calling for
                    assistance.</p>
            <p>The little cabin of John Smith and Gertrude Denslow Miller in Johnson County was like all the
                    log-houses of that period, built beside a spring. The spring water was later piped down the hill to
                    the lower ground by Alonzo Gale, who bought the farm several years later. This water still runs in
                    the "milk house" through the trough in which milk and butter are kept as in a
                    primitive refrigerator. The nearest cabin when Gertrude Denslow Miller became a house-keeper in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township was that of Jaob Woodruff, who <pb n="359" id="VAA4025-036-4-035"/> had come
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName> the same year that John Smith Miller arrived and who had opened a store on the corner
                    of his land one-half mile east of the village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, now <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Williamsburg was named for the early capital of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, but was compelled by the Post Office Department to give up that name because of prior
                    use by a village of the same name in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> county, Indiana. Joab Woodruff, by the way, whose grandson Benjamin Woodruff still
                    lives on the old farm, was a mighty hunter. During the first year after he built his store at the
                    cross roads, he killed three hundred seventy deer and was able to keep his own family and the
                    families of many of his customers, who were too busy with other matters to hunt for themselves, or
                    too unskilled, supplied with fresh meat. Joab Woodruff also killed many bears and wolves during
                    those early years.</p>
            <p>Gertrude Denslow Miller thus lived nearly a mile from the nearest store, and in between was an
                    unbroken and almost impenetrable forest. Many of the tulip trees, white oaks and black walnuts were
                    more than six feet in diameter, and their leafy tops were so interlaced that the sun never struck
                    the ground. The squirrels who found abundant food under the walnut, butternut, hickory and beech
                    trees, welcomed enthusiastically the prospect of a change of diet and fell on the new corn fields in
                    the fall like a swarm of locusts. One settler nearby reported having harvested one whole ear of corn
                    from four acres of shocks after the squirrels had finished their work. Gertrude Denslow Miller,
                    however, shouldered her husband's trusty rifle and patrolled the corn field with such good
                    effect that a fairly good harvest was had even the first year. She later told her grandchildren that
                    she had no use for a rifleman who would shoot a squirrel or any other kind of game thrugh the body
                    and thus deface the hide and spoil a good cut of meat. Small though she was, she handled the heavy
                    rifle with such good effect that all her squirrels were shot in the head. The first three yars of
                    her married life found her left alone frequently by her husband, who was forced to make trips to
                    Jennings county or to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> to obtain articles which were not available in Joab Woodruff's store. She told
                    her grandchildren of many occasions on which roving Indian hunters, singly or in bands, stopped to
                    ask for a drink from the spring, a piece of corn-bread, or something else that happened to strike
                    their fancy. In <pb n="360" id="VAA4025-036-4-036"/> midsummer, they were very prone to steal
                    roasting-ears from the far side of the corn patch. She kept her rifle just inside the door and said
                    that she never felt any real fear of the visitors. A cabin was built after three years by her
                    nearest neighbor, Robert Moore, who entered the eighty acres to the west of the Miller land in 1824.</p>
            <p>John Smith Miller kept on clearini additional land and improving his farm until, in 1826, he was
                    offered $400 for it, four times the amount he had paid the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Government in 1821. He then sold this farm to William Gillaspy and bought Robert
                    Moore's land to the west for $200 and had a nice nest-egg of cash. His family
                    was increasing. His oldest son, George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, arrived in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName> forests in 1825. There, the young father erected a two-story, double log cabin near the
                    center of the tract he had bought, and, as always, near a spring. The site of the original cabin of
                    Robert Moore is near another spring which was evidently very popular with game in the early days,
                    because Indian arrow-heads and tomahawks are still turned up by the plow in its neighborhood. In her
                    new home, which was one of the large dwellings of the neighborhood, Gertrude Denslow Miller had room
                    for her loom, on which she wove the material for the clothing of her family of six children. In my
                    boyhood, I was interested to find also in the deserted building candle-moulds, spinning-wheels, and
                    other relics of the early days. On the outside wall of an addition to the house, one of my aunts
                    once showed me holes bored in the logs where sharp pegs had been inserted to hold up the occasional
                    newspaper, which reached the family from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and which my grandmother read diligently as she churned, while standing to manipulate
                    the old churndasher.</p>
            <p>John Smith Miller was one of the leaders in his neighborhood and county and was a member of the first
                    board of county commissioners when Johnson County was organized, and also a member of the first
                    grand jury. He was a giant of six feet, four inches, weighing over two hundred pounds and must have
                    caused some merriment among his neighbors when he appeared with his tiny wife. His well-founded
                    dread of malaria-bearing mosquitoes, which had led him to build his first cabin on the top of the
                    highest hill that he could find, was forgotten, to his cost. In midsummer, <pb n="361" id="VAA4025-036-4-037"/> 1834, he came down with a most vicious attack of that dread scourge of
                    pioneer days, ague, or chills and fever, or malaria, and the physician who was called in used the
                    only anti-pyretic known in that neighborhood, blood-letting. So the doctor bled his patient until
                    the patient's fever left him, and his life left with it. About the only other remedy known
                    to medical science in those days was calomel, which was given in terrific doses, and with terrific
                    results. There was no surprise that in some neighborhoods, notably in the New Hope community, north
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, practice of the Thompsonian type appeared. Joseph Fassett, farmer, teacher, minister
                    and physician, practiced Thompsonian medicine there for more than one-fourth of a century with
                    considerable success. He discarded calomel and other mineral drugs and used the herbs, barks, and
                    roots that the Indians found so efficacious on many occasions. He was too far away to be called for
                    John Smith Miller, however, and Gertrude was left a widow with her six children in 1834, her son
                    George being only nine years of age at the time. She told us in later years that she did the plowing
                    and the wood-chopping for a year or two and that, when it came to cultivating corn and vegetables,
                    she would pull the cultivating plow herself with little George at the handles. In 1836, she
                    remarried, the Rev. Aaron Farmer, a preacher-farmer of the Newbern community of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew</region>
                    </placeName> County and a minister of the United Brethren church, becoming her second husband. He
                    lived only three years after the marriage, however, and she then remained a widow until her death in
                    1882, at the age of eighty-one. The youngest daughter of her first husband died early, but the
                    oldest of her second husband's two children grew to womanhood, and so the mother lived to
                    see six children grown and married. She had frequent reunions with them and with her thirty-two
                    grandchildren in her old age.</p>
            <p>The farm which her first husband bought from Robert Moore in 1826 remained in possession of members
                    of the Miller family until 1933, when it was transferred to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName> Christian Church by the will of Gertrude Denslow Miller (granddaughter of Mrs. Gertrude
                    Denslow Miller) and by deed of her brothers and sisters. These, the writer being included, were the
                    children of John Chapman Miller, who, named for his two grandfathers, was born in the double log
                    house in 1831 and died on the same farm in 1901. The farm <pb n="362" id="VAA4025-036-4-038"/> was
                    operated first by Gertrude Denslow Miller, Sr. (Mrs. John Smith Miller), with the aid of her
                    children, then by her eldest son George, with whom she lived. The place was sold by him to her
                    youngest daughter, Lucinda, who had married Virgil Preston Gale. They lived on the original Miller
                    tract to the east. Gale soon sold the farm to my father, John Chapman Miller, who built on it, in
                    1866, the house which now stands in excellent repair and which is used as the parsonage of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName> Christian Church. John Chapman Miller was prepared for college by William
                    Satterthwaite, a graduate of Bethany College, who came from his home in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to the vicinity of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, married Josephine Troutman, in the New Hope neighborhood, and, after teaching at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName> to establish what was a forerunner of the high school. He died young of tuberculosis.</p>
            <p>John Chapman Miller was graduated from Indiana University, where he was a roommate and fellow Phi
                    Delta Theta with Judge David Demaree Banta, historian of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                    </placeName>. After further study at Bethany College in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, Mr. Miller spent some years in the Christian ministry at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and then bought the old home from his brother-in-law and sister, Mr. and Mrs. Gale. He
                    'built the house there, to which reference has been made, in the summer of 1866. In that
                    fall, he opened, in the old Christian church building in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a high school or academy. In this school, for the next four years, he prepared a large
                    number of students for college. This academy was doubtless the inspiration for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName> high school which was erected in 1876. This high school was said by Fassett A. Cotton,
                    former state superintendent of public instruction (and, like his later successor, Floyd MacMurray, a
                    native of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName>), in his <hi rend="i">History of Education in Indiana</hi>, to have been the first
                    township high school in Indiana. Because of my father's educational experience, he was
                    permitted to train his children at home, where he prepared them to enter college. His mother,
                    Gertrude Denslow Miller, Sr., lived in the new house erected by him in 1866 from 1870 to 1876, while
                    he was minister of the Third Christian Church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and member of the faculty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> University (then Northwestern Christian University). For a few years after her son
                    returned to the farm in 1876, she lived <pb n="363" id="VAA4025-036-4-039"/> there with him, but
                    later took a house in the village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, near her beloved Methodist church, in which she was superintendent of the Sunday
                    School and chief pillar until her death. When her health broke, she went to live with her daughter
                    Martha (Mrs. John Keaton).</p>
            <p>Gertrude Denslow Miller, Sr., was as industrious as a reader as she was a worker with her hands. When
                    the day's work was done, her chickens safely locked up for the night and all the other
                    evening work completed, she always read her Bible, the <hi rend="i">Western Christian Advocate</hi>
                    and some religious book until her early bedtime. She was then up by candle-light in the early
                    morning and busy from the start. I have called her Gertrude Denslow Miller, Sr., because her
                    grand-daughter of the same name (my sister) lived on the same farm and managed it with much the same
                    ability for more than thirty years. Gertrude, the elder, was really Mrs. Gertrude Denslow (Miller)
                    Farmer. John Chapman Miller, father of the younger Gertrude Denslow Miller (also my father) died in
                    1901. Then my sister took charge of affairs on the home place until her death in 1933. She suffered
                    a stroke while hurrying across a field to put out a brush fire which had threatened one of her
                    fences. She was the chief pillar of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName> Christian Church, its leader in all departments of work, and the guardian of community
                    welfare, appearing at every sick-bed, in the home of every shut-in, and on every other occasion that
                    required aid or sympathy, with inevitable regularity. It was mentioned, at the time of her death,
                    that the farm for more than a hundred years had been the home of a Gertrude Denslow Miller, who,
                    most of the time was its sole manager.</p>
            <p>It has been mentioned that Chapman Denslow was the oldest child of Benjamin Denslow and Sibyl
                    Tmompson of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
               </placeName>. Benjamin was the son of Samuel Dens-low, Jr., and Sarah
                    Chapman. Samuel Denslow, Sr., was the son of Henry Denslow, who was born in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> in 1615. Henry, in 1676, while King Philip's Indians were waging their deadly
                    war against the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> settlers, left the blockhouse at Windsor one afternoon to go up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> River to his farm at Windsor Locks to salt his cattle. He was warned that the Indians
                    had been reported close at hand, but said that he was not afraid of any Indian that ever lived. He
                    should have heeded the warning, for he <pb n="364" id="VAA4025-036-4-040"/> was taken prisoner and
                    killed by the savages. The site of his house in Windsor Locks is marked by a huge boulder and a
                    bronze plate. Early genealogists record that the father of Henry Denslow was Nicholas Denslow, who
                    came to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Bay on the <hi rend="i">Mary and John</hi> in 1630. This is a widely accepted view
                    today, but some have dissented on the ground that Henry was not named in the will of Nicholas nor in
                    the passenger list of the <hi rend="i">Mary and John</hi>. There is evidence against this view and
                    in favor of the original one of Nicholas as the father of Henry, in that Nicholas lived to be quite
                    old, remarried, and named in his will of 1666 only children and grandchildren of the second
                    marriage. Those of the first marriage were then grown up, married, and in possession of property.
                    Also, even if Henry came over with his father, it was not surprising that a boy of fifteen might not
                    be mentioned, and quite possibly Henry came over from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to join his father and step-mother at a later date. In any event, it is agreed that
                    Nicholas was either the uncle or the father of Henry Denslow. Nicholas was a freeman, or voting
                    citizen, of Dorchester, now a part of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for six years, during which time the town-meeting, as New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>', knows it, had its origin there. In 1636, he was one of the party under the
                    leadership of Hooker and Stone who walked through the wilderness to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> River and founded the town of Windsor. The following year, when the Pequot Indians
                    massacred thirty of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> settlers and threatened a war of extermination, Nicholas was one of the little band of
                    militia who used Indian tactics to locate and surround the tribe near Groton, and, in the battle of
                    Mystic, practically exterminated the Pequot tribe, distributing its survivors among other tribes.</p>
            <p>Nicholas Denslow was the oldest white man in this battle. Along with other ancestors of Champan
                    Denslow, he was a citizen of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> in 1639, when the char-ter that is called the first written constitution of a
                    self-governing people was granted. Of late years, an amateur genealogist in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, a retired slergyman, has been investigating the early history of the Denslow family
                    and has produced evidence indicating that the first of the name was one Giovanni di Angelo, who
                    emigrated from <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> in the reign of Henry VIII, before Henry broke with the pope over the question of
                    divorcing his <pb n="365" id="VAA4025-036-4-041"/> wife. After this break with the Pope, King Henry
                    looked with disfavor on these Italian citizens, and they found it wise to change their names.
                    Giovanni di Angelo, who had meantime married Johanna Bailey, took his wife's maiden name.
                    After the intensity of this feeling against the Italians died down, he was known as di Angelo alias
                    Bailey. Finally di Angelo in everyday speech became <hi rend="i">Denzhlo, then Denzlo</hi>, and
                    finally <hi rend="i">Denslow</hi>. This Italian-born English-man had a son, Hugh, who had, among
                    other children, Nicholas and John as sons. It is now believed that, if Henry was not the son of
                    Nicholas, he was certainly the son of John, and consequently descended from Hugh and his Italian
                    father.</p>
            <p>Among the early ancestors of Chapman Denslow are the Grants. His grandmother Sarah Chapman was a
                    daughter of Henry Chapman and Hannah Grant, Hannah being a daughter of Tahan Grant and Hannah
                    Palmer. Tahan Grant was the son of Matthew Grant and Priscilla Grey. Matthew was, along with
                    Nicholas Denslow, a passenger on the <hi rend="i">Mary and John</hi> and a founder of Windsor. He
                    was the historian of early Windsor, keeping a diary in which he set down everything with meticulous
                    care. He was the ancestor of the chief line of Grant in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, of which President Ulysses S. Grant was a member. Amateur genealogists (including the
                    writer) were considerably excited for some time over the possibility that Priscilla Grey, Matthew
                    Grant's wife, was the daughter of the Reverend Anthony Grey of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, whose line of descent can be very accurately traced back to the Plantagenet family of
                    English kings and through them to Charlemagne and certain of the later rulers of the Holy Roman
                    Empire. We learned, however, by later investigation, that the Priscilla Grey who was the daughter of
                    the Reverend Anthony Grey was too young to have been the wife of Matthew Grant, when he was married
                    in 1623. The Grants trace their English ancestry back to William Graunt of Roxby in Yorkshire, who
                    is said to have come down to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> from the Grant clan of Inverness, <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>. Nicholas Denslow, Matthew Grant, Nicholas Palmer (father of Hannah), Giles Gibbs, and
                    Thomas Dibble (father of Hepzibah, who married Samuel, son of Giles Gibbs, and mother of Patience)
                    were all charter members of the First Congregational Church of Windsor, which was organized <pb n="366" id="VAA4025-036-4-042"/> in 1630 on the <hi rend="i">Mary and John</hi> during its
                    voyage to America. This church celebrated its three-hundredth anniversary some years ago, and the
                    historian of that occasion claimed that it was the first Congregational church in America.</p>
            <p>In the old churchyard at Windsor lies Katherine Gibbs, wife of Giles, who died in 1660, and the
                    inscription on whose tombstone, a large slab covering the entire grave, may still be easily read.
                    John F. G. Miller, brother of the writer, in recent years, carried on an investigation of the
                    ancestry of Sibyl Thompson, Chapman Denslow's mother. Her name, by the way, is spelled <hi rend="i">Sibbel</hi> (and almost every other way except the correct way) in the records of her
                    day. She was the daughter of Elizur (or Eleazar) Thompson and Esther <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Elizur was the son of Daniel Thompson and Sarah Bronson. Daniel lived in Redding, but
                    Sarah came from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Daniel was the son of Thomas Thompson Junior, and Elizabeth Smith, who was the
                    daughter of Arthur Smith, 'a founder of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Thomas Thompson, Jr., was married twice, and there was much worry for a time on the
                    part of my brother and me, lest a family skeleton had been dragged from the closet in our family
                    line. It seems that the second wife of Thomas, Junior, was a lady of fiery temper and that, in the
                    course of a violent disagreement with her husband, she threw a pair of scissors at him with unerring
                    aim. A point penetrated one eye to the brain and killed Thomas. She was imprisoned for about two
                    years while the authorities of the colony were deciding whether to impose the death penalty on a
                    woman criminal. Early in her imprisonment she gave birth to a daughter whom she hopefully called <hi rend="i">Mercy</hi>. The authorities, however, decided that a murderess was a murderer and
                    executed Mrs. Thompson by hanging. The brother of the writer finally obtained definite proof that
                    Chapman Denslow was descended from the, first wife and could not possibly feel any disgrace be-cause
                    of the tragedies just described.</p>
            <p>Thomas Thompson, Jr., was the son of Thomas Thompson, Sr., who married Anne Welles, eldest daughter
                    of Thomas Welles, twice governor of the colony of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, deputy governor at different times, first treasurer of the colony and an officer of
                    some sort from its very beginning. He came of an ancient English family which is said to have come
                    north to Normandy from southern <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> two or three <pb n="367" id="VAA4025-036-4-043"/> centuries before the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Norman</settlement>
                    </placeName> Conquest. Two bishops of this family have their names on <hi rend="i">Magna Carta</hi>
                    and one of them, Hugo, is credited with having written it. For many years, genealogists gave the
                    name of the wife of Thomas Welles as Elizabeth Hunt, but this was based solely on a reference in the
                    will of an elderly maiden named Hunt to "Onckle" Wells. It is now believed that
                    this title of "Uncle" was the same title of respect which was given in pioneer
                    days, as well as in my own boyhood, to all the older members of the community, for it is now quite
                    well established that Elizabeth Hunt was the wife of the grandfather of Thomas Welles (Thomas
                    Welles, father of Robert) and that the wife of Thomas Welles himself was Alice Tome. Alice has a
                    very interesting line of descent, which is probably reliable for a number of generations back, but
                    which begins to be-come somewhat questionable with the name of a Norwegian freebooter (named
                    Bardolf), born in the year 1045. Ancestors of Chapman Denslow's grandmother, Esther <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, were: Benjamin <placeName>

                    Barlow (daughter of John and Ann); Francis Bradley and Ruth Barlow (also daughters of John and Ann).
                    Other ancestors of Champan Denslow were: Samuel Bronson and Sarah Gibbs; Jacob Gibbs (son of Giles)
                    and Elizabeth Andros; Richard Bronson and Abigail Wibourne; Edward Chapman and Elizabeth Clark Fox;
                    John Thomson and Beatrice Detton; George Detton and Anne Thomas (daughter of Walter ap Thomas);

            <p>The above names may not be interesting to the average reader, but, in years to come, they may reach
                    the eyes of someone who is making a search and who will welcome clues. Most of them are to be found

            <p>It is an interesting commentary on the interest of the present generation in the past to note that
                    Chapman Dens-low probably did riot know the name of any of his ancestors farther back than his
                    grandparents or some of his great-grandparents, at most. We owe quite a debt of gratitude to the New <placeName>

                    </placeName> towns that have preserved their records so faithfully and which have placed typewritten

                    </placeName>, as well as in the libraries of the original towns where we have had occasion to make
                    investigations. George MacKenzie Roberts, former treasurer-general of the Sons of the American
                    Revolution, to whom reference was made above, went to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> early in the summer of 1939 to piece out some missing portions of the Denslow
                    genealogy. He was surprised and yet gratified to find that these priceless records are not available

                    are stored away in underground vaults, are covered with sandbags and will be accessible only to the

            <p>The number and length of the publications of the Society, fortunately or unfortunately, are limited
                    by the relatively small amount of funds which may be used for that purpose—the income
                    from the William H. English fund of $2500 and the portion of the membership fees not
                    absolutely required for other purposes. This means that frequently a long interval elapses between
                    the acceptance of a manuscript and its preparation for the press. The preparation of manuscripts for
                    the press—checking the accuracy of statements, verifying, correcting references, insuring
                    uniformity and reading proofs—has for some years been done by the staff of the Historical
                    Bureau. The Bureau is authorized by law "to promote the study of Indiana history in

                    cemetries are fast disappearing and the recording of names from the tombstones is a great aid to
                    genealogists. So far this year, members of this Committee and their assistants have turned over to
                    the Genealogy Division records from nineteen cemetries in <placeName>

            <p>The Library Committee is in charge of the Indiana Historical Society Library (William Henry Smith
                    Memorial Library). The members of this Committee are Benjamin D. Hitz, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, chairman, Lee Burns, J. K. Lilly, Jr., Perry W. Lesh, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Frederick D. Rose, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Committee determines the policies of the Library and decides upon important
                    purchases. Among the Library's acquisitions this year are: letters of various members of
                    the Owen family to James M. Dorsey; autobiographical notes of Miner K. Kellog concerning a year of
                    his boyhood spent in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the Owen period; and letters of Judge Jeremiah Sullivan (a gift of George H.
                    Sullivan). A number of William Henry Harrison manuscripts have been added to the Library's
                    already large collection of his papers. Two hundred sixteen photographic prints of portraits of
                    Indiana men and women, most of them painted by early Indiana artists, have been obtained from Wilbur
                    D. Peat, who is making a study of these early portrait painters. The Library now totals
                    approximately 3,327 volumes, 1,278 pamphlets, and 7,300 manuscripts. It occupies a large front room
                    in the State Library and Historical Building and enjoys the closest cooperation of the State Library
                    and of the Historical Bureau. The general policy of the Committee in receiving and purchasing
                    acquisitions has been to specialize in the rarer and more valuable items, books, maps, and
                    manuscripts that relate to the Old Northwest.</p>

            <p>The political campaign of 1896 is properly regarded by students of American history as one of the
                    most significant in the political annals of our country since the Civil War. The financial and
                    economic policies of the national government constituted the important issues before the electorate
                    in. that year, but of equal, if not greater, weight was the choice of presidential candidates.
                    President <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, by his financial measures, had fallen into disfavor with and had been repudiated by a
                    large section of his party. Although some Democratic stalwarts urged his renomination for a third
                    term to save the party, he early signified his unwillingness to be drafted for further public
                    service. William Jennings Bryan of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>, who had recently served two terms in the national House and who had become one of the
                    outstanding spokesmen of the "free-silver" element, was rapidly making himself the
                    inevitable candidate of the western and southern Democrats and Populists.</p>
            <p>The Republican party, in 1896, was confronted with the more difficult task of making a choice between
                    several prominent and more or less receptive leaders. Former President Benjamin Harrison of Indiana,
                    defeated by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1892, was considered by many to be entitled to a re-nomination. His friends, against
                    his wishes, labored long but in-effectually to put him in the race. Thomas B. Reed, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName>, Speaker of the House of Representatives, was an active candidate, widely endorsed but
                    lacking an efficient organization. Governor Levi P. Morton, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, had adequate financial backing and an extensive organization, but he lacked popular
                    appeal. Several Republican Senators aspired to the nomination without being serious contenders.
                    Governor William McKinley of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, whose name was so intimately connected with the high protective tariff of 1890, had
                    behind him a vigorous organization led by the prominent <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> industrialist, Marcus Alonzo Hanna, who was determined to see his friend and protege
                    placed in the White House. The pre-convention campaign of the Hanna-McKinley forces was so energetic
                    that it alarmed other Republican <pb n="372" id="VAA4025-036-4-048"/> candidates who made futile
                    efforts to stop the progress of the favorite.</p>
            <p>Among those Hoosier politicians who early mounted the McKinley band-wagon was Colonel William R.
                    Holloway, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who for more than thirty years had been a wheel-horse of the Republican state
                    organization. A brother-in-law of the great Republican leader, Oliver P. Morton, Colonel Holloway
                    had enjoyed political favors in the form of appointive offices throughout most of that period, but
                    he was still hungering for further recognition in 1896. Holloway started his public career in 1852
                    as a newspaper reporter, first on his father's paper, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Palladium</hi>. Later he worked on a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> paper until 1858. After a short period at the bar, he answered the call of his
                    brother-in-law, Governor Oliver P. Morton, and became private-secretary to Indiana's War
                    Governor early in 1861. This position he held until 1863, when he resigned and went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> City on some kind of business not revealed to the public. In 1864, he returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and became the sole owner and editor of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>. The next year, he sold the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> and took up again
                    his service with Governor Morton as confidential secretary and adviser. News-paper work having too
                    much attraction for him to resist, he then re-purchased a part interest in the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> and continued to help formulate its editorial policies until 1872.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, in 1869, through the influence of Senator Morton, Holloway was appointed postmaster of
                    Indianapolis by President Grant and this position he continued to hold until 1881, being
                    re-appointed by President Hayes in 1877. As a venture into the field of literature, he produced in
                    1870 a valuable guide-book-directory, <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>

                        </placeName>—a Historical and Statistical Sketch of the Railroad City</hi>."
                    After relinquishing his share in the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> again in 1872, he once more, in 1875,
                    resumed part ownership for a brief interval, the paper passing finally into the possession of John

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1880. Holloway's experiment, in that year, with a new morning newspaper,
                        <hi rend="i">The Times</hi>, ended in failure after a short run. During the years from 1881
                    until 1892, Colonel Holloway seems to have been on the wrong side of <list type="footnotes">

                    enjoying public office mattered. Democratic successes and his failure to line up with the Harrison
                    backers account chiefly for his being left out in the cold. In the period from 1892 until 1896, he
                    is found occupying the modest position of member of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> park department staff and it is from that vantage point that he surveyed the political
                    prospects on the eve of the 1896 campaign.</p>
            <p>The letters from Marcus A. Hanna, William McKinley and others to Colonel Holloway from 1895 until
                    1897, which are here presented, are believed to merit publication, not only because of the
                    historical importance of their authors, but also for the reason that they reveal the methods whereby
                    the managers of an important candidate for high public office went about promoting their aims. The
                    letters also make clear the route by which appointive offices in our government were filled. Some
                    presidential Warwicks have been so modest or careful or careless as to leave no written records
                    concerning how certain American presidents have been nominated. The general public and students of
                    history owe some gratitude to Colonel Holloway for preserving this correspondence, for whatever
                    reason he may have preserved the letters.</p>
            <p>The originals of letters here published are a part of the Morton-Holloway collection which was turned
                    over to the Library of <placeName>

            <p>Among the devoted friends and admirers of William McKinley was the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> ironmaster, Marcus A. Hanna, who took upon himself the agreeable task of promoting the

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> congressman defeated in 1892 because of the popular dislike of the McKinley Tariff Act
                    of 1890. Hanna was a firm believer in the virtues of high protection, especially for his own
                    business, and was apparently, the first important person to recognize the twinkling of
                    McKinley's star of destiny. After having made the latter governor of his state, Hanna
                    assumed the role of Warwick in order to advance his idol to the presidency. The next letter reveals
                    his understanding of the problems that lay ahead and shows how he proposed to proceed toward the
                    winning of the nomination for McKinley.</p>

                                    objection could there be about adopting resolutions of

                        <p>I think also that General Lew Wallace would be an excellent man for delegate at
                                    large. As you say, his name would be worth more than most any other that could be

                        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
                        <p>I am delighted at the tone of your letter. It corresponds with my estimate of the
                                    situation in Indiana. The foolish story<hi rend="sup">16</hi> being circulated for
                                    the purpose of injuring McKinley will be duly appreciated by you, and men of your
                                    intelligence. I was present when all this took place, and I know that no man was so
                                    faithful to duty than was McKinley in that behalf… . I shall be glad if
                                    Indiana speaks promptly and clearly. It will be a splendid condition of things if we
                                    can stand together at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> side by side. Keep me advised and I will do the same by you. Everything
                                    looks favorable. I do not believe that it is within the power of man to beat our
                                    candidate. The favorite son business is reacting everywhere, and the conspiracy is
                                    being understood.</p>

                                    course, I have no personal knowledge of the circumstances. Major McKinley is an
                                    exceedingly frank man. He disguises nothing, and will tell you the exact truth about
                                    the circumstances. Why don't you write him personally on the subject? He
                                    knows you very well, and I am sure will answer your letter.</p>

                    New, who with his son Harry S., was owner and editor of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, had been given much individual credit for the nomination of General
                    Benjamin Harrison at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    </placeName>, 1889-1893. Although Harrison had frequently expressed the desire to remain in
                    retirement from public life, New apparently hoped to have the nomination once more offered his
                    friend in the belief that it would not be refused. To further such action, he and his newspaper were
                    active in promoting a "stop McKinley" movement in Indiana.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Sir:-</salute>
                        <p>I see by the papers that this crowd of desperate politicians is now engaged in
                                    organizing forces behind Mr. John C. New<hi rend="sup">25</hi> in Indiana to head
                                    off the election of McKinley delegates at your coming convention. This is part of
                                    the scheme represented by the Senatorial combine here in the interest of anybody to
                                    defeat McKinley. Now, it is not proper for me to suggest to the Republicans of
                                    Indiana what would be wise for them to do under any circumstances for you understand
                                    your own business better than I do, but the most important consideration as I look
                                    at it is to make Indiana practically solid for McKinley as it can be on the first
                                    ballot. I suppose there is not very much doubt that McKinley will have a vote
                                    largely in the lead of any other candidate on the first ballot and that seems to be
                                    the fear that our friends, the enemy, have. The cry in Indiana as it is going out
                                    here now by the Senatorial junta is that there should be no instructions with the
                                    hope of getting the Indiana Delegation into such shape that these gentlemen can
                                    traffic on it.</p>

                                    this state and of the country is no longer a matter of sentiment or hysterical
                                    enthusiasm. It is down deep in the hearts of the people and is genuine and earnest.
                                    It is gratifying to note the situation in your state. A solid Indiana delegation for
                                    M'Kinley means more than 30 votes in the convention. It has influence <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>I find running through the newspapers and through correspondence, a suggestion that
                                    after all there may be a movement for Harrison at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. The intimation is thrown out that Mr. Harry New<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                                    and others on the delegation are in sympathy with the suggested movement. It would
                                    not surprise me, if from now on there are quiet but persistent efforts of the
                                    anti-McKinley element both inside your State and outside, to undermine
                                    McKinley's standing with the Indiana delegation. The danger in Indiana is
                                    that the McKinley men, thinking that the battle is won, will now retire and that the
                                    other fellows will be as busy as beavers.</p>

                        <p>Yours of the 4th inst. with enclosures received. My opinion is that the people who
                                    are trying to work the "Harrison scheme" in Indiana are doing so
                                    under false pretences—that is, they have no idea at all that Harrison
                                    stands a ghost of a chance of nomination, but they use Harrison's name and
                                    prestige purely for the purpose of rallying the anti—McKinley sentiment
                                    in Indiana and to scare off the McKinley people from instructing at the State
                                    Convention. It would be a great misfortune if your State Convention failed to
                                    endorse McKinley. It would be heralded over the country at large as proof that there
                                    was an "undertow" to the McKinley sentiment and that it was
                                    rapidly subsiding.</p>

                        <p>Dear Sir:- Your favor of April 9th is just at hand. I am very glad indeed to hear of
                                    your taking steps to counteract the injurious stories in circulation about
                                    ex-President Harrison. I am satisfied that he will be faithful to his own
                                    declarations, but of course I am in no position to ask him to do anything in the
                                    matter. Let me know what you develope. Glad to hear your lines are firm everywhere
                                    and do not believe myself that there will be any weakening at any point. The
                                    cheapest and best McKinley buttons are made by the Commercial Novelty Advertising

                                    enclosed. They have been read carefully and with much interest. I thank you very
                                    much for the interest you take in the candidacy of Gov. McKinley, in writing letters
                                    to the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName> Gazette, Tribune, Inter—Ocean and other papers. It will do
                                    great good.</p>
                        <p>The Indiana State Convention should by all means instruct its delegates at large to
                                    support and vote for Gov. McKinley, or a great deal of the good influence of the
                                    District Conventions instructing their delegates will be lost, which would otherwise
                                    be greatly strengthened if the State Convention instructs for McKinley. This is very
                                    important.</p>
                        <p>Let me hear from you again whenever you have information of importance which you
                                    think I should know. Keep me posted on the situation in your State, as you view it.

            <p>Republicans who were opposed to McKinley's nomination continued to harp on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> candidate's alleged friendliness to Catholics and foreign—born
                    persons against whom the American Protective Association was agitating and sought to magnify such an
                    attitude into a disqualification for the high position of President. Indiana newspapers hostile to
                    McKinley, as was the leading Republican organ, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, appeared to get great satisfaction out of repeating reports of A. P. A.
                    hostility towards the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> candidate. The most frequent criticism was the old charge that he was straddling the
                    religious issue. There was a real basis for this, since McKinley, like most political leaders, had
                    no desire to alienate needlessly any important element of the electorate, and therefore refrained
                    from any public statement on the subject under consideration. To silence such criticism, the
                    McKinley managers emphasized the strong Protestant affiliations of their candidate and his closest
                    associates. After a long discussion of the charges, <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-036-4-061"/> Secretary

                        <p>It is proper that you should know, under the circumstances, that Major McKinley is a
                                    life-long member of the Methodist Episcopal Church; that Mr. Hanna and myself are
                                    life-long members of the Protestant Episcopal Church… . I would not be
                                    surprised if the opposition which you find developing to Major McKinley in Indiana
                                    owes its origin to some extent to the circulation of the lies above referred to.</p>

                        <p>Dear Sir:- In your favor to me of April 11th you spoke some-thing about the idea of
                                    making a contract with the "News" for 2 columns space each day,
                                    and devote it to Major McKinley, and especially the idea of Indiana instructing in
                                    his behalf.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> I wish you would pursue this a little farther and
                                    see what such an arrangement would cost. Talk to Capt. Gowdy about it and let me
                                    know what is his decision in the matter. We must not fail to secure the adoption of
                                    McKinley resolutions. I consider it of great importance. Upon the slight prop of
                                    opposition to McKinley in Indiana rests all that is left of the Combine against him.
                                    It ought to be ditched forever, and we must spare no efforts in that direction.</p>

                        <salute>My dear Sir:</salute>
                        <p>I herewith return the clippings you enclosed in a letter I received this morning.</p>
                        <p>We are keeping a close and somewhat anxious eye upon Indiana. Speaking from this
                                    distance I would say that there is a subsidence of the Harrison talk over the
                                    country. There is a concencus [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] of opinion that Harrison meant
                                    exactly what he said. Any way, the Harrison talk is altogether futile, if not
                                    malicious. No matter what Indiana does, McKinley will be nominated and that on the
                                    first ballot. I have never wavered from that opinion. Six weeks ago I made an
                                    estimate which showed McKinley's nomination on the first ballot. The
                                    situation has steadily improved since then. There are now more than enough votes in
                                    sight to nominate McKinley on the first ballot even if we do not get a single vote
                                    from Indiana. But the expressions we get from your State, quite apart from what you
                                    and Mr. Gowdy write, are to the effect that, first, your State Convention will
                                    instruct for McKinley and secondly even if it does not, that McKinley will get
                                    probably the solid vote from Indiana on the first ballot.</p>

                    ineffectual efforts to block this action, but they did not have even the backing of General
                    Harrison, since he declined to address the convention on account of his unwillingness to stir up
                    factional strife. Thus, Messrs. Gowdy and Holloway carried their plans through to victory and
                    fulfilled their promises to Hanna and McKinley. The latter were duly appreciative of the service.</p>
            <p>The Harrison faction, led by Colonel New and other former Hoosier office-holders under the Harrison
                    administration, still did not give up all hope. They next turned on State Chairman John W. Gowdy and
                    tried to oust him. Throughout the month of May, the <placeName>

                                    President Harrison<hi rend="sup">38</hi> has made its appearance and I am very glad
                                    that he had the gracefulness to do what he did do.</p>
                        <p>Of course, we have expected that Brother New would feel disgruntled. The prospects
                                    for cakes and ale are not so good as they would have been under other conditions.</p>

                        <p>Your favor of the 20th ult., came duly to hand, and like all the others, has waited
                                    an opportune time for me to reply. I have been simply snowed under since my return

                        <p>I hope the matters will be straightened out in your State, so there will be no
                                    factional differences. Every good Republican now is interested in the result, and I
                                    am sure if proper concessions from both sides, all friction may be avoided.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
                        <p>Your favor of August 4th is received. I am sorry to hear that poor old Joe<hi rend="sup">46</hi> has jumped the fence again. He was always unreliable and we
                                    could never trust him. I am, however, of the opinion that the nomination of a second
                                    Democratic ticket would be of the greatest benefit to us. I have just returned from
                                    a trip to Europe and met a good many old time Democrats, travelling, etc. I did not
                                    find but one man, and that was Senator Daniel of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                                    </placeName>, who was going to vote for Bryan. They all said that a new ticket would
                                    give them a chance to go on the stump and fight Bryan, and one of them said to me
                                    that if there was a second ticket he would go on the stump and fight Bryan on the
                                    straight ticket and "when voting time comes, I will vote to kill".
                                    I would be glad to hear from you and what you think of the situation in Indiana. The
                                    two papers in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName> are at such divergence that I am unable to learn what the real facts
                                    are.</p>

            <p>The election of November 3, 1896, in Indiana resulted in a decisive victory for the Republican
                    candidates, both national and local. Hanna's "educational" campaign by
                    way of Indiana school-houses helped to swell the plurality for McKinley's election in this
                    state to 18,850, the largest any presidential candidate of either party had received since the
                    victory of Grant in 1872.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that the heat of battle was past, the victorious veterans turned their attention to the
                    distribution of the "cakes and ale." Colonel Holloway had mounted the McKinley
                    bandwagon among the earliest and had done yeoman service for the cause. It was but natural that he
                    should hunger for the spoils of political war. Apparently, he had set his heart on a lucrative post
                    in the consular service, that traditional "asylum for broken-down lawyers and political
                    hacks." To achieve this goal, it was necessary that he should marshal an impressive array
                    of sponsors. Hence, these last letters.</p>

                    one of the most lucrative in the entire consular service. Our friend, Colonel Holloway, drew as his

                    1904, when, for the sake of his health, he asked and received a transfer to the consulate at

                    health, so, in 1907, Colonel Holloway retired and returned to make his home in <placeName>

            <p>It may be of public interest to note that the consular service has not provided political plums for
                    deserving party henchmen since 1907, for, in that year, President Theodore Roosevelt placed consular
                    offices under civil service regulations. Hungry would-be officeholders have had to look to other
                    fields for political rewards in recent years.</p>

                    construction of canals stimulated both passenger and freight movement until Chicago was the cynosure

                    and the rapid increase of wealth. It was these forces which gave rise to municipal corruption and

                    moulded the refinements and ways of an urban world in a transitional period. Crude theatricals, such

                    "passion and prejudice" the city, overwhelmed with militaristic fervor,
                    volunteered liberally, but did not forget to quarrel over Lincoln's policies and the state
                    of the Union. And the city continued to grow —in population, in trade, and in wealth. By
                    1871, "America possessed no more interesting city than <placeName>

                    and one also saw the beginnings of a metropolitan American community. Nothing seemed inconsistent to

                    explanations have been offered. It is but fair to mention, however, that Mrs.

                    </placeName> politics in the most active period of Aaron Burr, when the evolving Republican Party
                    was weakened by the clashes between the Clintons and the Livingstons. Elected to the national House
                    in 1795, he remained a member until 1802. He first won prominence on the national stage, when he
                    stood with Albert Gallatin in the famous House fight against Jay's Treaty. Later, the two
                    leaders fought together against the Alien and Sedition Acts. In 1801, he was regarded as one of the
                    pivotal men during the desperate at-tempt of Federalists to elect Burr to the presidency. How-ever,
                    he voted for Jefferson on every ballot. In 1802, he was appointed by Jefferson to the office of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Attorney for the District of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. One of the duties of this office was the collection of federal taxes. It was one of
                    the misfortunes of Livingston's life that he entrusted this duty to a subordinate whom he
                    did not properly supervise. There was a serious defalcation, and Livingston lost his office. In
                    1804, he went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>. In time, he rose to eminence as a lawyer there. In 1823, he became again a member of
                    the national House after an absence of nearly a quarter of a century. In 1829, he was elected to the
                    Senate. In 1831, he became Secretary of State in Jackson's Cabinet, and, in 1833, was
                    appointed minister to <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Such a record of facts in relation to any able leader would make him a worthy subject for a
                    biography. It has been the aim of Dr. Hatcher to deal impartially with Edward Livingston in each
                    period of his career. He has shown with what energy Livingston played his part in the national House
                    from 1795 to 1802. In his later and greater period on the national stage, the author has told simply
                    and well the story of the achievements of Livington. Secretary of State in Jackson's
                    Cabinet during the nullification crisis of 1832-1833, Livingston rendered great service to the
                    President and made a name for himself as one of the great interpreters of the Constitution. It was
                    not only with these periods of political success as a national leader that Dr. Hatcher had to deal,
                    but with the uncertain years from 1802 to 1823. This obscure period in the life of Livingston was
                    very important, and it required more research and more skill to tell the story of those years than
                    was necessary to present the better known portions of his career.</p>
            <pb n="400" id="VAA4025-036-4-076"/>
            <p>Dr. Hatcher has handled the misfortune that befell Livingston in the matter of the defalcation in <placeName>

                    </placeName> with great fairness. He has done even better with the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> years during which the transplanted New Yorker built himself up to a second and greater
                    period of success. This is partly because a greater mass of materials was at hand as a basis for the
                    study. Anyone who reads the six chapters relating to the years of upward climbing in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> against great difficulties will learn much that is new. The new and prolonged
                    controversy between Livingston and Jefferson is the most difficult phase of Livingston's
                    life to handle. Whether Dr. Hatcher has arrived at correct conclusions in regard to all of the
                    various points involved in this clash, the reviewer is unable to say. At any rate, the author has
                    made an honest attempt to unravel the tangle. Livingston's course in relation to the
                    Batture land was cerainly open to question, but Jefferson possibly pushed him too relentlessly in
                    the matter.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, it must be said that Dr. Hatcher has written a high-class biography which is supplied
                    with a good index, and a large and helpful bibliography. The story is well organized and
                    Livingston's life is well interpreted. The Southern Biography Series has been well started
                    with this volume and that dealing with <hi rend="i">Felix Grundy</hi> which preceded it. Other

            <p>In this welcome volume, Dr. Leopold has made a very real contribution. After making a long and
                    critical study, he concludes that Robert Dale Owen was "one of the most versatile figures
                    in an age of versatility." a man "who performed ably in many fields but achieved
                    greatness in none." Since Owen has fallen into "unwarranted obscurity,"
                    it has seemed to the author to be a worth while task to recover the man by writing a
                    "critical full length biography" based on the wide variety of materials available.
                    In the course of his researches, the author discovered that Owen led three lives in three different
                    periods, in each period responding to a different environment, and that, between these three periods
                    of <pb n="401" id="VAA4025-036-4-077"/> Owen's life, there was "only a tenuous
                    connection." In addition to these fundamental keys to his subject's career, the
                    author discovered that Owen, more than once, "came near to achieving lasting
                    renown." It seems necessary to quote one longer passage from Dr. Leopold's
                    "Preface": <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>A brilliant career in radical journalism was prevented only by his [Owen's] return
                            in 1833 to the Indiana backwoods. If the influence of <hi rend="i">Moral Physiology</hi>
                            could be accurately determined, he might be known as a leading pioneer writer on
                            sociological problems. His name might have been enshrined in the annals of the Smithsonian
                            Institution if he had not, apparently, disagreed with its first Secretary. His reputation as
                            an educator might have been made secure if in 1852, after helping devise the Hoosier public
                            school system, he had consented to run for the office of State Superintendent and thus
                            perfect the organization. Had he not lived his most fruitful years in southern Indiana, he
                            might today be remembered among feminists with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth C. Stanton and
                            among abolitionists with William Lloyd Garrison and Theodore Dwight Weld. But these are all
                            might-have-beens. The fact remains that Owen is largely forgotten, and the fault is partly
                            his.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Having worked out these essential notions in regard to Owen from the study of abundant sources that
                    he knew how to use, it remained only for the author to write the biography. The book is divided into
                    three parts, of which the headings are: "The Reformer," "The Western
                    Democrat," and "The Intellectual." To the first period, one hundred
                    twenty pages are devoted; to the second, one hundred eighty-one; to the third, one hundred ten. Only
                    three chapters of the seven that make up Part One of the biography are concerned with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> experiment launched by Robert Owen, the primary purpose of the volume being to portray
                    the long public career of Robert Dale Owen. "The Western Democrat" has received
                    more space than "The Re-former" or "The Intellectual," which
                    seems correct. The results of Owen's efforts in his middle period are important and
                    tangible. Did he not come closer to winning "lasting renown" as a political leader
                    than earlier or later? Strange to say, however, the author failed to mention Owen's
                    achievements in the field of politics or to explain why he did not actually attain greatness in that
                    realm in the keen paragraph of his "Preface," quoted above.</p>
            <p>It was not easy to prepare a biography of the versatile, almost-forgotten Robert Dale Owen, but Dr.
                    Leopold has <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-036-4-078"/> made the man live again. He has recreated Owen as
                    he was in his three periods. Often he was misunderstood and condemned because he was ahead of his
                    age. As he labored in different fields, he was handicapped in some of them by the prejudices that
                    his views evolved in others had produced against him. These phenomena of his life are brought out
                    and his changing views and variety of labors are portrayed. Much spade-work was done and well done
                    preliminary to the writing of this biography. In addition, the narrative is fine. The book makes
                    fascinating reading. It will appeal to the general reading public. At the same time, since it is
                    scholarly, well documented and accompained by an extensive bibliography, it will find high favor
                    with special students of history as well.</p>

            <p>This Study is No. 3 of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Historical Society</hi> Publications, XIII,
                    comprising pages 227-383 of that volume. The seven chapters deal with Camp Morton mainly as one in
                    which Confederate prisoners were cared for. In 1861, the Camp was used largely as a place for
                    training Union soldiers, and, to this use, a chapter is given. No one can read the story of Camp
                    Morton without being impressed with the many serious and multiplying problems that presented
                    them-selves to the various persons in charge of the Camp during the War. Housing, bedding, fuel,
                    food, illness all furnished plenty of headaches to the officers. At the best, it would have been
                    difficult to manage the Camp efficiently, but most of the time even the best of the executives
                    assigned to duty worked under discouraging handicaps. The brightest days of the War for the
                    prisoners at Camp Morton were during the regime of Col. Richard Owen in 1862. In the remaining years
                    of the War, however, matters usually went from bad to worse. Much more could be told about this very
                    interesting though very distressing bit of war-time history, but the story must be read to get the
                    setting and the facts. If for no other reason, every northerner steeped in the traditions of the

            <head>Editor's Pages INDIANA TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO</head>
            <byline>WILLIAM O. LYNCH</byline>
            <p>The year of our Lord nineteen hundred fifteen does not seem so far back in the past as annual cycles
                    are counted, but, measured in events, the period has been a long one. The World War started in 1914.
                    Coming events are said to cast their shadows before, but, to most Americans, the great conflict that
                    was on a quarter century ago came with alarming and unexpected suddenness. During the decade
                    preceding the opening of that first titanic world struggle of the twentieth century, our country had
                    been passing through a period of unrest. A large part of the American people had become convinced
                    that the economic system had reached a stage where it was marked by many and great injustices. There
                    was also a decided ferment in regard to political inefficiency and corruption. Especially, was the
                    belief widespread that there was a sort of unholy alliance between big business and politics.</p>
            <p>William Jennings Bryan was still a crusading reformer, and Senator Robert <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> La Follette of Wisconsin was at the climax of his career. Theodore Roosevelt, on the
                    basis of his reputation as a zealous progressive, overwhelmed his opponent, a conservative Democrat,
                    in the election of 1904, named his successor in 1908, and led away half of the Re-publican Party in
                    1912. Woodrow Wilson, erstwhile college professor and President of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, attracted nation-wide attention as Governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>, and, be-coming President in 1913, he effectively led his party in Congress in a
                    program of constructive legislation. A score of other leaders of strongly progressive tendencies
                    could be named.</p>
            <p>In this period marked by reforming zeal, Indiana shared in the general unrest, but Hoosier
                    progressiveism was not particularly militant or outstanding. Most of the Republican leaders of the
                    time, who attained prominence within or with-out the state, were conservative—J. Frank
                    Hanley, James A. Hemenway, Charles W. Fairbanks, Winfield T. Durbin, James E. Watson, James P.
                    Goodrich. The Democratic leaders of the time were progressive only by comparison—John W.
                        <pb n="406" id="VAA4025-036-4-082"/> Kern, Thomas R. Marshall, Benjamin F. Shivley, Samuel M.
                    Ralston. It is true that some of the listed Republican leaders sometimes agreed with Theodore
                    Roosevelt when he was President, and, that the Democrats mentioned, while slow to lead, on their own
                    initiative, anyone very far from the straight and narrow path of orthodox economic and political
                    doctrines, were pretty certain to follow where President Wilson led. In marked contrast to the party
                    and industrial leaders who were so clearly characterized by conservative tendencies was Albert J.
                    Beveridge. First elected to the Senate by the Indiana Legislature in 1899, he was reelected in 1905.
                    In 1909, he threw in his lot with the small group of Re-publican Senators who repudiated the
                    Payne-Aldrich Tariff measure. As a result of the election in 1910, the Senator was defeated in the
                    Legislature by John W. Kern. In 1912, Mr. Beveridge championed the cause of Theodore Roosevelt,
                    running for Governor of Indiana on the ticket of the Progressive Party. Two years later, he was
                    named as a candidate for Senator by the same party. The Progressive Party in Indiana was strong
                    enough to leave the state in the hands of the Democrats for a period, but not strong enough to place
                    Mr. Beveridge in any office. It should also be noted, that, after the disappearance of the
                    Progressive Party, the citizens of Indiana did not return this outstanding progressive leader to the
                    Senate of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> nor otherwise elevate him to a position of leadership. Fortunately, he devoted his time
                    to historical writing, and Claude G. Bowers later gave him recognition by making him a central
                    figure in his <hi rend="i">Progressive Era.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In population, Indiana's growth was slower as the state matured. Fifty years ago, the number
                    of inhabitants was 2,192,404. Twenty-five years later, the figure stood some-where between 2,700,876
                    and 2,930,390, the totals for 1910 and 1920, respectively. Many counties showed very little
                    increase, while several showed slight decreases. The economic and social problems of Indiana had not
                    been greatly aggravated by urban expansion or by any large influx of foreigners before 1815, nor
                    have they been since. In fact, the number of foreign born persons in the state was only 150,868 in
                    1920. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName> reported 46,046, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> 18,185, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> County 17,174 in that year. No other counties ran as high as 8,000, though there were
                    three counties <pb n="407" id="VAA4025-036-4-083"/> in each of which the foreign born element
                    numbered between 5,000 and 8,000. When enumerating the reasons for poor government or graft in the
                    cities of the state, people often placed much of the blame on foreigners with no very good basis for
                    their contentions. With no strong tendency towards urbanization, Indiana remained essentially
                    conservative.</p>
            <p>The fact that most Hoosier cities grew slowly, caused a considerable proportion of the young people
                    of the state to migrate to newer states, or to older states with rapidly growing cities. This meant
                    a loss to the commonwealth, since many of those leaving Indiana were persons of aggressive spirit
                    and ability. Besides, most of them left in early maturity, after having received their training and
                    before ther was a chance to return much to the commonwealth that had fostered them throughout
                    childhood and youth. The flow away from Indiana still continues, as it does from other states that
                    have not become more and more highly industrialized. That ideal condition which people sometimes
                    dream about, where society shall become stabilized with a nice balance between agriculture, business
                    and industry is difficult of attainment. Unless the average number of children born and reared to
                    maturity is about two per family, there is little chance for any community or area to maintain
                    itself primarily under an agricultural economy without constantly losing a part of the younger
                    element year by year. This is what has happened for two or more generations in every county in
                    Indiana whose population has remained practically stationary decade after decade.</p>
            <p>Between 1890 and 1915, one may say that Indiana came of age. The pioneer period lingered on till
                    about 1890 in much of the state, but pioneer life and manners had disappeared before 1915. Already,
                    everything was becoming stream-lined. The automobile and moving pictures had come into their own and
                    the age of the radio and the airplane was just ahead. The wants of most families had already
                    multiplied and restless activity was taking the place of the slower, calmer way of life pursued by
                    earlier generations of Hoosiers.</p>
            <p>The panic of 1893 and the several years of depression that followed produced a period of Iow prices
                    long to be remembered. Those who are always sure that they would buy readily and extensively were
                    prices very low are greatly in error. It does not work out that way. On the other hand, <pb n="408" id="VAA4025-036-4-084"/> rising prices, instead of discouraging buying, greatly augment it. The
                    upswing of prices between 1900 and 1915 was accompanied by a vastly increased business over that
                    which prevailed in the dull and sluggish 'nineties. It is true, of course, that those who
                    lamented the high cost of living of those pre-war years were to learn that they had passed through
                    tame experiences compared to what the hectic years of the World War and after were to bring.</p>
            <p>With some alleviation of the wrongs and injustices that had come with the expansion of business and
                    industry, the American people could feel, in 1915, that the world had entered a new age. I suppose
                    that Hoosiers were about as hopeful and happy in that year as they had ever been. With more and more
                    modernized homes, an ever-expanding and more expensive educational system, easier access to
                    literature and books, better roads and transportation, why should not blessings continue to shower
                    upon them? Were the currents running true in 1915? Was there a real justification for the happiness
                    and hopes of that year, now one-fourth of a century behind us? Was it the World War which began in
                    1914 and ended in 1918 that deflected the currents, brought the delusions of the gilded age that
                    followed, the business disaster that came in its wake, and the new world conflict of today? If so,
                    when shall the true path of progress be discovered again? One thing is certain-mankind cannot
                    discover or re-discover that path too soon.</p>

                    </placeName>, the Indiana Historical Society has received a chart, "Index of Descendants of
                    Hugh McMillen and Lydia South-wick." This includes all data available as of May 15, 1940.
                    It is reproduced by offset process, carries reduced photo-graphs of nearly all persons in the direct
                    line of descent, and is conveniently folded. It is a model which all genealogists will find both
                    interesting and suggestive.—<hi rend="i">Christopher B. Coleman.</hi>
