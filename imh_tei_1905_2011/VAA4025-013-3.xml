            <p>A<hi rend="sc">LTHO</hi> 1852 was a year for the election of a President not much
                    interest was taken in the campaign in Indiana. The Democrats held their State
                    convention at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, February 24. They endorsed the compromise of 1850 and placed a
                    ticket in the field, headed by Joseph A. Wright and A. P. Willard. The Free
                    Soilers were strong in northern Indiana, but not a man of their political belief
                    was placed upon the ticket. This indicated a split in the party.</p>
            <p>The next State convention was that of the Whigs, held February 26, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in which Nicholas McCarty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and William Williams of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Warsaw</settlement>
                    </placeName>, were placed at the head of their ticket. A platform was adopted
                    differing but little from that of the Democrats.</p>
            <p>Abolitionists, Wilmot Proviso Democrats, Van Burenites, and
                    Anti-Fugitive-Slave-Law Whigs made up the Free Soil convention which met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, May 17, 1852. A. L. Robinson, of Vanderburg, and J. P. Millikan,

                        <region type="county">Decatur</region>
                    </placeName>, were their candidates. At this time the Free Soilers had come to
                    the place where they were to accept the compromise measures except the clause
                    relating to the return of fugitive slaves.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    battle had cleared away it was seen that the Democrats had won a fruitless
                    victory. They had elected ten congressmen, while the Whigs had elected but one,
                    S. W. Parker, of the Fifth district. The State legislature was Democratic, there
                    being but thirty-four Whigs elected to the House and sixteen Whigs to the
                    Senate. The entire State ticket was Democratic.</p>
            <p>The election had some serious effects upon the political parties. While the
                    Democrats had won and had succeeded in quieting dissention in their own party
                    during the campaign, they were by no means harmonious after the election. The
                    small vote of the Free Soil party shows that it had run its course and need no
                    longer exist as an independent organization. The Whigs, who had supported their
                    ticket not so much from belief in the principles of the party as from opposition
                    to the Democrats, practically went out of existence. As the New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi> put it, the Whig party was annihilated and could never
                    be rallied as a political party.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Thus there were many
                    voters in Indiana whose views were such that there was no political party
                    existing of which they could be a member. If some fundamental issue should arise
                    upon which these men might agree a new party could be formed which might unite
                    the elements opposed to the Democratic party. Such an issue did arise and it is
                    the purpose of this paper to show how these men, differing widely in their
                    views, united themselves into a great political organization, the Republican
                    party of Indiana.</p>
            <p>While there was no great political principle upon which the opponents of the
                    Democratic party could unite there was a question which was causing men of all
                    parties some thought. Indiana had come to the point where she felt that the
                    temperance question would have to be fought out. It was seen that the temperance
                    law of 1853 was not drastic enough and a prohibitory liquor law was demanded.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The <placeName>

                    driven out of other States who would come to Indiana, and, most significant of
                    all from a political viewpoint, it was seen that all Catholics, Protestants,
                    Whigs, Democrats, natives, and foreigners could unite in a common cause.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While all were to unite in a temperance movement the advocates of a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> Law asserted that they proposed to get such a law through the
                    existing political parties, if possible. A resolution was passed by a temperance
                    convention at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, August 5 and 6, 1852, by which it was resolved that "we
                    will vote only for such legislators and executive officers, without regard to
                    political party, as will create and sustain such a law."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> At the State Temperance convention held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, September 28, 1853, it was resolved to attempt a <placeName>

                    independent of party considerations.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Thus it appears that
                    if the men back of the temperance movement had any idea of forming a new
                    political party they were careful to keep it from the public.</p>
            <p>The temperance movement was given a decided impetus by the decision of the
                    Indiana Supreme Court stating that that portion of the temperance Act of 1853
                    submitting the question of "license or no license" to the vote
                    of the people was unconstitutional.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> The decision made it
                    legal for anyone to sell liquor in any quantity. Indiana was practically without
                    any liquor law. At Mt. Sterling, November 26, 1853, the citizens of <placeName>

                    not wish to form a distinct temperance party, but they would not vote for any
                    man who would not pledge himself to a prohibitory law.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> a State temperance convention was held January II, 1854, with
                    probably 1,100 men in attendance. A State Central Temperance Committee was
                    organized and it was recommended that each county hold a meeting on February
                        22.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> An address to the people of Indiana was
                        prepared.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> How shall the crime and misery caused by
                    intemperance be most effectually banished from our state? License laws have
                    proved of no avail. There is but one remedy left, prohibition. Two main
                    objections will be urged against such a law; (1) existing prejudices and the
                    alleged pecuniary interests of those engaged in the traffic; (2) the present
                    organization of political parties. The address made it plain to the people that
                    it was not the intention to legislate against the private use of liquor in the
                    home but only against the manufacture and sale of liquor. In answer to the first
                    objection it was urged that the money invested in the liquor traffic could be
                    turned into more profitable channels. In answer to the second objection it was
                    stated that it was not the intention to injure the existing political parties,
                    but that it was the intention of the temperance men to support the party that
                    was willing to make prohibition an issue. In accordance with the address a
                    series of resolutions, stating that no liquor law would satisfy the temperance
                    sentiment of Indiana unless it represented the principles of "seizure,
                    confiscation, and destruction" of liquors kept for illegal sale, was
                    adopted. It was resolved that, attached as they were to their political parties,
                    they would not interfere with their present organization, but that they would
                    not support a candidate for the legislature who would not pledge himself to the
                    above principles.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Thus the convention put the temperance
                    issue squarely before the people. It is worthy of note that at this time the
                    convention proposed to secure what it desired through the existing political
                    parties and not by the formation of a new political organization.</p>

            <p>What was the attitude of the people of Indiana toward this movement? As early as
                    January, 1854, the <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi> published an article stating
                    that out of 110 newspapers in the State but ten were opposed to the movement.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> From this it may be seen that the press was in favor of
                    some move for the betterment of conditions. Of course, among the people there
                    was a division of sentiment in regard to the matter. Many felt that this
                    question was of such a nature that it should not be dragged into politics. They
                    argued that it was more of a moral reform than a political question.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> There were many voters wanting a more stringent
                    temperance law who had so long been party men that it would have been very
                    difficult for them to support an opposition candidate no matter how strong he
                    was for temperance.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> The Democratic politicians looked upon
                    the movement with distrust. They felt that it was an attempt to revive the Whig
                    party by giving it a live issue. The various temperance meetings held throughout
                    the State were looked upon by the Democratic politicians as an indication that

            <p>While the temperance movement was growing there was growing at the same time a
                    great political sentiment against the further extension of slavery. By a series
                    of political compromises the status of slavery in the territories had been
                    settled. The crowning act of this settlement had been the Compromise of 1850,
                    which was looked upon as a final disposition of the question of slavery in the
                    territories. Although this act only applied to the Mexican Cession and had not
                    specifically repealed the Compromise of 1820 it had affirmed a new principle
                    which, if sound, superseded the principle of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Compromise and was bound to reopen the whole question even though
                    this measure was looked upon as a "finality."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this act was so considered was seen in one of the planks of the national
                    Democratic platform of 1852, which reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The platform of the Democratic party in Indiana approved the compromise measures
                    by stating that they should under no pretense be disturbed.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> The Whigs in their State platform made no direct reference to the
                    slavery question, but the national Whig platform provided that the compromise
                    measures, including the Fugitive Slave Act, should be looked upon as a final
                    settlement of the slavery question."- The Free Soilers stood for,
                    "free soil, free speech, free labor, and free men." Thus it
                    will be seen that the great majority of Indiana people looked upon the question

                    Ellington disappeared. There being a large crowd present, the meeting was turned

                    this served to stir up a bitter hostility toward the Fugitive Slave law and any
                    further extension of slavery. At a meeting of the Free Soilers at Lo-gansport in
                    September, 1853, it was resolved that they would refuse to obey the inhuman
                    demands of the Fugitive Slave law and that J. L. Robinson, <placeName>

            <p>While Indiana was interested in the slavery question from the viewpoint of the

                    </placeName> Compromise was to be determined by the people of the two
                    territories. What Douglas had in mind when he introduced the bill is now a hotly
                    disputed question.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> By some it was said that as long as the
                    principle of popular sovereignity served the interests of the South it would be
                    obeyed but that as soon as it failed to do so another
                    "compromise" would be made whereby the interests of the South
                    would be maintained.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> By others it was said that it was a
                    bid for the presidency.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Still another view was that of
                    building up a sectional party which aimed at a dissolution of the Union.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the question of the power of Congress over slavery in the territories was
                    reopened. It had been the feeling of the northern Democrats that Congress had
                    full power over slavery in the territories and that it could either legalize or
                    forbid the institution.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Many Democrats held that Congress
                    should not exercise its power in this respect but should let the people of the
                    territories decide the question for themselves. The attitude of the Democrats of
                    Indiana was well expressed by the <hi rend="i">State Sentinel</hi> when it said:

                    new party to accomplish the desired result. This was felt to be the condition in
                    1854 in Indiana. Out of what elements did the new party arise? It came from the
                    elements of opposition to the Democratic party. We have seen the growth of the
                    temperance movement and also the antagonism of the Anti-<placeName>

                    </placeName> act was the most powerful factor in determining the new party we
                    shall consider at this point the attitude of all who were not administration
                    Democrats toward the stand of the Democratic party.</p>
            <p>Although their party was practically disbanded at this time the Whigs were much
                    aroused over this new move in the interests of slavery. They had much to say
                    about the sacredness of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>

                    protective tariff and internal improvements, were Federalistic in tendency, and
                    were not Abolitionists, having considered the slavery question settled by the
                    finality measures of 1850.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> Early in 1854 it was wondered
                    if the Whig leaders would attempt to revive their party through temperance and Anti-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>

                    the Democratic leaders since it might have prevented a new party from
                        forming.<hi rend="sup">69</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another element of opposition to the Democratic party was the Know Nothings, a
                    secret political organization which was very hostile to the influence of the
                    Papacy and to foreigners. They favored a twenty-one year naturalization law;
                    held that none but native Americans should hold office; demanded stricter
                    immigration laws and ample protection of all Protestant interests.<hi rend="sup">70</hi> At this time the organization was headed by Godlove S. Orth (Whig),
                    of <placeName>

                    religious liberty."</p>
            <p>A third opposition party was the Free Soil party. As a national organization it
                    had stood for legislative prohibition of slavery in the territories, immigration
                    from Europe, and free trade.<hi rend="sup">74</hi> It cannot be said that the

                    the principle of compromise which they opposed.</p>
            <p>There was one more source of opposition to the Democratic party. This was the
                    Abolitionist sentiment. Men holding this radical opinion were not numerous but
                    were very outspoken in their views. At this time they were considered fanatics
                    and disunionists.<hi rend="sup">75</hi> The fact that some of them favored the
                    Fusion movement caused many Democrats to hesitate about allying with a party
                    which might be stigmatized is Abolitionist.</p>
            <p>In summing up the political conditions in 1854 we may say that while there were
                    many sources of dissatisfaction and opposition to the platform and principles of
                    the Democratic party of Indiana there was no party in Indiana capable of uniting
                    all the others into one great strong opposition party. Seeing this, the leaders
                    of these elements were anxious to bring about a general coalition on the
                    questions of the extension of slavery and temperance. Of these leaders four are

            <p>There was no Know Nothing plank in the platform probably due to the fact that

                    been laughed at who thought that this was to be a permanent organization since
                    it was not thought possible to harmonize the differences of the individual

            <p>Members of the new party in speaking of the People's party explained its
                    origin by saying that men of all parties and of no party had laid aside
                    political bias and entered the campaign to preserve one of the great fundamental
                    principles of the founders of the government.<hi rend="sup">137</hi> From this
                    it appears that the members of the new party were anxious to have it understood
                    that they were acting from principle and that the Democratic party had left them
                    rather than that they had left the party.</p>
            <p>The two leading questions that confronted the voter were the extension of slavery
                    and the liquor question. The Democrats maintained that they were not a
                    pro-slavery party but that they believed in the principle of permitting each
                    citizen who lives in a territory to say whether or not slavery shall exist there
                    when statehood is reached. It was their contention that this view was thoroughly
                    democratic and that, by its adoption, the people would determine the conditions
                    under which they should live. In regard to the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. As to temperance it was asserted that they deplored the evils of
                    intemperance but were unalterably opposed to the principle of "search,
                    seizure, confiscation, and destruction" of the <placeName>

                    of the People's party. The stand of these men on temperance was for
                    prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors. They did not propose to prevent
                    the use of liquor in the home as long as it was not sold there.<hi rend="sup">139</hi> From this discussion it will be seen that the two parties were

                    </placeName> Democrats were looked upon as renegades and traitors and were often
                    read out of the party. This fate befell W. J. Peaslee of <placeName>

                    </placeName> county at the hands of the Democratic convention of the Sixth
                    congressional district. The resolutions which placed these men without the
                    Democratic party were designated by Editor Defrees as the "Bull of
                        Ex-communication".<hi rend="sup">140</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The interest in the campaign seemed to center in the congressional elections and
                    in the selection of State legislators. Since Senator Pettit's term
                    would expire in 1855 the next legislature would select his successor. Pettit was
                    anxious to succeed himself in spite of the fact that his utterances on the power
                    of Congress over slavery in the territories were in flat contradiction to each
                    other. In order to secure his election it was necessary to have a Democratic
                    majority in each House of the State legislature. Hence he stumped the State.</p>
            <p>In the First district Smith Miller was renominated by the Democrats. Against him
                    was nominated Samuel Hall by the People's convention. In the Second
                    district W. H. English was opposed by Thomas C. Slaughter, a Know Nothing. In
                    the Third district Colonel J. A. <placeName>

                    G. Dunn. Cyrus L. Dunham was again nominated by the Democratic convention. Since
                    all three of these districts were in the southern part of Indiana and were
                    strongly Democratic the party leaders felt safe in running men who had voted for

            <p>It was unfortunate for the Democrats that the attitude of the party toward the

                    resolution making "non-intervention by Congress" the true

                    Congress had the right to and ought to prevent the spread of slavery to the
                    territories. In justice to the Democrats it should be said that the resolutions
                    of 1849 did not express the position of the mass of the party but these
                    resolutions were the work of the party leaders who did so as a matter of

                    necessary on the issues before the people of the State. Significant among its

                    was selected as president.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> Lane expressed his views by
                    saying that the first great issue to be settled was that of the extension of
                    slavery, that the admission of <placeName>

                    </placeName> had to be settled, that President Pierce was ready to put down free

                    </placeName> who were fighting for free speech, free press, and free
                    institutions. Lane showed that opposition to the extension of slavery did not
                    mean Abolition. He eulogized the temperance law of 1854 and urged that no
                    foreigner be permitted to vote until naturalized. Of this speech the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> of May 2, 1856, remarked that Lane said the object of
                    the convention was to unite all the factions of the Fusionists into a party
                    whose leading principle was opposition to the further extension of slavery.</p>

            <p>There was some confusion when Mr. R. M. Hudson of <placeName>

                    appointed since this was not a Republican convention. Hudson, who was a Know
                    Nothing, felt that the Fusionists did not dare to act against the wishes of the
                    Know Nothings since they were strong in southwestern Indiana.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> David Kilgore, who was an older Know Nothing than Hudson, said that

            <p>Not only was the State interested in State politics but there was much interest
                    in national politics due to the fact that the questions before the people were
                    national rather than local. While many of the States had State organizations
                    which were opposed to the administration's policy there was no national
                    organization of these State parties. To effect such an organization a call was
                    issued in the name of the Republican State chairman of nine States, including
                    Indiana, for an informal convention at Pittsburg, February 22, 1856. This
                    convention was to draft plans for the organization of a permanent Republican

            <p>By the latter part of 1855 it was seen that the Know Nothings were losing their

            <p>The State convention of the American party met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on July 16, 1856. The big question to be decided was whether or not
                    the party should run an independent electoral ticket. R. W. Thompson was made
                    chairman of the meeting. Amid much confusion it was decided that it was
                    inexpedient to put out a State or congressional ticket, to support Fillmore and
                    Donaldson, and to pledge themselves to prevent the success of the Democratic
                    party since it had surrendered itself to the extension of slavery. A resolution
                    supporting the People's State ticket was voted down. Mr. Hudson and Mr.
                    French of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clark</settlement>

                    People's State ticket since they had taken part in the
                    People's State convention. Both these men said that unless the
                    convention supported the People's State ticket that they would desert
                    Fillmore for Fremont. The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> seemed to think that the
                    result of this meeting would be a loss of one-half of the strength of the

            <p>This division of opinion in the convention was foreshadowed by the attitude of

                    Fillmore before the nomination refused to support him. Three weeks after the
                    nomination of Fillmore there were but few straight out Fillmore papers in the

            <p>A comparison of this election with that of 1854 shows that the Democrats had
                    gained four congressmen from the Third, Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh Districts.
                    This gave the Democrats six congressmen to the Republican's five. It
                    will be noted that the Democratic congressmen were from the southern part of
                    Indiana, while the Republicans were elected from the northern part and the Fifth
                    District.</p>

                    mean a prohibitory law. George W. Julian gave two reasons for the defeat, the
                    refusal of the Know Nothings to unite with the People's party and the
                    inability of the Republicans to rally the Whigs.<hi rend="sup">121</hi> The

                    7,000 votes. In these counties there were not more than 500 Americans.<hi rend="sup">122</hi> Later the editor stated that the cause of the defeat was

            <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> the last twenty years we have again taken up the question
                    of universal education; we are just beginning again the agitation to nationalize
                    our industries; we are as undecided now as we were in 1860 concerning government
                    ownership of public utilities; we have made little real progress with the labor
                    question; the tariff is off and on again like Finnigan's train; a State
                    wide prohibition law was enacted in Indiana sixty years ago and we are now again
                    painfully working up to that point; we are a little nearer universal suffrage
                    than we were in 1860; the military system of the State is exactly where it was
                    in 1860, that is, there is none; a general reform in agriculture is now getting
                    under way, but one-half of the State is now farmed much as it was in 1860. In
                    all the essentials of fundamental progress we are very near where we laid down
                    our tools in 1860. There is far more wealth now but it is not so evenly
                    distributed; the laboring classes are in no better political or economic
                    situation than they were in 1860; the farmers are living faster than in 1860,
                    but hardly better; while the increase of absentee landlordism raises a more
                    serious agrarian problem than had arisen in 1860.</p>
            <p>We are at the end of the Civil War Regime. The period has been noted for its
                    great industrial development. Its characteristic men are the so-called captains
                    of industry. In the game of commercial aggrandizement they have shown the
                    greatest skill and have been rewarded with enormous fortunes. But now public
                    opinion has passed upon and condemned them in the means they used. Rebates,
                    watered stock, blue sky companies, legislative corruption, interlocking
                    directorates have become immoral and unsocial. The captains have been caught in
                    the toils of their own expert-ness and the whole system which they represent is
                    tottering <list type="footnotes">

                    been sent to the rear in disgrace.</p>
            <p>These are the industrial aristocrats. They superseded what for lack of a better
                    name I have called The Pioneer Aristocrats. Every period in history has soon or
                    late brought forth a group of leaders in its dominant activity, sometimes
                    political, sometimes clerical, sometimes industrial, sometimes social and
                    sometimes agricultural. They are the experts with the knowledge and tools of
                    that period. The pioneer aristocrats were the experts in developing farms under
                    the conditions then prevailing. They were just as truly in possession of a body
                    of organized knowledge and expert skill as any other aristocracy of which we
                    have a record. They were the leaders, and in a way represented the best in
                    pioneer society. It seems inevitable that an aristocracy must lose sympathy for
                    the masses.</p>
            <p>There are distinct problems and conditions the meeting and solving of which
                    constitute pioneering. The conditions are a new stock of people in a new
                    country. Social distinction and organizations formed in older communities,
                    social cleavage which gradually takes place in older societies, family kinship
                    and other ties which come to separate people into clans or groups, all of these
                    are lacking in any large degree in a pioneer state. There is a large
                    predominance of the young aggressive, radical element. Such in general are the
                    folks. The frontier, their home, is also a land of untried resources, of untried
                    possibilities. New crops must be raised, new seed times and new harvests are
                    found necessary. New diseases requiring new remedies are met. In the midst of
                    these new conditions certain problems must be solved. Houses must be built out
                    of whatever material is readiest at hand, logs, stone, sod or brick. Farms must
                    be opened up in the forest, on the prairie or on the arid plain; or perhaps
                    mines must be opened. Whatever the most available resource of the country is, it
                    must be utilized. A special body of skill and knowledge must be developed. This
                    may involve the handling of a new metal, the discovery of a new farm crop, or
                    the modification of an old one. Finally the staple products of the new country
                    must be introduced to <pb n="272" id="VAA4025-013-3-064"/> the world and means
                    of transportation and communication established. Of course, while this work is
                    going on social institutions will be organized. The church and state will
                    partake of the pioneering spirit. These in the abstract are the pioneer
                    problems. The men and women who tear themselves away from established society,
                    confront these conditions and attack these problems are called pioneers. The
                    word itself, referring back to "peons" who founded the early
                    Spanish settlements in America, has no trace of its original signification.</p>
            <p>The pioneers of the <geogName>Ohio valley</geogName> were Scotch, Irish, German,
                    English and French in origin. They themselves, in 1850, were little conscious of
                    these different origins. <placeName>

                    1832: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The honest, patient, and industrious German readily unites with our
                            people, establishes himself on some of our fat lands, fills a capacious

                            accommodating himself cheerfully to all the vicissitudes of life,
                            incorporates himself without difticulty in our society. But. of all
                            foreigners, none amalgamate themselves so quickly with our people as the
                            natives of the Emerald Isle. In some of the visions which have passed
                            through my imagination, I have supposed that <placeName>

                            </placeName> was originally part and parcel of this continent, and that
                            by some extraordinary convulsion of nature it was torn from America,
                            and. drifting across the ocean, it was placed iu the vicinity of Great
                            Britain. The same open-heartedness, the same careless and uncalculating
                            indifference about human life, characterizes the inhabitants of both
                            countries. <placeName>

                            were reversed, and set from America upon the shores of Europe, every
                            American emigrant to lreland would there find, as every Irish emigrant
                            here finds, a hearty welcome and a happy home.</p>

            <p>They had been pioneering during two or three generations before reaching the
                        <geogName>Ohio valley</geogName>. Each and all were refugees and certainly
                    no one of them harbored any love for his native country. Unjust laws,
                    governmental restrictions and persecutions were the reason for their emigration.
                    A natural result of this was that each bore little patriotic regard for any
                    government. They thus easily accepted the Jeffersonian statement that government
                    is a necessary evil. <pb n="273" id="VAA4025-013-3-065"/> They looked with
                    suspicion on a power from which nothing good had in their estimation ever
                    emanated. Not until they, themselves, had made their own state and local
                    governments in the valley did they begin to show any affection for government.</p>
            <p>Likewise in the church they were all dissenters, the French Huguenots, the German
                    Moravians and Dunkards, the Irish Catholics, the Scotch Convenanters, the
                    English Methodists and the German and English Quakers. In their first American
                    homes in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, in the Shenandoah Valley of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, in the uplands of Carolina and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="gau">Georgia</region>
                    </placeName>, they sustained only the loosest connection with the colonial
                    churches and governments. When they crossed the mountains during and after the
                    Revolution these feeble attachments were snapped asunder. It was not until they
                    had reconstituted their church organizations in the <geogName>Ohio
                    valley</geogName> that they developed any filial love for their churches. It is
                    hardly necessary to observe that these new political and religious institutions
                    were organized in harmony with pioneer life.</p>
            <p>For a century classical systems of education struggled for a footing among the
                    pioneers but without any noticeable result. Colleges, seminaries and academies
                    sprang up here and there in early Indiana, but they were exotic. The spirit of
                    pioneer life never lived within their classic atmosphere. There were expressions
                    in plenty of the appreciation of education by the pioneers, but no system
                    attracted their earnest support because none ever cherished their ideals or
                    attempted to teach their science, philosophy or skill. There were schools among
                    the pioneers but none of them in the sense in which the present industrial
                    schools cater to our industrial civilization. For this reason the pioneer
                    aristocracy never supported the schools as it supported its own religious and
                    political institutions.</p>
            <p>The central system around which the others were organized was the art of reducing
                    the wilderness to homesteads. Their ideal was the manorial homestead of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> about 1700, the time when their refugee ancestors began leaving
                    those countries. This has been the most important occupation in America during
                    the last three centuries. <pb n="274" id="VAA4025-013-3-066"/> The art became
                    highly developed after about 1740, when the first real American pioneer
                    settlements were formed in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, the Shenandoah valley and the Carolina and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="gau">Georgia</region>
                    </placeName> uplands, and reached its culmination in the <geogName>Ohio
                    valley</geogName> about 1860.</p>
            <p>Two radically different types of men and women attacked the problem. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and the northern part of the Shenandoah were the refugee Germans
                    called, until recently, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Dutch, from southern and western <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. In their German homes they had been peasants. For centuries it had
                    been necessary for them to cultivate their little fields with the greatest care
                    and skill and practice the most rigid <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">economy</settlement>
                    </placeName> in order to make a living and pay the heavy demands of the German
                    landlords. Every foot of land was made to yield its greatest return. They
                    produced little for the market and every need of the household had to be
                    anticipated during the year in the growing crop. They accordingly developed a
                    nice balance in their crops. There were sheep for clothing; cows for milk,
                    butter and cheese; horses only enough for the work, with a preference for oxen,
                    on account of their value for beef and hides after they were too old for
                    profitable work; hogs for meat; geese or ducks for feather beds; chickens for
                    eggs and table use; garden vegetables for the table; cabbage for sauerkraut;
                    potatoes for winter use; apples for cider, apple butter, eating and drying; corn
                    for feeding and for making whiskey; wheat for bread. They took extreme care of
                    their farming implements, cleaned their fields of rocks and stumps, and built
                    capacious barns for housing their stock and crops. All this knowledge and skill
                    they had brought with them from the Rhine hills. They stuck close to their work,
                    plodding, prosaic, practical. Their old homesteads along the Susquehanna, with
                    their red brick houses, hillside barns and productive fields, bear ample
                    evidence of their skill as farmers.</p>
            <p>The exact counterpart and supplement of these were the English, Irish and Scotch
                    peasants who settled in the Carolina uplands and in the Shenandoah. A glance at
                    the map will show the close geographical relation of all these settlements which
                    by 1750 were merged together. The long Shenandoah <pb n="275" id="VAA4025-013-3-067"/> valley, the "Great Valley" of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> as it was called then, furnishes an easy and open connection
                    between the other two. Just as the Wallachian, Moravian, Palatine and other
                    German peasants had the same general characteristics and all passed as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Dutch, so the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and Carolina backwoodsmen possessed common characteristics and
                    became known as Scotch-Irish or the "poor whites" in contrast
                    with the wealthier slave owners and the slaves. The common thing in farming in
                            <placeName>
                  <country reg="enk">England</country>, <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="stk">Scotland</region>
                    </placeName>, as these peasants had known them, was stockraising. Especially was
                    this true in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="stk">Scotland</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, where they pastured their herds on the moors, mountains, and
                    fen-lands. Nothing more natural than that when they saw the grassy glades of
                    their new country they at once became stock raisers and cattlemen, marketing
                    their beeves at Charleston and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They acquired large bodies of land, let their stock stand out
                    during the winter, feeding on cane and tuft grass, built large wooden houses,
                    met many household needs with money from sales of cattle, and spent their
                    leisure time roaming the woods, hunting or arguing politics and religion at the
                    taverns or cross roads. They developed an intense, robust, independent
                    individualism, rough and boisterous, artistic and imaginative. As politicians
                    and preachers they were a tremenduous success, as farmers and business men they
                    were failures. The tumble down buildings and worn out lands of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, the Carolinas and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> are witnesses to their unthrifty farming. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Dutch were the reverse. They soon lost their peasant piety, took
                    little interest in politics but their granaries were the storehouses of the
                    Revolution.</p>
            <p>A century intervened, a long, hard century, full of the struggle with the
                    wilderness, bloody Indian wars and the harsh discipline of the frontier, their
                    "sojourn in the wilderness." The best class of Hoosier farmers
                    of southern Indiana were the highest types of pioneer character. They fulfilled
                    the definition in politics, religion, language, education and skill in farming.
                    In politics they were Jacksonian Democrats, loud and boastful; in religion they
                    were old-fashioned Baptists and shouting Methodists with a fair sprinkle of
                    Dunkards, Quakers and Presbyterians, all patrons <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-013-3-068"/> of the campmeeting, that most agonizing form of
                    punishment for sinners ever known in the valley. In language they excelled in
                    the picturesque lingua of the <geogName>Ohio valley</geogName>, which for that
                    reason has become known as the Hoosier dialect. They were strong for education,
                    a smattering of the three R's, provided it stopped safely short of
                    "book larnin,'" for they had a growing suspicion that
                    literary culture and craftiness went hand in hand and would usually be found in
                    company with some more objectionable form of moral obliquity.</p>
            <p>In clearing a farm and making it a place for decent, comfortable living, not
                    primarily a money-making instrument as is now the idea, they beat the whole
                    universal world, to use an anglicised form of their own idiom. Their Buckeye
                    neighbors were better statesmen, more cunning at a bargain; the Bluegrass
                    mansions were places of affluence and culture as compared to their double, hewed
                    log, or red brick houses; while the big prairie farms of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> were rapidly outstripping theirs in the size of their crops; but
                    for all these they were still unsurpassed in those qualities that constituted
                    the typical pioneers of the <geogName>Ohio valley</geogName>. The army of
                    200,000 young men who marched off to the service of their country during the
                    Civil War and the other army of 200,000 young women who took their places on the
                    farm are strong argument for the validity of the home life and the institutions
                    provided by the pioneer Hoosier farmers of 1850 and justify a closer study; for,
                    as mentioned above, when the war broke out these men were just emerged from the
                    pioneer stage and had undertaken the solution of many of the political problems
                    now confronting us.</p>
            <p>Our aristocrats have the reputation of having been men of great physical strength
                    and activity. Their daily life was conducive to bodily vigor. No better physical
                    training could be prescribed today than to swing the ax or maul in the forest
                    ten hours a day for months at a time. In this respect southern Indiana was full
                    of Lincolns before the Civil War. Such men could help at twenty logrollings on
                    as many successive days and not require a vacation afterward. Most young men
                    could leap an eight rail fence and at gatherings it was not extraordinary to
                    find a half dozen men each of <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-013-3-069"/> whom could
                    jump a bar held level with the top of his head. An ordinary deer hunt would in
                    the course of the day take them on a thirty mile tramp through deep snow.
                    Harvesters would swing the scythe or cradle "from sun to sun"
                    with only brief rests for dinner and lunch. Yet between "busy
                    seasons" there were considerable periods of leisure. From the middle of
                    August to the middle of October little work was done and again from Christmas
                    till April work was easy. Usually a man who weighed 160 in August would weigh
                    200 in March.</p>
            <p>But there is another side to this picture. In almost every household there was
                    some old "hippo," broken either in body or spirit or usually
                    both. Ague perhaps had robbed him of the vitality necessary to compete in the
                    hard struggle. He could name a dozen diseases working on him. From his ailments
                    he had constructed a science. His corns and his rheumatism warned him of
                    approaching changes in the weather. The pale red setting sun foretold a
                    disastrous plague, most probably smallpox or "yaller" fever.
                    The crackle of the burning backlog announced an approaching snowstorm. The thick
                    corn shuck, the low-hung hornets' nest, the busy woodpeckers and
                    squirrels were sure signs of a hard winter. In the art of forecasting he was the
                    successor of the seers, soothsayers and astrologers, last and least harmful of
                    all the parasitic train. Science has usurped his throne though traces of his
                    reign still linger. By his shrewd observations, his persistent guessings and
                    artful "I told you so's" he gained a vast influence
                    over the unscientific community.</p>
            <p>Hippo was also a medical man. His specialty was "bitters." On
                    fine days he would potter around the premises gathering roots, leaves and bark
                    and concocting his nostrums. At other times he ventured as far as the store or
                    to some neighboring crone where he compared theories, observations and
                    experiences in the interest of his compound science of prophecy and
                    pharmacology. So complete was his sway in this field that few homes could be
                    found without its jug of bitters and so persistent has been that influence that
                    few of us today are able to defend ourselves against the patent medicine fakers
                    who cater to our inherited weakness.</p>
            <pb n="278" id="VAA4025-013-3-070"/>
            <p>Our aristocrats also had traditions. One hundred years of struggle in the
                    wilderness with nature and the Indians had furnished many dramatic scenes and
                    incidents. Their fathers and grandfathers had fought with General Lewis at Point
                    Pleasant, with George Rogers <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Harrison</settlement>
                    </placeName> were their heroes. Some future <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Scott</region>
                    </placeName> will find these traditions as fascinating as were those of the
                    Scottish border. No finer things are in the memories of many Hoosiers than these
                    old tales as told by some pioneer who lingered twenty years beyond his allotted
                    time apparently with no other purpose than to communicate his story to the next
                    generation.</p>
            <p>The volume of technical knowledge and skill acquired by the pioneer farmer far
                    exceeds what is ordinarily supposed. Where there was no extraordinary rush, land
                    was not cleared immediately. The intended field was laid off and timber selected
                    for fencing. The fence was a square rail worm, built usually nine rails high.
                    Each rail was ten feet long and about four inches square. The fence would thus
                    be eighty inches high; if a pasture fence, it was staked and ridered or simply
                    locked. The first choice of timber for the rails was walnut and poplar, though
                    oak would be used rather than haul the rails a great distance, say a quarter of
                    a mile. Usually the rails could be made so near the line of the fence that
                    hauling, with oxen and sled, was not necessary. The rails were usually made in
                    the winter while the sap was down because the timber split better then and the
                    rails lasted longer. In making the rails an ax, an iron wedge or two, a maul,
                    and at least two gluts, or wooden wedges, were necessary. The maul was made of
                    second growth hickory, if possible a hickory without any red. The sapling, five
                    or six inches through, was cut below the first roots and a maul about one foot
                    long left. The handle was then dressed down to the proper size, the maul rounded
                    off and the finished article set in the chimney corner to season a half year or
                    so. The gluts were made of dogwood saplings three inches through, each glut
                    being from twelve to sixteen inches long, dressed <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-013-3-071"/> down very carefully to a point. If not properly
                    tapered the glut would bounce, utterly ruining the rail splitter's
                    temper. The iron wedge was made with the same proportions and precision by the
                    blacksmith. Thus armed the pioneer rail-maker went forth, as much a skilled
                    mechanic as any cabinet maker. After the rails were laid up there was always
                    danger of some descendant of Rip Van Winkle firing the woods.</p>
            <p>After the fence was completed the underbrush was cut and piled and the trees and
                    saplings deadened. This latter process required both knowledge and skill again;
                    for some trees, as the hickory and willow, needed only to be barked; the oak,
                    poplar and beech needed only to be sapped; while such as the gum and sycamore
                    had to be cut deep into the red. Most trees when girdled or deadened immediately
                    died, but if a willow were peeled in the spring there were usually some
                    thousands of volunteer willows in its neighborhood a year later, while a gum or
                    sassafras deadened out of season was a calamity. Trees deadened when the sap was
                    up became sap rotten in two years, at which time if the clearing were fired many
                    of the trees would burn down and then burn up. The remaining trees could be cut,
                    rolled and burned easily. Most of the small stumps were likewise rotten and if
                    the flock of sheep had been busy nearly all the sprouts were dead.</p>
            <p>The field was thus ready for the plow. The most approved way of the first
                    breaking was with a stout jumping shovel and two yokes of heavy, steady oxen.
                    There was a certain amount of pleasure in watching such a plow tear through the
                    rotten roots, but the completest torture this side of eternity was plowing with
                    a jumping shovel in a rooty new-ground with a team of spirited horses. The plow,
                    excepting the iron shovel and the cutter, was produced on the farm, as were also
                    the ox yokes, and the oxen.</p>
            <p>The same expert knowledge coupled with the same practical skill was necessary in
                    all the various lines of farming activity. There was no refrigerator, but a
                    house was built over a spring and places prepared so that the milk crocks and
                    the butter bowl could get the benefit of the cool water. There was no cold
                    storage, but the potatoes, apples and cabbage were holed up in the ground beyond
                    the reach of frost <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-013-3-072"/> and a cellar provided
                    for other articles of constant use during the winter.</p>
            <p>Our Hoosier aristocracy had long ago lost all distinctions between Dutch and
                    Irish but they had retained the Dutch characteristic of all-'round
                    farming and had acquired some new tastes which required an even wider range of
                    production. In the barnyard were horses, cattle, hogs, sheep, ducks, geese, and
                    chickens. The heavy draft horses that formerly drew the old Conestoga gave way
                    to a lighter, quicker breed from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, while at least two yokes of heavy oxen were kept for the heavy
                    hauling around the farm. There must be at least a half dozen milk cows, for
                    country butter, and hot corn bread disappeared in enormous quantities at
                    breakfast in the presence of eight or ten husky young Hoosiers and two or three
                    hired hands. At dinner or supper a quart of sweet milk was a modest allowance
                    for each person, with perhaps an extra pint for the six and eight year olds,
                    while a jug of cold buttermilk, fresh from the springhouse, was an ever present
                    comfort when the hot harvesters came up to the shade to blow after marching
                    across a ten-acre field. There must be two or three fat, yearling steers to tide
                    over the period from October to Christmas, when the pork season was closed. A
                    considerable amount of beef must be on hands also at butchering time to mix with
                    the pork to make the proper quality of sausage. Last, there must be enough milk
                    to make a dozen or so cheeses the size of a half bushel, for there might be a
                    scarcity of butter sometime during the winter.</p>
            <p>Our farmer also kept a weather eye on his porkers. There must be at least fifteen
                    good two-hundred pounders ready for the hog-killing, which happened along about
                    Christmas. There was no special rush, for, in any emergency like quarterly
                    meeting or a political rally, a couple of sheep or a shote or a yearling steer
                    could be killed. But the porkers must bear the brunt of the burden. They were
                    ready for fattening when two years old, until which time they followed the law
                    of the range, root hog or die. Their master never failed, however, at weaning
                    time to clip off the tip of an ear, cut a notch in it, bore a hole through it or
                    make some other mark as an indication of his affection and ownership. After one
                    month's feeding <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-013-3-073"/> on corn the
                    fifteen or twenty chief porcine actors at the hog-killing festival, one of the
                    big events in pioneer life, were ready for their debut. It would take a small
                    volume to give all the details of the hog killing, pork-curing
                    process—the killing, the sticking, the scalding, the hanging,
                    rendering lard, making head cheese, sausage, salting the meat in tubs, smoking
                    and finally preparing the hickory hams for the summer season. So skillful were
                    they and so tasty was the finished product that even today some of the choicest
                    products of modern packing houses are labeled country sausage or country-cured
                    hams.</p>
            <p>Space will not permit further descriptions of farm life activities, but we must
                    take one hasty glance at the house work, that busiest and most characteristic
                    part of the farm life. The woman's sphere in pioneer life was large and
                    indispensable. Outside the house she, together with the children, looked after
                    the sheep, caring for the lambs in the early spring, shearing the sheep,
                    washing, picking, carding, spinning, reeling, winding, knitting, weaving and
                    making the cloth into coverlets, blankets and clothing. In a large family, and
                    all were large, this was an endless task, lasting from early morn till late
                    bedtime every day in the year except Sundays. Very few persons now living have
                    the knowledge and skill to do this routine work which every pioneer girl learned
                    as a matter of course.</p>
            <p>The geese, most perverse of animals, were under the complete jurisdiction of the
                    women. It required a flock of two or three dozen to furnish the huge featherbeds
                    and pillows that were such an attractive feature of the farm home. Besides this
                    every child when married off was presented with a featherbed and four pillows.
                    And many a baked goose found its way to the dinner table of our aristocrat.
                    Enough chickens, say one hundred, had to be raised to furnish eggs for the
                    cooking, and the women used eggs freely in making coffee, corn bread, cakes and
                    especially for a breakfast fry in the early spring. It was the social law that
                    chicken should form the <hi rend="i">piece de resistance</hi> at all church
                    festivals and the preacher's predilection for fried chicken was known
                    of all women.</p>
            <p>While the men looked after the cattle in general, the milk cows came under the
                    special charge of the women; milking, <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-013-3-074"/>
                    straining, churning and dressing the butter was more than a mere pastime.</p>
            <p>In the dining room and kitchen the wife was more than queen, she was sole monarch
                    and together with her daughters was the whole working force. Providing for the
                    table required a foresight beyond our conception at present. The grocery store
                    was no assistance to her. She had to plan a year ahead. The men assisted with
                    the work to a small degree, but the family mother furnished all information and
                    gave the general directions. The father looked after the meat and bread, but
                    beyond that his knowledge and skill were limited. Canning was not practiced but
                    there was no end of preserves, apple, peach, quince, crab apple, water melon,
                    and citron; jams, marmalade, jellies of all varieties, maple syrup and sorghum,
                    dried fruits, green fruits stored in cellar, spice brush, sassafras, balsam,
                    sage, alder blossoms, buckeyes, catnip, pennyroyal, ditna and scores of other
                    things to be gathered, prepared and laid away, some to be used in cooking,
                    others as medicines, others as charms, as flavors for soups, meats, or cake. It
                    was a whole science in itself. The remembrance of such a home makes many of our
                    old grandfathers, still lingering with us, long for the good old times in a way
                    we cannot appreciate and which we therefore attribute to dotage.</p>
            <p>The skill of the pioneers was not all expended on the endless routine of work.
                    The social life was quite as distinctive as the farm work. Here again a valid
                    distinction can be drawn between the Hoosier and his neighbor. Society in the
                    upper circles of the Blue Grass aristocracy was not different from that among
                    the southern planters. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> society was affected largely by the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> settlers. In Indiana before the war one found almost a perfect
                    mixture of the pioneering races.</p>
            <p>The farmers were essentially religious. Neither dancing, gambling, duelling,
                    drunkenness, nor debauchery of any kind was countenanced by the best class,
                    although of course all existed. The various church days such as Quarterly
                    Meeting, Association, Yearly Meeting, Synod and above all the Camp Meeting were
                    celebrated each in its way. The spelling match, literary, joint debate between
                    preachers or politicians of opposite <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-013-3-075"/>
                    beliefs, the stump speaking, the barbecue, weddings, infares, charivaris,
                    huskings, apple parings, shooting matches, horse races were the commoner forms
                    of strictly social gatherings. Not one of the above has been outlawed or
                    discountenanced in the half century since they were so largely in vogue.</p>
            <p>Having pictured in a brief way the pioneer life let us analyze it. In the first
                    place it was an open society to all who had the merit to belong. If the man and
                    his wife had the ability to build up a home of this description they were by
                    that token welcomed into the social neighborhood provided their morality was up
                    to a tolerable standard. Democrats, Whigs, Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists
                    and Universalists mingled in good fellowship. In fact, they admired the one who
                    could lay on the cudgels with force in a political or sectarian controversy.
                    Pedigree, politics, religion, or even wealth availed little without morality,
                    open door hospitality and the means of good living. Education was not necessary,
                    though a man was expected to be able to read his Bible, his county newspaper
                    (usually borrowed) and understand preachers and stump speakers. This latter was
                    not always a very severe test. In other words this aristocracy was very
                    democratic.</p>
            <p>Again, all this abundant activity was for the home. Could one of these old
                    pioneers come back to us now we may imagine with what surprise he would ask us
                    how we became bondsmen of this unsparing master we call the market. We raise our
                    chickens for the market, our butter is prepared for the market, our corn, our
                    cattle, our hogs, our apples, all, everything are prepared for this
                    all-consuming monster. Even worse, our schools are preparing our children for
                    the market and to the market they go and the farms are following. In the pioneer
                    days the hickory hams were prepared for the table; the last loving touch was
                    given to the jelly and the marmalade that it might grace and flavor a Sunday
                    dinner when the folks were all at home. The feather beds mounted step-ladder
                    high so that the children might find none better in any hotel in the city.
                    Everything lured to the home and conspired to keep one there. The four
                    fireplaces in the old log house did not so much add to the market price as to
                    the comfort of the folks. From 1800 to 1860 the pioneers built up a <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-013-3-076"/> great home civilization. The cities were mean and
                    dirty in comparison. From 1860 to the present the emphasis has gone to the city
                    until it bids fair to rob the country of every attractive feature.</p>
            <p>Another striking contrast between that society and ours of today is in its
                    organization. The individual was emphasized then, the community now. If there
                    was superiority in the house or farm it was due to the man or woman or both who
                    owned it. The pioneer aristocrat could say of everything about him,
                    "these are mine," and of most of them, "I made
                    them." Beginning with the State government he could say of every
                    institution with which he came in contact, "this is part of my
                    handiwork. There is no office here but what I can fill." Coming down to
                    his farm, he made practically all the furniture from the fence rails to the
                    sideboard. Except for a little iron on his plow and wagon, and the wheels of his
                    wagon and carriage he was the sole author of his line of farming implements. He,
                    at his home, might sit down to a sumptuous feast with the preacher, the judge
                    and the colonel all present and listen to their words of praise and their
                    eloquent deeds of praise, conscious that every article on the table from the
                    mutton roast to the jelly cake came from the farm which he owned and operated.
                    As a result of this a strong individualism prevailed. Each farm was an economic
                    unit, all but independent. There was great satisfaction to the farmer in this
                    condition and a satisfied, prosperous farming class is a fair basis for a good
                    society.</p>
            <p>Not being organized on a money-making basis our pioneer society gave much more
                    opportunity for leisurely reflection than we have at present. These were the
                    days when the neighbors, in Platonic style, gathered at the country store and
                    discussed all possible questions. There was time for checkers and horse shoes,
                    for hard cider and long green.</p>
            <p>There was predestination and original sin to be discussed, as well as the signs
                    for a cold or open winter. There was the latest cure for rheumatism, the latest
                    concoction of bitters struggling for recognition in good society.</p>
            <p>These same folks who stood speechless in the presence of the grandeur of nature
                    planted their cucumbers when the sign was in the arm so they would grow long;
                    planted their <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-013-3-077"/> potatoes in the dark of the
                    moon so they would not all grow to tops; knew that if the new moon lay on its
                    back the month would be dry; carried buckeyes in their pockets to keep off
                    rheumatism; carried the left front foot of a rabbit killed in a graveyard in the
                    dark of the moon for good luck; butchered their hogs in the dark of the moon
                    lest when the pork was fried it all go to grease; believed that if a child were
                    born when the sign was in the stomach he would be hearty; if the sign was in the
                    head he would be wise; if it clung to a pencil when first presented to it it was
                    destined to a noble professional career. All nature was full of personal
                    significance, full of signs and potents to their superstitious minds. But this
                    characteristic must not be passed over too lightly. Many of these signs and
                    sayings were based on long and careful observations. Their weather
                    prognostications took the place of the present weather bureau reports and at
                    least were quite as accurate. Most of the prudential sayings which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> printed in his almanac and which have since passed for proverbs
                    were the folk lore of the thrifty German peasants, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Dutch. A large majority of their small superstitions had kernels of
                    wisdom concealed in the cores. There were special days for special deeds, many
                    of them determined by the phases of the moon or the zodiacal sign.</p>
            <p>The whole pioneer atmosphere was charged with a mysterious element somewhat akin
                    to religion and somewhat akin to superstition. They were not a scientific
                    people. Their civilization was built on experience, carefully treasured up and
                    most curiously translated. There were no sufficient means for determining the
                    facts and their so-called reasoning without the facts led to no valid
                    conclusions.</p>
            <p>In central Indiana there located a physician, a graduate of Yale, energetic and
                    skillful. He kept two fine, fleet, black horses. His skill so far surpassed that
                    of the neighboring herb doctors that it became mysterious. Members of the family
                    almost held their breath as the silent mysterious physician entered the house,
                    ungloved his hand, passed it over the hot face of the patient, felt the pulse,
                    issued out the tiniest bit of magical powder and was gone. Some saw him sweep by
                    in the moonlight without sound or motion, others heard the click of his
                    horse's hoofs but saw nothing as he passed by in <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-013-3-078"/> the night on the wings of the storm, riding his
                    black charger, always going as if pursued. He was a wizard. There was no doubt.</p>
            <p>From a personal standpoint their philosophy was broadly humanitarian. Individuals
                    might differ in endowments or wealth, but each bore the impress of the Deity and
                    thus was entitled to respect. This conception had far-reaching consequences. It
                    made slavery impossible, prevented any deep class distinctions, made public
                    schools possible, and laid a broad foundation for Jacksonian Democracy. In
                    social life it made the difference between Emerson and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, between the man who fastens his eye on a distant goal and crushes
                    on through the wreck and ruin of hopes and lives to its consummation, and the
                    man who shapes his life to afford the greatest pleasure to himself and neigbors
                    without much regard to the fulfillment of his own self-appointed destiny.</p>
            <p>Politically, their philosophy was most curious and their conduct contradictory.
                    Long and bitter experience had made them distrustful of government either in the
                    church or the state. Unlike the Puritans and Cavaliers and all other civilized
                    peoples of their time, they conceded no divinity to laws or courts. If the law
                    measured up to their sense of justice they enforced it, if the court meted out
                    substantial justice they obeyed it. If the law was otherwise it remained a dead
                    letter, if the court failed they called in Judge Lynch and the halter strap. Not
                    swift to transcend the law, but certain if the provocation continued. In
                    contradiction, they gave their full strength to America in the Revolution, not
                    so much because they loved America as that they hated <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. They fought the military part of the war of 1812 largely in
                    gratification of their enmity toward <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and the Indians, and finally they saved the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the Civil War not because they hated the South, but because they
                    loved the Union. A strange and happy transformation in the attitude toward the
                    government has come about since our folks engaged in the Whiskey Rebellion,
                    wrote the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Resolutions, intrigued with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="sp">Spain</region>
                    </placeName> and encouraged Burr. Each recognized within himself great political
                    capacity, such that he would willingly undertake to hold any office he could
                    get, from postmaster to congressman. This confidence was inspired by the fact
                    that <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-013-3-079"/> he and his neighbors had organized the
                    government both state and local. All the institutions around him were his own
                    handiwork, the product of his mind and hand. He wanted all the education he
                    could get for himself and children, but he paid his taxes grudgingly.</p>
            <p>Economically he liked to picture himself self-sufficient and wholly independent.
                    His ideal was a farm which furnished him all the necessaries of life. He opposed
                    the state or <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> bank because the bank was too powerful. He could not meet it on the
                    level. He preferred a canal to a railroad because on the canal he could launch
                    his own boat and come and go independently of any other power. On a railroad he
                    would have to accommodate his needs to another man's pleasure. He was
                    in his glory floating down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> with a flatboat load of produce, dickering with the plantation
                    owners on the coast. Even thus abroad he maintained the natural simplicity of
                    his life, not avaricious, not a close bargainer but reveling in his freedom to
                    buy or sell as he pleased. He made a spectacle as he ambled along the levee or
                    in the fashionable streets of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> or even <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with his pants legs hooked over the inside ear of his boots. He
                    was such a robust animal himself he couldn't help but pity the whole
                    world except his own neighbors in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Such in brief was the old society in Indiana. It demanded of its political and
                    clerical servants obedience and we might profit by the same practice. It
                    developed a capable, all-'round, independent citizenship with some good
                    qualities and some bad. It developed a type of rural home life which it made
                    attractive. Finally, it laid a heavy emphasis on individual worth and integrity,
                    an emphasis we seem to need at present.</p>

            <p>As has been the case in too many questions of historical interest, particularly
                    those having only a local bearing, so in the case of the Underground Railroad in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> county, no record has been preserved from which an account could be
                    written. This question has been neglected, until now there are very few people
                    living who have any first hand information to give.</p>
            <p>The source of the material for this paper, therefore, has been largely the
                    statements of people who remember the stories told by those who were actually
                    engaged in aiding runaway slaves to escape to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. An attempt has been made to check any errors that may have slipped
                    in through a lapse of memory by comparing the statements of several different
                    individuals concerning each particular bit of information. Particularly was this
                    method used in connection with the story of "Tony," about whom
                    more will be stated later in the paper. Documents, newspaper clippings, and
                    letters bearing on the subject of the Underground Railroad I was unable to find.
                    About a dozen people were consulted who remember something about specific
                    instances of aid offered to runaways, but I was able to find only three people
                    who had actually taken part in the escape of slaves. These persons were W. C.
                    Smith, who was rather intimately connected with several cases, T. N. Faris, who
                    helped escort to safety the last runaway that passed through this section, and
                    Thomas Kilpatrick, who was one of several into whose custody was placed a negro
                    that was escaping by way of a Monon train.</p>
            <p>Generally speaking, the people of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> county were rather luke-warm in regard to escaping slaves. They
                    weren't actively engaged one way or the other. The small group of
                    people that was actively engaged in aiding fugitives came originally from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Some of them were influenced to <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-013-3-081"/> move from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> largely because of the slavery question. In fact, the church with
                    which they were connected, the Reformed Presbyterian church, was undergoing a
                    rupture, one of the factors of which was the question of holding slaves. The
                    break in the church came in 1833. Those who remained in the church were staunch
                    Abolitionists and many of them who had not already left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> before that time left then. Many, however, had noticed the drift of
                    things, and had moved before the break came. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> county, Indiana, was one of the stopping places. Several of these
                    people entered land in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> county, as early as 1816. From that time on they continued to
                    arrive until a few years before the Civil War. When the split in the church came
                    in 1833 there were in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> county members of both factions. Two churches resulted from the
                    rupture. Among the people here, though the slavery question was not a paramount
                    issue in the break-up, practically all were agreed on the slavery question, so
                    they continued to work together in the interests of Abolition.</p>
            <p>The main motive actuating the majority of those who aided escaping slaves in this
                    community then was a religious' motive. That accounts for the
                    persistency with which they carried on their work and for the risks they ran in
                    performing what they considered their duty.</p>
            <p>Among those in the vicinity of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> who took the most active part in aiding escaping slaves were Thomas
                    Smith, James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clark</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Rev. J. B. Faris, John Blair, Samuel Gordon, Samuel Curry, William
                    Curry, Robert Ewing, John Russell, D. S. Irvin, W. C. Smith, T. N. Faris, Austin
                    Seward, and John Hite, while they didn't take an active part, were
                    nevertheless in sympathy with the people who were doing the work, and thus
                    encouraged and supported the cause. The greatest activity of all of these men
                    was between the dates of 1845 and 1860. Many of them were active only a few
                    years before 1860. Thomas Smith and James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clark</settlement>
                    </placeName> were leaders in the movement from the very beginning.</p>
            <p>The leading "slave catchers," as they were called, who were
                    active in this community were William and Jess Kersaw and Cornelius Mershon
                    through the entire period, and Isaac and James Adkins during the latter part of
                    the period.</p>
            <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-013-3-082"/>
            <p>The first station immediately south of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> station was at Walnut Ridge, a few miles this side of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. There were some Reformed Presbyterians at that place who
                    were interested in aiding slaves to escape. Rev. J. J. McClurkin, who was pastor
                    there for a while, was active in the cause. Isaiah Reed, a member of the
                    congregation there, came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> several times with negroes. A great many people in that community
                    harbored and fed the negroes while they stopped there for a rest, and for
                    hiding. Farther south still, at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>, Davies county, lived William Hawkins, colored, a son-in-law of
                    Knolly Baker, a barber in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Hawkins, being acquainted as he was with the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> who would help the negroes, gave the negroes directions and
                    assistance on their journey north toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In the early days of the Underground Railroad the first station
                    north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was at Moorcsville, a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> settlement. A little later on some Reformed Presbyterians moved
                    near Morgantown and after that Morgantown became an intermediate station between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mooresville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At Morgantown James Kelso and John Cathcart took charge of the
                    negroes. Mr. Cathcart usually harbored them until an opportunity could be found
                    to take them to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mooresville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Kelso took the negroes from Morgantown to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mooresville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He sometimes even came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to help negroes through to Morgantown. Generally, however, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> people looked after that part of the work.</p>
            <p>The negroes usually made their escapes during the summer time or the fall,
                    because they could get their food easily, being able to live on fruits and thus
                    avoid stopping at houses where they might be detected and captured.
                    Occasionally, however, they came through in the winter time. The case of Joel
                    Bee is the most striking example of this kind, and for that reason the story is
                    given as complete as I have been able to work it out.</p>
            <p>Joel Bee had made his way north as far as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> and after passing that town, which was always considered a
                    dangerous one for negroes, he found himself at the break of day in a corn field.
                    It was a little cold and he longed to go to a farm house, but considered such
                    action too dangerous <pb n="291" id="VAA4025-013-3-083"/> and decided to hide in
                    a corn shock. Later in the morning men came out and began shucking corn. Nearer
                    and nearer they approached him so that it was impossible for him to shift his
                    position, to walk about and get warm. He sat quiet so long that his feet were
                    frozen. More than that, he barely escaped being discovered. The huskers were
                    gradually approaching the shock he was in. About noon they began on the one next
                    to him. Before they finished it, however, Joel was delighted to hear the dinner
                    bell ring and to see the men leave their work for dinner. During the noon hour
                    he escaped to a nearby woods where he stayed until night. At dark he began his
                    painful journey north, crippling along on frozen feet. He finally made his way
                    to Samuel Gordon's, three miles south of town, the first stopping place
                    near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for practically all runaways. As was customary, because of the
                    fact that Mr. Gordon's house was rather public, beuv<hi rend="sup">1</hi>; on the road, he took Joel the same night of his arrival to Thomas
                    Smith's. two miles southeast of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Here Joel Bee stayed for several weeks until his feet were cured.
                    Dr. Joseph Me-Pheeters, Thomas Smith's doctor, doctored the negro and
                    kept quiet the fact that he was being harbored there. During the stay of the
                    negro, J. C. Smith, who was at that time attending Indiana University, taught
                    him to read and write. Later on, after he reached <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, he wrote back here telling about how he was getting along. He also
                    wrote to some friend in the South directing how his wife and child might find
                    their way north. Some time later they came through bearing the letter with them.
                    The letter was written so that it could not be understood except by some one who
                    had known the writer. The mother and child stayed with Thomas Smith until they
                    could be conveniently sent on. They were brought here from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> by Hawkins, the colored man who had friends in the South and had
                    married a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> woman through whom he became acquainted with the people here who
                    would aid slaves to escape.</p>
            <p>Adkins watched closely for Joel Bee when he went through here but he failed to
                    find him. Joel Bee stayed here longer than the most of the slaves although on
                    one occasion when it was for some reason or other difficult to find the time or
                    means to take them on their way, two stayed at Robert <pb n="292" id="VAA4025-013-3-084"/> Ewing's two or three weeks, and helped him
                    harvest. They were frightened most of the time because on their way up here one
                    of them had, in a quarrel, hacked a man with a corn knife and they thought the
                    man's friends might be after him. The best record for time that was
                    ever made was made by a negro named Britton, who was just three days on the road
                    between his <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> home and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The following are a few experiences that have been related to me. They throw some
                    additional light on the situation. Rev. James Faris, who took a very active part
                    in the Underground Railroad business in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> county, was initiated into the work in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> in a way that would have discouraged most men from continuing it.
                    While a young man teaching school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he witnessed an auction. One slave that was to be sold learned
                    that Mr. Faris had some money and begged so hard that finally Mr. Faris agreed
                    to purchase him and take him to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where Mr. Faris was to enter the seminary and where the negro was
                    to work and pay him back.</p>
            <p>The trade was made. The following is a copy of the terms of the sale: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            I do hereby warrant and defend the property of the said negro man Isaac
                            to the said James Faris his heirs and assigns forever.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I am indebted to Mr. T. N. Faris for the privilege of making this copy from the
                    original, which he has in his possession. The negro proved to be a rascal and
                    ran away shortly after reaching <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Later on Mr. Faris had a family by the name of Crassen willed to
                    him, by a man in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who wanted to free them, but could not because of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> law. Mr. Faris brought this family of five or six to Indiana and
                    freed them here. For several years after they were freed, Mr. Faris held himself
                    responsible for them and looked after their welfare.</p>
            <p>Through Mr. James Blair I was able to gather some of the experiences his father,
                    John Blair, had in connection with the Underground Railroad. Mr. John Blair was
                    particularly interested in this work for a few years just previous to the <pb n="293" id="VAA4025-013-3-085"/> Civil War. On one occasion Kersaws had a
                    colored woman and child just below the depot somewhere. The Abolitionists did
                    not know just how to get them away, so they arranged for Mr. Blair, whose
                    Abolition tendencies were not at the time known to Kersaws, to go to
                    Kersaw's and ask for some money that one of them owned him. Kersaw told
                    him that he could pay it the next day, that a man was coming up on the morning
                    train from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to claim a colored woman and child that he was holding in custody,
                    and that as soon as he got his reward, he would gladly settle. The next morning
                    Mr. Blair was at the station and was taken in by Kersaw to help watch the woman
                    and child. Kersaws felt safe because they thought they realized that Mr. Blair
                    was financially interested. During the wait a fight began which was not a rare
                    occasion at that time. Kersaws left their charge with Mr. Blair and went to see
                    the fight. In the meantime Mr. Blair succeeded in letting the mother and child
                    escape into the hands of some of the Abolitionists that were in waiting and when
                    Kersaws returned Mr. Blair upbraided them for leaving the whole task to him,
                    claiming that he had had too much to do. "You've played
                    smash," he complained. "I had too much to watch and they got
                    away." At another time Mr. Blair was passing Aunty Myrears'
                    residence on the site of the present electric light plant. Aunty
                    Myrears' was the place in town that negroes were run in for safety. She
                    saw Mr. Blair passing, and according to previous understanding sent a negro to
                    follow him. The negro was so anxious that he kept gaining ground and getting too
                    close for Mr. Blair's comfort. Walk as fast as he could, however, he
                    could not keep in the lead and was finally overtaken by the time he reached the
                    present site of the Monon Stock Yards. By that time the negro could contain
                    himself no longer and cried out, "Massy, Massy, how far is it to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>?" Mr. Blair directed him to the Robinson farm where John
                    Russell met him and later took him to Ewing's.</p>
            <p>W. C. Smith, who, of all persons yet living, had the closest connection with the
                    work of the Underground Railroad, related a great many experiences that he had
                    personally. Among them was the following:</p>
            <p>On one occasion a negro came through by himself and <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-013-3-086"/> got to Thomas Smith's. Isaac Adkins had
                    heard of his arrival but had been unable to locate him. He set his forces to
                    watching in the hope that they might get a glimpse of him. In the meantime,
                    Adkins went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> presumably to find someone to claim him. He failed to come back
                    that night, so Thomas Smith became a little uneasy and sent his son, W. C.
                    Smith, down there the next day to watch. He got as far as New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and located Adkins and his crowd there, so he stayed around until
                    he learned that they were not coming to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> until the next train. Someone of the Adkins crowd was drinking and
                    noticing Will Smith he remarked for his benefit that they would get that nigger
                    or kill someone trying. Mr. Smith concluded that he would be at least as safe
                    with a weapon as without one, so he crossed the street and bought a Colt
                    revolver. That quieted things down in a little bit. Coming up on the train
                    things came near breaking out again. The Adkins proposed a vote on the
                    presidential candidates. Will Smith, to avoid trouble, voted for Filmore. Only
                    one voted for Fremont. They were about to put this one off the train, but
                    because of the conductor's remark that just one would not amount to
                    much, and also because Will Smith voted unexpectedly for Filmore to avoid their
                    trap they quieted down. The rest of the trip to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was made without excitement. Thomas Smith met the train at the
                    depot and later succeeded in transferring the negro to Robert Ewing's.
                    No one ever suspected Robert Ewing of harboring slaves. The Adkins crowd stayed
                    around several days before giving up the hunt, but they failed to find their
                    negro.</p>
            <p>It was customary at that time to put advertisements in the papers in regard to
                    runaway slaves. Sometimes the advertisements would be accompanied with the
                    picture of "the nigger" running away, and the reward that
                    would follow his capture. Frequently this advertising was done by large posters
                    which were scattered through the country. The reward was paid as soon as the
                    negro was delivered to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The statement was made to me by two individuals that in at least a
                    few instances when the negro proved not to be the right one he was sold anyway
                    to pay for the expense of his capture.</p>
            <p>Among the white families with which runaway negroes usually stayed in this
                    community were those of Thomas <pb n="295" id="VAA4025-013-3-087"/> Smith,
                    Robert Ewing, and John Blair (and Mrs. Myrears, colored). They did not often
                    stop at Sammy Gordon's or the Faris' as they lived directly on
                    the road.</p>

            <p>Toney was a negro who escaped from his master in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and undirected made his way to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> county where he was caught by the Kersaws one Saturday night. James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clark</settlement>
                    </placeName>, an elder in the Presbyterian church, found out about the capture
                    the following morning on his way to church, and sent word by Tommy Moore to
                    Thomas Smith, who lived two miles in the country southeast of town. Mr. Smith
                    came to town and together with Mr. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clark</settlement>
                    </placeName> secured a writ authorizing them to take Tony from the Kersaws. At
                    that time the Kersaws lived on the east side of the square where the Wiles Drug
                    Store is at present located. Their place of business was in the marble work shop
                    on the site where the old Presbyterian church used to stand. The trial for the
                    possession of Tony took place before Judge David McDonald. The negro was free;
                    after which he went into the Kersaw house to get his bundle of clothes, and
                    while there he was persuaded by the Kersaws that Mr. Smith and Mr. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clark</settlement>
                    </placeName> were trying to get possession of him, not for the purpose of trying
                    to get him through to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, but for the purpose of taking him back to the South. The Kersaws
                    promised him that if he would stay with them they would take him through to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Smith and Mr. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clark</settlement>
                    </placeName> failed to get possession of Tony, as the Kersaws would allow no one
                    to come around their house. In the meantime the judge had disappeared and could
                    not be found. Some students, originally from the South, had by this time joined
                    the Kersaws, and had threatened to shoot anyone who made an attempt to enter the
                    Kersaw house. One of the students was from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName> and his father was a slave holder in that State. Finally the
                    feeling got so high that a group of the students decided to attack Mr. Smith and
                    Mr. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clark</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but were persuaded from their purpose by Austin Seward, who told
                    them that these men stood too high in the community <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-013-3-088"/> to be shot down without involving a great many
                    people in the shooting affray. Mr. Smith and Mr. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clark</settlement>
                    </placeName> finally went home leaving the negro in the possession of the
                    Kersaws.</p>
            <p>Early Monday morning the Kersaws started with Tony towards <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Tony noticed the direction in which they were going and began to
                    feel that he had been duped. He racked his brain to remember what Sammy Gordon
                    had told him just after the trial before he went to the Kersaws for his bundle
                    of clothing. Mr. Gordon had felt that there was some danger that the Kersaws
                    might fool the negro and had consequently instructed Tony that if ever he got
                    into trouble again and wanted protection to come to the Gordon home. He
                    described the place, a one story log cabin with a two story brick at the end of
                    it, a few miles south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The negro was told to snap the large gate latch and Mr. Gordon
                    would understand the signal and would come out and take him in. The negro
                    remembered this house since he had passed by it when he first came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Kersaws proceeded southward with Tony until they finally came to the
                    residence of Mr. Fleener, the father of Nick Fleener, a few miles north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By that time the negro was tired since he was unused to riding,
                    and with weariness as an excuse he went to bed early. During the night Tony
                    heard Mr. Fleener urging the Kersaws to tie him. They argued, however, that they
                    could take Tony anywhere and that he had all the confidence in the world in them
                    and they would rather not arouse his suspicions. Tony immediately planned to
                    escape, but he did not wish to make the attempt without his clothes, so he
                    decided to wait until morning. The next morning he watched his chance and while
                    his captors were not looking he slipped into a nearby cornfield and made his way
                    into the woods where he stayed until night. At nightfall he started north again
                    and two or three nights later made his way back to the Gordon's. The
                    Kersaws finally tracked him to Gordon's but before they discovered that
                    he had been there some of them reconnoitered about Thomas Smith's place
                    east of town. That very fact warned Mr. Smith that Tony had escaped and
                    immediately guards were stationed to be on the lookout for him to protect him.
                    Mr. Gordon brought Tony to Mr. Smith's the same night that he reeached
                    the Gordon farm, <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-013-3-089"/> and Mr. Gordon was back
                    home before daylight the following-morning. Tony was kept at the home of Mr.
                    Smith for over a week. W. C. Smith, Thomas Smith's son, was not let
                    into the secret, but he noticed the following day that his father and his uncle,
                    Mr. Curry, as they were putting up hay would frequently go back to the rear part
                    of the loft, so he decided to see what was back there and discovered Tony.</p>
            <p>For several days the Kersaws stayed about the place on the pretext of gathering
                    blackberries. They had guards on all the roads and vowed that Tony would never
                    escape. In the meantime Mr. Kelso, from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mooresville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, had been notified and arrangements were made whereby Mr. Smith was
                    to deliver Tony to him at a point north of town as agreed upon through
                    correspondence. The time for delivering Tony came to hand. The ways of escape
                    were guarded. Finally two wagons were loaded, one a covered wagon with the ends
                    closed, which was driven by Mr. Curry, the other Mr. Smith drove, which was an
                    open wagon filled with sacks of grain. Tony was in this wagon under the sacks.
                    Mr. Smith and Mr. Curry started towards town. Mr. Smith drove his team up to the
                    square and began to mingle with the people, and especially with those whose
                    curiosity had been aroused by the covered wagon. Mr. Curry had intentionally
                    looked a little guilty and driven somewhat nervously through the town and out
                    east towards Union-ville and Morgantown. After he got a short distance from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> some of the pickets reported that he was whipping up his horses and
                    before long he was followed by a crowd of Kersaw sympathizers. He was finally
                    overtaken but nothing was found in the wagon. In the meantime Mr. Smith
                    unhitched his horses from where they had been and started north. As it was in
                    the dry season and there were no mills here the farmers had to take their grain
                    away; and in view of the fact that the suspicion was directed towards the Curry
                    wagon, no one suspected the negro's being in the wagon driven by Mr.
                    Smith. Mr. Smith proceeded unmolested, delivered Tony to Mr. Kelso at the
                    designated point, and proceeded to the mill. No one ever discovered how the
                    negro escaped. Some even decided that he had never returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and consequently was not at the Smith residence when it was being
                    watched.</p>

            <p>D<hi rend="sc">R</hi>. T<hi rend="sc">RYON</hi> might have called his volume the
                    barometer of progress. In general household manufactures in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> rose among the thriftier classes of our population, indicating by
                    their rise with fair accuracy the place and rate of progress. Likewise, in their
                    decline they indicate with equal accuracy the growing wealth and culture. The
                    phenomenon is not different from the taking on and casting off of a new fashion,
                    or the coming and going of a new farm implement. At one time it is a badge of
                    progress, at another it is the opposite. Household manufactures also, as Dr.
                    Tryon points out, characterized certain racial groups, the Puritans, Dutch,
                    Germans and Scotch being leaders. Certain economic conditions also had much to
                    do with the prevalence of household manufactures. Small farms, large families,
                    and remoteness from markets, one or all, were accompanying conditions.</p>
            <p>Such is the theme of the book. The author has done his work thoroughly, basing
                    his brief comment on a vast amount of data. He has necessarily used a great many
                    terms, common in the old days, but long since passed out of everyday use, just
                    as have the things themselves. A glossary, such as one finds in an edition of
                    Burns or Chaucer, would not be amiss.</p>
            <p>The story is a modest, homely one and in these times of war will not be read as
                    widely as it merits. What lessons the story has for us is problematical. Whether
                    a partial return to these old customs or a further discarding is preferable are
                    questions of discussion at present. It is a question of emphasizing the
                    old-fashioned, all-round type of individuality, or the narrow expert; it is a
                    contest between the home and community units. Whatever the result of these the
                    volume of Dr. Tryon will help to clarify the issues. It will also be found
                    valuable in manual training work in schools where emphasis is laid on the
                    historical development of industry.</p>

                    </placeName>, after the opening up of the country to settlement, was the center
                    of immigration and commerce. Highways from it led west to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and south into Indiana, making it the commercial center for the
                    pioneer trade just as it had been for a century of the Indian trade. The author
                    has confined himself, as the title indicates, to the civil side of history. The
                    Indian, French and English wars that frequently devastated the lower peninsula
                    are not mentioned. Of special interest is the chapter on the source and
                    character of the population. "The Irish were the leading foreign
                    element, with the English and the Germans close rivals. Scotch and Canadians
                    were few. <placeName>

                    cent, New Englanders 21 per cent, others 8 per cent. These conclusions are based
                    on a single typical county, Washtenaw, directly west of <placeName>

                    William Oliver. This is a doctoral thesis submitted to the history faculty of
                    the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>

                    university.</p>
            <p>Mr. Oliver divides his subject into four chapters; the first is called the Civil
                    War Decade, in which he outlines <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-013-3-095"/> the six
                    pension laws enacted before congress adjourned in 1870. Chapter II deals with
                    the Codification of 1873 and attempted reforms of the Pension system. Chapter
                    III deals with the Arrears of Pensions Act 1879. Chapter IV is entitled Pensions
                    and Politics. It seems that on the whole Mr. Oliver has taken too dark a view of
                    the period. It was a period of poor public service, but the administration of
                    the Pension Bureau was not worse than that of several others. Few bills passed
                    congress in those days except they were backed by lobbies. Compared with the
                    railroad lobby of that time the pension lobby was microscopic in size. The
                    author has done well in citing many caustic remarks and editorials concerning
                    the pension system, but he owed it to his subject to state boldly the underlying
                    justice of pensions and especially of the Arrears Act of 1879.</p>

                    reading," but for voters and taxpayers in general and public officers
                    particularly it is the best the State puts out. The work of <pb n="304" id="VAA4025-013-3-096"/> this office, popularly known as the State Board of
                    Accounts, falls under three heads. First, expert accountants audit the books of
                    all agents in the State who expend public money; from the country squire to the
                    governor. Detailed reports are given of each office examined, and if any
                    crookedness or mistake is found suit is instituted, if necessary, to correct it.
                    Second, there is carried on a publicity work by which all officers are kept
                    informed not only of the laws governing their office, the prices of commodities
                    to be purchased, but of approved uniform systems of bookkeeping. Third, a
                    general propaganda for a higher grade of public service with less graft. This
                    latter business, graft in the civil offices of the state, is rapidly
                    disappearing. The department has published a number of pamphlets in the last two
                    years for circulation among officers and citizens. The following are noticed:</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Special Report of State Examiner</hi>, 1914, by GILBERT HEN-DREN.
                    This is a brief description of the working of the office, the character of the
                    deputies, scope and progress of the work. There were examined 6,522 offices;
                    1,650 public officials were made to restore public money. The department employs
                    about forty field examiners.</p>

                    September 1, 1916. This was an officers' manual defining terms used in

            <p>A pamphlet of 54 pages dated 1915 gives a list of officers to be investigated and
                    the order of examination in each office. This is entitled <hi rend="i">Uniform
