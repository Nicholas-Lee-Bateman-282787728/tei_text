            <p>Benjamin Harrison has frequently been described as a respectable front for the Republican machine and
                    as a President who remained aloof from the political activities of the party organization. That he
                    played neither role can be attested by the high respect both friend and foe alike had for his
                    political capacities and can be demonstrated by his own vigorous action in determining party
                    strategy. This was especially true of his efforts to crack the Democratic South and to regain for
                    his party the political ascendancy it had enjoyed in this section in the early years of
                    reconstruction. For while Harrison might have sweated ice water on other matters, he worked
                    feverishly throughout his presidency to rejuvenate southern Republicanism and plunged into the work
                    with all of the skill of the consummate politician that he was. It is also a phase of Republican
                    history and of Harrison's presidency that has been sadly neglected.</p>
            <p>The presidential election of 1888 had both pleased and troubled Republican leaders. While they
                    controlled both the presidency and Congress for the first time since 1875<hi rend="sup">1</hi>, they
                    still remained a sectional party, with negligible appeal in the South. Despite the strenuous
                    attempts of Hayes, Garfield, and Arthur to recapture political control of the South, Republican
                    strength had steadily diminished to the point where it offered <list type="footnotes">

                    In some southern states the Republican party had practically disappeared, as for instance in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where it had not put up a state ticket since 1876. In other states independent
                    movements and leaders controlled it, as in the case of William Mahone and his
                    "readjusters" in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Few influential southern whites affiliated with the Republican party, and it lacked
                    money, newspapers, and assistance from the national committee. Republicans rarely appeared in the
                    South except at national conventions or when a president of their party had some patronage to hand
                    out. Many Republicans would have agreed with the observation of a white from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> when he wrote, "in abandoning the South… the Republican party had
                    thrown away its best territory for future growth and had violated sound political
                        rules."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand many Republicans hoped with a county chairman in <placeName>

                    </placeName> "for a better time for Republicanism in the South" under Harrison.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> But the problem of methods for rejuvenation there still plagued Republican
                    leaders. Every stratagem to build a strong party in the South had failed. Military reconstruction
                    had alienated southern whites and had been a costly price for the few years of Republican supremacy
                    following the Civil War. Although since 1877 Republican policies had appealed mainly to whites to
                    win their confidence and respect, by 1888 the Republican party had fewer white supporters in the
                    South than it had had under Grant. The time had come for a reappraisal of strategy, and with the
                    Republicans in complete control in <placeName>

                    </placeName> the occasion for a fresh try to win in this section could not have been better.</p>
            <p>Sensing that Harrison planned to do something spectacular about the South, political observers began
                    to make their usual predictions. The most persistent was that Republicans would revive their
                    reconstruction policies so as to protect party voters against fraud and intimidation. Another had

                    stories had Harrison deciding to woo high protective tariff Democrats in the South and to smash the
                    many cliques of Republican bosses through a judicious handling of patronage. Accompanying these
                    predictions was a heavy pressure on Harrison from various Republican quarters to make an energetic
                    assault upon the Democratic South.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Harrison had inspired some of this speculation when he had asked certain friends to submit detailed
                    plans on methods of dealing with the so-called "southern question." But most of
                    the ideas, plans, and demands came on a voluntary basis, and a flood of them passed under
                    Harrison's eye in the interval between election and inauguration. Republicans bombarded
                    Harrison with information about election frauds and intimidation and asked for laws and officials to
                    correct the ballot box outrages, to enforce the laws, and to uphold free speech, free elections, and
                    an honest count in the South. They asked him to avoid the mistakes made by his predecessors in the
                    South, especially in his selection of a southern adviser on patronage and in thinking that
                    ex-Confederate leaders controlled the southern whites. They wanted him to abandon the
                    self-constituted Republican leaders in the South and to give up any policy which might cause
                    southern whites to fear Negro supremacy, for a "Negro party will always be confronted by a
                    white party and be beaten by fair or foul means." Above all he should avoid the folly of
                    appointing Democrats to office in the South "unless there ain't enough Republicans
                    to go around."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But most Republicans looked upon the matter of good appointments as the primary way to ingratiate
                    their party with the South, especially with its white population. When a <list type="footnotes">

                    for the addition of good men to our ranks?" he touched upon a sensitive but extremely
                    important issue. When he urged Harrison to "Take time—give us good Federal
                    officers," he drove home a point that had confronted Republican leaders since 1865.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Yet while Republicans insisted that the prosperity of their party in the South
                    depended upon good appointments, they had various definitions of what these meant. Some limited it
                    to intelligent conservative whites, others recommended only native whites who had been Whigs, still
                    others believed that only young Democrats of protection proclivities filled the bill. Some wanted
                    Harrison to choose only the "Post-Bellum Class of men," for "the old
                    rebel Dems. would never change their politics, and the negroes could not be depended upon to
                    maintain a party by themselves." A few wanted Harrison to make a clean sweep of all the
                    federal officeholders in the South and to name only those men loyal to the Union and the
                        Constitution.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Such varying interpretations confused and puzzled Harrison as
                    they had his predecessors, and they pointed up the immense difficulty of finding a solution to
                    please everyone.</p>
            <p>While Republicans pressed Harrison for good appointments they also asked him to exclude the Negro
                    from party leadership and patronage in the South. This was especially true of southern Republicans
                    who wanted to grab control of the party in their own state. The question of building a
                    "lily-white" party in the South had frequently confronted Republican leaders since
                    reconstruction. While it had an appealing side and was pushed by southern whites, there was no
                    assurance it would woo them away from the Democratic party. Many Republicans would have agreed with

            <p>While others had much to say about Harrison's policy in the South, he refrained from making
                    any public statement on the subject for several months after his election; and when he did say
                    something, he appeared to be as flexible as the rumors themselves. In his letter accepting the
                    presidential nomination he repeated an old Republican theme when he declared that the
                    "right of every qualified elector to cast one free ballot and to have it honestly counted
                    must not be questioned. Every constitutional power should be used to make this right secure and
                    punish frauds upon the ballot." Shortly after his election he pointed out privately that he
                    could not yet make any public statement on the southern question. Then on New Year's Eve he
                    stated in public, "I would like to hear a bugle call throughout the land demanding a pure
                    ballot. A free ballot honestly expressed and fairly counted is the main safeguard of our
                    institutions, and its suppression under any circumstances cannot be tolerated."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Just a month before his inauguration Harrison informed a friend that he would have no southern policy
                    because of necessity his policy must be as national as a law. In his inaugural address Harrison
                    again insisted upon the freedom of the ballot as a condition of national life and emphasized the
                    necessity for the exercise of every power vested in Congress and the executive to secure that
                    freedom. He tempered his insistence by suggesting to the protectionists in the South that they might
                    make allies of the Negro through friendly instruction and co-operation. Six weeks after taking
                    office Harrison let it be known that he had been conscientiously studying political affairs of the
                    South and that he had no tendency to follow the beaten track.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>As he actually developed it, Harrison's southern policy had three main features: a reversion
                    to reconstruction tactics with the Force Bill of 1890, an attempt to resolve factional bickering
                    among southern Republicans, and an effort to win over certain elements in the South by supporting
                    legislation that favored them.</p>
            <p>His major effort to win back the South for the Republican party centered around the Force Bill of
                    1890. By supporting this measure he turned his back on Hayes' idea of conciliating southern
                    conservative Democrats, and he rejected the possibility of co-operating with any independent
                    movements such as those which had captivated Arthur. Thus Harrison scouted the likelihood of winning
                    additional Republican support in the South by accepting the elimination of the Negro as an important
                    political force. Why he returned to a policy which had alienated the white South and which had also
                    caused the Republicans to lose votes in the North deserves some explanation.</p>
            <p>Harrison had probably become convinced of the nearly impossible task of converting southern Democrats
                    to Republicanism. He had witnessed the failure of Hayes and Arthur to accomplish this aim, and he
                    had seen a steady diminution of Republican strength in the South in the face of policies aimed at
                    reversing such a trend. Like other Republican leaders in the North, he had reached the opinion that
                    enough Republican voters lived in the South to give the party some victories but that their vote had
                    either been suppressed or not counted. These strategists argued that the party should work to have
                    this vote counted instead of devising a policy to drum up Republican sentiment among southern
                    Democrats where it did not exist or could not be cultivated.</p>
            <p>The suppression of the voting privileges of southern Republicans, especially of the Negro, had become
                    a major concern to Harrison and other party leaders. By the use of extra-legal methods southern
                    Democrats had nullified the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments. As President, Harrison felt that he
                    had a solemn obligation to enforce the law of the land, and he believed that with an effective
                    federal elections law, fear and fraud could not prevent a voter from casting his ballot.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>In its platform for 1888 the Republican party had demanded "effective legislation to secure
                    the integrity and purity of elections" and charged that the Democratic party in Congress
                    owed its existence to the suppression of the ballot by "a criminal nullification of the
                    Constitution and laws of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>." Harrison had followed up this party declaration in his letter of acceptance
                    by insisting upon the freedom of the ballot and in his first annual message to Congress had called
                    for more complete control of congressional elections. This stand was a shift of sentiment on his
                    part, for he had spoken against federal intervention in 1886 when he sat in the Senate.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> In 1889 northern Republicans contended that the Negro could not vote in the
                    South because of his race and previous condition of servitude. This situation, they argued, violated
                    the Constitution and strengthened the Democratic party in the House and in the electoral college.
                    Not only did a southern Democrat hold his seat illegally, but his vote was two or three times as
                    effective in federal matters as that of a northern Republican. This was a national rather than a
                    local evil, because congressional elections were of national consequence. Since state action in the
                    South had done nothing to correct the abuse, it became the nation's business to do so.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the Republicans in control of the presidency and the Congress, they had for the first time since
                    reconstruction the authority to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments. Harrison now stood
                    ready to remedy the condition of suppressed Republican voters in the South. When Congress convened
                    in December, 1889, Republicans introduced numerous bills which provided for the regulation of
                    national elections. Out of these came the principal measure which Henry Cabot Lodge introduced in
                    the House in March of 1890.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>The Force Bill,<hi rend="sup">16</hi> as it came to be known, proposed a chief supervisor for each
                    judical circuit of the country. It placed three supervisors, not more than two from any political
                    party, at every registration office and polling place where the elections law was in effect. They
                    were to observe and report on registration, to watch the reception of the votes, to participate in
                    the count, and to make their own returns. On the petition of one hundred citizens in an entire
                    congressional district or in a city of twenty thousand or more inhabitants, or on the petition of
                    fifty citizens in any section forming only a part of a congressional district, the law went into
                    effect. The circuit court appointed a board of canvassers of three men and charged it with the duty
                    of examining and returning the votes transmitted to it by the supervisors. If the certificate of the
                    board agreed with that of the state officials, the candidate holding both would become a member of
                    the House. If the two tallies differed, that of the board, on a majority decision, was prima facie
                    evidence of election. A contestant could appeal the board's decision to a circuit court;
                    and in the event of a reversal of opinion, the candidate certified by the court went to Congress.</p>
            <p>These were the main provisions. Additional ones dealt with the selection of juries and with
                    empowering the President to use the Army and Navy to enforce the law if necessary. A minority report
                    that accompanied the bill established the pattern for all arguments used against it in the House and
                    Senate. This report maintained that the proposal subjected the states to federal interference and
                    control, that it was unnecessary because state laws were adequate, and that it was unconstitutional;
                    furthermore, the bill projected the judiciary into the arena of politics, made the supervisors
                    instruments of party control, and cost too much.</p>
            <p>Democrats in the North and South immediately dubbed the measure the Force Bill and attacked it on
                    every possible ground. While numerous Republicans in the South favored the plan, approval was far
                    from unanimous. Objections arose from two sources. Some argued that instead of strengthening the
                    party, it would drive out the better elements and lose the independent vote. To this they added
                    arguments of racial animosity that southern Democrats used, and a few even deluded <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> for twenty-five years called the Force Bill one of the greatest blunders of party
                    strategy. He thought it was "high time the Republican party was giving the Negro a rest.
                    Let him alone." But the majority of the Republicans in the South who opposed the measure
                    resisted it on the grounds that it did not go far enough.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    </placeName> pushed it through on July 2 by a vote of 155 to 149. Two Republicans voted squarely
                    against it, and six had absented themselves without pairs.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> In the Senate,
                    where it became involved in other issues which developed a division among Republicans, the measure
                    met a different fate. Because Harrison and other party leaders had talked much about safeguarding
                    the vote of the Negro, some senators like George F. Hoar of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and John Coit Spooner of <placeName>

                    </placeName> wished to see the party meet its obligations. But when Hoar reported the bill out in
                    the summer of 1890, the McKinley Tariff had come up for passing. This piece of legislation affected
                    practically all of the business interests in the country, among which were heavy contributors to the
                    Republican campaign fund in 1888 who expectantly awaited its enactment. Under Senator Arthur P.
                    Gorman of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>, the Democrats filibustered any attempt to pass the Force Bill, which in turn blocked
                    any consideration of the McKinley Tariff. Senators Matthew S. Quay and Donald Cameron of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, very much interested in the quick and safe passage of the tariff bill, subordinated
                    the plight of the Negro to it. On August 12 Quay successfully moved to postpone consideration of the
                    Force Bill, pointing out that the McKinley Tariff was an "immediate necessity; the election
                    bill can wait."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>In his message to Congress in 1890, Harrison renewed his plea for the passage of the Force Bill,
                    which still awaited action in the Senate. He argued the need for such a law in all parts of the
                    country, because the restraints and penalties would be useful everywhere. For those who doubted its
                    effectiveness, Harrison pointed to the character of its opposition. For those who held the measure
                    to be unconstitutional, a new exercise of power, and an invasion of the rights of the states, he
                    referred to Supreme Court decisions affirming the validity of such legislation and to the
                    enforcement acts of 1870-1871 by which Congress had established certain practices for the election
                    of representatives. Harrison scouted the sectional nature of the bill, declaring that if it appeared
                    in such a light then "crime is local and not universal." Neither would the
                    proposed law revive race animosity. Instead it would provide the President with an opportunity to
                    remedy the inadequacies of the existing laws which attempted to secure to every citizen his
                    constitutional rights and privileges.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the second session of the Fifty-first Congress the Democrats under the lead of Gorman again
                    organized delaying tactics to kill the Force Bill. On this occasion the Silver Republican senators
                    sided with them. Like Quay, they shelved their party's program for the South and reached an
                    accord with the Democratic leaders that subordinated the Force Bill to the silver measure with its
                    free coinage amendment. The coalition came about in January, 1891, when enough Democrats voted with
                    the rebellious Republicans to effect this change in the legislative calendar. From then on no chance
                    remained to pass the Force Bill, and its Republican supporters made few efforts to revive it in the
                    following days of the session.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                        <p>The defeat of the Force Bill marked the third major abandonment of the Negro by the
                            Republican party in the post-reconstruction years. Hayes had abandoned the Negro when he
                            removed the troops because he hoped this policy would reconcile North and South, conciliate
                            southern whites, and ingratiate the Republican party with them. Arthur had abandoned the
                            Negro when he chose to work with the Independent Democrats in the South because he believed
                            this course would allow him to break up the Democratic South. See Vincent P. DeSantis, </p>

            <p>The Force Bill had caused considerable alarm in the South and probably did much to lessen Republican
                    appeals to Southern Democrats. Southern newspapers raised the specter of another reconstruction and
                    of Negro supremacy, and the practical effect of the bill was that the whites closed ranks and
                    opposed any type of federal intervention. This is what the Republicans had worked since 1877 to
                    prevent. Yet Harrison and others had thought the Force Bill was worth the gamble, for had it passed
                    it would have controlled elections effectively and might have piled up some Republican majorities in
                    the South.</p>
            <p>Harrison also worked to destroy the factionalism that had been the bane of southern Republicanism
                    since 1865. His plan called for placating every major Republican group in the South, but many
                    Republicans who felt that the President rewarded them solely because of their participation in an
                    interparty fight intensified their struggles. Another factor that weakened Harrison's
                    efforts was his alignment with erstwhile carpetbagger leaders in the South. In <placeName>

                    ingratiated themselves with Harrison, from whom they received every assistance. Buck proved to be

                    interference with patronage matters in <placeName>

            <p>Powell Clayton had developed an unsavory reputation by reason of his notorious activities during
                    reconstruction. Yet James S. Clarkson, vice-chairman of the Republican National Committee and
                    patronage dispenser for Harrison, admitted that in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName> all patronage matters had to be cleared with Clayton. In fact Harrison took
                    Clayton's advice so frequently that the former carpetbagger once told the President,
                    "I have received from you a degree of consideration I had no right to expect."
                    When some of Clayton's foes tried to break his influence with the administration, Clarkson
                    advised Harrison, "I should look with distrust on anyone who would seek to lessen the
                    party's confidence in Gen. Clayton and the other Republican leaders who have long made such
                    a great and courageous fight… in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>

                    National Committee, an intimate of Harrison advised against it in strong terms, saying in part,
                    "I should not allow anybody to keep me from putting Powell Clayton on the Committee, merely
                    because he was a reconstruction governor… to refuse to appoint him, merely because some
                    Democrat will say something about Reconstruction times, is equivalent to slapping him in the face
                    without excuse. We must remember that we are not organizing a Sunday School convention, or a

                    had the confidence and good will of the "better classes" of Negroes, and he

                    administration through its ties with Mahone had "not only humiliated and disintegrated the

                    which the share of the negro shall be confined to casting his vote." On the other hand,
                    Quay and Clarkson who had been working with Mahone to round up southern delegates at the 1892
                    national convention felt that Harrison had committed a political blunder by not supporting

                    problem. Politics, tradition, and public promises complicated the matter. In a speech he had made on
                    the Senate floor in the spring of 1886 Harrison had declared, "I am one of those who feel
                    that the colored race in the South since the War has been subjected to indignities, cruelties,
                    outrages, and a repression of rights such as find no parallel in the history of

                    Harrison decried the fact that the Negro Republican vote of the South had been deprived of all
                    effective influence in the administration of the government. He demanded that "a free
                    ballot shall not be denied to Republicans in these States where rebels have been rehabilitated with
                    a full citizenship."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> He did favor the Force Bill and did urge it upon

                    this bill as they would have applauded him had it gone through.</p>
            <p>Above everything else Negro Republicans wanted patronage, for in their eyes this was the mark of
                    favor and recognition from the administration. But the Negro press was divided over
                    Harrison's intentions. According to the <hi rend="i">

                    offices in their states to Democrats or "crawfishing" Republicans. Harrison told
                    the delegation, in so many words, to go home and attend to its own business, which reminded the <hi rend="i">Age</hi> of Garfield's advice to the Negro to obtain
                    "Webster's Blue Black spelling book." Then in another alleged interview
                    with a southern delegation, Harrison proposed to appoint Negroes to minor places in deference to the
                    feelings of southerners. Through his secretary Harrison branded this latter statement as false and

            </p>
            <p>While Harrison made a number of Negro appointments, he continued the traditional Republican policy of
                    rewarding a few Negro leaders as a means of recognizing the entire race. Names like Blanche K.
                    Bruce, Robert Smalls, Frederick Douglass, John R. Lynch, and their friends which had appeared on
                    Hayes' appointment list reappeared on Harrison's. But some of Harrison's
                    Negro appointments reflect a change of policy. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> he passed over old Negro leaders like P.B.S. Pinchback and began to recognize the
                    merits of the younger men who had grown up since the war. In this state he chose John Francis Patty
                    and Charles B. Wilson for the posts of naval officer at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>

                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>. Both Wilson and Patty were young men, the latter but thirty-four years old. Harrison
                    had taken a new departure, and the Negro press viewed it as such.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Harrison also attempted to give Negroes postmasterships in some of the large southern cities. He
                    named W. O. Crum, a doctor, for postmaster at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> but withdrew his nomination when too much Senate opposition developed. Supposedly Crum
                    was not competent enough, although the Negro insisted that the objections were raised because of his
                    race. The President kept James Hill's name before the Senate for postmaster at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vicksburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> until that body refused to confirm the <placeName>

                        <p>The Cuney appointment provides an interesting commentary on Harrison's dealing with
                            the Negro. Cuney had been under consideration for some time for this position. He was the
                            boss of the Republican party in <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                            </placeName>, but he was also a Negro and was seeking a very important patronage job in the
                            South. The appointment dragged on. Cuney went to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                            </placeName> to see about it. Senator William B. Allison of <placeName>

            <p>At the outset of his administration Harrison's policy in the South was criticized severely
                    by the Negro, especially by T. Thomas Fortune, editor of the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                        </placeName> Age.</hi> Fortune asked Harrison to carry out the party's pledges in the
                    campaign of 1888 concerning the South. He asked the President to avoid Hayes' policy of
                    "conciliating, bowing and scraping, and apologizing and supplicating the white men of the
                    South." He demanded that Harrison consult with Negro leaders and remove every southern
                    Democrat from office. As time went by Fortune accused Harrison of surpassing all "former
                    Republican Presidents … in ignoring the advice and claims of colored leaders."
                    Fortune's fury mounted when Harrison vacillated between the white and the Negro factions in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>, and he charged the President with attempting to ride "the pale horse of the
                    white league and the dark horse of colored Republicanism."<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Fortune's attitude changed when Harrison gave office to a number of Negro leaders. Then
                    he ceased his attacks on the President and exclaimed, "Let the good work proceed. Turn the
                    Southern Democratic rascals out." Harrison's policy continued to please Fortune,
                    for when the President was renominated in 1892, the Negro leader congratulated him and pledged his
                    enthusiastic support.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Other Negro leaders <list type="footnotes">

                                reportedly informed Allison that the Treasury Department had adopted a rule not to name
                                any Negro to office. Then Cuney called upon Clarkson, vice-chairman of the Republican
                                National Committee, and together they went to the White House, where they found the
                                President with Windom signing appointments for the treasury. Clarkson gained admittance
                                just after Harrison had signed the appointment for the collectorship at <placeName>

                                </placeName>. He held it out to Clarkson and asked, "That is right, is it not
                                and as was finally decided upon, isn't it." Clarkson answered,
                                "No, Mr. President, that is not the right name. In conferences some of us had
                                with you, with some people from <placeName>

                                </placeName> with us, You decided to appoint Mr. Wright Cuney to this place."
                                Harrison got up, walked around with the commission in his hand and replied, "I
                                remember now, but the Department has for some time been advising differently and has
                                caused me to change my mind." Then he asked Clarkson, "If you were
                                President would you give the most important position in <placeName>
                                    <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>

                                hesitating, Clarkson answered, "Yes, and be glad of the chance."
                                Harrison scratched out the name he had written in and wrote in Cuney's. Then he
                                turned to Clarkson, "You are right and I am glad you called my attention to the

                    chief executive and wound up by appealing to Negroes to love and to remain in the Republican party
                    and to despise the Democratic party. The <hi rend="i">Bee</hi> called Harrison "an honest
                    man believing in honest elections and in honest money," and told Negroes it would be easier

                    southern Negroes who could not contribute any electoral votes, raised a vital question that had been
                    carefully weighed by all northern Republican leaders since 1877. Some southern Negroes even urged
                    Harrison to appoint white Republicans and conservative Democrats to the chief offices and to give
                    the minor posts to the Negro, for there was "no danger of the Negro race siding with the
                    Democratic party for we know they mean nothing good for us."<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Harrison also tried to win over dissatisfied Democrats in the South with favorable legislation. He
                    favored the McKinley Tariff, which benefited some industries in the South, which had provisions
                    appealing to farmers, and which held out some favors to the sugar cane growers in Lousiana. The
                    President also supported the Blair Educational Bill in an effort to placate any discontented Negroes
                    in the South.</p>
            <p>The Blair Bill provided for a sum of money varying from $75,000,000 to
                    $100,000,000 to be distributed over a period of from eight to twelve years to states on
                    the basis of illiteracy. Since the southern states, with large Negro populations, had the greatest
                    number of illiterates, they were in a position to receive the bulk of these funds. Advocates of the
                    measure emphasized the danger of a large number of illiterates to a republican form of government,
                    the inability of the South to cope with Negro illiteracy, and the responsibility of the government
                    to the Negro in preparing him for citizenship.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Opponents of the Blair Bill

                            educational funds was the surplus in the treasury that menaced the high protective tariff
                            which the Republicans considered essential in the continuing prosperity of the country.
                            Between 1866 and 1890 a surplus had been built up because Congress had been slow to repeal
                            the internal revenue taxes of the Civil War and because it imposed high duties in a series
                            of post-war tariffs. In the eighties the disposal of this surplus became a pressing problem,
                            for a surplus matched a deficit in being an uncomfortable phenomenon in public finance and
                            politics. It embarrassed those who favored a high tariff because a surplus indicated
                            excessive rates and tempted to extravagant appropriations. Obviously if the surplus
                            continued, the tariff would have to be reduced, for it constituted then the chief source of
                            income. The simplest way of all to reduce the surplus, and politically the most
                            satisfactory, had been to pension Civil War veterans. But the Blair Bill presented an
                            opportunity to the Republican party to hold the Negro in line, to dispose of part of the
                            surplus, and to retain the high tariff rates.</item>

                    schools, and predicted that federal aid to the states would humiliate and destroy local initiative.
                    But the fear that the federal interference with states' rights would undermine white
                    supremacy, along with antitariff sentiments, lay behind the hesitancy of southern Democrats to
                    accept funds.</p>
            <p>The Blair Bill had passed the Senate in 1884, 1886, and 1888, but it never gained enough strength to
                    reach a vote in the House. Despite the numerous setbacks the measure had received in the House,
                    Senator Henry W. Blair, the author, introduced it again in 1889. Harrison supported it, but on this
                    occasion the bill was defeated in the Senate and never went on to the House.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
                    The failure of a Republican-controlled Congress to pass the Blair Bill and the Force Bill aroused

            <p>The McKinley Tariff of 1890 had some novel features which the Republican leaders hoped would attract
                    support for the party in the South.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Its complete schedule of protective duties
                    on agricultural products aimed at mitigating one of the chief grievances of farmers, in the South as
                    well as in the West. By including duties on agricultural products, politicians sought to refute the
                    charge that farmers sold on an unprotected market while they bought on a protected market.
                    Alliancemen in the South, disappointed in their efforts to win control of the Democratic party in
                    their states, might be persuaded to join the Republican party if the proper inducements could be
                    made.</p>
            <p>The repeal of the sugar duty constituted another novel feature of the McKinley Tariff. At the time

            <p>The McKinley Tariff admitted all raw sugar free but retained the duty of one-half cent per pound on

                    </placeName> who would be affected adversely by such action. For this reason Republican leaders
                    sought to compensate them for their loss. The Republican leader also hoped that this policy would
                    prove to the protectionists in the South that the Republican party was their friend and would look
                    after their interests in the same way it watched over the interests of the northeastern business
                    community.</p>
            <p>Harrison had had a busy time trying to recapture the South for the Republican party, and he had
                    employed a variety of tactics in the hope that any one or a combination of them would produce the
                    new and vigorous Republican party in the South for which the national leaders had yearned for nearly
                    two decades. The Force Bill aimed to have every Republican in the South register and vote, so that a
                    vast Negro Republican vote would not be lost. Had this happened, a political realignment or a
                    political revolution might have occurred. But when Congress failed to pass this legislation it
                    weakened considerably Harrison's effort to get out the Republican vote in the South.</p>
            <p>Harrison also failed to make any headway in his attempts to have the party in the South stop its
                    internal quarrels and start fighting the Democrats. For as many Republicans as he placated he
                    antagonized an equal number, so that factionalism remained to vex Republican Presidents. While
                    Harrison revived the fear of Negro supremacy among southern whites through his public statements on
                    the suppression of the ballot in their states and by his support of the Force Bill, he tried to win
                    them over to the Republican side by tempting their Democratic loyalties through favorable
                    legislation. He straddled the silver issue in a vain effort to gain the allegiance of Silver
                    Democrats in the South, who had begun to fight the northeastern leadership of the party on this
                    matter. The Republican leadership had inserted a schedule for agricultural products in the McKinley
                    Tariff in a maneuver to bring back the small farmers in the South and elsewhere to the Republican
                    fold. By 1890 most of the small farmers in the South had joined the Alliance and some of them felt
                    prepared to leave the Democratic party if they could not control it. But they still hung back from
                    organizing a third party, as Alliancemen had done in the West, and <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-051-4-028"/> Republicans hoped that if they bolted they would come over to the
                    G.O.P. Likewise the bounty on sugar was a concession to Democrats in the sugar cane area of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> in the hope of stirring up sentiment for the Republican party in these districts that
                    sought protection for their sugar.</p>
            <p>But by 1892 the Republican party had still failed to win over the southern white support that it
                    needed if it ever intended to develop a two-party South. On top of this its Negro support had
                    dwindled almost to the vanishing point in some areas. The Republican party in the South, despite the
                    series of efforts and changing tactics to resurrect it and to rebuild it, faced a greater problem of
                    rejuvenation than it confronted when Hayes recalled the troops.</p>

                    </placeName>'s true rival, the one standing as a colossus before their designs, was their

                    </placeName> promoters ever believed that their town could become supreme in the <geogName>Ohio

                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> leaders, and viewed in the light of the general situation in the middle part of the
                    past century this optimism becomes somewhat understandable.</p>
            <p>Of the multiple factors which might influence the growth and success of a town in this area of the
                    Middle West in the past century, the major one was the degree of success with which it could fit
                    into the over-all pattern of transportation and trade. In 1830, and even by the middle of the
                    century, this pattern was still highly flexible. And though far behind <placeName>

                    addition to several thousand smaller boats, about 14,000 steamboats passed through from 1831 to
                    1843, netting more than $1,200,000. Tolls were charged according to the rated capacity of
                    the vessel, not the weight actually carried. Since by 1850 the average steamboat had a capacity of
                    about 350 tons, at 50¢ per ton each boat paid about $175.00. For the
                    twelve-year period, 1831-1843, the federal government's share of the profits was
                    $258,378.00, which was $23,378.00 more than its original investment. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>By 1850 much of this threat was still only theoretical, but interests on both sides of the river
                    surmised that it might some day be more than this. A Greenville, Indiana, resident summed up this
                    view in a letter to the <hi rend="i">New Albany Daily Ledger</hi> in 1850: "If position

            <p>It was the construction of the New Albany and Salem Railroad that really awakened the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> people to the fact that they had a serious commercial competitor in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and they obviously decided that the best way to turn this threat into a boon was to
                    improve road facilities on the western outskirts of their city. Thus the Indiana farmers and
                    merchants would be encouraged to pass through <placeName>

                    </placeName> to carry on their business. The editor of the <hi rend="i">Louisville Democrat</hi>

            <p>In the middle of the nineteenth century, some citizens of the <geogName>Ohio Falls</geogName> area

                    </placeName> through a tunnel under the river. Like many other unrealized projects of a hundred
                    years ago, the imaginative boldness of the idea does its propounders a certain credit. And having
                    projected the tunnel, the planners further proposed to carry it under <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

            <p>Thus the press encouraged the plan, and official support was not lacking. Public reaction is harder
                    to document. The area was undergoing one of its recurrent financial crises at this time;
                    nevertheless by December 1, a local member of the approximately seventy-five stock agents of the
                    road was reported to have obtained more than $10,000 in subscriptions in the city, and an

            <p>Little additional propaganda was put forth until the middle of November, when Joseph A. Wright, then
                    governor of Indiana, was scheduled to address a meeting of friends of the tunnel at the
                    Merchants' Exchange in <placeName>

                    Journal</hi> reported next morning that it was "large and highly respectable."
                    Preceding Governor Wright's speech, Holman addressed the group on the topic of the tunnel.
                    The governor then spoke "in a happy vein of mingled argument and exhortation." His
                    chief theme was that the citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> had allowed too many opportunities for the improvement of the town to slip by and they
                    had better not let this one pass also. In a flurry of enthusiasm, eleven hundred dollars'
                    worth of stock was subscribed at the end of the speech.</p>

                    advantage that would accrue from the undertaking: the work would supply sufficient gravel to surface
                    all the streets. Optimistically, the paper concluded: "It is possible that the materials to
                    be excavated… will be more than sufficient to pay for the taking of them out. It is known

                    an answer within forty-eight hours in the form of a letter to the editors of the <hi rend="i">Louisville Daily Journal</hi>. Over the signature "Bridge," the author
                    denounced with much heat and sarcasm the earlier communication and demonstrated to his own

                    on January 4, 1855, "Tunnel Junior" entered the lists against
                    "Bridge." With as much heat and somewhat more fancy he demonstrated in the <hi rend="i">Louisville Daily Journal</hi> of that date the superiority of the tunnel.
                    "Bridge" took up the challenge on January 6. Indeed, by heading his communication
                    "Bridge or Tunnel, No. 1" the editors of the <hi rend="i">Louisville Daily
                    Journal</hi> indicated that more was to come. But here the issue grew confused, for it is apparent
                    in the letter that "Bridge" was not only convinced of the sole correct method for
                    trains to pass from the Indiana to the <placeName>

            <p>Events now began to move toward a denouement. The funds did not come in, whether because of the
                    eloquence of "Bridge," the continuing financial stringency, or rival business
                    interests. On April 7 a warrant was obtained against John Zulauf, president of the Jeffersonville

               </placeName>, in 1817, was one of the earliest
                    practitioners of his profession in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Indiana. As a child he began to use indigo from his mother's bluing bag
                    and the juices of bloodroot and yellowroot to tint his pictures, applying his colors with a brush he
                    made from squirrel hair. At the age of twenty he was making watercolor miniatures on ivory and soon
                    thereafter was painting portraits in oil. For three years he taught in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> subscription schools, but from the time he was twenty-two he was a full-time artist,
                    notwithstanding the fact that the Quakers, with whom he maintained an active membership, looked upon
                    art as a snare of Satan. In 1844 he moved to the vicinity of <placeName>

                    an itinerant artist for six years until he established in the town itself a studio which he
                    maintained until he moved to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1843, Mote drew two sketches of him, which Adams autographed. Mote's
                    painting of "Indiana Yearly Meeting of Friends in 1844" has been reproduced in a
                    number of books and other publications, sometimes as an example of the work of a pioneer artist but
                    more often as an illustration of types of conveyances used in the 1840's. In 1853-1854,
                    when panoramas were at the height of their popularity, Mote painted four of these mammoth
                    forerunners of the moving picture: "Uncle Tom's Cabin," from the book

                    especially the use of tax funds for art instruction, Marcus Mote was far ahead of his time.</p>

                    </placeName> only the most advanced pupils were permitted to draw from life, and there were no nude
                    models. Painting was not taught until after 1872. Since even recognized artists often copied
                    extensively the work of others instead of drawing from nature or from life, naturally copying was
                    thought a proper occupation for students. Asher Brown Durand, president of the National Academy of

                    came to believe and to advocate the revolutionary theory that painting landscapes from nature should
                    come before the study of masterpieces of art, His theory did not receive general support, however,

                    to copying, but he also allowed students to draw from nature. As early as March, 1864, he organized
                    a sketch club in which eleven teachers from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> schools participated. This club made trips to the woods around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> and to points of interest along the <geogName>Whitewater River</geogName> and various
                    creeks. There was still life drawing from fruits and flowers, or the subject might be a hen and
                    chickens, a puppy, or even a dog's hind leg. Marcus wrote in his journal, "I took
                    Sue S's Martha Washington to Nicholson's [book store] to hang to show a
                    student's work with less than 2 month's instruction."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Sometimes students brought family photographs for instruction in making photo-portraits.</p>
            <p>In 1869 Mote moved his studio, which had been on the second floor of Vaughan's Building at

                    circulars advertising the School of Design, setting forth terms and rules. The new evening class in
                    drawing, which was to meet twice weekly, numbered nine students who paid $9.00 for the
                    course. In the class was President Joseph Moore of Earlham, who wanted to improve his ability to

                            as butter or milk for use in the Mote home. Mote's journal during August, 1869, and
                            for several years following tells the story of his School of Design, supplemented by
                            occasional advertisements and news stories in the local papers. A journal entry on October
                            15, 1869, named Joseph Moore as one of his students. Another on March 22, 1872, mentioned
                            the class of twenty students, including three women. Journal entries during thb period refer
                            to students brin ing butter or milk, as on April 20 1877, when Alpheus Test "wanted

                    taste for Art among our citizens sufficient to warrant its continuance and full development. The
                    fees are low, much lower than lessons in music, and while many parents are anxious to have their
                    daughters study music, and willing to pay fifty and seventy-five cents per lesson, they seem to
                    think even twenty-five cents a lesson for Drawing rather more than the worth of the importance of
                    the achievement. A very little observation and thought should convince every parent that their
                    daughter would use the skill of hand acquired in drawing, together with the cultivated ideas
                    induced, ten times in her everyday business to where she would her musical ability. Drawing is of
                    use in the kitchen or the parlor, the shop, or whilst traveling. It matures ideas and gives habits
                    of observation, which cannot be said of music."</p>
            <p>Mote had a succession of assistants who helped fill in backgrounds in portraits and assisted in
                    instruction in his school. Samantha Hankins came to <placeName>

                    </placeName> studio and remained for four years. Temperamental differences made their association a
                    mixed pleasure, but when she left and he had no one with whom he could talk art he was almost
                    prostrated with loneliness, writing in his journal, "I must take it alone
                    henceforth… trying to become reconciled to my fate-but companionship in Art is one of the
                    dearest things on earth to me. … Would like she saw my last pictures."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Miss Hankins was followed by Sue Spence of Paxton, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. She was an able student and artist but so full of temper that the room in which she
                    worked came to be called Castle Thunder and retained that name long after she left <placeName>

                    company. In his next assistant, Edith Adcock, he caught another Tartar, to use his own phrase. He
                    thought her fussy and incomprehensible. She did not get along well with students, and she was so
                    faultfinding that no landlady would keep her more than a few days. Lydia Jackson went to the
                    opposite extreme, with so little vitality and spirit that she was no company and of little help.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    may have been only unfortunate. But he too was sometimes irascible, and always he was an exacting
                    taskmaster, so that he probably incited some of the trouble. With the passing of the years he and
                    Sue Spence forgot their differences, and Marcus remembered her only as a favorite student and a
                    capable artist. In 1877 he wrote in his journal, "Just got settled to painting &amp; a
                    feeble knock &amp; open the door &amp; lo my poor long lost child Sue Spence." She

            <p>Mote's female pupils often impressed him as strange creatures. Because he had been reared in
                    a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> home without sisters, the usual woman came from a background foreign to his experience
                    and no doubt behaved at times in ways he neither approved nor comprehended. At the same time he felt
                    it his duty to counsel and correct. On one occasion, his journal indicates, he "advised
                    more staid way of walking."<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes he was an unwilling confidant. He refused to take any student of doubtful reputation. Two
                    of his pupils conspired to use his studio to see friends they were not permitted to see at home.
                    When they refused Mote's advice, he consulted weighty Friends about what course he should
                    follow; he also conferred with the "french priest" of one of the girls. Thereafter
                    he declined to give them further lessons. When he discontinued the school it was with relief, for he
                    felt "tireder after teaching than by any kind of painting I do."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>Harvey himself has told the story of how he came to study art, his association with Mote, and his
                    impressions of his first art teacher: "While in my teens [thirteen] I attended one of the

                        <settlement type="city">Wilmington</settlement>

                    </placeName>]. It was announced that on the following day a distinguished artist from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, a <placeName>

                    </placeName>, would be present to give a chalk talk lesson on some Bible character. I need not tell
                    you I was there, ‘present early’ in choice seat, center, facing platform.
                    … I was all eyes and expectancy, eager to see a real artist, not just pictured in prints
                    and with written descriptions of beings that might be termed super-men, with heroic statures,
                    flowing beards and shaggy locks. Then Marcus came in. I saw a man of unimposing stature, about
                    5' 2", past middle life, clean shaven face, light brown hair, considerably grayed,
                    blue eyes, a ruddy healthy complexion, plump cheeks void of wrinkles, and serene brow. He walked
                    nimbly and talked glibly. Standing before the blackboard with a box of crayons nearby, he addressed
                    the large assembly with a few preliminary remarks, then proceeded to draw while talking.
                    … I can't recall a single word he said nor drawing he made, but I can yet see
                    him as he made his entrance and exit, wearing a dark brown smock that made him look like

            <p>So Eli Harvey became a pupil of Marcus Mote, who set him to copying colored prints. He was so
                    homesick that at the end of the month he returned home; there he remained until he was nineteen,
                    when he entered the art school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Since Mote did not keep a journal at this time, no record remains of his opinion of
                    the boy who lived in his home, spent a month in his studio, and was to become the most famous of his
                    students.</p>
            <p>Mote knew that in 1864 the public schools of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> had added art to their curriculum. As the leading art center in the Middle West it was
                    natural that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> should lead in making art training as available to students as any other branch of
                    learning. Mote published an article in the <hi rend="i">Richmond Weekly Telegram,</hi> April 27,
                    1867, stating his belief that the public schools should train students "for all that is
                    civil and useful." Since the ability to draw is useful, he argued, often even necessary, to
                    a mechanic, and since a knowledge of the principles of art is of great advantage to a housewife, it
                    followed that art should be taught in the public schools.</p>
            <p>Mote was aware of the opposition of the Quakers to the fine arts, but in following art as a vocation,
                    in acting as an art teacher in his private school, and in advocating the teaching of art in the
                    public schools, he thought of himself as a good <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> who differed only in interpretation. Had not George Fox instructed his followers to
                    teach the young all that was civil and useful in creation? Therefore his task was to persuade the
                    Quakers and the general public that a knowledge of art was civil and useful. In his heart he knew
                    that in thus making art of use to others man could find personal happiness, and that even fine art
                    had a high level of usefulness, though it usually brought, in the words of Ruskin, only bitter bread
                    and salt and going up and down other people's stairs.</p>

                        </placeName> Telegram.</hi> It was unsigned, but Mote's journal entry on August 19
                    indicated that he was the author: "It is generally conceded that schools are intended to
                    prepare the pupil for the active duties of adult life. Is this strictly true of our present system?
                    Are not pupils taught many things they never have any use for in after life, and are not some things
                    entirely omitted which are of primary importance? Among the last, which is almost or entirely
                    omitted in our schools, is practical drawing. A knowledge of Drawing, it must be admitted, is of use
                    in all of the necessary details of life. Drawing gives the pupil a knowledge of form, size and
                    proportion, and will assist the future woman as housekeeper, shopkeeper, lecturer, teacher, etc.;
                    and to the future man it is almost indispensable, whether as architect, builder, mechanic, merchant
                    or farmer. Then why is Drawing omitted? Can any one of our educators tell? I pause for a
                    reply."</p>
            <p>A year later Mote carried his concern directly to the supertendent of schools and to the mayor. An
                    act of the Indiana legislature of 1865 had authorized schools to make additions to a specified list
                    of subjects under certain conditions. The superintendent and the mayor did not believe the demand
                    was sufficient in 1869 to justify action on Mote's concern.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His next move was directed at the general public, a campaign of propaganda to increase the demand for
                    the teaching of art. He had hundreds of circulars printed at his own expense and personally

                    factories for training in drawing. It is likely that he hoped to be the teacher for such a class,
                    independent of the public school system. He realized that he did not have the technical training
                    which would be required by school boards for teaching an accredited class. A class for apprentices
                    did not materialize, however.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Ten years were to pass before Mote saw his wish come true for Earlham. He had to wait fourteen years
                    for art to be introduced into the public school curriculum. Authentic information as to further
                    steps taken and Mote's connection with them is lacking, but tradition gives him credit for
                    the achievement, not only in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>

                    city, art became part of the curriculum and has been taught continuously since that time.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to an article in the <hi rend="i">Indianapolis Journal</hi> by a reporter who visited the
                    old artist, then nearly eighty years old, Mote "secured the petition which caused the
                    legislature to provide that the public schools of Indiana should teach drawing. The petition was
                    presented by Sen. William Baxter, since deceased. Two years previously the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>

                    terms of service in the legislature were in 1875 and 1877, and since no such act was passed until
                    later after art teaching had become fairly general, the reporter seems to have made an inaccurate
                    statement. It may be that Mote related efforts he had made toward the passage of the act but may
                    have been confused about the sequence of events.</p>
            <p>Whatever the details may have been, there can be no doubt that in actively promoting the introduction
                    of art into the school curriculum and in giving art instruction in his own studio Mote was a local
                    prophet whose work, combined with that of others throughout the country, was responsible for the
                    general acceptance of art as a valuable field for general instruction.</p>

            <p>The Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation celebrates in 1955 the twenty-fifth anniversary of its founding.
                    A quarter-century of sustained effort to promote American-German relations and cultural exchange
                    provides sufficient evidence for an appraisal of its work, even though the foundation operates in
                    the area of intangibles.</p>
            <p>Ultimately such a foundation must depend upon the deep, possibly obscure, emotions and attitudes of
                    those who support it. In the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> citizens of German birth ordescent have often felt a need for an understanding of their
                    inherited culture. This may seem strange at first glance, because approximately six million Germans
                    came to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> between 1820 and 1945. Exceeding the immigration from any other European country, by
                    weight of numbers alone the German stock might be expected to make its way easily in America. But
                    this has not always been true.</p>
            <p>Certainly no serious student of American history can long overlook the impress on life in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> made by citizens of German origin. Their contributions to music and to the arts stand
                    out as clearly as their energy and good sense in business. German skill in agriculture is
                    proverbial. Germans also leave their mark in public life, as the career of Carl Schurz abundantly
                    illustrates. It is their own tragedy, however, that three times, at least, since the middle of the
                    nineteenth century the German citizens have been thrown in upon themselves and have been put on the
                    defensive about their origins: first, by a nativist movement of the 1850's expressed in the
                    Know Nothing party; again, seriously, during World War I; and finally, in a different way, during
                    World War II. Today, paradoxically, only a few years after a war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                        <country>West Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and the door is open wide to a friendly understanding of Germans wherever they live.
                    The present situation is precisely what the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation seeks to encourage
                    through a cultural, non-political approach to the problems of American-German <list type="footnotes">

                    the foundation during the past twenty-five years reveals its guiding policies in action.</p>
            <p>On June 12, 1930, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, seven men filed the certificate of incorporation of the Carl Schurz Memorial
                    Foundation with the intent of developing American-German friendship and promoting cultural exchange
                    between the two nations. The organization grew out of enthusiasm and funds supplied by more than one
                    hundred men whose thoughts were turned toward a memorial by the centenary celebration of the birth
                    of Carl Schurz, 1829-1906.</p>
            <p>Leadership and large gifts came from such men as Ferdinand Thun, industrialist, and his associates,
                    Gustav Oberlaender and Henry Janssen; George McAneny, attorney and political figure; Stephen Duggan,
                    of the Institute of International Education; and Paul M. Warburg, banker. A continuing element in
                    the character of the foundation emerges from an unofficial connection with the Society of Friends.
                    Wilbur K. Thomas brought to the direction of the foundation his experience in war relief with the
                    American Friends Service Committee. His successor as the foundation's executive director,
                    the late Howard W. Elkinton, also represented the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> approach to problems of international understanding. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> influence has meant that the foundation would act in a direct, personal way.</p>
            <p>The organization weathered the catastrophes of a great depression and a world war. This speaks well
                    for its strength and the character of its direction. If it had not been strong the depression would
                    have wiped it out; if it had indulged in chauvinism or irresponsible action the war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> would have closed its doors. Although the depression, the rise of the Nazis, and the
                    world war all impaired it functions, the foundation went steadily forward.</p>
            <p>From the outset the foundation administered several distinct funds. Notable among these were the
                    Oberlaender Trust of approximately a million dollars, the Henry Janssen Foundation, and the Thun
                    Foundation. These resources have been strengthened, of course, by additional gifts and
                    subscriptions.</p>
            <p>As a beginning the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation subsidized the trans-Atlantic exchange of students
                    and established scholars. Books as well as people crossed the <pb n="337" id="VAA4025-051-4-063"/>
                    Atlantic with foundation grants: for example, in 1936 sixty American libraries received German books
                    purchased out of foundation funds and ten German libraries were supplied with American scientific
                    journals and literary works.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">American-German Review</hi>, published bimonthly since 1938, first appeared in
                    September, 1934, as a quarterly presenting the work of the foundation to the public. Richly
                    illustrated, particularly in the field of art, it has always carried something in the German
                    language as well as articles in English. An important feature of this journal is the annual
                    publication of bibliography of Americana Germanica which began in 1941 under the guidance of A. E.
                    Zucker, as research director. At its home in the Old Customs House near Independence Hall in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> the foundation maintains a catalogue of more than 75,000 items for the assistance of
                    scholars working in American-German studies. The annual bibliography in the <hi rend="i">Review</hi>
                    serves to keep this catalog up-to-date.</p>
            <p>By exhibits at the Old Customs House or on tour, the foundation has endeavored to present German art
                    to the American public; perhaps the most comprehensive survey of German painting ever shown in this
                    country was brought to the <placeName>

            <p>Since the study of the German language had come under a frowning hostility in American schools and
                    colleges after 1917, the foundation sought to change this attitude. Encouraging the study of German
                    literature and the <hi rend="i">Muttersprache</hi> has been a steady aim to the foundation, which
                    has often made available to American libraries such works as the collected writings of Goethe.</p>
            <p>Not all of the foundation's projects have been so academic. Its grants have helped doctors,
                    social workers, city-planners, chemists, foresters, and many other people whose specialties could be
                    advanced by a period of residence and travel in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Gustav Oberlaender particularly favored <pb n="338" id="VAA4025-051-4-064"/> grants
                    which would lead Americans to become better acquainted with work being done by Germans of similar
                    interests. Occasionally, therefore, German specialists have been brought to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>: for example, Franz Heske, an authority on forestry. His book, <hi rend="i">German
                        Forestry</hi>, and the volume of Karl Dannecker, <hi rend="i">Forest Manager</hi>, were both
                    translated into English and published with subsidies from the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>As much as a fourth of the foundation's expenditures assisted refugees from the Nazi
                    régime. Many of these people came to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, where the foundations helped them to become established. Money and encouragement have

                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> since the end of the war, when conditions entirely new confronted American-German
                    relations. If heretofore the foundation had been primarily interested in cultural exchange, it now
                    began to meet some of the needs of a stunned and apathetic people. The American medical missions to <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and the Free University of Berlin are only two of many postwar projects partially
                    subsidized. Assistance with the restoration of the Goethe Haus rebuilt a national shrine in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Frankfurt</settlement>
                    </placeName>. A visiting artist program brought American musicians to a music-loving people. An
                    exhibit of American art showed the Germans what American painters were doing. As Ambassador James B.
                    Conant has pointed out, the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation could select objectives and move with
                    speed, unencumbered by the restrictions which often surround governmental action. The implications
                    of assistance rendered by private organization are worth noting; acting on its own initiative, an
                    American organization treated the Germans, recently enemies of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, as a civilized people with their own cultural institutions and monuments, and as a
                    people fully capable of reciprocity in a cultural exchange. Ten years of practice have made the
                    wisdom of this policy quite apparent, for the Germans have responded warmly to American interest.</p>
            <p>While reviewing the first quarter-century of the operations of the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation,
                    it is difficult to point out large, serious mistakes in policies or action. <list type="footnotes">

                    political issues, foundation publications might be charged with indifference toward them; however,
                    the very substantial assistance of half a million dollars given to refugees from the Nazi government
                    does not look like indifference on the part of the foundation. And certainly the foundation cannot
                    be charged with a lack of policy in the area of international relations. To say that its work is
                    simple and direct and personal, that it touches individual Germans and Americans, that it promotes
                    cultural exchange—this does not rob it of significance. After the expenditure of far less
                    money than the cost of one large bomber the foundation can point to an imposing list of activities
                    which have done nothing to harm, and most certainly have helped to create good relations with
                    Germans in Europe and a friendly awareness of German achievement within the United states.</p>

            <p>The reasons for which each town was established where it was and what conditions favored its growth
                    are significant aspects of local history. Most Indiana towns started as trading or exchange centers
                    for the people of their locality. Consequently, when most Hoosiers lived near the Whitewater, the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, most towns were located in those areas. A number, however, were established along
                    early routes partly to serve travelers, some near the crossing of rivers, others at convenient
                    distances between older and often larger settlements. In the early years when the <placeName>

                    having some local advantage, such as higher, better-drained land, or the presence of a tributary

            <p>The presence of potential waterpower was a significant influence in locating numerous grist, flour,

                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>

                    </placeName> was established in 1803 by immigrants who were attracted by the resemblance of the area

                    so fine a view that its promoters expected it to be the chief town of the county. But the fine view
                    did not compensate for relative inaccessibility by road and for inadequate water supply. Hence,
                    after an epidemic, Palestine lost the county seat and soon became a "ghost town."
                    Scenic features have, however, stimulated the growth of towns near the state parks, and Marengo

            <p>Numerous villages and towns grew up where early roads or railways crossed or converged. Most of the
                    towns which have grown into cities are served by more than one railway, and by several roads. Hence
                    conditions that conspicuously affected the location of roads and railways help to locate numerous
                    towns.</p>
            <p>Railway towns are necessarily located on railroads, most of which were planned to connect certain
                    cities, for example, <placeName>

                    considered desirable to have the town center well within a township rather than divided by township
                    lines. This was partly because most survey townships became units of civil government, including
                    units for schools and assessment for taxes.</p>
            <p>The numerous villages established on roads owe their location in a fundamental respect partly to the
                    location of the roads. When roads were first laid out, most were local, township, or county roads.
                    Except in the most rugged areas, a predominant percentage of their milage was along section lines,
                    or half-section lines of the federal land survey. Most streets of towns were also laid out with
                    respect to the federal land survey lines. Hence an understanding of the locations of Indiana towns
                    is augmented by knowledge of the land survey system. For all of the state except small areas at the
                    southeast (especially Clark's Grant) and southwest (the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                        <region type="county">Orange County</region>
                    </placeName>, from which the townships were surveyed and numbered northward and southward. The
                    north-south base line, called the principal meridian or the range line, is just east of Paoli. From
                    it the townships are numbered east and west.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> For example, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> is in Township 23 north, Range 4 west.</p>
            <p>More than half of the 92 county seat towns and cities of Indiana were planned as county capitals.
                    Many additional townsites were laid out in the hope of their being chosen as county seat, but when
                    another site was selected, most of them failed to develop. Centrality in the county was an important
                    factor as to county seats; repeatedly it was specified in the legislative act creating the new
                    county. Hence the location of the county boundaries helped locate many Indiana towns and cities.
                    Most of Indiana's counties are approximately 20 miles square. This size was popular when
                    most of the counties were established partly because it was possible for a taxpayer to travel from
                    the margin of a county of that size to a centrally located county seat and return the same day. This
                    would not have been feasible then from the margins of a notably larger county. Counties considerably

                    taxes collectable then from a notably smaller area would have been insufficient to pay the legally
                    prescribed salaries forthe various county officers. In those years local taxes were predominantly on
                    real estate, little of which had much value, as money was scarce. Moreover, there was a
                    constitutional provision against reducing existing counties below 400 square miles in area. Counties
                    were not much larger than 400 square miles also partly because of the active desire of the people of
                    each sizable area to have their own local county government and a nearby county seat.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    centrality, important considerations were relative quality of the land, the number of settlers,
                    local advantages such as water supply, and at least fair drainage. Important also in numerous cases
                    was an offer by the townsite owners to donate a suitable tract of land for the courthouse in case
                    that townsite was selected.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If with the growth of population a city not centrally located and not the county seat became
                    sufficiently large, the county capital was generally shifted thereto. Two striking examples are <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> getting the county seat from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1878, and <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>

                    </placeName> are on the margin of their county. In <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName>, the county seat has continued at centrally located <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crown Point</settlement>
                    </placeName> despite the fact that most of the county's people live in the northern part of
                    the county. The rivalry between <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>, <settlement type="city">East Chicago</settlement>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>

                    </placeName> has so far prevented the northward shift of the county seat. An example of the
                    relocation of a county seat to a more central location is afforded by <placeName>

                                    years. The new launch is 52 feet long, 12¢ feet beam, 4¢ feet
                                    draught &amp; 23 tons displacement. She steams 9 knots and is fitted with
                                    cabins, deck house etc, like a small tug boat—which she looks just like.
                                    For all that she is very light and built for smooth inland waters—like
                                    most launches. The problem was how to get her up to Ft. Wrangell<hi rend="sup">4</hi> 1500 miles distant. From Washington Territory (Puget Sound) the trip is

                                    insisted on towing (as much to save <hi rend="i">coal</hi> as anything.) Now I wish

                                    minutes as it was very thick. Suddenly our engines stopped. I jumped aft and found
                                    that one of the machinists had his arm jammed in the machinery. The blood was
                                    spurting and his groans were not very refreshing at this juncture for we fell off
                                    into the trough of the sea. We finally got him out and got him into the cabin into
                                    my bunk. I steamed up again and then got over the "drag" or
                                    "sea anchor"—we rode to it for a few moments, and then
                                    the cable parted.</p>
                        <p>The situation was critical. Here we were 350 miles from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, about 30 miles from land, and 200 miles from the <geogName>Columbia
                                        river</geogName>. If I used coal (and water) in "bucking" the
                                    sea to ride up to it, I might find myself short and adrift. I concluded that every
                                    risk must be taken to save coal and water. I there fore treated her as a wreck and
                                    let her drift. I found after a little while that she would lay to <hi rend="i">stern</hi> to the sea as her pilot house &amp; turtle back acted as sail, so I
                                    got up a tarpaulin abaft the pilot house, and laid her to <hi rend="i">stern</hi>
                                    foremost. This is considered the most perilous position for a vessel and Beecher
                                    &amp; the two seamen respectfully demurred. We had to take the chances, and she
                                    did remarkably well (We had no sails)</p>
                        <p>Then it did begin to blow. The seas were terrific. What saved us was that it rained
                                    so hard at times that the white "curlers" were beaten down now and
                                    then. What we had to fear was having the deck house swept off by a sea. It was
                                    really wonderful the way the great seas broke just <hi rend="i">ahead</hi> and just
                                        <hi rend="i">astern</hi> of us. One broke over us but it went clear over. I laid
                                    her to in such a position that we were set in towards the shore and on our course.
                                    You can believe that it was somewhat of a blow when the
                                    "Patterson" had her boats smashed, &amp; rolled her rails
                                    under, and when a four masted American ship, the "Ocean King",

                                    him in. I told him our condition. We were short of coal, out of fresh water through
                                    leakage in the tanks, and had an injured man who must have medical attendance. I

                                    Our condition was critical; I had been up for four days and nights, Beecher had had
                                    to stand a watch in the fire room as machinist with a seaman to shovel
                                    coal—Every one was about worn out, and I was not well balanced in my
                                    judgement about the bar. In fact I simply did not care. I had pulled through so much
                                    that I was reckless. No man in his right mind, <hi rend="i">knowing</hi> the bar
                                    (which I did not) would have dreamed of it. We stood in. The pilot boats have
                                    bulkheads on their deck houses of timbers 12 inches thick and are handled by the
                                    most expert, surfmen in the world. Over 180 lives were lost last year on the bar in
                                    small craft.</p>
                        <p>We went through the breakers for three miles heading obliquely across the bar from
                                    one side of the river clear to the other. As soon as we got in I saw we had no
                                    business there but I hung on. It was marvelous to see the way the pilot handled the
                                    tug (a vessel about 450 tons.) He had given me some pointers on it, and we did well
                                    for awhile. About half way across we caught one that knocked us down, went clear
                                    through the deck house, and left about 2 tons of water on board. Our young machinist
                                    (an American to be proud of) stayed right by his post and by a miracle got the
                                    engines to going again, and we moved ahead. Then came the prettiest piece of
                                    skillful seamanship I have ever seen. The pilot tug hovered us to windward, took the
                                    breaking of the seas for us, and nursed us the rest of the way over the bar.</p>

                                    strong that I had to retire immediately after dinner. I had smashed my thumb besides
                                    and that began to get in on me. Next day it was stormy. I went up to the tug office
                                    to pay pilotage and the owners laughed and said it was all right. I never felt so
                                    cheap in my life. All I could say to the tug Capt was "Thank you, you
                                    simply saved our lives, and I can only thank you for it." The Astoria
                                    papers gave us a little send off, and every one seemed to look on it that it was a
                                    great piece of cheek to tackle the bar in that weather. The
                                    "McArthur" left next morning and we followed her out over the bar
                                    as she had a pilot. It was smooth outside and we parted at the entrance. We had 213

                                    cheered us to the echo. We answered much to their surprise with 32 voices. I first
                                    asked permission to land the crew of the "Ocean King" and then we

                                    and my friends taken the matter up. So many wild statements have been made, that

                                    of May 8th—(during which my ship, a vessel of 2,500 tons

            <p>The Genealogy Department of the Indiana State Library is the depository for records covering hundreds
                    of graves in old cemeteries of the state. These records represent over the past two decades work
                    both of individuals and of organizations. For example, one of the early and enthusiastic workers
                    presented inscriptions gathered from thirty-five cemeteries in his county during one year and this
                    was only the beginning of the activity in that area. More recently, several local historians
                    co-operated by listing, in one volume, the names and dates of Hoosiers buried in thirty-nine
                    cemeteries of another county. In between these contributions have come others from every corner of
                    the state.</p>
            <p>This year the Genealogy Committee of the Indiana Historical Society is making a renewed effort to
                    collect various types of records which will supplement those which have been presented to the
                    Indiana State Library by groups of workers in past years. Among the lists of desiderata are cemetery
                    records which have not yet been collected. If there are those who have been planning to do this work
                    on their own initiative, it is hoped they will contact their county historian and inform him of
                    their plans. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Likewise county</region>
                    </placeName> historians have been encouraged to discover residents who are sufficiently interested
                    in carrying on the task of locating neglected cemeteries in order to copy the inscriptions before it
                    is too late.</p>
            <p>The late Harry O. Garman, a former chairman of the Committee on Pioneer Cemeteries and Churches said,
                    in his report made at the Indiana History Conference on December 14, 1940: "Since there are
                    more people in the ground than there are on top of the ground, we cannot expect to preserve all the
                    burial places, but we can collect the names and describe the burial places and file this information
                    … where it will be available to everyone as long as public institutions last."
                    For those who do make the effort to search these abandoned spots, there has been the suggestion that
                    a marker <list type="footnotes">

                    and where deposited would be a further step in preserving our heritage and commemorating the courage
                    of our pioneers.</p>
            <p>In every township of our ninety-two counties are found old burial grounds; some are in abandoned
                    church yards and others are in small family plots on farms. Many are full of weeds, briers, and
                    poison ivy with the headstones hidden in the underbrush. Others are badly eroded and the markers, if
                    still there, are partially covered with the soil or are broken into bits. Still other graves have
                    disappeared completely due to their being in the path of progress-buildings, new roads, or plowed
                    under for agricultural purposes.</p>
            <p>As described in the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                        </placeName> Genesis</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">1</hi>, there are several groups of historically minded
                    people in the state known as "tombstone hounds." A small group outfits itself with
                    small shovel; light crowbar; stiff brushes; mirror; light and dark powders; pumice stone; and, of
                    course, pad and pencil. More specific directions include these suggestions: "Rub the pumice
                    across almost obliterated letters and and you will be amazed at what will show. On light stones,
                    dark earth or dust sprayed over lettering and brushed with a flat object, will bring out the figures
                    and the reverse is true on very dark stones by using light powder or chalk. The mirror? To reflect
                    light rays onto stones to read, particularly in dark shaded places. One member writes and one checks
                    the writing while the others make the preparations." The work certainly progresses more
                    rapidly if it is done in small groups of two or three, with all collaborating in making a map to
                    accompany the records and in making the final copies in triplicate; local historical societies will
                    also appreciate copies of records made. However, lacking a team to do the work, much has been
                    accomplished by one lone worker.</p>
            <p>Sometimes only one person in a county can generate sufficient enthusiasm to accomplish whatever
                    remains to be done in gathering records-be it much or little. A news story in the local papers may
                    be the means of producing volunteer workers as well as information as to the location of old burial
                    grounds, especially the family plots known only to a few present-day descendants. A county atlas
                    published in the last century will often indicate the location of old churches <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In respect to efforts of various organizations and of individuals to locate only graves of specific
                    interest to them, it has been pointed out that it is undesirable to discriminate and to exclude any
                    graves from the record-the fathers and mothers because they are the ancestors while the children
                    help to identify the parents. To answer any further questions that may arise, it is wise to
                    transcribe all of the information available upon the headstones though it may be incomplete. Such is
                    the procedure the majority of loyal county workers have followed through the years.</p>

            <p>James Woodress has succeeded admirably at a difficult task: he has not only written the first
                    biography of Booth Tarkington but has written it justly and honestly while the literary reputation
                    of that fine gentleman from Indiana is still under the critical cloud that inevitably hovers over
                    the names of writers during the first decade or two after their deaths.</p>
            <p>The book will inspire a warm nostalgic pleasure in all readers of middle age and beyond, especially
                    if they are Hoosiers; for Woodress is not content with simply reporting the events of
                    Tarkington's life from his birth in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on July 29, 1869, to his death in that city on May 19, 1946; he also recreates vividly
                    the world in which the Hoosier novelist and playwright lived for seventy-seven years. The early
                    chapters, describing the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> of the 1870's and 1880's, Princeton University in the
                    1890's, and again <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where Tarkington returned for his apprenticeship at writing, are a masterpiece of
                    atmosphere produced from accurate detail.</p>
            <p>In those early chapters, perhaps, Woodress is not altogether convincing in his insistence upon the
                    ordeal of the apprenticeship. True, Tarkington devoted seven or eight years to the practice of his
                    craft and he was thirty before his first book was published. But few authors are published before
                    they are thirty; even fewer spend their years of learning in the ideal circumstances that Tarkington
                    enjoyed' (with an independent income inherited from his famous uncle, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Booth, and the love, understanding, and confidence in his talent of two very
                    intelligent parents and a devoted sister); and fewer still become famous overnight with their first
                    books, as Tarkington did with "The Gentleman from Indiana," and follow those
                    initial efforts with a succession of best-sellers. However, disappointment and frustration are as
                    painful to a sensitive spirit in physical <pb n="366" id="VAA4025-051-4-092"/> comfort and security
                    as they are in poverty, and the biographer's error here is one of faulty emphasis rather
                    than exaggeration.</p>
            <p>The story is slightly out of kilter at one other point. In his middle years, Tarkington was writing
                    too much and a great deal of his output was of inferior quality. Woodress seems somewhat embarrassed
                    by this fact and, to cover his embarrassment, devotes far too much space to a catalogue and analysis
                    of the ephemeral work of this period, thus obscuring his point that the labor itself was a miracle
                    of determination and courage on the part of the author, since this was the time when
                    Tarkington's sight was failing and he was undergoing numerous operations with what must
                    have seemed an almost certain prospect of blindness ahead of him.</p>
            <p>But these are only minor flaws in the light of the biographer's whole accomplishment. From
                    the book, the character and personality of Booth Tarkington—warm, generous, unaffected,
                    and yet always urbane,—emerge alive and understandable. Finishing the book, the reader
                    feels that he has lived for a time in the company of a great gentleman, who, in the perspective of
                    time, may ultimately be regarded not only as the great Hoosier novelist but as one of the major
                    artists of all American fiction.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Raiders</hi> is a historical novel and, as such, presents a problem of considerable
                    magnitude for a historian to review. The task is made more difficult since the narrative of <hi rend="i">The Raiders</hi> is based on the raid into southern Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> during the Civil War by General John Hunt Morgan and his Confederates—a raid
                    which has confounded historical accuracy because of its legacy of legends. Therefore, it would not
                    be fair to judge Professor Wilson's book according to standards expected of a scholarly
                    piece of historical writing; to do this would be extremely foolish and would distort the real intent
                    and purpose of the work. Consequently, comments here should be confined to what <hi rend="i">The
                        Raiders</hi> actually is: a highly entertaining, rapid-moving novel.</p>
            <pb n="367" id="VAA4025-051-4-093"/>
            <p>Being as it is a many-sided art form, the novel usually possesses a plot, shows good
                    characterization, reveals the imagination of the author, and presents a reasonable portrayal of
                    life. In particular, the historical novel should be accurate as to time and setting, be true and
                    life-like in regard to characters, and it should give a general impression of the historical reality
                    of the era. Has Wilson met these requirements in his latest novel? Has he transformed the formal
                    records of the past and the folklore of yesteryear into a credible portrayal of life and human
                    experience?</p>
            <p>The novel opens with Henry Clayburn, the mayor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crescent City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, observing during the gentle graying of the dawn the rebels from Dixie crossing the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> side. He knows that his city—a politically-divided river town disturbed by
                    the conflicting loyalties of the North and South—will soon be invaded. What should he do?
                    He fears a Copperhead uprising. He does not know how the townspeople—nor he, for that
                    matter—will react to the impending events of the day ahead. Will the Home Guards succumb
                    to panic after the first few volleys of shot have been fired? What does any man do when ominous
                    clouds of war darken his door? In <hi rend="i">The Raiders</hi>, Wilson points out that Clayburn
                    could not simply run home, lock the doors, and think that the danger of the moment would
                    pass—one, by wishful thinking, does not brush those clouds away and make a brighter day.
                    The invasion force gathers momentum! The portentous storm will soon rain its pellets of destruction
                    upon <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crescent City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Clayburn's home. His own family, like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crescent City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is caught in the web of conflict. His son by his deceased first wife is fighting with
                    the Union forces. His second wife and his son by her are sympathetic to the Confederate cause. Henry
                    Clayburn is a Democrat and believes in the preservation of the Union. In his determination to save
                    his city, will he respond immediately, heroically, and dramatically, or will he "act simply
                    upon the exigencies of each moment" (p. 35) as it approaches? Shouldering a gun and
                    fighting would be much simpler than thinking about the complexities of the day.</p>
            <p>As mayor of the city he meets with the council and arranges the details of defense. But after that,
                    what can he do except wait, wait, wait? Herein lies the author's secret—that is,
                    he creates a feeling of suspense and controlled excitement <pb n="368" id="VAA4025-051-4-094"/>
                    which envelops the reader. The raiders begin to encircle the town! Mayor Clayburn has just received
                    bad news and is engulfed with grief. His son, one of the Boys in Blue, has been killed by the
                    Confederates—Confederates like those who are capturing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crescent City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The victorious leader of the Dixie Dons, Colonel Stacey Morey, is a cousin of the
                    mayor's wife. While Colonel Morey is in command, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crescent City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, although extremely tense, is safe. There will be no loss of life and no great amount
                    of property destroyed. Colonel Stacey Morey, who leads this diversionary force into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crescent City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and so augments Morgan's drive into Hoosierdom, is shot. The tension is
                    relieved by the violent outbreak of a riot. The brutality of war unfolds before the eyes of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crescent City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The sons of the South begin to pillage and burn the mayor's city.</p>
            <p>Henry Clayburn perceives the course of action necessary for the liberation of his beleaguered city:
                    it is his responsibility to go for help. During the process of finding himself he frees from his
                    mind the false notion that man, on some occasions, will have to stand alone. As he prepares to slip
                    through the rebel line which surrounds the town and ride for military aid, he realizes that he is
                    not alone. Neither will he be alone when he begins to pick up the broken pieces amid the smoldering
                    embers. He and his people will salvage what is left of ravaged <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crescent City</settlement>
                    </placeName>—their home on the north bank of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>.</p>
            <p>This tautly woven narrative shows expert construction. It is extremely compact and is filled with
                    pulsating action. Some critics will argue that there is not enough characterization. There is,
                    nevertheless, an impressive study of character and human experience in the central
                    figure—Henry Clayburn grows in stature and dignity, and there are adequate descriptions
                    for most of the minor characters. The reader, perhaps, could criticize this novel because there are
                    not several minor conflicts or themes interwoven into the fabric of the main plot. But this
                    fast-moving work is, in many respects, an elongated short story; therefore, too many subordinate
                    lines of interest would not fit into the intended framework.</p>
            <p>The author is a novelist of undeniable skill: the work, from beginning to end, reveals his
                    imagination. Interspersed throughout there is romance and love, of both the romantic and scandalous
                    varieties; there is reflective thinking, including <pb n="369" id="VAA4025-051-4-095"/>
                    philosophical tidbits; there is a villain counterbalancing the hero; and there is the mentioning of
                    sex, but passion is restrained and is not offensive to good taste.</p>
            <p>The reader definitely gets an impression of the atmosphere and life of the times by the
                    author's accuracy in time and setting, by realistic descriptions of houses and dress, and
                    by the use of idiomatic language. Comic relief is attained by the witticisms of Goosehead, the Negro
                    janitor at the City Hall.</p>
            <p>Historians will recognize much of the Hoosier phase of Morgan's raid which Wilson has
                    incorporated in this book—so much so that some may wish that the author had definitely
                    located the fictitious <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crescent City</settlement>
                    </placeName> at a particular spot in southern Indiana instead of leaving the geographical location
                    somewhat indefinite. The novel indicates that the author is well acquainted with the Civil War along
                    the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. The historical background has been adequately reproduced for
                    the plot and story. But historians and critics should remember: the author's purpose was
                    not to record an episode in history but to study the reactions of a peace-loving and thoughtful man
                    in a moment of violence and action. This reviewer suggests that Professor Wilson admirably achieved
                    his objective.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">America Takes the Stage</hi> is an interesting exposition of the development of
                    romanticism in American drama and theater from 1750 to 1900. Since the prevailing spirit in a nation
                    to be conceived, born, and started on its vigorous way was essentially one of "restless
                    eagerness," as Moody indicates, and since the American dream of the freedom of opportunity
                    for each individual was often close to reality, it is not surprising that American drama and theater
                    reflected the spirit of a new age of hope and expectancy. Theater managers are in the business to
                    present popular fare before the eyes of an entranced public, and it was <pb n="370" id="VAA4025-051-4-096"/> only common sense that dictated that this predominant spirit and
                    interest should be encouraged from the stage.</p>
            <p>Moody recognizes these important considerations in the one hundred and fifty years of American drama
                    which he covers in his work. At times, it is true, the author overemphasizes a pervading romanticism
                    in all aspects of national life in order to reenforce his thesis that the romantic was the
                    compelling motivation in all American drama and theater. There is no question but that economic
                    depressions and the aftermath of war brought people into closer contact with a realism which was not
                    always part of the idealism of the growing nation, but, as Moody points out, the drama and the
                    theater, except in a few instances, did not recognize the reality or else touched on it only
                    superficially. By the end of the nineteenth century, there was an increasing desire to bring about
                    changes and reformation, but the results of such evolution are not within the scope of <hi rend="i">America Takes the Stage</hi>.</p>
            <p>The chief emphasis in Moody's book lies in the section concerned with "Native
                    Themes and Characters," in which there are discussions of Negro minstrelsy, the Negro, the
                    Indian, the Yankee, the wars, the frontier and the folk. These subjects are related to the plays of
                    the nineteenth century in so far as they are used as plot, character, and idea material. Moody has
                    carefully avoided repetition in his treatment of his subject matter, however, and the editing of a
                    vast amount of factual material is well done. Some of the conclusions to be drawn from the facts are
                    not so completely developed as they might be. Since Moody is attempting to present so large a canvas
                    and the editing is obviously necessary, there are several instances where the focus is blurred. For
                    example, John Bernard, who wrote <hi rend="i">Retrospections of America, 1797-1811</hi> (1887), and
                    whom Moody uses as reference, has some rather penetrating observations to make concerning the
                    Yankee, dividing him into three species: the swapper, the jobber, and the peddler. Although Moody is
                    concerned primarily with the stage creations of the various native characters, he at times might
                    have made more clear the relationship between the actual American types and their representations on
                    the stage.</p>
            <p>A number of histories of American drama and theater have included much of the material to be found in
                    Moody's <pb n="371" id="VAA4025-051-4-097"/> book, but in the standard reference works of
                    the past many important plays are ignored or given slight treatment. The contribution made by <hi rend="i">America Takes the Stage</hi> is that the scattered references have been gathered
                    together into a comprehensive whole. In addition to this cohesion, there is a sense of dramatic
                    development which attracts and holds the interest of the reader. The section concerning the various
                    wars in which the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was involved during the nineteenth century and the plays which evolved as the result of
                    those conflicts furnishes the best of the new material on American drama.</p>
            <p>Chapter III on "Romanticism in Acting and in the Traditional Drama" is the weakest
                    section of the book. The author does not discuss the romantic mode of acting as much as he might,
                    and therefore treats it superficially, being more interested in discussing the romantic plays in
                    which famous actors appeared rather than acting techniques.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">America Takes the Stage</hi> is, in spite of a certain unevenness in its emphasis on
                    various aspects of nineteenth century American drama and theater, an important addition to the
                    increasing library on the subject. Written with obvious enthusiasm for the material and injected
                    with an obvious eagerness to bring to life another time and people, the book has a fascinating
                    appeal and makes clearly evident the kind of theater which attracted a majority of those who
                    professed to be part of a romantic and revolutionary experiment among the nations of the world.</p>

            <p>The above selections are tokens of the continuing fecundity of denominational historians. They also
                    attest to the fact that widely different amounts of imagination, understanding, and literary
                    craftsmanship go into the writing of religious history. Least satisfactory of the trio is
                    Moseley's <hi rend="i">Disciples of Christ in <placeName>

               </hi>. The book does justice neither to a passable subject nor to the
                    author's exhaustive research. Dates, places, thumb-nail biographies, anecdotes, and
                    statistics are marshaled in almost encyclopedic fashion on the apparent conviction that once
                    assembled they will automatically relate the story of the Disciples in the Empire State of the
                    South. Such rigid annalism is guaranteed to convey few durable impressions. The principal ones
                    gleaned by the reviewer are: since its origins in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, the
                    denomination has experienced a fitful growth in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, numbering less than 30,000 members in 1949; the advances of the Disciples have been
                    achieved in the face of considerable opposition from older Protestant churches; and controversies
                    over theology, church polity, and the use of musical instruments in worship have persistently
                    disturbed the internal harmony of the sect. Moseley leaves hanging a number of tantalizing questions
                    which, had he tried to answer, would have relieved the bleak monotony of this book. One vainly
                    wonders why the Disciples failed to duplicate in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> the successes they achieved in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Indiana or what explains the denomination's small and constantly
                    diminishing popularity among the Negroes. The appeal of the work might have been further widened by
                    close examination of the attitudes and activity of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> membership in the fields of pacificism, temperance, public education, racial relations,
                    and numerous other areas that traditionally have interested Protestants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Tinkling Spring</hi> deserves to be commended as one of the better examples of the
                    writing of local history. Notwithstanding occasional lapses into apologetics and repetition, Wilson,
                    the current pastor of the Tinkling Spring congregation, has manufactured a lively account of a
                    church now in the third century of its existence. Located a few miles south of
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Staunton</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, on U. S. Highway 11, the church descends <pb n="373" id="VAA4025-051-4-099"/> from the stern Presbyterianism of the Scots-Irish who poured into the
                    trough between the <geogName>Blue Ridge</geogName> and Alleghenies before the American Revolution. A
                    resume of the early membership at Tinkling Spring (Lewis, Logan, Breckenridge, Preston, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, etc.) reads like a beadroll of the families who importantly shaped frontier history in
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Basin as well as in the <geogName>Great Valley</geogName>. Wilson, however, has not
                    rested with listing prominent names. From an evident awareness that the world has influenced the
                    church as well as being influenced by it, he sketches developments at Tinkling Spring against the
                    evolving background of politics and society in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. That much of this background material is a rehash of the familiar or that less than a
                    quarter of the text is given to the period after the Civil War does not fatally detract from a
                    surprisingly entertaining book.</p>
            <p>The most ambitious contribution to the literature of religious history is William West's
                    account of Barton W. Stone. Stone, even before the appearance of this new study, had been accepted
                    as a significant figure in nineteenth century American Protestantism. Born and schooled on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>-Carolina frontier, he was caught up in the tide of migration to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> near the end of the eighteenth century. Following his ordination to the Presbyterian
                    ministry in 1797, he took pastoral charge of the congregation at <geogName>Cane Ridge</geogName> and
                    had an important part in the celebrated revival which centered there a few years later.
                    Stone's experiences in the Great Revival triggered a predisposition against the creedal
                    formalism of the Presbyterians and in 1804 he renounced his connection with that denomination.
                    During the next forty years Stone's preaching, organization of "New
                    Light" churches, and editorship of the <hi rend="i">Christian Messenger</hi> brought him
                    increasing renown. He is counted among the founders of both the Disciples of Christ and the churches
                    which, before their union with the Congregationalists in 1931, were affiliated under the title of
                    the American Christian Convention. West's book meets the academic requirements for a
                    biography. The scattered though scanty manuscript and printed materials bearing on Stone have been
                    thoroughly exploited; the influences molding Stone's career are painstakingly traced; and
                    the narrative moves with restrained objectivity. However, West has attempted not only a balanced <pb n="374" id="VAA4025-051-4-100"/> life of his subject but an emphatic presentation of the ideas
                    of Stone which seem to have especial meaning for Protestant churchmen today. Evidently a partisan of
                    the present ecumenical trend in American Protestantism, the clerical author sees Stone as a sort of
                    John the Baptist of the movement toward unity. "The thesis of this book," reads a
                    prefatory statement, "is that Stone has… been neglected by… American
                    Church historians… as a significant forerunner of the ecumenical movement" (p.
                    ix). West's able volume ought to put an end to the neglect of which he complains. It
                    convincingly reveals Stone in the novel role of a prophet who made the union of American Protestants
                    "the polar star" of his mature thought and endeavor.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Minneapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, has collected books, maps, and manuscripts for more than thirty years that relate to
                    the history of discovery and exploration. He has collected purposefully, wisely, with discrimination
                    and unflagging enthusiasm. The results of his devoted efforts are truly imposing and can be seen in
                    the Bell Room of the University of <placeName>
                        <country reg="mnu">Minnesota</country>

                        <country reg="mnu">Minnesota</country>
                    </placeName> and a public-minded man who wishes to share his books with the world of scholarship,
                    Bell has given his collection to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The dedication in October, 1953, of the library quarters to house his collection

                    collectors by men with a personal knowledge of the subject.</p>
            <p>The essay of Theodore C. Blegen, dean of the graduate school of the University of <placeName>
                        <country reg="mnu">Minnesota</country>
                    </placeName>, is an appropriate introduction to the title given the volume. Blegen duly emphasized
                    the importance of books, the necessity of scholars to have access to them and described the scope
                    and richness of the collection. His essay not only contains a thumbnail sketch of Bell but a
                    tasteful bow of appreciation toward <pb n="375" id="VAA4025-051-4-101"/> Bell's generosity
                    as well as that of other famous collectors who gave collections to public institutions.</p>
            <p>Bell fittingly titled his essay "Bound Fragments of Time." The motive which led him
                    to become a collector of books dealing largely with "trade" is simply stated:
                    "man's insatiable appetite for experience. He wishes to live not only his own life
                    but the lives of many other men as well, especially the lives of men whose preoccupations are
                    similar to his own" (p. 25).</p>
            <p>Stanley Pargellis, librarian of the Newberry Library, considered the always tantalizing topic,
                    "Rare Books and the Scholar." He defined a rare book as one which is important, is
                    in demand, and scarce. Admonition was passed on to those investigators who do not concern themselves
                    with primary source material: "No scholar worth his salt but goes to the original document,
                    in manuscript or in print" (p. 38).</p>
            <p>Colton Storm, who directs the Western Reserve Historical Society, discussed the "Specialized
                    Collection." Co-operation is called for when such a collection is placed in a public
                    institution. It then becomes the duty of all collectors, book dealers, and librarians to co-operate
                    one with the other in making such a collection the best of its kind.</p>
            <p>Louis B. Wright, the director of the Folger Shakespeare Library, wrote of "American Book
                    Collectors." He pointed out the contributions great book collectors of the past have made
                    to the cultural development of the nation by assembling collections of importance and making them
                    available for public use. Wright used Henry E. Huntington and Henry Clay Folger as exemplars of
                    collectors who have made such contributions.</p>
            <p>As befits a memento of the Bell Collection, the book is pleasing in format, well printed, and
                    handsomely bound. The colophon informs us that it was designed by Jane McCarthy, printed at the Lund
                    press, and bound at the A. J. Wahl Company.</p>

            <p>A persistent question in American history has been how to draw the boundaries between state and
                    national powers <pb n="376" id="VAA4025-051-4-102"/> within a complex federal system so as to
                    provide essential operations of government while protecting the liberties of the people. Both past
                    and present generations have debated the issues with much vigor. Disagreement concerning the nature
                    of the Union led to civil war in the nineteenth century. During the twentieth century the imposing
                    growth of the national government has been deplored or defended by political, industrial, labor, and
                    educational leaders.</p>
            <p>Shortly after he took office, President Eisenhower, proceeding on the theory that some suspicious
                    changes had occurred in the previous twenty years, urged an extensive study of constitutional and
                    administrative aspects of the problem. Congress responded with a law establishing the Commission on
                    Intergovernmental Relations. That body, minus its originally appointed, crusading chairman, Clarence
                    Manion, submitted its report in June, 1955. Few recommendations for major reallocations of functions
                    were made, although the emphasis of the document was clearly favorable to increased activity by the
                    states.</p>
            <p>One member of the commission has written a book, <hi rend="i">The Nation and the States</hi>,
                    designed to inform the public about the background and present position of intergovernmental
                    relations. He is William Anderson, professor of political science at the University of <placeName>
                        <country reg="mnu">Minnesota</country>
                    </placeName>, a long-time specialist in this field. Professor Anderson cautions the reader that his
                    suggestions for "constructive action" are his own and not those of the commission.
                    When this volume and the official report are compared, the differences are obvious. In fact,
                    Professor Anderson probably preferred the former as a vehicle for expressing his views, since he
                    attached few dissents to the report itself.</p>
            <p>The author skillfully surveys the principal functions of the national government, of the forty-eight
                    states, and of the more than 100,000 local units in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> (counties, cities, villages, towns, school districts, etc.). He shows that state and
                    local governments are far from becoming merely "administrative districts" and
                    indeed that they are expanding their operations instead of being choked off by a national leviathan.
                    A particularly valuable part of the book describes several of the fifty-two grants-in-aid programs
                    which have disturbed those persons, including many Hoosiers, who fear undue consolidation of power.
                    Professor Anderson believes that such undertakings as social security, highway construction, <pb n="377" id="VAA4025-051-4-103"/> and vocational education have been in the <hi rend="i">national</hi> interest and are national problems. But the states, acting as partners instead of
                    rivals of the nation, have also played an important role in formulating as well as executing these
                    policies. Furthermore, state administrative standards have been decidedly improved.</p>
            <p>Some attention is paid to the constitutional history which affords perspective on these matters. The
                    Union formed by the founding fathers is an indestructible one composed of indestructible states, as
                    Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase later said in <hi rend="i">

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1787 are explored, but the chief intent, in Professor Anderson's opinion,
                    was not to bind the nation to an inflexible Constitution, a "lawyers'
                    document." "Later framers"—the term is
                    interesting—inherited a practical instrument, adjustable and usable. This portion of <hi rend="i">The Nation and the States</hi> is not so satisfying to the historian interested in
                    details. Very little is said, for example, about the shifting spheres of national and state powers
                    over interstate commerce through the years. To explain the taxing-spending authority, the important
                    case of <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>

                    </hi> (1936) and an opposite line of Supreme Court decisions should have been developed more fully.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Professor Anderson accomplishes his main purpose: to lay the fundamentals of the record
                    before the lay reader, not the scholar. He concludes that the general outline of the present system
                    should be retained, that cries for "returning" powers to the states should be
                    critically examined, and that the states themselves can do much to improve conditions by modernizing
                    their own constitutions and by giving local units the self-government which states'
                    righters frequently preach but do not practice.</p>

            <p>This will be a welcome volume to all students of the Carolinian frontier in the eighteenth century

                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and a man of considerable wealth gained in large part in the Indian trade. The
                    author's scholarly and full introduction and his numerous footnotes present
                    Atkin's <hi rend="i">Report</hi> and <hi rend="i">Plan</hi> in excellent setting. His
                    research has taken him to <placeName>

                    beautifully designed volume. It is the type of book which one expects a university press to publish.</p>
            <p>Atkin was sorely troubled by the confusion, selfish rivalries, and the lack of understanding,
                    statesmanship, and patriotism among both colonial and imperial leaders of the 1740's and
                    1750's, and so he poured out his heart and soul in trying to present to the powerful Board
                    of Trade a report describing in detail the important Indian tribes on the Carolinian and
                    Georgia's frontiers and their relations to French and English traders. These men often had
                    their eyes only upon immediate profit, and, at times, sold war goods even to the enemy. His <hi rend="i">Report</hi>, antedating by twenty years James Adair's famous book, <hi rend="i">History of the American Indians</hi>, published in 1775, is a valuable source of
                    information on the southern Indian tribes and British and French policies toward them.</p>
            <p>In his <hi rend="i">Plan</hi> Atkin urged the creation of a northern and a southern district with <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> as boundaries and separated by the <geogName>Tennessee River</geogName>. Each was to
                    have an imperial superintendent of Indian affairs with ample funds for forts, agents, interpreters,
                    gunsmiths, and missionaries, and power to control land purchases and Indian traders so that justice
                    would be done to the Indians and hence their friendship secured.</p>
            <p>The 1750's was a period in English history similar to the early years of the two recent
                    world wars. In all three cases it was a war of "John Bull the Unready" under weak
                    leadership until a Pitt, Lloyd George, or a Churchill emerged. Till then, Britain was losing battle
                    after battle. As in World War II American leaders followed a policy of "Europe
                    first" and denied the Pacific theater the men and supplies it needed, so in the
                    1750's British leaders favored the northern district and denied the southern district money
                    and supplies. <pb n="379" id="VAA4025-051-4-105"/> Quebec's capture was considered more
                    important than that of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It is in this setting that one must consider Atkin's record as superintendent
                    and his <hi rend="i">Report</hi> and <hi rend="i">Plan</hi>.</p>
            <p>The Board of Trade followed the major principles of Atkin's <hi rend="i">Plan</hi> and
                    appointed Sir William Johnson superintendent of the northern district and Atkin of the southern
                    district. The former was supported by General Loudoun with goods and money, whereas Atkin was given
                    but meager supplies. Atkin, unlike Johnson, could not get the co-operation of British military
                    leaders, colonial governors, and Indian chiefs, nor could he get along with Johnson and his chief
                    deputy, George Croghan. Atkin served from 1756 to 1761. Jacobs concludes that Atkin was unfitted for
                    his post, but that conditions in the southern district were so different from those in the northern
                    district that not even a strong man could have succeeded to the extent that Sir William Johnson did.
                    Atkin's statesmanlike plan for the management of Indian affairs, however, like
                    Johnson's policies, had much influence on Indian affairs, both during his lifetime and in
                    the decades that followed. This imperial plan met with but little favor and much opposition in the
                    thirteen colonies. As a result, bloody Indian wars accompanied the westward movement of the pioneer
                    frontier all along the way from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jamestown</settlement>

                    </placeName>. It became, however, the basis of Indian policy in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, and its beneficent results enabled the white man to advance across this country
                    without costly wars.</p>

                    is told. The previous volumes in the series were concerned with combat activities in the several
                    theaters of operations from Pearl Harbor to Nagasaki. <hi rend="i">Men and Planes</hi>, as the
                    subtitle of this volume is designated, is concerned with the considerable number and variety of
                    activities that must be successfully accomplished before a plane can be airborne in combat.</p>
            <pb n="380" id="VAA4025-051-4-106"/>
            <p>As in the series heretofore, <hi rend="i">Men and Planes</hi> likewise represents the research
                    efforts of several reputable scholars. In this instance there are six. In the first section,
                    "The Organization and Its Responsibilities," William A. Goss presents the impact
                    of the airplane on the makeup of military forces in World War II, the origins and organization of
                    the AAF, and the evolution that resulted from wartime lessons. Goss, P. Alan Bliss, and Frank
                    Futrell describe air defense of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and to some extent the hemisphere. These interesting chapters should be made available
                    in pamphlet form for present day civil defense and other volunteer workers to give them a broader
                    understanding and appreciation of the role which they play today.</p>
            <p>The second division of this volume, "Equipment and Services," was written by Alfred
                    Goldberg. It is concerned with the development, production, allocation, and servicing of equipment,
                    and of the unprecedented collaboration of science, industry, and the military which made this
                    possible for the AAF. The unparalleled pressure of the war years forced greater attention to
                    research and development which pushed the ultimate limits of performance far beyond "even
                    the wildest flight of the imagination." This was especially true in efforts to develop an
                    intercontinental bomber, jet propulsion, and guided missiles, all commanding a considerable share of
                    consideration since the end of World War II as well. This is to say nothing of atomic energy and all
                    its allied ramifications.</p>
            <p>The third part of the volume, "Recruitment and Training," is the work of Arthur R.
                    Kooker and Thomas H. Greer. The eight chapters detail this phase of the AAF program considerably.
                    "The superior qualities of a given aircraft may be more than offset by the inferior skill
                    of the man who flies it" (p. 427); so a good argument can be given that the training
                    program was the greatest achievement of the stateside effort. Recruiting was not confined to the
                    hundreds of thousands needed to fill the quotas of flying and technical training schools because the
                    AAF became, principally in air depots, one of the largest of wartime users of civilian labor. Some
                    appreciation of the size of the personnel problem can be grasped when it is realized that during the
                    war four technical specialists were required for every man who flew; there were nearly seven ground
                    personnel to one flying; and sixteen individuals served in noncombattant assignments to every man
                    committed to air combat. In addition there were several thousand foreign nationals who were given
                    instruction of various sorts with the AAF.</p>
            <pb n="381" id="VAA4025-051-4-107"/>
            <p>The value of <hi rend="i">Men and Planes</hi> needs to be assessed as a unit in itself and as a
                    volume of the series. It contains new aspects which enhance its usefulness, such as the numerous
                    helpful charts that visualize statistics, and an appendix of "AAF Staff and Command
                    Assignments, June 1941 - August 1945." In a way more apparent than in earlier volumes, it
                    becomes editorial to the point of sacrificing some of its unusual objectivity. At times, Chapter X,
                    for example, it becomes entirely too statistical. This reviewer will forgive the apparent derogation
                    of a lawyer, an executive, a politician, a public relations counselor, "or just a college

            <p>Joseph and Estelle Bayliss offer the present volume as an expression of their love for the region and
                    river with which most of their lives have been identified. They note in the preface that their
                    collaborator, Milo M. Quaife, has done the sixteen chapters of Part 1, a general historical
                    narrative, while they have been principally responsible for the seven chapters comprising Part 2,
                    entitled "Local History with Recollections of Persons, Places, and Events."</p>
            <p>Quaife, the dean of middle western historians, writes with that change of pace which Professor R. C.
                    Buley found so delightful in the former's <hi rend="i">

                    whole chapter entitled "The Perfect Crime." Furthermore, in his discussion of the
                    international boundary dispute involving the <geogName>St. Marys River</geogName>, Quaife presents
                    information neglected by many authors of textbooks on American diplomatic history, Julius W. Pratt

            <p>Mr. and Mrs. Bayliss are uniquely qualified to write the local history of the area. Bayliss came to
                    Sault Ste. Marie in 1878. He has been a pilot on the <geogName>St. Marys River</geogName>, a
                    prospector in the Klondike gold rush of 1898, a mailman, a sheriff, a state legislator, and has
                    engaged in other pursuits. While being a jack-of-all-trades, his interest in county and state
                    history has been constant. He is an honorary life member of the Algonquin Club of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The grandfather of Mrs. Bayliss was one of the earliest settlers on <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>'s Island and her father was a Great Lakes ship captain. She has been a school
                    teacher and collaborator with her husband in historical writing. Their knowledge of the islands of
                    the <geogName>St. Marys River</geogName> and their acquaintance with the people and events of the
                    past sixty years are indeed remarkable. The historians dwell on such personages as Jean Baptiste
                    Cadotte, John Askin, Alexander Henry, John Johnston, Henry R. School-craft, and Bishop Frederick
                    Baraga. Mr. and Mrs. Bayliss give recognition as well to lesser publicized figures such as Peter B.
                    Barbeau, General Hugh Brady, Samuel Ashmun, Francis H. Clergue, and James W. Curran.</p>
            <p>Mr. and Mrs. Bayliss state in the preface that the publication of the volume has been timed to
                    coincide with the centennial celebrations of the completion of the State Canal and Lock which
                    brought many visitors to Sault Ste. Marie in the summer of 1955. Many persons probably have never
                    heard of any lock besides the one built by Charles T. Harvey. As a matter of fact, the twenty-foot
                    rapids had originally been by-passed on the Canadian side by a small canal and lock constructed in
                    the late 1790's to facilitate the activities of the North West Company and had been
                    partially destroyed by the Americans during the War of 1812. Chapter XII is concerned largely with
                    the so-called Harvey Lock but calls attention to the later ones, viz. the Weitzel, Poe, Davis,
                    Sabin, and McArthur locks.</p>
            <p>The reviewer would not be so brash as to take issue with Quaife in the field of his specialization or
                    to quibble with Mr. and Mrs. Bayliss regarding the first name of the judge who served at the
                    Canadian Sault from 1907 to 1911. He does consider the brief reference to the famous senatorial
                    contest of 1918 misleading (p. 298). Although Henry Ford made a gesture toward securing the
                    Republican nomination in the open primary, he ran at the request of President Wilson. As the
                    Democratic nominee he lost by a narrow margin to Truman H. Newberry, thereby giving the Republicans
                    a bare majority in the United States Senate.</p>

            <p>In addition to its intrinsic historical value the book will be a delight to those interested in
                    bookmaking. It is set in Baskerville and Eden types, printed on Garamond antique paper, and bound in
                    Holliston Roxite with linen finish. It will be particularly appreciated by those readers who enjoyed

                    historical studies. Happily, <hi rend="i">The Battle Cry of Freedom</hi> does not belong in that
                    category. Professor Johnson of Harris Teachers College, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was probing source materials long before the centennial of the Kansas-Nebraska Act.
                    The chances are that he would have brought out his volume at about this time with or without
                    anniversaries to celebrate.</p>

                    find <hi rend="i">The Battle Cry of Freedom</hi> helpful and even stimulating. Virtually throughout
                    his pages, Johnson's style does him credit; some of the duller incidents test his
                    sprightliness, and he successfully meets the challenge. Attention is centered primarily on the <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> Emigrant Aid Company, its origins, influence, membership, methods, and particularly its
                    leaders. But other groups, communities, and individual settlers, having little or no direct
                    connection with Amos A. Lawrence or Eli Thayer, are included in the picture. Since the author is
                    concerned with the <placeName>

                    </placeName> "crusade" as a whole, as well as with the N.E.E.A.C., he is warranted
                    in extending his canvas and in painting a mural rather than a miniature. For this decision, and for
                    a large part of the execution, students of history will be grateful.</p>

                    </placeName> businessmen give variety of pace and tempo. Johnson is basically a scholar, disinclined
                    to sacrifice detail for the sake of drama. Therefore one finds pedestrian passages which the general
                    reader may decide to slight. But the author has an eye for color, too, capitalizing on the many <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> crises to gain and hold the reader's attention. You are in for some

                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> specialists will be interested in learning that Professor Johnson is aware of, but not
                    usually in accord with, the views of the late Frank H. Hodder on some highly important points. James
                    C. Malin of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> has looked askance at the assertion that arms were furnished northerners in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> by individuals and not by the company. This is "a distinction without a
                    difference," said Professor Malin; Johnson agrees, but finds it impossible to go along with
                    the Malin thesis that it was also "a contemptible pretense." On p. 128, Johnson
                    says: "A man like Amos A. Lawrence would not stoop to pretense. He and his associates
                    believed honestly that they were entirely free to do as individuals things that would have been
                    grossly improper in an organization like the Emigrant Aid Company." The reviewer, in this
                    regard, subscribes to the Malin interpretation. On p. 299, Johnson himself concludes that the
                    company "armed the free-state settlers," which in fact it did—albeit by
                    indirection.</p>
            <p>The tone of the book as a whole is friendly to the antislavery cause, the company, and especially its
                    guiding spirit. Nevertheless, the Johnson work contains numerous and striking examples of
                    objectivity. From a bookmaking standpoint, there are also many things in its favor. The notes are in
                    the back, but a degree of compensation is provided by a clear listing of pages to which the notes
                    refer. The index is excellent; very infrequently, names of minor men are omitted. If General P. F.
                    Smith did not happen to spell his first <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-051-4-111"/> name
                    "Percifer," exceptions to the rule of almost faultless technical accuracy are rare
                    indeed.</p>
            <p>Johnson has taken into consideration many dozens of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> sources—manuscript letters, account books, articles, and monographs, in
                    addition to book-length treatments of principal topics. The documentation is painstaking, the most
                    extreme example being p. 184 with its six note references in twelve lines of narrative. The fact
                    that this passage refers to John Brown's connection with Amos A. Lawrence and the company
                    justifies the extra effort to nail down each statement.</p>

                    </placeName> fact and legend continue to arouse intellectual curiosity. Johnson comes to grips with
                    several of the most provocative issues in his final chapter and elsewhere. Aside from turning in a
                    most commendable job on the company's institutional history, he has dared to take a stand
                    on many a controversial subject. Disagree as they may with some opinions expressed in <hi rend="i">The Battle Cry of Freedom</hi>, fair-minded critics will admire Johnson's book on many
                    counts and will rate it one of the best recent additions to the expanding shelves of <placeName>

            <p>His thesis is that the Know Nothings were the essential factor in explaining Republican victory in
                    1860. He cites detailed election data to buttress his thesis. Those who have supported the
                    proposition that the Germans added the element of victory in 1860 will find it hard to accept <placeName>

               <hi rend="i">Spring Mill: <geogName>Hidden Valley</geogName> Village</hi>. By Norman C. Evans. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Published by the author, 1953, pp. 148. Illustrations. $2.50.)</head>
            <p>Evans has written approximately 150 pages about the history and traditions of Spring Mill. His book
                    is an interesting reminder of pioneer ways and it serves to inform Hoosiers that Spring Mill State
                    Park is a particularly appropriate place to preserve and add memorials concerning pioneer life.
                    Unfortunately the sources for quotations are not generally indicated and at times it appears that
                    statements used are those appropriate to the situations described. Nevertheless, Evans has
                    recaptured much of the atmosphere of pioneering and the numerous visitors to the park today would
                    generally have an increased appreciation of the history, traditions, flora and fauna, as well as the
                    natural setting of this site, if they would read this little volume.</p>
