                    FIRST LINES
                    Ah love, the sweet spring blossoms cling 1
                    Why am I singing all alone 2
                    My sweetheart lays her hand in mine 3
                    Below the rocks where the samphire blows 4
                    She comes through the meadow yonder 5
                    Amid a crown of radiant hills 6
                    In yonder bay the waves find rest 8
                    In the first light of the morning 9
                    When first I saw your face, love 10
                    I am wanting to send you a song, love 11
                    If I were in the valley?land 12
                    The birds sang from the tree 13
                    Love my heart is aching, aching 15
                    Violets, sweet violets 16
                    In the distant woods are blowing 17
                    
                    The golden gorse and the heather 18
                    Why seems the world so fair 20
                    Winds blow cold in the bright March weather 21
                    What song shall I sing to you 23
                    Out on the moor the sun is bright 25
                    Little maiden are you lonely 26
                    The snow queen passed our way last night 27
                    How gently this evening the ripples break 28
                    Cold, quite cold, I could only see 30
                    The hours of the day have departed 32
                    Listen and we shall hear the voice 33
                    I have been wandering to?day 34
                    Give me thy hand dear friend, and let me take thee 36
                    And art thou come again, Oh Night 37
                    Oh, what know they of harbours, by E. R. 39
                    November with mysterious feet 40
                    When you are lonely, full of care 41
                    The tender touch of a gentle hand 42
                    We wandered in that shadow?land 44
                    The clouds have gathered soon to?night 45
                    
                    Are your grave eyes graver growing? 47
                    The town is very gay to?day 49
                    The March wind rises through the skies 50
                    The skies are blue 51
                    I saw your portrait, yesterday 52
                    Though I may rest in some leafy place 54
                    There is no unawakened string 55
                    Last night again we saw him there 56
                    The ladies bow, and partners set 58
                    A flash of colour through the trees 61
                    All day I read your book; at eve 63
                
            
        
        
            
            
                SPRING?SONG
                
                    AH love, the sweet spring blossoms cling
                    To many a broken wind?tossed bough,
                    And young birds among branches sing
                    That mutely hung till now.
                
                
                    The little new?born things which lie
                    In dewy meadows, sleep and dream
                    Beside the brook that twinkles by
                    To some great lonely stream.
                
                
                    And children, now the day is told,
                    From many a warm and cosy nest,
                    Look up to see the young moon hold
                    The old moon to her breast.
                
                
                    Dear love, my pulses throb and start
                    To?night with longings sweet and new,
                    And young hopes beat within a heart
                    Grown old in loving you.
                
            
            
            
                SONG
                
                    WHY am I singing all alone,
                    Outside your window here?
                    Because the roses are all blown,
                    And all the sky is clear.
                
                
                    Because the glen I passed was fair,
                    And fresh with morning dew,
                    Because the gold shines in your hair,
                    Because your eyes are blue.
                
                
                    Because for many a sunny mile
                    The hills stretch out, and furled
                    Is every cloud: because God’s smile
                    Is shining through the world.
                
            
            
            
                MY SWEETHEART
                
                    MY sweetheart lays her hand in mine
                    When she would have me glad,
                    She sings and sings, she never knows
                    What music makes me sad.
                
                
                    My sweetheart holds my heart to hers
                    When she would have me rest,
                    She never hears the heavy sigh
                    Which breaks within my breast.
                
                
                    Her sweet lips press my tired lids
                    When she would have me sleep;
                    Alas, they have no power to stay
                    The burning tears I weep.
                
            
            
            
                SONG
                
                    BELOW the rocks where the samphire blows,
                    The pebbled beach in an inlet shows
                    A quiet cave, where a green fern grows
                    By the summer sea.
                
                
                    ’Twould cheer and brighten my home alway,
                    But fades if far from the fresh sea spray,
                    It could not live for a single day
                    In the town with me.
                
                
                    Below the hill where the heather lies,
                    A maiden sings, and her smiling eyes
                    Say love’s a blossom that never dies
                    By the town or sea.
                
            
            
            
                SONG
                
                    SHE comes through the meadow yonder,
                    Her face is turned to the west,
                    And I divine how her clear eyes shine
                    With the light of a lasting rest;
                    And the rays of the sun?set wander
                    To bless her and she is blest—
                
                
                    By touch of their golden splendour,
                    By beauty of earth and sky,
                    Her spirit waits at the western gates,
                    No music can pass her by
                    That Heaven or Earth may send her,
                    I watch where I stand, and sigh.
                
            
            
            
                SONG
                
                    AMID a crowd of radiant hills,
                    A little wood with blossoms rare
                    Breathes sweetly, while the young lark trills
                    His new learnt melody and fills
                    The fragrant air.
                
                
                    Among its boughs the fresh winds play,
                    And, where the spreading branches part,
                    The sun?light drops from spray to spray,
                    And seeks the ferny streams which stray
                    Within its heart.
                
                
                    And there the wild bee fills his cells,
                    And murmurs through the golden hours,
                    And charmèd fancies and sweet spells,
                    Are woven in the tall blue?bells
                    And cuckoo?flowers.
                
                
                
                    There many a mossy bank entwined
                    With shining leaves awaits our choice,
                    Come swiftly love, my soul unbind
                    With thy dear looks, that it may find
                    Its prisoned voice.
                
            
            
            
                IN YONDER BAY
                
                    IN yonder bay the waves find rest,
                    They die along the great shore’s breast
                    With one low sound
                
                
                    Of longing for the fuller breeze
                    Which rose across the trackless seas,
                    And swept them round.
                
                
                    Ah love, if I might find their rest,
                    Might end my wanderings on thy breast,
                    I should not sigh
                
                
                    For fuller life, so I might stay
                    My heart’s throb on thy heart some day,
                    Before I die.
                
            
            
            
                SONG
                
                    IN the first light of the morning,
                    When the thrush sang loud and clear,
                    And the black?bird hailed day’s dawning,
                    How I wished my love could hear.
                
                
                    When the sun shone on the sand there,
                    And the roses bloomed above,
                    And the blue waves kissed the land there,
                    How I longed to see my love.
                
                
                    Now the birds good?night are calling,
                    And the moonbeams come and go,
                    And my tears are falling, falling,
                    Because I want him so.
                
            
            
            
                SONG
                
                    WHEN first I saw your face, love,
                    I knew my search was done,
                    You passed my lonely place, love,
                    The light I sought was won,
                    When your steadfast eyes looked down on me,
                    And I arose to follow thee.
                
                
                    And something in your smile, love,
                    I knew to be a part
                    Of joy that for a while, love,
                    Had slumbered in my heart:
                    To what sweet music it awoke,
                    When first you turned to me and spoke!
                
            
            
            
                SONG
                
                    I AM waiting to send you a song, love,
                    From over the sea,
                    But the way, Oh the way is so long, love,
                    Between you and me,
                    All the music would die,
                    In the waves and the sky,
                    Before it reached thee.
                
                
                    I am wanting to tell you my love, love,
                    But you will forget
                    How you lifted your sweet eyes above, love,
                    How their lashes were wet
                    When you wished me good?bye,
                    While the stars filled the sky,
                    And my sad sails were set.
                
            
            
            
                SONG
                
                    IF I were in the valley?land,
                    And you far up the mountain blue,
                    Would you just turn and wave your hand,
                    And bid me strive to follow you.
                
                
                    If I were in the tossing sea,
                    And you upon the quiet shore,
                    Would you send out your help to me,
                    And bid me to my life once more.
                
                
                    If I were cast from Heaven’s gate,
                    And you within so glad and fair,
                    I know you would come forth and wait
                    Beside me love, in my despair.
                
            
            
            
                SONG
                
                    THE birds sang from the tree,
                    “Sweetheart
                    Go forth across the silent hills,
                    For in the vale their shadow fills
                    Thy love awaiteth thee
                    With lonely heart.”
                
                
                    She wound a wreath of flowers
                    So sweet,
                    And, while the birds still sang their song,
                    Across the hills she passed along
                    In the fair sunrise hours,
                    Her love to meet.
                
                
                
                    But when the sun, asleep
                    At eve,
                    Lay hid behind a purple cloud,
                    Each little bird in leafy shroud
                    Saw her return and weep,
                    “And dost thou grieve.”
                
                
                    Ah no, I am not sad
                    She said,
                    He did not know me when I came,
                    But I have crowned him all the same,
                    And how can I be sad,
                    My heart is glad.
                
            
            
            
                SONG
                LOVE my heart is aching, aching,
                While the soft sea?wind is making
                Music in the aspens, breaking
                Silence in my soul.
                With its sad?voiced singing blending
                With my sighs, while stars befriending,
                Beams to mid?night seas are sending
                As they eastward roll.
            
            
            
                VIOLETS
                
                    VIOLETS, sweet violets,
                    I can find the fairest,
                    In a little ferny glen
                    Blossom all the rarest,
                    I can reach the leafy beds
                    Where they hide their dewy heads.
                
                
                    From the mossy stones and rocks
                    Where the pools are deepest,
                    I can leap across the stream
                    Where the banks are steepest,
                    And beneath the hawthorn get
                    Many a scented violet.
                
            
            
            
                SPRING?TIME
                IN the distant woods are blowing
                Tender buds and blossoms sweet,
                Fragrant leaves and grasses glowing
                From the touch of fairy feet.
                In the woods a spirit singing
                Stays and touches every tree,
                And to loving branches clinging
                Flowers open tremblingly.
            
            
            
                SONG
                
                    THE golden gorse and the heather
                    Bloom down the whole hill side,
                    And below in the rocks are lying
                    Still pools where the sea?flowers hide,
                    And all the day
                    The shadows play
                    In the cliffs and the chasms wide.
                
                
                    The hedges are decked with berries,
                    The lanes gleam with yellow and red,
                    And the pale blue endive blossoms,
                    And the golden?rod lifts its head,
                    And poppies shine,
                    And wild wood?bine
                    Scents the air round the fern’s green bed.
                
                
                
                    And Time passes by like a dream,
                    And birds sing the whole day long,
                    And bright?wing’d insects fill the air
                    With murmurs, and flash along
                    When the green leaves part,
                    And my own heart
                    Is full of a happy song.
                
            
            
            
                SONG
                
                    WHY seems the world so fair,
                    Why do I sing?
                    Why? in the meadow there
                    When it was Spring,
                    There when all fair things were
                    Clearer to see,
                    All the young dreams I’d lost
                    Came back to me.
                
                
                    * * * *
                    I may not enter now,
                    But there’s a Spring
                    Somewhere beyond the sun.
                    So I can sing,
                    So I can wait and sing,
                    While I prepare
                    My soul to welcome thine,
                    When we meet there.
                
            
            
            
                TWO SONGS
                
                    WINDS blow cold in the bright March weather,
                    Yet I heard her sing in the street to?day,
                    And the tattered garments scarce hung together
                    Round her tiny form as she turned away.
                    She was too little to know or care
                    Why she and her mother were singing there.
                
                
                    Skies are fair when the buds are springing,
                    When the March sun rises up fresh and strong,
                    And a little maid, with her mother, singing,
                    Smiled in my face as she skipped along,
                    She was too happy to wonder why
                    She laughed and sang as she passed me by.
                
                
                
                    Stars are bright, and the moon rejoices
                    To pierce the clouds with her broken light,
                    But the air is heavy with childish voices,
                    Two songs ring through the clear March night—
                    Songs which the night with burning tears
                    Sings out again to the coming years.
                
            
            
            
                WHAT SONG SHALL I SING
                
                    WHAT song shall I sing to you
                    Now the wee ones are in bed,
                    What books shall I bring to you
                    Now each little sleepy head
                    Is tucked away on pillow white,
                    All snug and cosy for the night.
                
                
                    Many many singers now,
                    Sing their new songs in the land,
                    Many writers bring us now
                    Many books to understand,
                    But I can sing, these evening times,
                    Only the children’s songs and rhymes.
                
                
                
                    All the day they play with me,
                    My heart grows full of their looks,
                    All their prattle stays with me,
                    And I have no mind for books,
                    Nor care for any other tune
                    Than they have sung this golden June.
                
            
            
            
                ON THE MOOR
                
                    OUT on the moor the sun is bright,
                    And the gorse is yellow,
                    The sky is blue and the air is light,
                    And a little fellow
                    May walk for miles in the grassy way
                    On a holiday.
                
                
                    Out on the moor the wild bee dips
                    In the sweet fresh heather,
                    And through the bracken the young have slips
                    In the autumn weather,
                    And all around shine the tiny wings
                    Of a thousand things.
                
            
            
            
                LITTLE MAIDEN
                
                    LITTLE maiden are you lonely,
                    Standing there beside the sea,
                    Are your blue eyes sad or only
                    Filled with dreams too fair for me.
                    Are the summer breezes making
                    Fairy music on the sand,
                    And the quiet ripples breaking,
                    From some sea?girt fairy?land.
                
                
                    Ah, the fragrant flowers never
                    Fade in that sweet sunny air,
                    And the fairy people ever
                    Send you dreams and fancies rare.
                    Little maiden, you must only
                    Keep your blue eyes clear and free,
                    And you never will be lonely,
                    Standing there beside the sea.
                
            
            
            
                THE SNOW?QUEEN
                
                    THE snow queen passed our way last night,
                    Between the darkness and the light,
                    And flowers from an enchanted star,
                    Fell showerlike from her flying car.
                
                
                    And silently through all the hours,
                    The trees have borne their magic flowers,
                    And now stand up with dauntless head,
                    To catch the morning’s gold and red.
                
            
            
            
                WESTLEIGH BELLS
                
                    HOW gently this evening the ripples break
                    On the pebbles beneath the trees,
                    With a music as low as the full leaves make,
                    When they stir in some soft sea?breeze,
                    And as day?light dies, if I rest my boat
                    ’Neath this bough where the blossoms fall,
                    I shall hear the curlew’s last good?night note,
                    As he answers the sea?gull’s call.
                
                
                    And there where the wheat lies in golden sheaves
                    In the fields across the river,
                    And wood?bine creeps over porches and eaves,
                    And fuchsia and myrtle quiver,
                    Lives my love, my love; tis her casement see,
                    Where the light glimmers to and fro,
                    If she were my love she would come to me
                    This evening, I long for her so.
                
                
                
                    I long for her so that to linger near
                    Her home as I do sometimes,
                    And send her blessings across from here,
                    When they ring the Westleigh chimes,
                    Makes my summer glad, so I stay my boat
                    ’Neath this bough where the blossoms fall,
                    While the curlew flies with his good?night note,
                    To the sea where the white gulls call.
                
            
            
            
                COLD STONE
                COLD, quite cold, I could only see
                Beauty of curve and line,
                I could not find that deeper thing
                That secret which dwells in everything,
                I could not make it mine.
                The marble stood so cold and still,
                And yet within her breast,
                I knew lay hid a wondrous spell
                To open dreams too fair to tell,
                Where I might stay and rest.
                I find it ever in the flowers,
                In tints and perfumes sweet,
                And in the silent stars at night,
                And in the rays of sun?set light
                Their meaning is complete.
                I cried for light to find it here,
                
                And waited, till one day
                The hand that hid the wondrous gift
                Came from the past the clouds to lift
                And drew the veil away.
            
            
            
                TO?NIGHT
                
                    THE hours of the day have departed,
                    They folded their wings to rest,
                    When the last red ray of sun?light
                    Faded away in the west,
                    And fleecy clouds cover the stars,
                    And beyond is a world of blue,
                    And my soul awakes from a slumber
                    To?night, and I see right through—
                
                
                    Away to a world of azure,
                    Where white?wing’d spirits meet,
                    While the clouds float and fade below them,
                    And the stars shine at their feet.
                    They hold out their hands in welcome,
                    And now, for a moment of time,
                    Limitless worlds, and boundless space,
                    And planets—they all are mine.
                
            
            
            
                EVENING
                
                    LISTEN and we shall hear the voice
                    Of Evening, her name she told
                    When we stayed our boat by the shore to know
                    What wee flower shone ’neath the willow so,
                    And her hair was radiant gold.
                
                
                    Now veiled in grey with silent step,
                    She walks where shades are deep,
                    And the great trees hear, and the blossoms know,
                    The song she sings, and her music low
                    Is charming them to sleep.
                
                
                    My unseen brother and sister
                    Who dwell ’neath the roofs we pass,
                    Are you sad and weary with toil and care,
                    My rest is full, I have rest to spare,
                    I whisper it through your grass.
                
            
            
            
                OUT ON THE MOOR
                
                    I HAVE been wandering to?day
                    Out on the moor, and have seen
                    The country stretching far away,
                    In stony slopes and wastes of green.
                
                
                    And watched the distant hill?tops lie
                    Far in the sun?set fair and free,
                    Like purple clouds across the sky,
                    —And further still the line of sea.
                
                
                    And heard the lark above me sing,
                    And seen the plover flying near,
                    And many a little hidden spring,
                    And twinkling water brown and clear.
                
                
                    And brightest sun, and darkest shower,
                    And day and night?time, come to rest,
                    And toiling wind and tender flower,
                    Upon the moor’s untiring breast.
                
                
                
                    We falter in our smiles and tears,
                    And faint with joys and sorrows won,
                    The moors stretch out through all the years,
                    In perfect peace—till Time is done.
                
                
                    And peace is love, dear love I know
                    There is no greater thing than this,
                    It is the utmost love can show,
                    It is the utmost love can miss.
                
                
                    The love within my soul for thee
                    Before the world was had its birth,
                    It is the part God gives to me
                    Of the great wisdom of the earth.
                
            
            
            
                MY PALACE?HOME
                
                    GIVE me thy hand dear friend, and let me take thee
                    Into my palace?home and garden fair,
                    Beside me follow close, ah, it will make thee
                    Still dearer, sweetest friend, to see thee there.
                
                
                    Give me thy hand, dear friend, and let me show thee
                    The peaceful resting places in the shade,
                    Where the stream, flowing pleasantly below thee,
                    Stills each unquiet thought the day has made.
                
                
                    * * * *
                    No, no, dear friend, my palace?home is lonely,
                    No hand but mine may pluck the flowers there,
                    And, since for me they bud and blossom only,
                    Thou canst not tell me that they are not fair.
                
            
            
            
                NIGHT
                
                    AND art thou come again, Oh Night!
                    I know thee by thy starry crown,
                    And by the mists of violet light
                    Which gather where thy robes fall down.
                    I know thee by the purple clouds
                    Thy strong wings spread around the moon,
                    And by the stillness which enshrouds
                    Thy presence, thou art come too soon,
                    Too soon, for lo thy fair love Sleep
                    Turns not her sweet face to the skies,
                    She lingers where the shadows creep,
                    And stay to kiss our children’s eyes.
                
                
                    But when her gentle hands have blest
                    Our homesteads, she will come to thee,
                    And through the holy hours of rest
                    Thine arms will hold her safe, and she
                    Will hear the promises again
                    Thou bringest from the distant spheres,
                    
                    And learn the reason of our pain,
                    And meaning of our bitter tears.
                    Thine eyes are steadfast and I dare
                    Their mighty mystery to read,
                    But mine are dimmed by thought and care,
                    And fail me in my greatest need.
                
                
                    I watch for thee, wilt thou not bring
                    One message to my fainting heart?
                    Through summer?time and snow and spring
                    I watch for thee, must thou depart
                    Thus silently—when will it come,
                    That perfect day which we await?
                    For us thy lips are ever dumb,
                    And voiceless is thy calm estate.
                    Ah! tell thy fair love Sleep, that she
                    May touch me when she passes by,
                    And whisper what she hears from thee
                    In some sweet lullaby.
                
            
            
            
                HEART AND HOME
                
                    OH, what know they of harbours
                    Who toss not on the Sea!
                    They tell of fairer havens
                    But none so fair there be
                
                
                    As Plymouth town outstretching
                    Her quiet arms to me—
                    Her breast’s broad welcome spreading
                    From Mewstone to Penlee.
                
                
                    And with this home?thought, darling,
                    Come crowding thoughts of thee—
                    Oh, what know they of harbours
                    Who toss not on the Sea!
                
            
            
            
                CHRYSANTHEMUMS
                NOVEMBER with mysterious feet
                Creeps slowly through the land,
                And on the bridge and in the street,
                Amid the town’s tumultuous beat,
                Spreads out a quiet hand,
                And wraps around us unaware
                His mantle grey and cold;
                But he has blossoms still to spare:
                We find fresh flowers rich and rare
                Hid in each misty fold.
            
            
            
                WHEN YOU ARE LONELY
                
                    WHEN you are lonely, full of care,
                    Or sad with some new sorrow,
                    And when your tired fancy hides
                    The brightness of the morrow,
                    Ah, turn your footsteps to the woods
                    And meadows, where the rills
                    Are quietly flowing, when the moon
                    And stars shine on the hills.
                
                
                    Upon your brow the great wise trees
                    Will breathe, and something sweet
                    Will reach you from the fragrant grass
                    You press beneath your feet,
                    And some fair spirit of the fields,
                    Peaceful and happy?eyed,
                    Will find a way into your heart,
                    I think, and there abide.
                
            
            
            
                MY FRIEND
                
                    THE tender touch of a gentle hand
                    To?night on my aching brow,
                    The sound of a loving low?tuned voice,
                    How pleasant they would be now;
                    I think they would send the shadows away
                    Which hang so closely around me to?day.
                
                
                    And, sitting idly, I close my eyes
                    And dream how perhaps one day,
                    In my lonely hours, my long sought friend
                    Will come to my home and say
                    “Bring all your tired thoughts to me dear and rest,
                    No shadow will touch you here on my breast
                            .
                             
                        ”
                
                
                    I shall not tell her, but she will know;
                    My rest will be very sweet,
                    
                    And all the shadow and gloom will go,
                    Caught up in the toiling street,
                    And I shall thank her and clasp her hand,
                    And she will smile and understand.
                
                
                    And if on the morrow we chance to meet
                    With others, her face will be
                    Happy and bright for them all, and just
                    A little kinder for me,
                    And once I shall look in her eyes, and so,
                    Learn something there no other may know.
                
            
            
            
                ORPHEUS
                
                    WE wandered in that shadow?land,
                    My fair love, you and I,
                    Through all its strangeness hand in hand
                    We journeyed silently.
                
                
                    My lyre is hanging cold and dumb,
                    Mute with our triumph song,
                    I have no voice now you are come,
                    Whom I have sought so long.
                
                
                    But I will bring you in Love’s land,
                    Into Love’s highest place,
                    And crown you there, and understand
                    The wonders of your face.
                
                
                    And then my joyous song shall rise
                    To sun and moon and star;
                    And all the worlds beyond the skies
                    Shall tell how fair you are.
                
            
            
            
                BY THE SEA
                
                    THE clouds have gathered soon to?night,
                    They hang above the quiet sea,
                    And through the air a muffled sound
                    Is borne to me
                
                
                    From that dim island where the souls
                    Of all the Ages lie at rest;
                    It beats upon my throbbing brain
                    And troubled breast.
                
                
                    If thou wert standing on the shore
                    Beside me now, and held my hand,
                    I think that I should hear it plain
                    And understand
                
                
                    For there is one note in it all,
                    Which loud and clear has come to me,
                    And I have caught it in my heart
                    To tell to thee.
                
                
                
                    “Eyes steadfast from the watch of worlds,
                    Hearts big with secrets of the spheres,
                    We have no power to move you now
                    With hopes or fears.”
                
                
                    “No power,” thy soul has filled my soul
                    Thy life has rounded all of mine,
                    Thy love has girt me with a strength
                    Which is divine.
                
                
                    And when that sound perchance one day
                    Comes to us with a mighty roll,
                    We two shall stand unmoved, and hear
                    And learn the whole.
                
            
            
            
                IN THE WOODS
                
                    ARE your grave eyes graver growing?
                    Sweetheart, may I look
                    At the treasured thoughts which move you
                    In the poet’s book?
                    Stay not in the lazy shade
                    With the drowsy roses;
                    Come into the woods and see
                    Where I find my posies.
                
                
                    Has the buried singer left us
                    Songs to make you weep?
                    Are you saddened by the sorrow
                    Which his numbers keep?
                    Or were all the songs he gave us
                    Born in happy hours?
                    Come with me, he found his music
                    Where I find my flowers.
                
                
                
                    Where a little mossy path?way
                    Lies beside the stream,
                    Long ago the poet lingered;
                    Sun and pale star?beam
                    Touched his lips, while there he wandered
                    Summer?time and Spring,
                    And the mighty woods and river
                    Taught him how to sing.
                
            
            
            
                RETURN OF THE TROOPS
                
                    THE town is very gay to?day,
                    And down our busy street
                    Flags wave, and all the balconies
                    Are filled, our men to greet.
                
                
                    One night, not very long ago,
                    I heard them marching down
                    To where their ship lay, and the sound
                    So filled the silent town
                
                
                    With farewell voices that I wept
                    To know no word or deed
                    Of mine had stirred the sleeping night,
                    To bid our men God?speed.
                
                
                    The town is very gay to?day,
                    And in our busy street,
                    My eyes are dim with tears for those
                    I neither sped nor greet.
                
            
            
            
                MARCH
                THE March wind rises through the skies,
                His great wings rustling as he flies,
                And downward sweeps o’er plain and hill
                The sunshine to the daffodil.
            
            
            
                JUNE
                
                    THE skies are blue
                    O’er the meadows now,
                    And the leaves are new
                    On the willow?bough,
                    And the whole earth sings
                    In one joyous tune
                    All the happy things
                    Of the happy June.
                
                
                    Oh the golden time
                    Of the sweet fresh June,
                    And the happy rhyme
                    Dies away so soon;
                    But again—again—
                    When the years are young,
                    Will the sweet refrain
                    Be sung—be sung.
                
            
            
            
                A BRIDE
                
                    I SAW your portrait yesterday,
                    Set in a golden frame;
                    Around it twines a blossom?spray,
                    Beneath it is your name.
                
                
                    And tender smiles are round your mouth,
                    High thoughts are on your brow,
                    The world is beautiful as Youth,
                    You are so happy now.
                
                
                    The shining gates are opened wide,
                    Love stretches forth his hand
                    And bids the bridegroom bring his bride
                    Into the promised land.
                
                
                    And you and he dwell there alone,
                    Beneath Love’s radiant sky,
                    While all the world’s great grief and moan,
                    As a sad dream pass by.
                
                
                
                    Yet on Love’s flowers strange and rare,
                    Your saddest tears may fall,
                    And in Love’s country you may fare
                    The loneliest of all.
                
            
            
            
                TO THE UNKNOWN AUTHOR OF OBITER DICTA
                July, 1884.
                THOUGH I may rest in some leafy place,
                And read, through the summer day,
                Thy pages penned in the busy town,
                —So busy and far away—
                Though hills stretch out, and sunlight falls
                On acres of swelling land,
                I seem to span the misty miles
                Between us, and clasp thy hand;
                For thou hast bound with magic chain,
                The vagrant thoughts I chased in vain.
            
            
            
                MY SONGS
                
                    THERE is no unawakened string,
                    No untried note for me to ring,
                    No new?found song for me to sing.
                
                
                    Old numbers round my day and night;
                    When summer comes my heart is light;
                    ’Tis heavy, when the birds take flight.
                
                
                    My love is young, her face is fair,
                    The sun?light never leaves her hair,
                    Her beauty fills me with a prayer.
                
                
                    And many a tryst and watch I keep,
                    With those who laugh and those who weep,
                    Between the hours of work and sleep.
                
                
                    The songs I strive to sing have rolled
                    Through times and ages manifold,
                    A mighty chorus fully told.
                
            
            
            
                IN OUR SQUARE
                
                    LAST night again we saw him there
                    Beneath the plane?tree in the Square,
                    Our student neighbour.
                
                
                    He watches every evening now
                    Our garden tennis, and somehow
                    It seemed a labour
                
                
                    The running round, and futile stretching
                    At random balls while he was sketching
                    That foolish Polly
                
                
                    Who quietly stood, with arm up?raised,
                    The while her junior partner praised
                    Her style of volley.
                
                
                    I passed so near him, as we played,
                    He looked so peaceful in the shade,
                    Amid our bustle.
                
                
                
                    He draws and sketches all the day,
                    And studies through the night, they say,
                    Some bone or muscle.
                
                
                    And is this why his cheek is pale,
                    And why he looks so thin and frail,
                    And is such labour
                
                
                    The reason that his coat is bare,
                    And worn, and marks him everywhere—
                    Our student neighbour?
                
                
                    I know that I shall almost cry,
                    To?morrow when we pass him by,
                    All bound to?gether
                
                
                    For Cornish seas, while he—but there
                    Miss Polly’s always in the Square
                    This summer weather.
                
            
            
            
                SOLILOQUY OF A MAIDEN AUNT
                
                    THE ladies bow, and partners set,
                    And turn around and pirouette
                    And trip the Lancers.
                
                
                    But no one seeks my ample chair,
                    Or asks me with persuasive air
                    To join the dancers.
                
                
                    They greet me, as I sit alone
                    Upon my solitary throne,
                    And pass politely.
                
                
                    Yet mine could keep the measured beat,
                    As surely as the younger feet,
                    And tread as lightly.
                
                
                    No other maiden had my skill
                    In our old homestead on the hill—
                    That merry May?time
                
                
                
                    When Allan closed the flagging ball,
                    And danced with me before them all,
                    Until the day?time.
                
                
                    Again I laugh, and step alone,
                    And curtsey low as on my own
                    His strong hand closes.
                
                
                    But Allan now seeks staid delight,
                    His son there, brought my niece to?night
                    These early roses.
                
                
                    Time orders well, we have our Spring,
                    Our songs, and may?flower gathering,
                    Our love and laughter.
                
                
                    And children chatter all the while,
                    And leap the brook and climb the stile
                    And follow after.
                
                
                
                    And yet—the step of Allan’s son,
                    Is not as light as was the one
                    That went before it.
                
                
                    And that old lace, I think, falls down
                    Less softly on Priscilla’s gown
                    Than when I wore it.
                
            
            
            
                A MODERN POLYPHEME
                
                    A FLASH of colour through the trees,
                    A step upon the trembling plank,
                    A white sail flapping in the breeze,
                    And then a maiden leaves the bank.
                
                
                    Each day I watch her, as she guides
                    Her little boat with dexterous hand,
                    And like a river goddess rides
                    In gracious triumph through the land.
                
                
                    I watch her as she lightly tacks,
                    And marvel at the art which steers
                    Her boat into the quiet “backs,”
                    And sorrow when it disappears.
                
                
                    Who, in the summer evening, knows
                    What gentle feelings fill her breast,
                    Or by what bower the water flows
                    Which bear her dingy to its rest?
                
                
                
                    Perchance a lover, dark and tall,
                    Awaits her in some flower nook,
                    And gazing at her gathers all
                    Her thoughts, as from an open book.
                
                
                    Perchance—I know not learnt her name,
                    I know not where her home may be,
                    For one brief space alone I claim
                    Her beauty, as she passes me.
                
                
                    For then the Heaven?winged dreams, which smile
                    And fade in youth’s first golden hour,
                    Come back and soothe my soul awhile
                    As the sweet perfume of a flower.
                
                
                    And so I watch for her nor care
                    Which Acis tarries down the stream—
                    Enough to see her, I forswear
                    Thy black emotions, Polypheme!
                
            
            
            
                A DREAM OF “DREAMS”
                To Olive Schreiner.
                
                    ALL day I read your book; at Eve
                    Your dreams into my dark sleep stole,
                    Through the unbroken hours to weave
                    A picture for my soul.
                
                
                    Now from the deep inspired night
                    I rise, and, near and stretching far,
                    I see the earth lie clear and bright
                    Beneath one morning star.
                
                
                    The great World?Spirit watching still
                    Broods over all with folded wings,
                    And ever down?cast eyes until
                    The first bird wakes and sings,
                
                
                    And through the eastern cloud the sun
                    Breaks with a new unnumbered day
                    And now His watching is all done—
                    The night has passed away.
                
                
                
                    He turns toward the dawn, and I
                    Wait as he breathes the sweet fresh air,
                    Then with a new?born joy I cry
                    To see His face so fair.
