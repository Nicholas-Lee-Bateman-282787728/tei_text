                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag, with the
                    value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All split
                    lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for the
                    final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                        <q>âThere is perhaps no phase of our history more capable of poetic
                            treatment than the sainted lives of the Irish monks who first spread the
                            Christian faith over the western shores of Scotland, and yet it would be
                            difficult to point to a single representative poem having Saint Columba
                            and the devoted band of his disciples for its heroes. An attempt at
                            filling up this gap has recently been made by Miss Blind in a narrative
                            poem devoted to the fate of St. Oran, the friend and disciple of St.
                            Columba.... Apart from the sonorous beauty of her lines, there is in her
                            diction a straightforwardness and simplicity, and an entire absence of
                            affectation and false sentiment, which, combined with considerable power
                            of characterization, make her volume a remarkable contribution to
                            English literature.â</q>

                        <q>âTo disturb the <foreign xml:lang="fre">motif</foreign> of a legend is
                            always a bold, and mostly a rash proceeding.... And yet so skilfully is
                            the story handled that the main incidents of the legend do not lose, but
                            gain by this disturbance of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">motif</foreign>,
                            and the character of Oran, which with the old <foreign xml:lang="fre">motif</foreign> could only have presented the single side of the
                            religious enthusiast, becomes a character exhibiting that complexity
                            which modern taste demands.... Directness of style and lucidity of
                            narrative are the characteristic excellences of the poem. There are few
                            contemporary poets who could have done so much dramatic business in so
                            few lines.... In each of the sonnets there is a thought that is well
                            expressed, and worth expressing.â</q>

                        <q>âIt is in the domain of character that the poem is distinguished by its
                            highest excellence. There is an ideal statuesqueness embodied in the
                            person of St. Columba such as is felt to possess a powerful appeal to
                            the imagination. The poem embraces many passions, of which the most
                            tender and beautiful finds expression in the exquisite creation of the
                            radiant goldenâhaired girl for whose love St. Oran breaks his vow of
                            chastity. But the really powerful contribution to our knowledge of
                            character which this book contains is fittingly centred in St. Oran
                            himself. A dramatic instinct of high order finds utterance in his
                            struggles between opposing passions. Nor are the metrical excellences of
                            the poem less conspicuous.... If one were in need of some single phrase
                            by which to denote the ultimate effect produced by this book, one might
                            say that it seems the most <emph>mature</emph> of all recent first
                            efforts, even of established rank.â</q>

                            fortunate.... That a story such as this is full of poetical
                            suggestiveness is obvious, and Miss Blind has proved herself equal to
                            the occasion. She has avoided writing anything approaching to a
                            âtendency poem.â She metes out justice with an equal hand to all her
                            characters. The genuine enthusiasm and religious zeal of the monks are
                            set forth in language as inspired as is the final protest of St. Oran
                            against their narrow fanaticism; and one of the best passages in the
                            book is indeed the Sermon in which St. Columba announces the Gospel of
                            love and redemption to the islanders.â</q>

                        <q>âMiss Blind has produced one of the most noticeable and moving poems
                            which recent years have added to our shelves.... As a singer with a
                            message her attempt is praiseworthy, and her performance is fairly
                            selfâconsistent. It is eminently homogeneous; the passion once felt, the
                            inspiration once obeyed, the wellâhead pours forth its stream in a
                            strong and uniform current, which knows no pause until its impulse
                            ceases.... The story is pathetic at once in its simplicity and in its
                            terror.... We congratulate the author upon her boldness in choosing a
                            subject of our own time, fertile in what is pathetic, and free from any
                            taint of the vulgar and conventional. Poetry of late years has tended
                            too much towards motives of a merely fanciful and abstruse, sometimes a
                            plainly artificial, character; and we have had much of lyrical energy or
                            attraction, with little of the real marrow of human life, the flesh and
                            blood of man and woman. Positive subjectâmatter, the emotion which
                            inheres in actual life, the very smile and the very tear and heartâpang,
                            are, after all, precious to poetry, and we have them here. âThe Heather
                            on Fireâ may possibly prove to be something of a new departure, and one
                            that was certainly not superfluous.â</q>

                            the Roses than about such matters in the very history of our own days as

                            concentrated. The violinist, poor and unknown, finds himself at Capri.
                            Accident brings him, one evening, to a frightened group of women, one of
                            whom has just been bitten by the tarantula, and, according to the
                            popular superstition, he is implored to play, in order to drive the
                            poison out of her. He refuses at first, but afterwards consents, and
                            finding himself almost supernaturally inspired, plays an improvised
                            âTarantellaâ throughout a whole stormy night, finally curing the girl.
                            The tune thus strangely hit on spreads, and ultimately makes him famous,
                            but the love he has conceived for his Antonella brings him almost as

                            âTarantellaâ is more essentially a poem than many a narrative written in

                            originality and scenic effects of uncommon powers. The dance among the

                            readers, and it is rarely, we think, that in an English novel the
                            psychology of the poetic temperament has been touched by a hand so
                            delicate and at the same time so strong.â</q>
