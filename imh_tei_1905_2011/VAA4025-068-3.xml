            <p>In January, 1864, Charles Harding Cox wrote his sister in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana: "Was it patriotism, belligerant spirit, or tired of home that
                    induced me to enlist. I am sure it was not the last and for the life of me can not think why I came
                    for a ‘sojer’." Such a statement was unusual for Cox whose
                    exhuberance and enthusiasm carried him through almost three years of service in the Seventieth
                    Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the Civil War, and a few lines later he reassured his
                    sister: "Katie! I was a fool for writing the above and did not think while writing it. ...
                    You must not think I am having a rough time, as no soldiers have ever seen a more easy and pleasant
                    time than the Seventieth Indiana. ..."</p>
            <p>Cox had thoroughly enjoyed his first eighteen months in the army. From August, 1862, to January,
                    1864, most of his time had been spent guarding trains and performing picket duty near
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Bowling Green</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    </placeName>, and <placeName>

               </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> He had frequently received
                    "bids" to dances and parties and thought southern girls "far more
                    agreeable and sociable than those at home." Yet, as Cox warned his sister, the Seventieth
                    Indiana in January, 1864, had been assigned to a new corps "in the extreme front"
                    and the real "tug of war" was to come. As part of the First Brigade, Third
                    Division, Twentieth Army Corps the Seventieth Indiana participated in the <placeName>

                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> and the Carolinas campaign. After the surrender of General Robert E. Lee in April,
                    1865, the regiment marched with Sherman's army to <placeName>

                    </placeName> with the same underlying excitement that had characterized his earlier letters home. He
                    felt "bilious" when he saw his fellow soldiers slaughtered at Buzzard Roost and
                    graphically described the carnage at Golgotha: "Several men had their heads shot off close
                    to their shoulders, and men with arms and legs taken off was [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] quite
                    common." But, he told his sister: "such is the risk of a soldier and if they get
                    hurt it is their ill luck." Brigade commander Colonel Benjamin Harrison cited Cox for
                    "his coolness and his efforts to rally the men" at Resaca in May, 1864;<hi rend="sup">3</hi> and of the young Hoosier's actions at Peach Tree Creek two months
                    later Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Merrill, commanding the Seventieth Indiana, wrote: Cox
                    "brave as a lion, rushes ... to the hilltop, waves his hat exultantly, and beckons a
                    command ‘Forward!’. ..<hi rend="i">.</hi>"<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An increasing maturity as well as a continuing enthusiasm are apparent in Cox’ letters
                    from January, 1864, to June, 1865. His descriptions of towns, officers, the southern people, and the
                    war in general are far more perspicuous during his last eighteen months of service than was his
                    earlier preoccupation with parties, girls, visitors to camp, and camp life. Cox, a Republican,
                    supported Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton and President Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, denigrated the Democrats and Copperheads—whom he often
                    equated—and pitied the defeated southerners in a fatalistic kind of way. He rarely
                    complained, and he never questioned what he considered the purpose of the war, the preservation of
                    the Union. "‘America’ is a great word in the Army," he
                    wrote, "and when the boys of <hi rend="i">our</hi> army wish to speak of home or the North,
                    America is invariably used." Despite <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, however, Cox’ obvious
                    feeling of superiority over and his dislike of Negroes continued throughout the war.</p>
            <p>Cox also remained "ambitious in the military line" during his sojourn in the army.
                    Although he was not quite eighteen in August, 1862, when he entered the service, by January, 1864,
                    he had risen from company clerk and orderly sergeant to second lieutenant of Company E in the
                    Seventieth Indiana. After the death of his friend, Lieutenant Edward B. Colestock, Cox was
                    commissioned first lieutenant on July 1, 1864, and was mustered into that position on September 1.

                    captain. While the young Hoosier was on detached duty with the regiment, however, the Twenty-Seventh
                    Indiana Volunteer Infantry was combined with the Seventieth, and an officer from the Twenty-Seventh
                    assumed command of Company E. Cox was therefore never mustered as captain.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his final Civil War letter on June 1, 1865, Cox was again unusually despondent. He berated his
                    sister for not writing and complained: "I am in pretty good health not the best as I have
                    been working hard in the office lately &amp; no exercise, together with ugly dreams and no
                    letter from the ‘Girl I left behind’ has caused me to look &amp; feel a
                    ‘little the worse for wear’. ..." Cox’ sister, Catharine
                    Ward Cox (Mrs. Frank B.) Lord, whom he called Katie, was one of his most faithful correspondents
                    during his three years in the army; the other was his stepmother, Catharine Leila Fitler Cox, the
                    "Ma" frequently mentioned in his letters. The correspondence here published was
                    written by Cox to his sister and to his brother-in-law, Frank B. Lord, and includes letters from
                    January 14, 1864, to June 1, 1865. The Lords, who were associated with the <placeName>

                        <p>Katie! I was a fool for writing the above and did not think while writing it, <hi rend="i">or</hi>, my notions concerning the war, service &amp;c change so
                                    often &amp; quick that I hardly know my opinion myself. You must not think I am

                                    time than the Seventieth Indiana, still the tug of war is to come, and as we have
                                    been assigned to a new Corps (11th) which is mainly in the extreme front, we may
                                    look for our sojourn here near at a close and a few weeks will see us journeying
                                    still further into the "Sunny South".<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Had the

                                            Harding Cox letters have been followed faithfully in this transcription.
                                            Spacing of headings, salutations, and closings has been standardized, but
                                            the punctuation originally used in these portions of the letters has been
                                            retained. Sentences added in the margins have been included after the
                                            closing. Cox seemingly used commas, periods, dashes, and equal signs
                                            interchangeably, whether at the end of or within sentences. Similarly it was
                                            difficult to distinguish between exclamation marks and colons following the
                                            salutations. Although an effort was made to determine Cox’
                                            intent, complete consistency was impossible, and the editor has been
                                            somewhat arbitrary in transcribing commas and periods in an attempt to make
                                            the letters easier to read. Equal signs at the end of sentences and
                                            paragraphs have been changed to dashes. It was frequently impossible to
                                            ascertain whether Cox meant to use capitals or lower case letters, to begin
                                            new paragraphs, or to write certain words as two words or one, i.e., today
                                            or to day. In such instances the editor has attempted to conform to
                                            Cox’ intent or, when a decision could not be reached, has
                                            followed modern practice. Superior letters have been brought down to the
                                            line; flourishes and obviously unintentional repetitions have been omitted;
                                            incorrect spellings have been retained and have not been indicated by a
                                            [sic] or a correction except for a few proper names and for words which
                                            might be misunderstood.</item>

                                    but at night half-dozen blankets will hardly keep us from freezing.</p>
                        <p>Well, Katie we are now under "Marching Orders" for the <hi rend="i">front</hi>, and by Monday next we expect to start, we would leave immediately,
                                    but we have so many arms &amp; accoutrements to be condemned &amp; dropped
                                    and so much extra luggage and equipments to dispose of it will be impossible to
                                    leave before Monday Feb 1st. We have to <hi rend="i">march</hi> the entire distance
                                    over 150 miles, a pleasant little <hi rend="i">walk</hi> for the sake of getting to

                                    to pass slowly and a change is needed to inspire us with new life. I like the moving
                                    part very much but the idea of <hi rend="i">marching</hi> is not quite so agreeable,
                                    when a railroad runs exactly where we are going. Two Negro Regts went to the front
                                    last week, they were taken on the railroad, but our white Regts have to walk. <hi rend="i">Making a White Man almost as good as a Nigger.</hi>

                        <p>By this mornings mail I was the happy recipient of your latest, also one from Ma of
                                    same date. I answer yours at once and write to Ma next week. I was sorry to hear of
                                    Father's illness and sincerly hope he has fully recovered ere this. My wish
                                    at least forty times a day is, that I were home to assist him in business and
                                    releive him of part of his duties.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> I would rather be home than
                                    here anyhow, not that I am <hi rend="i">homesick</hi> but think my services would be
                                    more appreciated. I can see no way <hi rend="i">now</hi> of quiting the army but
                                    think by next fall the war will be sufficiently at a close to enable Officers to
                                    resign with ease. My patriotism and love of country is strong as ever, and to give
                                    Jeff [Davis] &amp; his diciples a through thrashing and no compromise is my

                        <p>I suppose Father has recd the <hi rend="i">two-fifty</hi> I expressed home yesterday.
                                    I have just bought me a fine Dress suit and can put on the style with anyone now.
                                    Military goods being very high the suit cost me about $75.00</p>
                        <p>Sunday: 21st: The foregoing was written yesterday &amp; I was unable to finish on
                                    account of an <hi rend="i">Inspection</hi> which came off just as I commenced
                                    writing.</p>
                        <p>This morning I attended the Episcopal church and heard the Rev Mr Harlow preach, the
                                    church has a fine organ and choir which almost equals our church for fine music
                                    &amp; singing. Many pretty girls attend the church adding to its attractions. I
                                    met Mrs Harlow after church and introduced myself, she introduced me to her husband
                                    with invitation to call at the parsonage occasionally, which is <list type="footnotes">

                                    answer immediately in my usual style. In the same mail with yours came also a good
                                    long letter from "The girl I left behind" and the two letters

                                    Corps will attack from the North. I do actually believe before 24 hours a hard

                        <salute>Dear Frank!</salute>
                        <p>Having just finished writing a few Regm'l Orders and an extra sheet of paper
                                    left, a word to you concerning myself, yourself and matters &amp; things in
                                    general. I wrote Katie I beleive on yesterday at a time when we were expecting to
                                    "engage the enemy" at any moment. The campaign has truly commenced
                                    in this Dept and active work must be done. All seem desirous to make the movement a
                                    decisive one. The country is perfectly alive with the stir of troops and positions
                                    for a hard struggle are now being taken. The XX A.C. having moved down from about
                                    Gordons Mill and Ringgold have formed a line immediately west of Dalton and Buzzards
                                    Roost, the <hi rend="i">3d Div</hi> forms centre of our Corps, McPhersons Corps
                                    (15th and 16th) are still further south and in rear of Dalton while the 4th
                                    &amp; 14th A.C's will cooperate with us from the North, so you see <hi rend="i">Mr rebs</hi> are snugly hemmed in at Dalton and must fight us or <hi rend="i">cave-in.</hi> Their fortifications are said to be impregnable but we
                                    are <hi rend="i">going for</hi> them before many hours. Part of the 1st Div XX Corps
                                    are now out on a reconnoisance and I think tonight the troops will be in position to
                                    start the ball rolling by morning. We were up under arms all last night expecting to
                                    take up a position for operations today but some hindrance prevented and we are now
                                    lying around the woods with 3 days rations in Haversacks awaiting orders to <hi rend="i">do something.</hi> Day before yesterday the 2d Division and 3d Brig of
                                    our Div were feeling the enemys lines near Buzzards Roost and in trying to take a
                                    gap in the hills ranging between us and the Roost—held by the
                                    rebels—were severly repulsed with loss of 400 men killed and wounded. The
                                    rest of our corps was lying within sight and almost in shooting distance of the
                                    fight but were not permitted to participate. It was rather bilious for us to look at
                                    those poor fellows slaughtered and not allowed to assist them<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                                            spring of 1864, Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton and Ohio Governor John
                                            Brough in cooperation with other midwestern state executives devised a plan
                                            to raise 85,000 volunteers to serve for one hundred days. These men were to
                                            receive no bounties and were not to be counted toward a state's

                                            troops could be raised. These men served their terms in Tennessee and
                                            Alabama guarding communications and supply depots, thus relieving older and
                                            more experienced troops—some of which were Negro
                                            regiments—for service with Sherman and Grant. Terrell, <hi rend="i">Report of the Adjutant General</hi>, I, 35–39. See

                                    15) the 70th entered her first real battle at Resaca loosing 156 men<hi rend="sup">41</hi>—other engagements we have been in since then suffering
                                    greatly—but the 15th inst—never was a body of men in such a
                                        <hi rend="i">hot</hi> place as was the invincible 70th on that terrible day. We
                                    had been lying in our line of works some 10 days keeping up lively skirmishing and
                                    petty engagements continually, but the inclement state of the weather caused our
                                    supplies not forthcoming, thereby giving us a greater taste of hunger than Hard-Tack
                                    and inclining us into a mood rather unpleasant than otherwise, also rendering an
                                    advance impossible as well as impracticable, but the morning of the 15th opened
                                    bright &amp; beautiful and the whole of Shermans army pushed over their works
                                    onto the rebs who with but slight resistence skedaddled leaving one line of their
                                    works in our possession, still our army pushed forward in line of battle preceeded
                                    by a heavy skirmish line and a little after noon the 4th corps on left of the 20th
                                    became engaged and as our corps gradually swung around it also engaged the enemy
                                    from left to right by Brigades. At 4 PM our Brig—on extreme right of
                                    corps and the 70th on its extreme right—came up to the Johnnies driving
                                    their skirmishers into their breastworks and arriving at an open field 100 yrds
                                    wide—the double quick was taken up with a yell. Scarcely a man faltered
                                    and the 70th gallantly crossed the field firing as they went, entered the woods
                                    &amp; pushed towards the rebel works over a troublesome abattis, but woe unto
                                    us, it was too hot a nest for Yankees at that time, for when within 200 yds of the
                                    rebel works two Batteries—8–12 pd guns—opened on
                                    us, making a further advance <hi rend="i">impossible</hi> as we had no support and
                                    not a dozen men would have been left to tell the tale had we continued the charge;
                                    but not a man flinched or turned his back to them, but sought such shelter as trees
                                    and the nature of the ground afforded and fought them behind their breastworks until
                                    9 P.M before we were releived—It is said <list type="footnotes">

                                            of the engagement: "Lieut. C. H. Cox, acting adjutant, was

                                    artillery fire before, and our Generals give us great credit. For 3 hours 8 cannon
                                    flung shot, shell, grape &amp; cannister at us and sad was the sight of the many
                                    killed &amp; wounded around us. Several men had their heads shot off close to
                                    their shoulders, and men with arms and legs taken off was quite common. Oak trees
                                    several feet in thickness were cut square into immediately amongst us, and many
                                    trees we shattered into splinters from base to top—More than 50 shells
                                    exploded within 25 feet of me and I was almost deaf when the battle was
                                    over—Our regt expended 10000 rounds of ammunition in less than 3
                                    hours—I have visited the battle grounds of "Stone

                                    the "Scars of Battle" as does the battle ground of
                                    "Golgotha". The 70th lost 47 men and 3 com off in the engagement.
                                    A loss of 8 officers and 225 men in the 70th shows whether she has done any fighting
                                    since the opening of this campaign.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> My health never was better

                                            which the name Kenesaw Mountain is generally associated, a number of battles
                                            occurred in the area during the month of June. Included were Pine Mountain,
                                            Gilgal Church, Golgotha, and Mud Creek. Cox suggests that the battle at
                                            Golgotha occurred on June 15, 1864; other sources place it on June 16.

                                    movements on them—packed up traps at daylight and

                                    their splendid lines of works than us Yankees were at their heels—At 9
                                    o'clk A.M. our Brig ran into a battery (1/2 mile from [M]arietta) which was

                                    us" is unpleasant even to think about—We hugged the ground with
                                    all the grace of a pig for over an hour until Smith's Bat of our Div
                                    silenced mr Rebs guns with a few solid shot from their rifled guns—We

                                    deserters to the tune of 8000. The gallant (as the papers say) 70th took 68
                                    "in out of the wet"—and about sunset we found the enemy

                                    invasion—Not anxious to get hurt so near 4th of July we concluded to let
                                    them "sweat" and threw up before us a line of works for protection

                        <p>At daylight on the 4th we were awakened to find our line of battle confronting with
                                    the enemy's at a stones throw distance, and the entire morning was spent by
                                    us lying in the trenches listening to the patriotic music of the 7 Brass Bands of 3d
                                    Div—which must have fell heavy on the ears of the rebs and made their

                                    Another tramp after them, with many prisoners we pushed them to the

                                        insurrection on August 16, 1864. Dodd's ultimate objective was
                                        apparently the formation of a Northwestern Confederacy. Horrified Democratic
                                        leaders forced Dodd to abandon his plot. Through various spies planted in the
                                        Sons of Liberty Governor Morton knew of the "great
                                        conspiracy." On August 20 military authorities raided Dodd's
                                        printing establishment in <placeName>
                                            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                        </placeName> and confiscated a large amount of ammunition and revolvers, private
                                        correspondence, and material concerning the Sons of Liberty, including an
                                        alleged membership list which contained the names of several prominent
                                        Democratic candidates for state offices. Morton and the Republicans effectively
                                        used these examples of Democratic "treason" in the 1864
                                        election campaign. These events, Dodd's arrest, and the arrest of
                                        several other members of the Sons of Liberty culminated in the famous Indiana
                                        treason trials in October and November, 1864. Stampp, <hi rend="i">Indiana

                        <p>Only two mails have arrived safely this far south since the retrograde movement of
                                    the two armies. The rebs have held our line of communication, hence my long silence.
                                    I have sent an occasional word home, doubting its chances of getting through. But
                                    now as Shermen has again defeated Old Beauregard or Hood—and the
                                    railroads clear of rebels, our connection with the civilized world has again been

                        <p>Your letter of the—came happily received, and contents noted. My business
                                    and the uncertainty of the mails, prevented an immediate answer—</p>
                        <p>It has been a gloomy disappointment to us, at not going home to vote. We thought
                                    surely we would make the trip, our plans were devised for spending the
                                    vacation—and an extraordinary time was anticipated.</p>
                        <p>Indiana boys feel bad over it, and will have another "crow to pick"
                                    with the rebels for severing our com[mu]nications and preventing our going.</p>

                                    flattering, and we almost feared the "butternuts" had gained the
                                    day.</p>

                                    It will cause much bloodshed to us but such is the risk of a soldier and if they get

                                    the enemy no natural advantage in ground, but the time they have had in preparing
                                    artificial advantages such as abbattis, tangles, and innumerable obstructions will
                                    make it a most difficult task to take their works and one that will take resolute
                                    determined men to perform. We are 3 miles from the city, the lines of the two armies
                                    confront each other at 3 or 4 hundred yards distance apart. A swamp is in front of
                                    our Brigade 300 yards in width, we occupy one bank and the Johnnies the other.
                                    Should we assault the works in our front the men will have to swing their cartridge
                                    boxes around their necks and wade through mud and water waist deep under fire of a

                        <p>I have just heard from you and a kind welcome letter it was, dated Dec 26th 1864! a
                                    letter from Ma accompanied it and the two together after so long silence makes me
                                    feel as if I was not forgotten at home and turned the monotony of the field into
                                    bright hopes of the future.</p>
                        <p>I have no particular items to transmit and write only to acknowledge receipt of
                                    letters from America. "America" is a great word in the Army and
                                    when the boys of <hi rend="i">our</hi> army wish to speak of home or the North, <hi rend="i">America</hi> is invariably used.</p>

                        <p>I have seen but few late northern papers and feel as though we were out of the world.
                                    I am anxious for the Ind'polis Journal to learn the general news from home,
                                    see who has married, died &amp;c. &amp;c. particularly to see the notice of

                        <p>We have camped at Hardeeville one week, and may remain another before Sherman will be

                        <p>Until today it has been storming since our entry to this place. We are camped on the
                                    only dry spot for miles around us. The country is one immense swamp "down
                                    here in the pocket", nasty wet and muddy at all seasons, and now the
                                    incessant rains have spread the Savannah [River] over the entire country here, and
                                    water bound we are. Our troops have been washed out a number of Camps and have
                                    sought <hi rend="i">higher</hi> ground. One poor Colonel of our command retired one
                                    night and after a sweet repose awoke at daylight with 10 inches of water in his
                                    tents, his boots bobbing around a la duck fashion and his horse was sent him to gain
                                    dry land. A boat was sent to releive a picket post who were surrounded during the
                                    night by the flood, and had sought safety in mounting a fence close by.</p>

                        <p>I have almost forgotten the art of dancing. Two years and a half in the service has
                                    made awkwardness again the master of me, and the grace I tried to aquire at home to

                        <p>On entering the service I had more young lady correspondents than I had time to write
                                    to. All have joined themselves in holy matrimony and now "poor little

                                    During our raid through the Carolinas, our communication with the north was severed,
                                    consequently no letters were either sent or received by Shermans Army. We felt
                                    almost out of the world during the trip, and although but a few hundred miles from

                        <p>At Fayetteville N. C. we were notified that all letters ready in sixty minutes would
                                    be sent north via Cape Fear River. I wrote to Ma then, and would have sent you a

                                        Sherman's march was slowed by swamps, heavy rains, and one continuous
                                        battle with the elements. The Confederates interfered little with the Union
                                        advance, but the Twentieth Corps did engage Hardee at Averasboro on March 16 and

                        <p>So much business in my office the past week that I have had no time to write you but
                                    one letter since the ending of Sherman's last campaign—</p>
                        <p>It is a bright beautiful Sunday afternoon that I now attempt an answer to your kind
                                    letters of Febry 5 &amp; 13 &amp; Mar 7th &amp; 20 all of which have

                        <p>I have just written Ma a good long document on the [manuscript torn] &amp;

                        <p>Several days since I was rejoicing over the receipt of a most welcome letter from you
                                    dated 6th inst. Our corps being absent from the city some 4 days and the mail
                                    irregular I have consequently neglected you longer than I should.</p>
                        <p>You are aware before this by the flash of the telegraph that Johnson has
                                    "gum up" to us, and peace now reigns from the Potomac to the
                                    Chattahoochee, and I doubt not but in a very few days the rebels along the
                                    Mississipi will have "grounded arms" and a great grand &amp;
                                    glorious old <hi rend="i">peace</hi> we will have from Maine to <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. About 25,000 rebels surrendered to Sherman and while I write they are
                                    being paroled and turning over their guns, &amp;c. I shall give you no items
                                    concerning the capitulation as my time to day will scarcely permit me to tell you

                        <p>May God bless you sister Katie for your respect for <hi rend="i">our</hi> General and
                                    the manner you defend him from the abuses of those who had an idol in some other man
                                    and was afraid Sherman was gaining too much glory.</p>
                        <p>I did not approve the terms of Capitulation which Sherman offered Johnson, neither do
                                    I think Sherman thought they would be ratified at <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, but as our army had not the supplies to chase Johnson probably for 30
                                    days, Sherman got up this armistice with Johnson, so as he could bring up from the
                                    coast supplies sufficient to push Johnson until he could be cornered &amp;
                                    captured.</p>
                        <p>What if Sherman <hi rend="i">did</hi> sincerely beleive in the terms he proposed.
                                    They were not approved at <placeName>

                        <p>[Friends?] should not be so easily parted with. Sherman has been the
                                    General of the war and Grant has done right in giving "Honor to whom honor

                                    every thing as we went and severing the flow of supplies to Lee is what compelled
                                    the evacuation of the rebel Capital and not on account of any movement of any other

                        <p>I say, Hurra for Sherman! so does his entire army, and they will not allow him abused

                  <hi rend="sup">99</hi> When Sherman had met with Johnston on April 17, 1865, and again with
                        Johnston and Confederate Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge on April 18, the three men had
                        written and signed "A Memorandum or Basis of Agreement" indicating the terms
                        of surrender. The armistice also contained sweeping civil and political concessions which went
                        far beyond the powers of either general to grant and practically took reconstruction out of the
                        hands of the President and Congress. President Andrew Johnson and his Cabinet rejected the
                        agreement, and Sherman was ordered to sign new armistice terms duplicating those signed at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                        </placeName>. This was done on April 26, 1865. What angered Sherman and his forces was the
                        public attack made on the general by Secretary of War Stanton, who implied that the Union
                        general had violated <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                        </placeName>'s orders and had granted an armistice in order to allow Jefferson Davis to
                        escape. Stanton stopped just short of accusing Sherman of treason. Sherman, however, remained a
                        popular hero in the North. Bruce Catton, <hi rend="i">Never Call Retreat</hi> (<hi rend="i">The

            <p>Vacillation and lack of efficient administration has generally characterized American Indian policy.
                    The three decades following the War of 1812 were no exception. Early governmental attempts to
                    convert the Indians to an agricultural way of life failed, and by the 1820s officials in <placeName>

                    appraisals of the Indians’ ability to adjust to the increasing white settlement and who
                    warned that the tribesmen were being victimized and debauched by unscrupulous white frontiersmen
                    buttressed this decision.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    prairies of north central Illinois and western Indiana. Scattering their villages from the
                    headwaters of the Kankakee to the north fork of the Sangamon, these Indians had remained loyal to

            <p>The years following the War of 1812 continued to be troublesome for this band of Potawatomi. In 1819

            <p>Once again rumors of Potawatomi hostility spread across the Illinois prairies. After American

                    </placeName>, Reynolds had earlier written to Secretary of War Lewis Cass and emphasized that the

            <p>Reynolds was true to his word. In December, 1832, reports reached him of alleged Potawatomi

                    population of the removal camp had increased to approximately 400 Indians, and they were impatient
                    with the delay. As early as May 7 Pepper had written to General Gibson warning that the Potawatomi
                    were anxious to leave and stating that they threatened to go by themselves if the government did not
                    begin their removal by the middle of June.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Quiquito's band had

            <p>Meanwhile, Pepper assembled four chiefs or headmen who wished to accompany him on his reconnaissance
                    of the lands in the West. Pepper had hoped to converse with the disbursing agent before he left on
                    his journey, but the agent's failure to appear and the growing restlessness of the
                    Potawatomi forced Pepper into action. On June 19, 1833, he reported to the War Department that
                    "If a disbursing agent does not reach this place within ten days, I shall deem it my duty
                    to start with the exploring party, and leave Colonel Sands and General Schoonover in charge of the

                    enter the city, Pepper instructed them to remain in camp while he and an interpreter visited <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He hoped that his safe return would allay their fears of contracting the disease, but
                    when he returned to camp, their desire to return to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> had increased. His interpreter agreed with the Indians, and Pepper decided to return.
                    On July 7, 1833, the party started back to Indiana. In the afternoon of the same day Pepper
                    contracted "bilous fever" and was forced to send the Indians home alone. He
                    eventually returned to his residence in Indiana, where a relapse of his illness prevented him from
                    resuming his duties at <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Before Pepper had left on this abortive venture, he had appointed Sands to supervise the removal.
                    Sands was to wait for the disbursing agent and then proceed with him and the Indians to the West. As
                    the days dragged into weeks and no evidence of the awaited departure was apparent, the Indians lost
                    their earlier fervor for removal. Food and provisions purchased by Pepper were gradually
                    diminishing, and some of the Indians began to wander away from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On July 4 another group of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Potawatomi straggled into the camp at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Four days later Sands and Schoonover moved their tent into the Indian encampment,
                    hoping that their proximity would dissuade the tribesmen's dissatisfaction with continued
                    waiting. To conciliate the Indians extra provisions were purchased and distributed. Unfortunately
                    these actions did not achieve the desired purpose, for on Wednesday, July 10, approximately 200
                    Indians left the removal center and returned to their former homes. Six days later, after hearing
                    that the exploring party had encountered cholera near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, thirty more Indians broke camp and moved away.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

                    government's good intentions, Montgomery remained in <placeName>

                    their city and had stated that since some of the Indians had dispersed, the emigration had been
                    abandoned. Evidently believing such statements to be true, Montgomery decided to wait in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> until he personally could discuss the situation with Marshall. He remained in the city

                    Sands over who should assume control of the removal.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> At the start of his
                    journey to Indiana Montgomery had written to Gibson stating that he hoped Pepper was aware of the
                    extent of his authority "which some citizen agents are apt to suppose only limited by an
                    ill-regulated discretion."<hi rend="sup">53</hi> Accordingly, upon arrival, the disbursing
                    agent informed Sands that since Pepper was absent, he, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName>, would assume authority over the emigration.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Although the two men
                    finally agreed to cooperate, the continued friction was reflected in their correspondence to
                    superiors. In a letter to Pepper, Sands denounced Montgomery and adamantly stated: "Had
                    this officer been here when he was eating his 4 of July dinner in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                    denied their request for additional horses to use on the removal. He told them that they would be
                    transported in wagons and further admonished them to "banish every idea of
                    presents—that they had applied to go west, and that they would be transported there by
                    such means as the Government thought proper, and be supplied with sufficient provisions, and nothing
                        more."<hi rend="sup">57</hi> The Indians then asked him to include their former home on
                    the Iroquois River in the removal itinerary, stating that they had left certain personal possessions
                    there which they wished to take to their home in the West. Montgomery again gave them a negative
                    reply but promised that he would allow some of them to go to that location and retrieve all of their
                    belongings if they would then join the removal expedition near <placeName>

                    approximately seventy Potawatomi who had gone to the Iroquois River to retrieve their personal
                    property. On July 25 Schoonover had left <placeName>

                    </placeName>, however, only three Indians accompanied him; the rest of the group had remained on the

                    throughout the afternoon of August 15. The steamboat failed to appear. In the evening the Indians
                    carried their baggage and led their horses back to camp. The boat did not arrive during the
                    following day, and the camp retired for the night. Finally, late on the evening of August 16, the

                        <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>
                    </placeName> proceeded without difficulty. Although several of the agents on board contracted a
                    fever, the Indians remained healthy and evidently enjoyed their excursion. The steamboat arrived at
                    its destination on the evening of August 24, and the Potawatomi were unloaded on the following
                        morning.<hi rend="sup">69</hi>

                    </placeName> were many members of Quiquito's band. The large number of Indians who had

                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> had gradually wandered away. From the agents’ reports, which listed the
                    number of Indians leaving the camp before removal, it would seem that during June, 1833, there were
                    at least 400 Indians in the camp in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">70</hi> Of this number, only sixty-seven

            <p>Both Sands and Montgomery realized that the removal had met with only limited success, and both

                        <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Sands charged that <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s late arrival at <placeName>

                    </placeName> and his subsequent relations with the Indians alienated the Potawatomi and caused them
                    to desert the removal.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> Montgomery replied that Sands and other local officials
                    were uncooperative. He also insisted that the majority of the Indians actually did not want to leave
                    Illinois and Indiana and that local traders and others who could exploit the Indians counseled the
                    tribesmen against removal.<hi rend="sup">73</hi>

                    during this period. Plagued by poor planning and inefficiency, these forced migrations are studies
                    in misadministration and failure. Several factors combined to cause the failure of this specific
                    venture. Pepper's promises to the Indians that they would be removed during the first week
                    in June may have been sincere, but he could not guarantee that such pledges would be honored. When
                    the removal was not initiated at that time, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Potawatomi became increasingly restless and dissatisfied with remaining in the removal
                    camp. The failure of the government to respond promptly to Pepper's request to prepare for
                    the removal added to the difficulties. Montgomery was not appointed as the federal disbursing agent
                    until May 28, and his orders did not reach him until June 17, over two weeks after the Indians
                    expected to start their journey. Therefore, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName>'s late arrival at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> caused many Indians who had earlier been interested in removal to change their minds
                    and desert the debarkation camp. Undoubtedly some would have reneged upon their earlier promises to
                    remove beyond the Mississippi even if the disbursing agent had arrived in June, but his late
                    appearance facilitated discontent and allowed the tribesmen ample time to reconsider their decision.
                    Obviously, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName>'s delayed arrival was not entirely his fault, for his late orders were
                    compounded by illness and transportation difficulties over which he had little control. Yet his
                    acceptance of hearsay evidence that the removal had been abandoned and his subsequent five day

                    </placeName> added to his late arrival and caused even more Indians to leave the removal camp. The

                    </placeName> Potawatomi removal, and Pepper's attempt to minimize the seriousness of the

            <head>Cornelius O'Brien Lecture Series Concerning Historic Preservation in Indiana</head>
            <p>From its initial appointment by President Herman B Wells in 1969 the Indiana University Committee on
                    Historic Preservation has devoted its efforts to fostering educational programs concerning historic
                    preservation within the Hoosier State. Three annual preservation conferences have been held, and a
                    fourth will meet at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> on September 29–30, 1972. After sponsoring tours of homes and other
                    buildings in or near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in connection with the two initial conferences, the committee conducted a separate two
                    day tour of historic structures and sites in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and vicinity on April 22–23, 1972, in cooperation with a local committee. A
                    similar two day tour of some portion of northern Indiana is planned for the spring of 1973. These
                    and related efforts have been very favorably received, and they have both directly and indirectly
                    made significant contributions to historic preservation within Indiana.</p>
            <p>A most promising addition to the efforts of the Indiana University Committee on Historic Preservation
                    has recently been announced by its chairman, Dean Eunice C. Roberts. Through a grant received from
                    Mrs. John Timberlake Gibson and her mother, Mrs. Cornelius O'Brien, a lecture series
                    concerning historic preservation in Indiana has been estabished in honor of Cornelius
                    O'Brien (1883–1953) who contributed substantial and devoted service to historic
                    programs and the preservation movement within Indiana. A successful farmer, banker, and
                    manufacturer, Mr. O'Brien was long an active member of the Indiana Historical Society,
                    serving on its executive board and as one of its vice presidents. He was also a member of the
                    Indiana State Library and Historical Board and of the Purdue University Board of Trustees. Mr.
                    O'Brien was a pioneer in historic preservation in Indiana, and his efforts in this field
                    were directed especially toward restoration of a portion of the Whitewater Canal and preservation of
                    Veraestau, the family home overlooking the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Aurora</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Cornelius O'Brien was a delegate to both state and national conventions of
                    the Democratic party, becoming its nominee for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate in 1944.</p>
            <p>Veraestau, with its commanding and scenic view of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, had its
                    beginnings in territorial days as the combination log cabin-brick residence of Jesse L. Holman, one
                    of the leading political figures of pioneer Indiana. William Steele Holman, a son who served as <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> congressman from Indiana for three decades, was born in this house. The log cabin
                    portion of Veraestau burned in the 1830s; following the fire Allen <placeName>

                    portion. Further additions have been made to Veraestau during this century, including a brick
                    extension by Cornelius O'Brien in the late 1930s. Veraestau is an excellent and well
                    preserved example of an Indiana house which had humble beginnings in the pioneer era, then with
                    additions from period to period developed into a large and attractive home. It is certainly one of
                    the oldest, if not the oldest, such structure surviving in the state; and the prominence of its
                    residents and visitors in state and national life for more than a century and a half has made it one
                    of the outstanding houses of Indiana in terms of its historic associations.</p>
            <p>The initial presentation of the Cornelius O'Brien Lecture Series will be given at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the evening of September 29, 1972, as a featured part of Indiana
                    University's fourth annual historic preservation conference. The speaker will be James L.
                    Cogar of Shakertown, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, who will give an illustrated discussion of the restoration of the Shaker community
                    there. Two additional lectures are tentatively planned for other places in Indiana during the
                    academic year 1972–1973. The lecturers will be persons who are nationally recognized for
                    their experience and competence in one or more fields of historic preservation. The Cornelius
                    O'Brien Lecture Series Concerning Historic Preservation in Indiana will thus be a
                    continuing memorial to an outstanding Hoosier who achieved a significant niche in the economic and
                    political life of his native state and who made important contributions to historic programs and the
                    advancement of the preservation movement.</p>

            <p>W. C. Vanderwerth has compiled speeches made by thirty-seven well known Indian chiefs whose words
                    were recroded at significant counciles or momentours occasions. He gives a breif biography of each
                    man and an equally brief explanation of the occasion for the speech. The arrangement in
                    chronological, extending from Teedyuscung's oration at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1758 to three short speeches by Quanah Parker in 1910. An appendix adds the full
                    speech of Nez Perc Chief Joseph as reported in the <hi rend="i">North Amerian Review</hi> of April,
                    1879.</p>
            <p>A breif forward by Willam R. Carmack describes the importance of Indian oral tradition in Amerindian
                    history. Vanderwerth has wisely confined his examples to confrom to the title of the book. He no
                    doubt was tempted to include many other speeches solely because of their Indian wit, pathos, or
                    careful rationalism, but which would have obscured the theme of his book.</p>
            <p>Indian oratory was a long established and much practiced art, but it owed much to the personal
                    accomplishments and the impressive delivery of its speakers, who were notable chiefs. Even the most
                    skilled interpreters and secretaries could only imply the chief's personal qualities in the
                    written reports. It is fourtunate that these recorders could convey the nuances of Indian thought
                    and expression as well as they dit since speakers obscured as well as emphasized their messagges by
                    elaborate figures of speech.</p>
            <p>By using a chronological presentation the author shows Indian recognition of a decline from equality
                    to an inferior and hopeless condition. Tecumseh's inspiring appeal for war in 1763 and his
                    acknolwedgement of defeat in 1765 indicate the change in the plight of one chief. Later speeches
                    show pathetic acceptance of the futility of resistance. The Indiana's position is
                    emphasized by the author's unavoidable use of orations given after concessions or defeats.</p>
            <p>A more exciting view of Indian oratory and imagery would have been presented if Vanderwerth could
                    have assembled speeches made in the deliberative councils which preceded majr decisions. Most of the
                    speeches which are included represent conclusive decisions and do not hint of the dissent or
                    compromise which preceded them. Such oratory is more reasoned, the product of interchanging opinions
                    of <pb n="259" id="VAA4025-068-3-079"/> many men, but the reviewer regrets the absence of dissenting
                    speeches by younger men. Of course, government officers and interpreters could not have witnessed
                    such councils, but the author has tried to fill this void by giving Tecumseh's speech to
                    the Choctaws and Chicka-saws in 1811 and Kicking Bear's to the Sioux in 1890.</p>
            <p>The author has added a useful collection to the growing body of authentic Indian history. He has
                    supplied useful background material, and the portraits of these grim orators tell much of lives
                    which led them to positions of leadership. The bibliography is varied and useful, and the University
                    of Oklahoma Press has achieved its customary excellence in editing and printing.</p>

            <p>The author is a well qualified architectural historian and photographer; he was a founder and first
                    president of the Western Reserve Architectural Historians, a chapter of the Society of Architectural
                    Historians. Campen traces the eastern historical concepts that had a considerable influence on Ohio
                    designers and builders and their solutions for residences and commercial, civic, and religious
                    buildings.</p>
            <p>The volume is illustrated with over 400 photographs; their quality ranges from good to excellent. The
                    photographs vividly show the variety of styles, richness of texture, and numerous forms that
                    resulted in a rich regional expression. The captions and text are clear, concise, and informative.</p>
            <p>The visual and written material is organized geographically by county. Each chapter has a brief
                    historical introduction which is most helpful in giving the reader a good background on the
                    development and evolution of the architecture from local indigenous concepts to the late nineteenth
                    century expressions in the Western Reserve.</p>
            <p>The glossary is commendable. It is well illustrated and should be most helpful in assisting a lay
                    reader to a much better understanding of architectural terms and forms.</p>
            <p>The volume is a welcome and commendable addition to the increasing number of excellent regional
                    publications on midwestern architectural history.</p>

                    growing tendency to lay aside prejudice and polemic and look at Davis as he was. To that end Rice
                    University and the Jefferson Davis Association have launched this monumental project which is
                    intended to be the definitive edition of papers related to Davis’ life and work. Monroe
                    and Mcintosh, who have already labored about a decade, expect to produce twenty or more volumes.</p>
            <p>The editors intend "to provide sufficient background material to enable the reader to make
                    his own appraisal of the man and his age" (p. xi). They have therefore included not only
                    substantive letters, both public and private, by Davis and to him, but also routine official
                    correspondence and records of his military assignments and activities. All dated items are arranged
                    in chronological order, and explanatory footnotes, which shed much light on the documents, are both
                    abundant and factual. Every name that appears in the text is accompanied at first mention by a
                    biographical note explaining the person's relation to Davis; subsequent appearances are
                    cross referenced to these notes. There are two autobiographical sketches of Davis, a chronology of
                    his life, and a Davis family genealogy. The list of sources includes those used in annotation as
                    well as the location of all documents reproduced in this volume. The index is detailed and appears
                    to be accurate.</p>
            <p>It was time for a new edition of Davis papers. Nearly fifty years have passed since the Mississippi
                    Department of Archives and History published Dunbar Rowland's ten volume compilation, <hi rend="i">Jefferson Davis, Constitutionalist: His Letters, Papers &amp; Speeches.</hi> Since
                    1923 additional Davis materials have been discovered, and the current project is more broadly
                    conceived than Rowland's. His work, for example, contains only three items dated prior to
                    1840; Monroe and Mcintosh have included 530 entries from those early years. Hudson Strode in <hi rend="i">Jefferson Davis: Private Letters, 1823–1889</hi> (1966) presents an
                    interesting personal portrait of Davis but touches his public life only incidentally.</p>
            <p>The editors and publishers of this book are to be congratulated on a work well conceived and
                    skillfully executed. Those interested in <pb n="261" id="VAA4025-068-3-081"/> Jefferson Davis and
                    his role in the nation's history will long be indebted to them.</p>

            <p>The book was written by Moritz Busch in 1851 and 1852 as a diary or journal of a trip to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Its publication in 1854 started Busch on a literary career that lasted more than forty
                    years. It is obvious that publication was a primary consideration in the writing of this journal.
                    The author writes consistently of the popular or spectacular and frequently borrows lengthy
                    descriptions and passages on subjects he has decided to include but which he has not observed or
                    knows little about. His work is entitled "Travels," but it could easily serve as a
                    guide book or a complete account to encourage others to come to the area discussed.</p>
            <p>The original text in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> was 772 pages. This volume of about 280 pages of text profited from needed and skillful
                    editing and deletions in the chapters included. The major deletion, however, was the complete
                    omission of nine of the eighteen chapters. These are briefly summarized in the introduction and
                    reveal that the editor narrowed or sharpened the meaning of the title. He deletes seven chapters
                    dealing with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the voyage to America and deals more specifically with the area from the Hudson to
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. Two chapters omitted could well have fitted into the limited interpretation of the
                    title. These are "The Saints of the Latter-Day" and "Thirteen Songs and a
                    Portrait of American Negroes." The editor explains their omission in relation to the
                    paucity of first hand observations used by the author. Deletion of the chapter on the Mormons both
                    in this context and because of Busch's practice of writing on topics of particular interest
                    to his audience is understandable. The omission of the chapter on the black man considering the
                    present widespread popular interest in additional interpretations of black history and in light of
                    Busch's personal visit to an African Methodist church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> is less easy to understand.</p>
            <p>The topics with which the author deals are numerous, and most readers will find several that will be
                    of particular interest. Busch treats modes of travel by canal, train, steamboat, stagecoach,
                    horseback and on foot, and his descriptions are interesting. The author's continuing
                    contact with and attention to recent immigrants to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, most of them like the author participants in the European <pb n="262" id="VAA4025-068-3-082"/> revolutions of 1848 and 1849, will also appeal to many readers. Busch
                    had been a theological student, and he had special interest in and was amazed by the religious
                    practices and customs he found in America. His observations of unusual groups such as the Shakers
                    are interesting, but equally significant are his descriptions and evaluations of more traditional
                    religious groups. In particular, Busch's evaluations of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> Protestant churches in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> read as if they were written by one expert in and concerned about such groups. His
                    concern with land values and agricultural production frequently made this reader wonder if he were
                    actively seeking a place to locate or simply adding another dimension to his account. People
                    concerned about special locations will find a good deal about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a substantial amount about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and interesting descriptions of a number of western Ohio and Kentucky areas.</p>
            <p>Professor Binger has translated well, and his introduction and notes succinctly explain the reason
                    for the book. The fact that no publisher or editor felt compelled to offer an English translation in
                    almost 120 years sets a dimension of the limitations on the book's significance. However,
                    its appearance in English now should be welcomed by a number of audiences interested in the area
                    dealt with and in the impressions of European visitors to the pre-Civil War <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The University Press of Kentucky as publisher and Binger as editor-translator have
                    provided an attractive and readable version and are to be commended. The price on a volume of modest
                    size without visible features to increase unduly manufacturing costs bears unhappy testimony to the
                    escalation of book prices in the present inflationary society.</p>

            <p>Paul Carter's study is crowded with a fascinating assemblage of American
                    "Victorians" representing a variety of religious viewpoints. The result is a
                    composite picture of the faith and the doubt of the Victorian age in America set within a wide
                    framework embracing such divergent figures as Robert Ingersoll and Samuel Clemens, critics of
                    traditional religion; Isaac Mayer Wise and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Gladden, modernizers of traditions; Lew Wallace and Henry Ward Beecher, popularizers of
                    unique brands of spirituality; and Andrew <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> Davis and Charles Taze Russell, prophets of Spiritualism and the Jehovah's
                    Witnesses respectively. The religious situation during the Gilded Age was complex: faith and
                    unbelief locked in conflict.</p>
            <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-068-3-083"/>
            <p>The spiritual crisis among Americans between 1865 and 1895 was a reflection of the larger situation
                    in western Christendom at the time. Science and scientism shook the foundations of the religious
                    establishments; indifference and a growing distaste for supernaturalism gnawed on the churches from
                    within. Open opposition to religion was on the rise. Yet in America agnosticism must be placed in
                    its proper perspective, alongside the Sunday evening hymn singing in the White House led by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rutherford</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Lucy Hayes and alongside the revivalistic successes of Dwight L. Moody in the
                    cities. The Gilded Age of America was a time of religious revival as well as decay, a paradoxical
                    age indeed.</p>
            <p>The principal religious issues spanned a wide spectrum. With respect to the origin of man, for
                    example, was it to be God, a gorilla, or something in between? As for man himself, was he
                    animal, spiritual, or divine? What vision of the afterlife or immortality could American
                    Victorians salvage? With social ills apparent to all—poverty, slums, labor
                    unrest, glaring inequality of opportunity—how should the churches respond? In
                    a moment of duress for all faiths in what manner ought religious people regard each
                    other? To these and other questions many different answers were given. Carter, however,
                    has done a commendable job of sorting the questions and the answers.</p>
            <p>The virtues of this volume are obvious. It is useful that Carter has not confined his perspective to
                    mainstream Protestantism but rather shows all religions encountering similar problems at the end of
                    the last century. Sectarian groups, ethnic churches, and Judaism are too often blocked out of view
                    in the more usual Protestant oriented religious historiography of America. This work will appeal to
                    a wide circle of scholarship because it is not presented as historical theology but as intellectual
                    history. In it abstractions fade, and the characters who peopled the churches or ranted against them
                    take flesh and blood. Well chosen illustrations add another delightful note, as do the extensive
                    annotation and bibliography in the text. This reviewer predicts that what has been said about
                    traditional dogmas in the Gilded Age—they "fade away because they are
                    neglected" (p. 125)—will not be true of this book.</p>

                    </placeName> and the aftermath of British rule following the decision of 1763. Although popular
                    accounts and legend minimize and sometimes attempt to obliterate this part of the history of slavery
                    in North America, Professor Winks proves its existence. At the same time he places it in the
                    perspective of a severely restricted and never widely practiced institution.</p>
            <p>Slavery was legal in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> until 1834 when an act of Parliament abolished it throughout the empire. Most of the
                    black people of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> are not descendants of these original slaves. Some came as volunteers for the Loyalist
                    side in the American Revolution or as slaves captured and freed during the same struggle. Others
                    arrived in similar circumstances during the War of 1812. There were maroons from <placeName>
                        <country reg="jm">Jamaica</country>
                    </placeName> involuntarily exiled to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, thousands of fugitive slaves from the southern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and later immigrants from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the West Indies. The various migrations settled in widely scattered places and
                    always provided a very small element in a mosaic of population groups. A short appendix on the black
                    population in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> points out the difficulty of locating reliable statistics and concludes that at no time
                    did black people form more than 2 or 2.5 per cent of the total population.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, these people suffered under oppressive and discriminatory practices which often
                    resembled those of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and which included a pattern of segregated churches, schools, and housing and a social
                    system based upon white superiority. Canadian blacks confronted a variety of bigoted practices which
                    on occasion found political expression. Even the Ku Klux Klan had its Canadian followers. Canadians
                    sometimes overlook these matters and point to the absence of a legal basis for discrimination,
                    though even this was somewhat negated by an immigration policy which restricted blacks.</p>
            <p>Black Canadians were slow to rally forces to fight for their rights. They were few in number, highly
                    scattered, and of varying backgrounds, and their own institutions tended to encourage cooperation
                    rather than confrontation with the white majority. The Canadian churches which served the black
                    people emphasized virtuous living for the afterlife; their schools emphasized preparation for manual
                    labor along the lines suggested by Booker T. Washington. In recent years, however, some of the more
                    militant voices from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and other countries have had an audience among Canadian black youth. Yet, compared with
                    the rush of events in the black community of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

            <p>A short review can only hint at the significance of this volume and the wealth of information it
                    contains. All the major themes of the subject are covered, and the interpretive sections will
                    undoubtedly provide a great deal of material for future research and discussion. The book is based
                    on study of a mass of manuscript material as well as newspapers, printed sources, and interviews.
                    Because of its thoroughness it is not an easy book to read, but it is certainly required for any
                    student of the history of black people in North America as well as students of Canadian-<placeName>

            <p>In the introduction to this book the author, who is a white professor teaching at a school with a
                    predominantly white student body, tells the reader that, to meet the needs of his students, he
                    decided not to try to teach a course in "Negro history" but instead to teach a
                    course on "‘white history’ with emphasis upon the means by which
                    whites in America have imposed second-class citizenship upon their black fellow citizens"
                    (p. 3). The book under review is an outgrowth of this course. In it Synnestvedt addresses himself to
                    what he calls the "greatest social need in America today"—the
                    reeducation of whites of all ages to a recognition of the realities of the racial record in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. His point of view is summed up in James Weldon Johnson's comment:
                    "The race question involves the saving of black America's body and white
                    America's soul" (p. 6). More recently a black sergeant with the <placeName>

                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, who was being interrogated about racial incidents, expressed the same view when he
                    replied: "What's the problem? What's the problem?
                    Hell ... [the white man] knows the problem. He <hi rend="i">is</hi> the problem!" (p. 212).</p>
            <p>The book does not represent original research but is a summary and synthesis of developments since
                    Reconstruction. It deals with such topics as legalized segregation and disfranchisement, lynching,
                    internal migration, the origins of the northern ghetto, the activities of the modern Ku Klux Klan,
                    racism in World War I and World War II, and the Equal Rights Revolution of the 1950s and 1960s. It
                    covers some of the same material as August Meier and Elliott M. Rudwick's <hi rend="i">From
                        Plantation to Ghetto</hi> (1966), John Hope <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s <hi rend="i">From Slavery to Freedom</hi> (1947), and other textbooks; but
                    the emphasis is on <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-068-3-086"/> the role of whites, especially white racism.
                    There are some factual errors. A conspicuous example is an incident in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1916 in which Synnestvedt pictures Paul Lawrence Dunbar (who died in 1906) as the
                    victim of white harassment when he moved into a white neighborhood. This is a badly garbled version
                    of an incident described by Arna Bontemps and Jack Conroy as having happened to a man who was an
                    admirer of Dunbar's poems.</p>
            <p>Synnestvedt makes no pretense of objectivity. He writes with the purpose of not merely informing but
                    of arousing the conscience of white Americans. Students and the general reader should find the book
                    provocative. There is a useful bibliographical essay. One hopes that the book will contribute to
                    achieving the objective for which it was written.</p>

            <p>Coupled together, cavalry and national parks are today contradictory, almost like mixing napalm and
                    chaparral. Yet the contemporary, peace loving ecologist who reads H. Duane Hampton's able
                    study will find that it was indeed the disciplined policing by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> cavalry which saved what are today the Yosemite, Sequoia, and General Grant parks.
                    Certainly the pollution conscious contemporary will be surprised at how genuine was the threat of
                    rubbish accumulation, extinction of wild life, and sheer vandalism that occurred in these
                    sanctuaries before the military moved in.</p>
            <p>Yellowstone has just celebrated its centennial as America's first national park. In 1872
                    this <placeName>
                        <country reg="wyu">Wyoming</country>
                    </placeName> wonderland had not long enjoyed such status before a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> army officer reported: "The ornamental work about the crater and the pools had
                    been broken and defaced in the most prominent places ... The visitors prowled about with shovel and
                    ax, chopping and hacking and prying up great pieces ..." (pp. 40–41). By the
                    early 1880s the westward push of the Northern Pacific Railroad swelled the ever mounting number of
                    Yellowstone tourists. The resultant pillage and wanton contempt for nature horrified General Philip
                    Sheridan and others who cared. By 1886 the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> cavalry found itself assigned the policeman's role. As had been the
                    army's fate before, this duty fell to the military because of congressional parsimony and
                    because no other branch of the government could do the job. The army did not retire from this duty
                    until 1918; at that time civilian hands, today's National <pb n="267" id="VAA4025-068-3-087"/> Park Service, assumed the reins of responsibility. Naturalist John Muir
                    summed up the army's service: "Blessings on Uncle Sam's soldiers. They
                    have done the job well, and every pine tree is waving its arms for joy" (p. 190).</p>
            <p>Historian Hampton has carefully researched and written a piece of western history which has
                    heretofore been overlooked. Whenever today's social or natural scientist reports on
                    America's ecological past, historical objectivity is frequently flawed by the
                    author's intense feelings about the environmental crisis. Happily Hampton's
                    narrative is no polemic. Some will wish he had given more attention to the Gilded Age matrix that
                    first preserved Yellowstone and its California counterparts and then so callously threatened them.
                    An extensive and accurate bibliography will provide help for those wanting to study this aspect of
                    the subject further.</p>
            <p>In his epilogue Hampton is not afraid to remind his readers that the struggle to preserve the
                    wilderness remains; in truth, the odds in the environmental battle may have worsened. "The
                    future of conservation may be in greater danger today than it was then. For now, the interested
                    public risks being lulled into complacency by reassuring statements from the White House, the
                    Secretary of the Interior, and major industrial concerns ... and the ever-present personal greed of
                    individuals all point[s] toward more and larger threats to the existence of an inviolate National
                    Park system" (p. 188). Given this reviewer's pessimism, one must wonder not if,
                    but when, the military will be required to return to the duty it left in 1918.</p>

            <p>Arguing that the impact of the rise of the interstate railroad system in the antebellum political
                    economy is best understood through a study of the Granger laws, Miller focuses upon the
                    politico-legal history of the enactment of these regulatory measures in the upper Mississippi Valley
                    between 1871 and 1874. Drawing upon the massive amount of secondary information already available,
                    coupled with extensive utilization of primary sources such as the papers and reports of various
                    interest groups, state and railroad archives, and local newspapers, the author has produced an
                    impressively documented, solid, scholarly study.</p>
            <p>As a result of an in depth analysis of the Granger agitation and legislation in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Miller coneludes <pb n="268" id="VAA4025-068-3-088"/> that to understand the Granger
                    laws one must recognize that they were part of a reaction of the older, regionally based mercantile
                    orders to the rise of a burgeoning industrial capitalism on a national scale and in particular to
                    the rise of interstate railroad systems. Promoted by local mercantile, shipping, and business
                    interests rather than farmers, the regulatory Granger laws centered mainly on the issue of railroad
                    rate discrimination and were essentially moderate, not radical, measures. Alluding to the fact that
                    the railroad officials played a key role in drafting the regulatory laws and to the fact that
                    "all the important Granger innovations ... were concessions to the railroad
                    interests" (p. 168), the author further alleges that the commission form of regulation,
                    framed by the established political leadership in each of the Granger states studied, was acceptable
                    to the railroads.</p>
            <p>While the author asserts that he can find no evidence of class struggle in this movement for railroad
                    rate regulation, it is nevertheless apparent that there was a conflict of economic interests in
                    which the forces of a dynamic industrial capitalism—in this case the railroad industry as
                    the first big business in the nation—sought in the face of increasing interrailroad
                    competition and disgruntled local interests to rationalize a ruinous nationwide competitive
                    situation through stabilization of the market. Confronted with increasing popular discontent and
                    agitation for government action, the railroad interests sought to shape that regulation for their
                    own benefit.</p>
            <p>Here the author has broached a particularly fruitful area for intensive exploration; yet, it is an
                    area which he does not develop—i.e., the role of the railroad interests themselves in
                    framing the Granger railroad regulatory laws. Much as Lee Benson approached this problem in his <hi rend="i">Merchants, Farmers and Railroads</hi> (1955) or as Gabriel Kolko dealt with the issue
                    in his <hi rend="i">Railroads and Regulation, 1877–1916</hi> (1965), and more broadly for
                    the Progressive Era in his <hi rend="i">Triumph of Conservatism</hi> (1963), historians in this
                    contemporary age of welfare corporate industrial capitalism should explore more closely the role of
                    industrial capitalists as a powerful interest group actively pursuing government regulation as the
                    means to stabilize an "unrationalized" capitalistic marketplace.</p>
            <p>Supported by a truly impressive bibliography and extensive documentation, Miller's volume is
                    a useful addition to those works on the Granger movement in general and to the studies dealing with
                    the history of railroad regulation in particular.</p>

                    </placeName> University is rather unusual in that it would serve quite satisfactorily as a review.</p>
            <p>Professor Martin set out to examine the real nature of the "railroad problem" which
                    he learned about as he grew up. He discovered that the problem had been around for more years than
                    he had thought and that its nature was quite different than was presented in conventional textbook
                    accounts. The more he researched the more he discovered that the difficulties were accentuated
                    greatly by "archaic Progressivists" and that the principal culprits were most
                    active in the period after 1910. Railroad capital requirements were expanding and costs were rising,
                    but general rate increases proved unobtainable. A little group of commissioners—goaded by
                    the people's lawyer, Louis Brandeis—thwarted attempts of the railroads to obtain
                    relief. Weakness inevitably ensued. The railroads could not meet rising labor demands, and, in the
                    course of time, operations were taken over by the government in World War I. Martin gives a detailed
                    and at times dramatic account of the rate proceedings.</p>
            <p>The book is written in a vigorous style, and the author may well be accused of being highly
                    opinionated. Something about the style invites or forces disagreement, but, on the other hand, the
                    breadth of research and the vigor of the arguments tend to cow a critic. Strong statements can be
                    forgiven when there is evidence that the author has already done his homework. For the most part
                    this has to be conceded.</p>
            <p>The writing style is sprightly and at times a trifle florid. The first part of the book is somewhat
                    difficult to follow. As the narrative continues, the focus becomes clearer and the style sharper,
                    and interest heightens. Although Martin indicts—and perhaps convicts—the
                    majority of the commission and Brandeis of actions that ultimately were harmful to the railroads,
                    shippers, and the nation, he may deal too lightly with the railroad leaders themselves. Almost as
                    convincing a case could be made that the industry spokesmen were somewhat incompetent because they
                    failed to muster convincing data and to evaluate the nature of the opposition to their cause. This
                    does not exonerate the "archaic progressives" but does suggest that the other side
                    ought to have been clever enough to outmaneuver them.</p>
            <p>It is hard to believe that the root of the decline of the American <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-068-3-090"/> railroads was so largely embodied within the confines of the period and the forces with which
                    Martin deals. The seeds of difficulty may be located in an earlier period, and regulation does not
                    appear primarily responsible for the railroads’ demise, but elaboration of this position
                    would entail a lengthy argument not advanced here. Certain imputations from the statistical material
                    presented in the appendix also weaken the thesis rather than strengthen it. Finally, the author
                    expresses the intention to concentrate on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, the Illinois Central, and the Santa Fe to describe the physical and financial
                    transformation of American railroads in the Progressive Era. This declaration of intention was
                    hardly worthwhile since little is done along this line, particularly with regard to the Santa Fe.</p>
            <p>Although one can quibble with the book because it is written in such a virile manner, it probably
                    merits its first prize in relation to most of the books on this subject. It is provocative and
                    informative. An enormous amount of scholarship has gone into its production with a result likely to
                    please railroad buffs, historians, and critics of commission regulation and to nettle a few readers
                    not otherwise classified.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Henry Ford and Grass-roots America.</hi> By Reynold M. Wik. (<placeName>

                    $10.00.)</head>
            <p>Henry Ford appears to have an unending attraction for biographers, both amateur and professional. Wik
                    is a professional with a lifetime of research in farm technology to apply to his subject. He is
                    undertaking here to explain Ford's relationship to rural America: on one side, why and how
                    rural America regarded Ford as a folk hero; on the other, Ford's own attitudes toward
                    farmers and farming. There is something ironic in the picture. In his youth Ford so thoroughly
                    detested farm life that he left home as soon as he could to work with machinery in nearby <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As a successful industrialist he considered himself as having a special mission to use
                    mechanization for the benefit of the farmer, and rural America came to regard him as a miracle
                    worker with a special understanding of farm problems.</p>
            <p>Professor Wik has skillfully used newspapers and magazines, public relations and advertising
                    statements, and much archival material to depict this phenomenon. He gives the reader detailed
                    accounts of the impact of the Model T on rural life, Ford's efforts at tractor development,
                    his experiments with soybeans, his plan for fertilizer production at Muscle Shoals, and above all,
                    how farmers saw Henry Ford.</p>
            <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-068-3-091"/>
            <p>There may even be too much detail. At several points this reviewer found himself wishing for more of
                    what Wik thinks and less of what the editor of a small town paper or a Ford public relations man had
                    to say. Not that the unearthing of these opinions is to be denigrated; it is a valuable historical
                    achievement—but then the reader, or at least this reviewer, would like to know how a
                    mature scholar like Wik interprets it. For example, Chapter 5 is largely a compilation of
                    contemporary opinions pro and con the Fordson tractor. Wik is correct in stating that "No
                    account of the social impact of the farm tractor has ever been written" (p. 99), and to
                    present such an account was not his purpose. But the author does discuss Ford's
                    contribution to farm mechanization in a way that avoids rather than faces the issue. It also seems
                    odd to have Harry Ferguson mentioned only once (p. 97), and then with no reference to his
                    relationship with Ford.</p>
            <p>Wik offers his own evaluations of Ford in the context of this book. He agrees with practically
                    everyone who has tried it that Ford is a difficult personality to interpret. Two points call for
                    comment. Wik credits Ford with considerable scientific acumen, more so than Ford's other
                    biographers, in practical matters like plant chemistry and plastics. On the other hand he attempts,
                    not too successfully, to dismiss Ford as an inventor or even an innovator in automotive matters. Is
                    it really worth while belaboring the fact that Ford did not invent the automobile and was not the
                    first to dream of the cheap car or to try to realize it? What matters historically is
                    that none of Ford's predecessors could make the dream come true and Henry Ford did.</p>
            <p>Wik has made a major contribution to the literature on Ford, but even in his chosen field of
                    Ford's relationship with rural America he has not said the last word. He has, however,
                    clearly established that he is the best qualified person to say it.</p>

                    </placeName> Cox. (Hamden, Conn.: The Shoe String Press, Inc., 1972. Pp. xv, 280. Notes, tables.
                    $15.00.)</head>
            <p>The purpose of this book is to provide a compilation of voting statistics in tabular form for
                    national offices during the recent period of American political history. The major portion of the
                    volume is comprised of statistics concerning elections for President, senator, and representative by
                    state and for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The author also presents the sum of partisan votes for representative and the mean
                    partisan vote as measures of partisanship. Finally, a relatively complete <pb n="272" id="VAA4025-068-3-092"/> set of notes for each state is presented. The partisan complexion of
                    each state's congressional delegation, names of important minor parties, contests for short
                    terms, and endorsements are reported.</p>
            <p>Noting other compilations of electoral statistics, the author argues that none of the other studies
                    combines the reporting of data for national elections for each kind of constituency (national,
                    state, and congressional district) during a period of comparable length. Few other works report
                    notes of similar detail concerning voting distributions.</p>
            <p>Despite the care that the author has taken to insure accuracy in this collection of statistics, this
                    reviewer was disappointed by the scope of the book. The addition of a few pieces of information
                    would have greatly enhanced the value of the work for social scientists.</p>
            <p>First, a rudimentary analytic framework would have been helpful in aiding interpretation of the data.
                    Indications of partisan groupings of states and of the development of new groupings of states during
                    the period would have been helpful. Behaviorally oriented typologies can add immeasurably to a book
                    of this kind by helping the reader to structure the extremely complex subject matter. Genuine
                    innovation may also be a result of such activity.</p>
            <p>Usefulness of the volume would have been increased if voting turnout had been reported. Based on
                    estimates of eligible electors, turnout would have allowed rapid computation of roll-off, drop-off,
                    and other descriptive statistics that would have added a new dimension.</p>
            <p>Finally, a series of events occurred during this period that undoubtedly had a tremendous impact on
                    political partisanship and on popular participation in elections (in addition to minor party
                    challenges). Progressives and other political activists succeeded in establishing institutional
                    changes in electoral practices during the early portion of the period. Mandatory voter registration,
                    for example, was a reform that had gross consequences for voter participation in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Other institutional changes and historical events that are associated with each state's
                    voting distributions would appear to merit comment in the footnotes. Primary elections, the
                    institutionalization and (more recent) decline of Jim Crow laws and practices, hours the polls are
                    open, ballot form, enfranchisement, and other legal aspects of voting varied considerably by state.
                    Each has an impact on partisanship as well as on turnout.</p>
            <p>Although the brief introduction was difficult to follow and a bit stilted in several places, this is
                    in part due to presentation of highly qualified conditions for reading and interpreting electoral
                    records. This compilation of voting statistics is workmanlike in construction <pb n="273" id="VAA4025-068-3-093"/> and should be of considerable value as a reference volume for the
                    quantitatively oriented historian. The usefulness of the volume should be particularly marked for
                    scholars who do not have ready access to large scale data bases and modern digital computers.</p>

                    Kinsey, notes, index. $6.95.)</head>
            <p>During the past year two accounts of the life of Alfred C. Kinsey and his controversial research have
                    appeared, both by persons who had long association with him in the Institute for Sex Research at
                    Indiana University. This reviewer's outstanding impression of Mrs. Christenson's
                    book is that she has presented remarkably well an enormous amount of detail, much of it highly
                    technical. Kinsey's early work on gall wasps is described clearly, and the transition from
                    this to the later studies on human sexual behavior blends the two into a single study of individual
                    variation. As a lifelong resident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, having close ties with Indiana University, the author has used her knowledge of campus
                    life in tactful and effective ways to tell her story. Some of the best parts of the book recount the
                    Kinsey marriage, the establishment of the Kinsey's home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and their relations with their neighbors.</p>
            <p>Christenson notes Kinsey's estrangement in later years from all formal church
                    activity—even to the family's forbidding a daughter to become a church member at
                    the age of twelve because she was too young to make the decision. The author contrasts this with
                    Kinsey's early experiences as a member of a rigidly religious family; his interest in
                    Sunday School, scouting (an Eagle Scout), and the YMCA; and his more or less regular church
                    attendance up to about the time of his marriage.</p>
            <p>Kinsey's father, a self-made man without much formal education but a member of the teaching
                    staff of Stevens Institute at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hoboken</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
               </placeName>, had visions of Alfred's
                    becoming an engineer; but at the age of twenty, after two years as a student in the institute,
                    Alfred declared his independence and enrolled in Bowdoin College, attracted there by the program in
                    biology. Henceforth he was practically without support from his family. Following graduation from
                    Bowdoin, graduate work at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and a year on a traveling fellowship, he came to Indiana University as assistant
                    professor of zoology in 1920, advanced rapidly, and remained for the rest of his life.</p>
            <p>Kinsey is remembered in university circles for his broad interests <pb n="274" id="VAA4025-068-3-094"/> in living things and in hiking, camping, and other forms of outdoor life; for his gardening; his
                    passion for good music; his unconventional garden costume; and his abrupt manner. If this biography
                    falls short anywhere, it is in not giving an adequate picture of the flourish with which he liked to
                    do things and of the way in which, in the words of one of his assistants, he "liked to
                    shock people" (p. 67). This was shown by what one early acquaintance characterized as his
                    "tempestuous" piano playing (p. 27), his exaggerated use of numbers in discussing
                    the extent of his research, his dramatic drive across a dangerous bridge in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gt">Guatemala</country>
                    </placeName>, and his voice from Olympus manner of stating his views.</p>
            <p>The last years of Kinsey's life brought him much frustration. His sex research was both
                    highly praised and bitterly condemned, and he regarded much of the criticism as unjust. He was
                    turned down for an honorary degree at Bowdoin because of "imagined possible ridicule of his
                    research" (p. 30), the Sex Institute was in financial difficulty, there was some attempt to
                    identify his work with communist activities, and there was strong pressure from several directions
                    urging the university to discontinue support for his research. As a final blow, the physical
                    afflictions which had kept him out of military service in his early years, but which had been
                    concealed by his active life, finally caught up with him at the age of sixty-two.</p>
            <p>Any reader of this book should get a clearer view of Kinsey's work and a better
                    understanding of his methods and purposes.</p>

                    structures as well as to scenic areas of southern Indiana. The enclosed map, with locations of
                    entries given, is a most helpful addition to the text. The authors have defined southern Indiana as
                    approximately that portion of the state south of the National Road (which traverses the state via

                    which the editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> has seen. The Cooks welcome

                    This <hi rend="i">Select Bibliographic Guide</hi> suggests that the Archives of DePauw University
                    and Indiana Methodism contain manuscripts, tapes, and microfilms of considerable variety. For
                    instance, they include items regarding Charles A. and Mary Ritter Beard; Indiana railroad material
                    collected by Frank F. Hargrave; tapes of addresses by the noted scientist, Dr. Percy T. Julian; a
                    tape of a speech which Richard M. Nixon delivered, presumably at DePauw, in 1957; and microfilms of
                    records of the American Missionary Association dealing with abolitionist and freedmen work in
                    Indiana, 1840–1879. The archives were formally established in 1951 under the leadership
                    of Worth M. Tippy. Eleanore Cammack served as archivist from 1955 to 1971, when she was succeeded by
                    David J. Olson. Useful as this and similar publications are, there is a growing need for a general
                    bibliography of manuscripts, tapes, and microfilms in all Indiana colleges and universities. Such a
                    worthy project—if developed practically—would merit generous financial

                    under Bushrod Rust Johnson during the Civil War frequently regretted that their commander had been
                    underrated and that justice to him had been "very tardy" (p. 383). In this
                    biography Cummings attempts <hi rend="i">to</hi> rescue Johnson from oblivion, but the Ohio born <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName>, whose choice of a military career ran counter to his heritage, "emerges from
                    the shadows as neither hero nor antihero, but something of both—a figure often bland and
                    undramatic, a man of multiple contradictions" (p. 379). In the final analysis
                    Johnson—well meaning, often heroic, but confused, inept, and foolish—fails in
                    almost everything he attempts: his military career in both the <placeName>

                    Despite the current emphasis on quantitative history, Merk's traditional account of
                    economic developments in Wisconsin during the Civil War era remains a classic. Originally published
                    in 1916, the volume has as its theme the economic impact of the Civil War on the Badger State and
                    the geographic region of which it is a part. Although the author focuses on the four years of actual
                    conflict, his discussion of agriculture, industry, transportation, and commerce ranges over the
                    entire period between the two years of financial panic, 1857 and 1873. Research for this volume in
                    scattered and often fragmentary records was prodigious, and the work still stands an an
                    indispensable starting point for historians interested in regional economic history. The State
                    Historical Society of Wisconsin should be commended for issuing this second edition with revised
                    illustrations. As Merk notes in his preface to the second edition: the theme of the work
                    "has a perennial interest, as wars still shape the lives of states and nations. It contains
                    lessons for the present in parallels that are at least suggestive" (p. 9). <hi rend="i">Lorna Lutes Sylvester, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    Pennsylvania Cavalry during the Civil War. Although apparently unknown to each other, the two
                    diarists "seem to have been cast from the same mold" (p. ix). Both expressed
                    similar ideas about soldiering and the purpose of the war and had obvious pride in their state and
                    regiment. Use of their accounts adds a continuity and depth of feeling to what might otherwise have
                    been merely a military record. Rowell has written well a documented story of a regiment which
                    "may have traveled farther and have seen more of the South than any other group in the
                    Federal army" (p. viii). <hi rend="i">Lorna Lutes Sylvester, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    </placeName> in February, 1970, in connection with a meeting of the Council for Urban Affairs (pp.

                    </placeName> in October, 1970, in support of the candidacy of Congressman Richard Roudebush to the

                    </placeName> (pp. 915–25). In one of the later speeches the President notes that the
                    Hoosier State "has sometimes been called ‘The Valley of Democracy,’
                    for this is the place where the voice of the people has always been heard loud and clear"
                    (p. 915). One wonders whether the President or one of his ghostwriters has become acquainted with

                    </placeName>, Indiana, originally published in 1915, is an event of more than usual import. Though
                    county histories are often puffy and have blemishes which make it essential that they be used with
                    care, nonetheless they are in various ways invaluable both to historians and genealogists. In part

                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName> was one of Indiana's leading counties in the pioneer era and has remained of
                    significance ever since and also because of the comprehensive nature of Reifel's account,
                    this volume has much value as a source for state as well as local history. Moreover, considering its
                    size, its bargain price at $20 should be an inducement toward the publication of other
                    county histories which could also be reproduced inexpensively. This reviewer has both enjoyed and

                    Pamphlet, $.75.) The Reverend Rehmer has written an introductory but informative survey
                    of Lutheranism in pioneer Indiana. This booklet results from his continuing interest in and
                    considerable study of this important religious group within the <placeName>

                    </placeName> element whose numerical importance in Indiana has been exceeded only by the English
                    stock. Rehmer exhibits much understanding of the general historical background from which
                    Lutheranism <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-068-3-101"/> sprang as well as Lutheran beginnings on the middle
                    western frontier. Comments or questions about this work should be sent to R. F. Rehmer, 100 S.
