                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. Indented lines
                    use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag with values of "indent1"
                    for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All split lines are
                    attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for the final
                    portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as

                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                    <l>What <emph rend="i">is</emph>ânot what it stands forâis the theme</l>
                    <l>Of Natureâs teaching. Let us learn that first,</l>
                    <l>Grave lessons learnt of cosmic constancy</l>

                    <l>Work in us patience. Thence, more safely true</l>
                    <l>Live we our lives, lawâtempered, soberly,</l>
                    <l>But ever lawârewarded. And, unchilled</l>
                    <l>By doubt of irony in sun or sky,</l>
                    <l>We learn to smile up in the face of fact</l>
                    <l>And praise its fitness, fitly. Let us learn:</l>
                    <l>For certainty attained we acquiesce;</l>
                    <l>And acquiescence wins the way to Happiness.</l>

                    <l><hi>HARK!</hi> how the inarticulate hum of crowds</l>
                    <l>Grows to a sadâvoiced, individual cry</l>
                    <l>Of massive meaning: an immense demandâ</l>
                    <l>Flung from a deeper depth than consciousness</l>
                    <l>Up to the highest sky of thronÃ¨d law;â</l>
                    <l>It questions Cause and Fate, with passioned will</l>
                    <l>To know why souls are driven through the world</l>
                    <l>From womb to grave, relentlessly, and forced</l>
                    <l>To ache all day but to forget at night.</l>
                    <l>Hear how the babble grows! A piteous throng</l>
                    <l>Swear by their gods a new lie every day:</l>
                    <l>Each busy with some flimsy, trivial thread,</l>
                    <l>Manâwoven, which he deems of fibre fit</l>
                    <l>To string the worlds upon, or moor the ship</l>

                    <l rend="ti-1">We want a gospel, brothers!âsome fair truth</l>
                    <l>To tell to souls all sickened with despair</l>
                    <l>At daily missing of their daily hope,</l>
                    <l>Spent with the ceaseless beating up the stream</l>
                    <l>Of counterâcircumstance, or fiercer tides</l>
                    <l>Within the soul;âso spent, and asking why.</l>
                    <l>We want a gospel that is not a lie,</l>
                    <l>Nor will be proved one in toâmorrowâs light;</l>
                    <l>Yet no severe negation, to undo</l>
                    <l>The meaning of the world for those who toil:</l>
                    <l>No utterance, however propped with proof,</l>
                    <l>That shall untune the heart, or paralyse</l>
                    <l>Menâs will to live. Eâen truth rings false when told</l>
                    <l>In ears unripe for hearing; and to eyes</l>
                    <l>Unready for the strength of its great shine</l>
                    <l>The prophetâvision of a transient Self</l>

                    <l>Seems but a lurid mockery of dawn:</l>

                    <l>For aye demanding, and when all is given</l>
                    <l>Sending them empty down the years to die.</l>
