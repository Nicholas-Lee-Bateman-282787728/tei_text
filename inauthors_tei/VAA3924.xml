						<l><hi rend="b">T</hi>HE village sexton tolls a solemn knell,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">As o&apos;er the bier the snow-white robe is spread,</l>
						<l>The dull vibrations of that passing bell,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Are tones of pity for the youthful dead.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Six manly forms convey the corse along</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The narrow path, between the turfy mounds</l>
						<l>That hide from vision, of this mournful throng,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The pallid dwellers of these sacred grounds.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>They rest the bier beside a fresh cut grave,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And tender hands remove the coffin lid,</l>
						<l>And grant the broken-hearted what they crave,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">A long last look at her the casket hid.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>While grief grows wild the vault receives its guest,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Sharp contrast with the giddy scenes of mirth,</l>
						<l>Pale rigid forms, thus laid to such a rest,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Inanimate, consigned to mother earth.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>The sober sextons seize the burnish&apos;d steel,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The grumbling clods roll down on precious clay,</l>
						<l>Wild grief again bursts forth, and makes us feel</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The threads that snap on such a parting day.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>If all the faces that lie sleeping here</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Were at one scene presented to our view,</l>
						<l>Our friends and foes would, all alike, grow dear,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And tainted lives would vanish as the dew.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>Death does not wait for age our face to plow,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">As marbl&apos;d slabs stand pointing here to show;</l>
						<l>The babe, the youth, the old are sleeping now,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Wrapp&apos;d in the robe of silence just below.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>The arbiter of time has numbered well</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Man&apos;s days of pilgrimage upon this earth,</l>
						<l>And each vibration of that village bell</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Gives some incentive to substantial worth.</l>

						<ref target="ref_002" rend="super">*</ref>This poem was first published in one of the
						Indiana papers. A certain man, under the pseudonym of &quot;Silent Partner,&quot;
						attempted to criticise it, being angry at the author, who he had wilfully and
						maliciously lied on. <lg>
							<l>&quot;The dull vibrations of that passing bell,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Are tones of pity of the youthful dead.&quot;</l>
						</lg>
						<p>&quot;Who ever heard of tones of pity coming from the dead&quot;--one of his
							criticisms.</p>
						<p>Below is a portion of the reply to his criticism.</p>
						<lg>
							<l>* Such fiendish lies unnoticed cannot pass,</l>
							<l>E&apos;en tho&apos; invented by a shallow &quot;ass &quot;</l>
							<l>And as we read we can but think in shape,</l>
							<l>His head&apos;s much like the South American ape;</l>
							<l>I do disdain to fight the grinning monkeys,</l>
							<l>E&apos;en tho&apos; they&apos;re aided by the long-eared donkeys,</l>
							<l>Fools always think in prose they&apos;re very strong,</l>
							<l>And henceforth plod their clumsy pen along,</l>
							<l>But if not too far gone in lunacy,</l>
							<l>He may learn yet that Jacks too often bray;</l>
							<l>I trust he may have left a little mind,</l>
							<l>To behold himself a libel on mankind,</l>
							<l>And that the pen he uses in its place</l>
							<l>Serves every time to pen his own disgrace,</l>
							<l>And lines address&apos;d to me but pass on by,</l>
							<l>For all conceive he is the hero of the lie.</l>
							<l>Nature taught me ever to despise</l>
							<l>The lying fool that slinks beneath mine eyes,</l>
							<l>Yet what known critic ever can excel,</l>
							<l>The one that takes a dead man for a bell,</l>
							<l>Who never heard before of sallow clay,</l>
							<l>But &quot;yaller&quot; is the critic&apos;s preferr&apos;d way.</l>
							<l>Oh! that Old Zell had employed him to o&apos;erlook,</l>
							<l>And criticise his large and wasted book.</l>
							<l>For soon &apos;twill perish with the author&apos;s name</l>
							<l>Crowded&apos;out by &quot;Silent Partner&apos;s&quot; fame.</l>
							<l>Changed orthography and meanings too,</l>
							<l>When once purloined by his close review;</l>
							<l>Oh! Webster, Webster! soon your day is past,</l>
							<l>Impossible for you to ever last.</l>
							<l>You cannot bear inspection by so great</l>
							<l>A genius--so prepare to meet your fate.</l>

						<l>Phantom lovers stand and kiss;--</l>
						<l>Cautiously did I advance,</l>

					<note id="note_004"><ref target="ref_004" rend="super">*</ref>This little poem is grounded

						excited him that on seeing an old castle across the river torn to fragments, he left his
						place in the school-room, and had only gone a few paces from it, when it shared a
						similar fate from the elements. Thus his life seems to have been miraculously

						<l>And while I sat there gazing</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Through the flashes of the night,</l>
						<l>A quick boom and flash of brilliance,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Came and went, and dimmed my sight.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>And I gazed through vivid lightnings.--</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">How my heart did ache to see,</l>
						<l>The old castle torn to fragments,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">That so long was dear to me,</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Still I sat there, lonely, listening</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To the solemn distant thunder,</l>
						<l>When another blast of lightning,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Rent that dear old home asunder.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Then I feared that in the madness,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Of the lightning&apos;s furious pranks,</l>
						<l>I&apos;d be killed within the school-house,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And burnt among the planks.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>And as I sat there thinking</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Whither I should now repair,</l>
						<l>A soft voice seemed to whisper,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">&quot;Do not trust to fate in there!&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Than I started out for refuge,--</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To some place, I knew not where,--</l>
						<l>When the school-house, like a feather,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Bravely rode off on the air.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>While the rain fell fast around me,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And through floods I had to roam,</l>
						<l>Naught but heavenly lights to guide me</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To any place but home.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb n="21" id="VAA3924-021"/>
					<lg>
						<l>On through the storm I wandered,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">While unbridled lightnings swept,</l>
						<l>As the thunder rolled around me,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">While my lonely course I kept.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>No one save God to love me,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Or to guide my feeble form,</l>
						<l>But a voice seemed to whisper,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">&quot;Thou shalt surely stand the storm.&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>A petition then I uttered,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To the God that reigns above,</l>
						<l>Fervent as my heart could fashion,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Full of reverence and love.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Oh God! I cried, (and not in vain),</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Behold an orphan child,</l>
						<l>Take him to thy protective care,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">From this cold blast so wild.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Then I cast my eyes to heaven,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And the clouds appeared no more,</l>
						<l>Yet, the river&apos;s white caps rolled,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And the rain had ceased to pour.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>A gentle calm spread o&apos;er me,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">As I on my journey walk&apos;d,</l>
						<l>Now and then a jar from heaven,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">As the distant thunder talk&apos;d.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Fainter, fainter grew their voices,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Till in distance died away,</l>
						<l>And a calm was spread before me,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Where the forests&apos; monarchs lay.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb n="22" id="VAA3924-022"/>
					<lg>
						<l>Then I gazed across the river,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">High above its angry lashes,</l>
						<l>To behold the old church steeple;</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">But alas! it lay in ashes.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>The fact then burst upon me,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I was in the world alone,</l>
						<l>Without a church to worship in,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">A school-house, or a home.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>What must I do, and whither go!</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To God I thus did pray;</l>
						<l>Send angels down to pilot me,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Or bear my soul away.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>And then I thought the God above,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Had thus far favored me,</l>
						<l>I&apos;ll not give up, I&apos;ll bear my lot,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">But from these scenes I&apos;ll flee.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Perhaps I may some future time,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The sympathies receive,</l>
						<l>Of some responsive heart I&apos;ll meet,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And some good end achieve.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Why should I stay in torture here!</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">It&apos;s true I have some friends,</l>
						<l>But many who appear as such,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Prove only to be fiends.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Before I go I must repair,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Where my heart&apos;s love doth stay,</l>

						<l rend="ti-2">My parents&apos; precious clay.</l>

						<l>Oh! mother, mother, here I stand</l>

					<lg>

						<l><hi rend="b">O</hi>NE night around my couch there came,</l>

						<l>A Peri we will call its name,--</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Came wandering and forlorn.</l>
					</lg>

						<l>Its ruby lips and graceful speech,</l>

						<l>&quot;Way off in the immortal space,</l>

					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>&quot;I was unruly so they say,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Condemned and banished here,</l>
						<l>That you may know where angels stay,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">That good alone is there.</l>
					</lg>
					<note id="note_005"><ref target="ref_005" rend="super">*</ref>About the year 1867, where I
						was going to school, there were some children whose parents were spiritualists going to
						the same school. One of them related to me a circumstance that he said occured at their

						hands upon my face and cut many kind of capers, when suddenly it vanished away and left
						me to revel over the matter.&quot; He further said that he believed the good angels had
						banished it from their domain. </note>

					<lg>
						<l>&quot;Oh! do not fear I ask of you,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">For angels sent me here,</l>
						<l>That I might some good for you do,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And crown you when you&apos;re there.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>&quot; Believe me, if you can, I say,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I&apos;ll call some other season,</l>
						<l>When night alone bedims the day,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And to you then I&apos;ll reason.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>&quot;You may think strange of such a call,</l>

						<l>I ask you to divert your sway,</l>

						<l>Unloose the chain that&apos;s binding me,</l>

						<l>Here in this Land where Freedom wanes,</l>
						<l>And Lord, and God, supremely reigns;--</l>
						<l>Can we proclaim America&apos;s free!</l>
						<l>When bound down in such tyranny?</l>
						<l>American braves, why did you war,</l>
						<l>To free yourself from kingly power?</l>
						<l>I ask in name of God above,</l>
						<l>Was not the war for freedom&apos;s love?</l>
						<l>Why then should we thus stand oppressed,</l>
						<l>By men who fortunes have possessed?</l>
						<l>You who have bled in honest toil,</l>
						<l>To tread the earth as freemen&apos;s soil,</l>
						<l>Whose bones lie bleaching with the dust,</l>
						<l>Achieved an end of wickedness:--</l>
						<l>America was never free</l>
						<l>For naught but lords, not you and me:--</l>

						<l>Fathers, sons, and brothers too,</l>
						<l>Stand face to face, and murder do,</l>

						<l>Oh! hush the cry of freedom&apos;s bliss,</l>
						<l>When born in such a world as this;</l>
						<l>God has ordained that men be free,</l>
						<l>And not sink down in misery,</l>
						<l>E&apos;en tho&apos; we sink in meagreness,</l>
						<l>Bereft, and left, all moneyless,</l>

						<l>The lord and king will lose this place--</l>
						<l>For he will reap as high reward,</l>
						<l>In heaven, as our old king and lord;</l>
						<l>Thank God, I do, with all my might,</l>
						<l>For such an act of equal right.</l>
						<l>You thieves and lords at once unbind,</l>
						<l>The cords you&apos;ve around the poor entwined,</l>
						<l>And give them right to look and see,</l>
						<l>The road that leads to liberty,</l>
						<l>We would not ask so much of you,</l>
						<l>If we were not created too,</l>
						<l rend="i">By the same great power that created you,</l>
						<l>We can feel oppression&apos;s great,</l>
						<l>When bound in a tyrannic state,</l>
						<l>God gave us life and strength to know,</l>
						<l>When lords and Gods oppress us so,</l>
						<l>He made us all I know quite well,</l>
						<l>Not to be ruled by men that dwell</l>
						<l>Upon this earth like the dumb brute:--</l>
						<l>The miscreants to persecute--</l>
						<l>God brought all men upon this earth,</l>
						<l>From the same blood, and gave them birth,</l>
						<l>That they might always brothers be,</l>

						<l>Oh! then, I pray, assume no more,</l>

						<l>And brother take their brother&apos;s dower;</l>
						<l>Oh! man, depraved and full of sin,</l>
						<l>How can you such a life begin,</l>
						<l>A brother takes his brother&apos;s life</l>
						<l>From neither malice, hate or strife,</l>

						<l>Beneath his master&apos;s vile commanding tones,</l>
						<l>Yet, he must not e&apos;en cry in self-defence,</l>
						<l>Or forty stripes will be his recompense,</l>
						<l>Lo! he retires to his lone couch at night</l>
						<l>Tired from the labor for his cruel wight,</l>
						<l>And thus he goes bound down in tyranny,</l>
						<l>Unknown to hearts that nourish sympathy,</l>
						<l>The God above will soon proclaim him free,</l>
						<l>And foil the hand of grasping tyranny,</l>

						<l>Time&apos;s sweetest wing has sped forever on,</l>
						<l>And left our records blank and quite unknown,</l>
						<l>Gaze back upon the idle hours enjoyed,</l>
						<l>And see how well they might have been employed,</l>
						<l>But then the days of youth are not for fame,</l>
						<l>But merely to applaud the merry game;</l>
						<l>Blessed be the day when science first does gain,</l>
						<l>And crush bad thoughts from out thy youthful brain.</l>
						<l>When mediocre&apos;s jests will only tease</l>
						<l>The once lost minds they did so truly please--</l>
						<l>But vernal winds that shake the verdant leaf,</l>
						<l>You thrill me with that lone and solemn grief,</l>
						<l>That time has wrought and clasped so firm on me,</l>
						<l>Since we did jest beneath this old beach tree.</l>
						<l>But, oh! to me, how changed and how sublime,</l>
						<l>Is such a change that teaches me to rhyme,</l>
						<l>And you to dive in murky depths to find,</l>
						<l>What seems beyond the comprehensive mind,</l>
						<l>But wide you spread that grasping talent round,</l>
						<l>And center&apos;d it with energy profound;</l>
						<l>Upon the tangled puzzles, that do tease--</l>
						<l>And only serve such minds as yours to please;</l>
						<l>The saffron leaves that fall from fragile stems,</l>
						<l>Are fairer to me than the golden gems</l>
						<l>Of costly bawbles, decked in all the art,</l>
						<l>That man&apos;s inventive genius can impart.</l>
						<l>The trees adorn&apos;d with nature&apos;s dusky robe,</l>
						<l>Form but a paradise here on this globe,</l>
						<l>To me, when they inhale the balmy wails</l>
						<l>Through the dull forest of alternate flails</l>
						<l>Which makes them bow majestically and creak,</l>
						<l>And, in a voice familiar to me, speak</l>
						<l>Of past events, melodious to my ear,</l>
						<pb n="47" id="VAA3924-047"/>
						<l>That transpired in these sober regions here.</l>
						<l>This forest, and its amber&apos;d nice retreats,</l>
						<l>Beguile me to its verdur&apos;d mossy seats,</l>
						<l>And satisfies my feeble languish&apos;d mind,</l>
						<l>For which my muse seems now so much inclined.</l>
						<l>Thee, mighty forest, where the towering trees</l>
						<l>Protect thy inmates with thy tranquil lees,</l>
						<l>O&apos;erspread the earth in which you plant your roots,</l>
						<l>With tinted foliage of thy many shoots;</l>
						<l>Thro&apos; thy retreats the wand&apos;ring hunter roves,</l>
						<l>When frosts have powdered up thy dwarfy groves</l>
						<l>With cautiousness he darts his flashing eye,</l>
						<l>Through drooping boughs, toward the ethereal sky;</l>
						<l>On leafless spray he sees the pigeon perch--</l>
						<l>The downy game he started out to search,</l>
						<l>With noiseless tread he cautiously advanced,</l>
						<l>His staring eyes toward it fairly danced;</l>
						<l>He approaches soft the old oak by the mead,</l>
						<l>His deadly weapon raised--he draws his bead,</l>
						<l>With certain aim up to his piercing eye,</l>
						<l>A heavy peal breaks on the frozen sky,</l>
						<l>The lapwing feels the hissing leaden ball--</l>
						<l>Pierced thro&apos; and lifeless, earthward it doth fall;</l>
						<l>His game wrapped in its feathery dress so nice,</l>
						<l>Free from the torture of the hunter&apos;s vice.</l>
						<l>Before him oft the lark soars up with care<ref id="ref_010" target="note_010"

						<l>There, there he muses in those realms serene,</l>
						<l>A heaven to him is this sober scene</l>
						<l>To watch the fledgeling owlet by him shoot,</l>
						<l>Athwart the forest at the clumsy coot,--</l>
						<l>The russet leaves crash&apos;neath his heavy tread,</l>
						<l>Which makes the wild bird of the forest dread</l>
						<l>His foes approach--so to secure a flight,</l>
						<l>On sombre wings he dashes out of sight--</l>
						<l>The hunter gazes up and &apos;round to see,</l>
						<l>And suddenly his eyes behold a tree</l>
						<l>Inscribed with these initials--A. N. C.</l>
						<l>And the date, &quot;What can th&apos; inscription be?&quot;</l>
						<l>He says, and gently thrusts his gun aside,</l>
						<l>His trembling hands o&apos;er smooth cut types do glide,</l>
						<l>Then peers around the other side to see,</l>
						<l>And there beholds the letters of M. C.</l>
						<l>Carved thirty years before this hunter&apos;s tread</l>
						<l>Was ever heard within the forest&apos;s bed.</l>
						<l>One generation of God&apos;s little race,</l>
						<l>Almost since these names occupied the place,</l>
						<l>I approached the hunter, this was his remark:</l>
						<l>&quot;Whose names are those stamped in that beechen bark?</l>
						<l>It shocked me when I read the date and name,</l>
						<l>To know that years ago while hunting game,</l>
						<l>My father carved his initials on this tree,</l>
						<l>To make men wonder, if by chance they&apos;d see</l>
						<l>Them thus displayed in such a wildwood place,</l>
						<l>And every letter in artistic grace;</l>
						<l>It was a book with all unfolded pages,</l>
						<l>And had been opened to wild men for ages,</l>
						<l>Telling all who passed the same thing many times,</l>
						<l>If any chance to read the initial lines.&quot;</l>
						<pb n="49" id="VAA3924-049"/>
						<l>The hunter stooped, his gun he firmly grasped</l>
						<l>And to his aching breast &apos;twas closely clasped</l>
						<l>Then giving vent to wailing cries of grief,</l>
						<l>Petitioning the Lord to give his soul relief.</l>
						<l>All was now clear; he knew him years ago,</l>
						<l>The adoration from his heart did glow,</l>
						<l>And crimson flush&apos;d his old and furrowed face:--</l>
						<l>&quot;The mirth that transpired in this sober place,</l>
						<l>&quot;Enough to know,&quot; said he, &quot;oh! glorious time,</l>
						<l>When music echoed thro&apos; this copse sublime,</l>
						<l>Piped forth from species of the lapwing kind,</l>
						<l>In warbling notes of melody refined:--</l>
						<l>Oh! take me, take me to yon lovely dale,</l>
						<l>There let me live, and die, within that vale;</l>
						<l>Where nothing save the wild refreshing note</l>
						<l>Can lull me into death--&quot;oh! thou remote,</l>
						<l>Consoling forest, if I live one hour,</l>
						<l>&apos;Tis for thee, and thy sweet perfuming flower,</l>
						<l>I&apos;ll seek thy shady, cool, and calm retreat,</l>
						<l>And there let life and death in combat meet,</l>
						<l>And struggle for their victory; and when</l>
						<l>The duel&apos;s o&apos;er the weeping foliage then,</l>
						<l>Will be the all that mourns my aged loss,</l>
						<l>Uncoffined, and untombed on thy green moss.</l>
						<l>There let me rest this then comingling dust,</l>
						<l>That is consigned to the Almighty&apos;s trust:</l>
						<l>Away with life! what is it now to me,</l>
						<l>That I may dread and bid it from me flee,</l>
						<l>I&apos;ll not, when it alone can give me rest,</l>
						<l>And stop that aching in my tortured breast.</l>
						<l>Oh! death! ten thousand times I&apos;d welcome you,</l>

						<l>From thee, so long and still, to me so near,</l>
						<l>The brooklet and its silvery gliding waves,</l>
						<l>Where oft the languish&apos;d hunter stoops and laves</l>
						<l>To quench his thirst, and soothe the aching pain;</l>

						<l>Where thoughts of love echoed from ear to ear,</l>
						<l>And ev&apos;ry bough twined amorous &apos;round its dear,</l>
						<l>And then to change the scene, soft mirth would flow,</l>
						<l>From hearts where love was ebbing faint and low;</l>

						<l>We&apos;d seat ourselves upon the mossy log,</l>
						<l>And gather leaves as fair as tinted flowers,</l>

						<l>That modest flower that sat beside me there</l>
						<l>With bloom of youth impressed with beauty rare,</l>
						<l>Upon her sable brow, now sweetly sleeps,</l>
						<l>Low, silent, &apos;neath where fern and ivy creeps,</l>
						<l>Alas, alas! like some fair flower of May,</l>
						<l>The thread of life was snapped, and swept away</l>
						<l>My Mary on a bright mid-summer&apos;s day.</l>

					<head>DEDICATING ODE.</head>
					<lg>
						<l><hi rend="b">W</hi>E&apos;VE met to dedicate</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To God&apos;s devoted grace,</l>
						<l>A church we approbate--</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Salvation to our race.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>We sing in lyric song,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And praise the God above,--</l>
						<l>The notes will all prolong,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">That sing redeeming love.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Thro&apos; all our heavenly lays,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Strike no discordant air,</l>
						<l>Let God direct our ways,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And all for Him prepare.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>No more the heathen sings,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Nor lulls the myth to sleep</l>
						<l>He bows to sacred things--</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Repenting, he doth weep.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>We bow around Thy shrine,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To extol Thy loving name,</l>
						<l>And praise Thy works divine,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Through all this wide domain.</l>

					<head>THE THREE SONS.</head>
					<lg>
						<l><hi rend="b">I</hi>M one o&apos; the three o&apos; father&apos;s sons,</l>

						<l>One follows swift, the other shuns,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The course that I pursue;</l>

						<l>That ev&apos;ry seed&apos;s just like its kind,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">In substance and in look.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>I sometimes think that this is so,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Because I saw it there,</l>
						<l>And then I think-and, too, I know,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">That we&apos;re from the same pair;</l>
						<l>I was a gen&apos;rous boy, they say,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Kind-hearted, bold and brave,</l>
						<l>And ev&apos;ry mite I threw away,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">One like it he would save.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb n="72" id="VAA3924-073"/>
					<lg>
						<l>And now his store has grown to be,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">A large and handsome one,</l>
						<l>While mine&apos;s so scant I can but see,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">It&apos;s less than when begun;--</l>
						<l>I was not rude enough to swear,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I&apos;ve been just so from youth,</l>
						<l>Tho&apos; I&apos;d fight an&apos; pull my brother&apos;s hair,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">(&quot;An&apos; sometimes tell the truth.&quot;)</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>When I was spendin&apos; roun&apos; the stores,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Enjoy&apos;n&apos; social pleasure,</l>
						<l>Too big to work, an&apos; on my &quot;Oars&quot;</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">He tugged away for treasures;</l>
						<l>&quot;His bank kept growin&apos; day by day,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">An&apos; mine kept growin&apos; too,</l>
						<l>But growing in a different way,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">From what my brother&apos;s grew.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>He&apos;d add a bauble to his pile,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And I&apos;d take one from mine,</l>
						<l>Then he&apos;d turn around and smile,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">As if I dress&apos;d too fine:</l>
						<l>And day by day my money went,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">&apos;Till, alas! I&apos;d squandered all,</l>
						<l>And then I learn&apos;d what savin&apos; meant,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And pride it took a fall.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>My tender hands unknown to work,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I knew not what to do,</l>

						<pb n="73" id="VAA3924-074"/>
						<l>With hands all checkered up with sores,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I tugged away awhile,</l>
						<l>&apos;Twas not such fun as when on &quot;Oars,&quot;</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Dress&apos;d up in dandy style.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>I chopp&apos;d, I sow&apos;d, I talk&apos;d, I blow&apos;d,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And tried a start to gain,</l>
						<l>I told &apos;em all how much I know&apos;d,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">But this was all in vain;</l>
						<l>They&apos;d listen not to my appeals</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">About my active brain,</l>
						<l>Bein&apos; always ready for my meals,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">They talked about my &quot;grain.&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>They said, &quot;work went agan&apos;st it so,&quot;</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And I sort&apos;r think it did,</l>
						<l>For when they next to work did go,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I ran away and hid.</l>
						<l>Straight way up to the town I went,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">All tired and stiff and sore,</l>
						<l>Without a shilling or a cent,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To strain my credit more.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>I made a vow I would not toil,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">E&apos;en if starvation came,</l>
						<l>An&apos; this here frame a dungeon&apos;s spoil,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And disgracer o&apos; the name:</l>
						<l>I said, &quot;if in a week I&apos;m jugged,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I&apos;m going to make my mark,</l>
						<l>I will humbug, or be humbugged,&quot;</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">So I launched my little bark.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb n="74" id="VAA3924-075"/>
					<lg>
						<l>I&apos;d wrote a book on common sense</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">(But forgot to put that in),</l>
						<l>And I got bluff&apos;d some, and the smoke was dense</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">When the people said &quot;&apos;twas thin.&quot;</l>
						<l>But I paid &apos;tention to their speech,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And let such judges be</l>
						<l>(Yet, every man I tried to reach</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I found him smarter&apos;n me.)</l>

					<lg>
						<l>My credit wasted all away,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And money, too, clean gone,</l>
						<l>And no place on this earth to stay,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Where welcome seem&apos;d to dawn.</l>
						<l>But I went to see young brother then,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To know what he had done,</l>
						<l>I found him class&apos;d with little men,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">(And fame, like mine, he&apos;d won.)</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>We talk&apos;d an&apos; parl&apos;ed an&apos; agreed</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To gain our rank in life,</l>
						<l>That we&apos;d at once the task proceed</l>

						<l>The road to <hi rend="i">brother&apos;s</hi> house we took,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To get advice from him,</l>
						<l>(And money) this did make him look,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Pale, haggard, sad, and grim.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>He told us that we were &apos;most lost,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">But may be we could find</l>
						<l>Some plain clad cre&apos;ture not embossed,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Or polished, or refin&apos;d,</l>
						<pb n="75" id="VAA3924-076"/>
						<l>That would be willing to disgrace</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Her life for evermore,</l>
						<l>An&apos; toil to aid us to replace</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Our credit an&apos; our store.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>To get some wealth we ask&apos;d his name</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To take a check safe thro&apos;,</l>
						<l>He said (&quot;that&apos;s just about the same</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">As giv&apos;n it to you,&quot;)</l>
						<l>But then his huge iron safe he op&apos;d,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">(With a mourner&apos;s sigh,)</l>
						<l>An&apos; pip&apos;d forth that he truly hop&apos;d</l>

					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>He gin us forty-five ($) apiece,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">We went staight to the stores,</l>
						<l>An&apos; dress&apos;d ourselves as sleek as grease,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">An&apos; &quot;laid upon our Oars&quot;</l>
						<l>Two lasses then we tried to find,--</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">But they <hi rend="i">look&apos;d</hi> us with contempt;</l>
						<l>An&apos; <hi rend="i">all</hi> the beautiful female kind,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Said, they&apos;d rather be exempt.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>(I tole&apos;m that I was the author o&apos; &quot;Common Sense,&quot;)</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">An&apos; they laugh&apos;d right in my face,</l>

					</lg>
					<pb n="76" id="VAA3924-077"/>

						<l>We tried a class some low&apos;r down,</l>

						<l rend="ti-2">An&apos; she married me for fun.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>(At last)--an old and wrinkl&apos;d thing,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Smil&apos;d on me one day,</l>
						<l>She wore a cap an&apos; pewter ring,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">An&apos; hair all turnin&apos; gray,</l>
						<l>I met her with a kind o&apos; grin,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">As tho&apos; I didn&apos;t care,</l>
						<l>She was as ugly as &quot;Old sin,&quot;</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">With all her dappled hair.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>I told my brother I&apos;d foun&apos; a wife,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">But not the han&apos;som&apos; kind,</l>
						<l>That said she&apos;d bless my future life,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Though she was not refined.</l>
						<l>I show&apos;d her to him the next day,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">He, musing on her, gazed,</l>
						<l>And when she turned to go away,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">He stood abash&apos;d, and &apos;mazed.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>He said that he&apos;d remain alone,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Forever an old bach,</l>
						<l>Before he&apos;d live with such a drone,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">As ugly as the &quot;scratch,&quot;</l>
						<pb n="77" id="VAA3924-078"/>
						<l>And that the cotton and whale bone,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">That fills where nature fails;</l>
						<l>And paint upon her face alone,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Shows well that art prevails.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>I stood stock still and work&apos;d my lips,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">For I didn&apos;t like it at all,</l>
						<l>That he should be there throw&apos;n&apos; his chips,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">E&apos;en if I was takin&apos; a fall,</l>
						<l>So I told him I wanted no more o&apos; his talk,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">For I tho&apos;t I was doing just right,</l>
						<l>An&apos; I, an&apos; the slender Malissa Jane Hawk,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Were married the very next night.</l>

						<l>I never had time to this day to regret,</l>

						<l>An&apos; now it has been almost ten years,</l>

						<l>Where all the renown was to come I expected,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Passed off on the wind with my fame,</l>

					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Since books I&apos;ve so disdain&apos;d &apos;em to edit,</l>

					</lg>

						<l>Within these sober realms at calmest even,</l>

						<l>He turns and reads the &quot;Psalm of Life,&quot; and heaven,</l>

					<lg>
						<l>And there he ponders o&apos;er thy speaking pages,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Within those breathing solitudes of groves,</l>
						<l>And pleasure prompts his mind as he engages,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To pay some tribute to the bard he loves.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>The songs you sang have tarried in my bosom;</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Since early youth, I&apos;ve read them with delight,</l>
						<l>And in my soul I&apos;ve felt the budding blossom</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Expand until it almost came to light.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>I oft have feasted on thy thoughts and numbers,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Thy gentle cadences fell from my tongue,</l>
						<l>Since in my heart, the song you wakened slumber&apos;s,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">There may it <hi rend="i">live</hi> when your last song is sung.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>But when at last death visits thy calm pillow,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And asks thee gently to lay down thy lyre,</l>
						<l>Then o&apos;er thy grave the lonely bending willow</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Will catch the echoes that thou didst inspire.</l>

						<l>And hear the olden music float with glee,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Where everything to-day is still and drear</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And not a note I love falls on my ear.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Alas! alas! my race is almost run,</l>

						<l>Where no pale face can dwell to give me pain,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Or ever drive me from my heavenly home,</l>
						<l>Inscribed with the insignia, &quot;Our own claim,&quot;</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">For the eternal God rules heaven&apos;s dome,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Who gave us our own natures, they were wild to roam.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Ah! the poor red man, whose unlettered mind,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Sees naught but beauty roaming o&apos;er the hills,</l>
						<l>In nature coarse, in graces unrefined,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">He hears no music but in rippling rills,</l>
						<l>In forest warbles, and the whip-poor-wills</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">That blend their echoes with the panther&apos;s screams,</l>
						<l>Or with the busy sound of wood-cocks&apos; bills,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">All these prepare his mind for pleasant dreams</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">A child of nature, what he is and seems.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>But darkness falls around me while I sit</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Beside the Wabash, as it heaves along,</l>
						<l>And now less vividly my visions flit,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">While list&apos;ning to its merry rippling song.</l>
						<l>And now the &quot;Tuneful Nine,&quot; a fickle throng,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Like the dark waters gently ebb and flow,</l>
						<l>And waves beyond me seem to have a tongue,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And whisper softly, as they onward go,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">A kindly farewell for the ones laid low.</l>

						<l rend="ti-2">Before its harvest&apos;s ripe for reaping;</l>
						<l>How fast the fleeting wing can fly,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And draw us near the hour to die;</l>
						<l>Not content the earth to spare,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">That was designed for our repose,</l>

					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>If all were peace, and joy on earth,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">This world would be a Eden pleasure,</l>
						<l>And we would hold the hour of birth,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">More sacred than the golden treasure,</l>
						<l>But all the wings of time must plow,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And furrow deep each aching brow;--</l>
						<l>Man makes, and drinks his cup of woe,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And quaffs the potion &apos;gainst his liking,</l>

						<l>The treasures sought once in his clasp,</l>

					</lg>

						<l>And when to youth we bid adieu,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And precious time is sweetly rolling,</l>
						<l>We feel that friends are cold and few,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And we&apos;re the slaves of men controlling;</l>

						<l>And who could in a breast confide,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Where stormy passion&apos;s ever growing.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>The heart displays just such a change,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And early friendship&apos;s often waning,</l>

					<p rend="center">Of our dear little Byron, who died Jan. 27, 1879, age 3 years, 7 months,
						and 28 days.</p>
					<lg>
						<l><hi rend="b">O</hi>UR home is sad since death came there,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And bore our brilliant star away,</l>
						<l>Our pride, our joy, our constant care,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The hope of our declining day.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>I weep, we weep, I know not why,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">But still we weep with hope and love,</l>
						<l>Yet knowing, as I know, to die</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Is but to live with God above.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>What hope, Oh, glorious hope, to think,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Upon the river&apos;s golden side</l>
						<l>Our friends stand waiting on the brink,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To welcome us beyond its tide.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Methinks I see my little boy,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">With hands extended to me now,</l>
						<l>As if in ecstacy of joy,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To press fond kisses on my brow.</l>
					</lg>
					<note id="note_025"><ref target="ref_025" rend="super">*</ref>I suppose it is natural for
						every parent to weep for his child, but the ties that bound me to this little one
						certainly were strong, and if I were foolishly attached, it is a weakness for which I am
						innocently to be pitied. If there is any affection stronger than parental affection, I
						hope to never be fully acquainted with it.</note>
					<pb n="136" id="VAA3924-138"/>
					<lg>
						<l>Time may efface to some degree,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The sorrow of two broken hearts,</l>
						<l>But tear the branches from the tree,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">How soon the quivering tear-drop starts.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Our hopes grow bright, our eyes grow dim,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">But weeping is of little worth,</l>
						<l>When all things &apos;round us breathe of him,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Who was too pure and fair for earth.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>His little, vacant chair I see,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Where we were wont to gaze with pride,</l>
						<l>It in the rear stands silently,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And no one brings it to my side.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>And oft at night in dreams I see</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The little chair rock to and fro,</l>
						<l>And little feet, unweariedly,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">In merry patter come and go.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>We only live with him in dreams,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">&apos;Tis then the joyful tears we shed,</l>
						<l>But ev&apos;ry morning only seems,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To wake us weeping from our bed.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>The fairest buds e&apos;er to us given,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Too tender for our earthly care,</l>
						<l>Are quickly snatched from earth to heaven,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And bid to bloom forever there.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb n="137" id="VAA3924-139"/>
					<lg>
						<l>And sweet to know ere sin could blight,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Or sorrow mark a sister&apos;s face,</l>
						<l>The little spirit took its flight,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To occupy a purer place.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>A bleak cold world &apos;twould be indeed,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">If I but tho&apos;t I&apos;d never meet</l>
						<l>My little child--my heart would bleed</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Until its pulses ceased to beat.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>I have an interest now in heaven,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I never felt I had before,</l>
						<l>And have had since that fatal even,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">That death came thro&apos; our chamber door</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>But little Byron e&apos;er will dwell</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Within our spirits, O, how true,</l>
						<l>We can but say on earth <hi rend="i">farewell</hi>,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">But then &apos;tis sad this short adieu.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>But now farewell, on earth, farewell,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">My little boy, farewell to you,</l>
						<l>Soon will I go to thee and dwell,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And there forget this sad adieu.</l>

						<l>There often two brothers so thoughtlessly strayed,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">That they knew not the pleasures of youth were so rife.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>The slope of the hills, and the babble of brooks,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Still live in my heart as I left them of yore,</l>
						<l>And the fields and the woods, and the mountains and nooks--</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">May I view them as then, or view them no more.</l>

						<l>The cottage has fallen and gone to decay,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Speak it low! for it is fatal news that you bear,</l>

						<l rend="ti-2">And hurled to the earth by the fierce hurricane.</l>

						<l>No trace on its trunk, no indenture, or mark,</l>

						<l>And the names that we carved side by side in its bark,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">With the symbols of honor have all passed away.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>But I come to the house of my youth to behold</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The lichens that time hath entwined with her wings,</l>
						<l>Since we left it alone, never thinking that mould,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Was the warp and the woof of the spoiler of things.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>&apos;Twas a dream--for I stood on the hilltop above,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And I gazed at the pleasant vale sleeping so gay,</l>
						<l>Not a token, or trace, of the scenes that I love,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Could I see--like a tale they had all pass&apos;d away.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>And the brooklet that babbled along to the mill,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Sang dolefully now, and not as of yore,</l>
						<l>As it wended its way down the slope of the hill,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Through the vale, and the grove, to the Sugar Creek shore.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb n="147" id="VAA3924-149"/>
					<lg>
						<l>The broad-reaching boughs interlacing above,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Where the wild downy minstrels their decants have sung,</l>
						<l>Are now of the past, and the scenes that I love</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Have all vanished away--and still I am young.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>The moral sinks deep in my heart on the way,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">As I pass down the lone winding river of time,</l>
						<l>For behold how the beauties of earth pass away,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">But the mansion in heaven glows ever sublime.</l>

					<p rend="center"><hi rend="sc">ADVERTISEMENT</hi>.</p>
					<lb/>
					<p>The following poem is founded on facts. The young lady represented as Jessica met her
						death on the evening of her marriage, in Fountain County, Ind., as described. She was an
						orphan child, and adopted by her aged grandparents. When she was quite small, and was
						the being in whom they centered their affections, she was given in marriage, at the age
						of sixteen, I believe, to a man by the name of Lawson (represented as Horace in the
						poem). It is said that the young lady, amid a life of social pleasure, would suddenly
						become despondent and gloomy, as her marriage day approached, and often intimated to her
						friends that something of a serious nature and unlooked for event was near at hand. On
						the evening of her marriage, at a late hour at night, a retinue of musicians went to
						serenade them. The members of the family, as well as the bride and groom, had retired,
						and, after the rendition of two or three airs by the serenaders, the bride and groom
						arose, dressed themselves, and stepped out upon the balcony at the north side of the
						house. The moon and starlight were beautiful. As the bride stepped out she was greeted
						with applause, and, while she was thanking the guests for the music, there came a shrill
						&quot;crash&quot; as from a revolver or gun, and the young bride was seen to reel, throw
						up her hands, and fall into her husband&apos;s arms, who was standing just in the rear.
						The cause of the shot has always been a mystery. Whether on purpose, or the careless
						handling of a firearm, is still unknown, notwithstanding all efforts to ascertain. The
						missile struck the fair bride near the temple, tearing away almost the whole top of her
						head. The grief of the aged grand-parents, as well as the young husband, can be better
						imagined than described. This poem was hastily written, having been completed in two
						sittings. Will not my readers think strange of this, and say any plodding prose writer
						should have done it as well in one.</p>

						<l>His eyes were fixed, he turned, and smiled,</l>

						<l>But this is proof of love sincere,</l>
						<l>Love that had grown but doubly dear:--</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>And here the aged dame and sire,</l>
						<l>Sank o&apos;er the form as to expire,</l>

					<lg>

						<l>Oh! how their flutt&apos;ring hearts did ache:</l>
						<l>This cruel stroke near made them break,</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Tears had no issue, words no sound,</l>
						<l>All notes in wailing grief were drown&apos;d,</l>
					</lg>

						<l>Oh! sorrows glorious! when adorned,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">By virgin innocence, they make</l>

						<l rend="ti-2">Till pining anguish forces tears.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Tears are a balm to broken hearts,</l>

						<l rend="ti-2">Where time is not a ceaseless plain,--</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Our lives are like an Autumn rose,</l>

						<l>We live in thoughts, not years, in deeds,</l>

						<l>Not us, but what we see of man,</l>

						<l>We think, we ponder, when we scan,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">This bubble with bewildered sigh.</l>

						<l>There is a port of rest to greet</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The wayworn traveler for aye.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Then what is death that we may dread</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">One moonless night, and where are we?</l>
						<l>We make in earth our endless bed,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And then our spirit goes forth free.</l>

						<l>Age plays upon the infant&apos;s face,</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">&quot;Sat like a fate,&quot; alone content,</l>

							<l>Beneath the waving wigwam spread,</l>

							<l>The filmy, silken, rapid thread,</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">There on the ground.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The thrushes seem to join her song,</l>

							<l>A kind of medley rings along,</l>

						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Beneath yon swaying oak tree where</l>

							<l rend="ti-3">Or pleasant song.</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">Its very brink, and gaze and speak</l>
							<l>To each dear crag till early dawn;</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Methinks it is the Angel&apos;s home,</l>

						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>And as I thro&apos; the vistas gaze,</l>
							<l>My soul is wrapped within the maze,</l>

							<l>Its tenement--the curdling blood</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Flows to my head--my form doth quake,</l>
							<l>While gazing where some monarch stood,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">In days gone by, and there I see,</l>
							<l>Far out on a projecting crag,</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">To a high brink where it doth fall</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Into a tarn of many feet,</l>

						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Thou stream unmindful of thy fate,</l>

						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>&quot;Through the crannies of the mountain,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">From the lofty peaks above,</l>
							<l>Pours a pure and purling fountain,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Such as artists could but love.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>&quot;When I gaze at it descending,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">In its sparkling merry glee,</l>
							<l>Seems it whispering commending,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Weary sister, sip from me.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>&quot;I flow thro&apos; the recesses,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Of the lofty mountain steeps,</l>
							<l>And linger round my cresses,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Where the ivy o&apos;er me creeps.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>&quot;I bubble o&apos;er my pebbly bed,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">In rippling merry waves,</l>
							<l>And cool Siouska&apos;s aching head,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">When on my bank she laves.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>&quot;I see thee, and murmur as I go,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Adown my lonely valley,</l>
							<l>Where mossy banks just o&apos;er me grow</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And thou canst watch me sally.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>&quot;I linger thro&apos; my lone ravine,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Where rustling wolves are heard,</l>
							<pb n="197" id="VAA3924-200"/>
							<l>And loiter where the fox is seen,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">That digs his hole unscared.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>&quot;I wander thro&apos; my lonely copse,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Beneath the old oak&apos;s quiver,</l>
							<l>Sometimes I am but little drops,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">At other times a river.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>&quot;I help to fill the briny sea,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Where sailors o&apos;er me boat;--</l>
							<l>I feed the monsters down in me,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">As round and round they float.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>&quot;I rise from this deep, angry foam,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">To misty clouds above,</l>
							<l>And with them oft I gently roam,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And live the life I love.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>&quot;I hie me to my native mountain,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And sink into the earth,</l>
							<l>Then flow out through my mother fountain,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">In the same glad, joyful mirth.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>&quot;Thus I go on from year to year,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Through lonely wildernesses,</l>
							<l>Receiving oft the redman&apos;s tear,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">As he stoops and me caresses.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>&quot;The gusty winds congeal my crest,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Cold, torpid, free from motion,</l>
							<pb n="198" id="VAA3924-201"/>
							<l>Then, then I take my tranquil rest,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Before I reach the ocean.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>&quot;Yes, winter storms do case me nice,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">I&apos;m oft a bridged river,</l>
							<l>With silvery sheets of crystaled ice,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Where wild men sport and shiver.&quot;</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>And here the brooklet ceased its song,</l>
							<l>Poor timid girl she&apos;d lingered long,</l>
							<l>Amid the tarns, and peaks, and vales,</l>
							<l>Inhaling the sweet mountain gales.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>She&apos;d wander&apos;d there while daylight held</l>
							<l>The vault above, and her heart swell&apos;d</l>
							<l>Within her--the insatiate hope</l>
							<l>Would come and go, and thus to cope</l>
							<l>With her own feelings were a task</l>
							<l>Beyond attainment--but to bask</l>
							<l>Beside the stream; and o&apos;er the hill,</l>
							<l>With nimble feet where&apos;er she will,</l>
							<l>Were a sweet privilege, for there</l>
							<l>Her life was a day-dream so fair.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>The last sunbeam has ceased to play</l>
							<l>Upon the mountain side; no ray</l>
							<l>Is to be seen, and still she lingers</l>
							<l>Above the mere, as the sweet singers</l>
							<l>Of the lone night lull her to sleep,</l>
							<l>And o&apos;er her a lone vigil keep.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-3">Oh! nightingale, that singest,</l>

							<l rend="ti-3">Wee, philomel, thou bringest</l>
							<l rend="ti-4">To my mind the vow,</l>

						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-3">Thou, bird, art not of earth,</l>

							<l rend="ti-4">In song, for it were given</l>

						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-3">Who knows of what thou speaketh,</l>
							<l rend="ti-4">As thou warblest fair,</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">But then my soul it seeketh,</l>
							<l rend="ti-4">And findeth lodgment there,</l>
							<l>Which makes me understand thy words, and feel thy care.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-3">Yet, bird so high above me,</l>
							<l rend="ti-4">Thou lookest a mere speck,</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">But Oh! my heart it loves thee,</l>
							<l rend="ti-4">Although it be a wreck,</l>
							<l>All shattered by the pangs for him that ever moves me.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-3">Oh! singer I beseech thee,</l>
							<l rend="ti-4">Wilt thou never weary,</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">But could I only teach thee,</l>
							<l rend="ti-4">To leave this place so dreary,</l>
							<l>And in the heavens join a place less solitary.</l>
						</lg>
						<pb n="200" id="VAA3924-203"/>
						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-3">Thou sittest all alone,</l>
							<l rend="ti-4">Beyond the reach of danger,</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">On your mountain throne,</l>
							<l rend="ti-4">And singest to a stranger,</l>
							<l>That loves thee best of all, thou solitary ranger.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-3">And as you warble there,</l>
							<l rend="ti-4">Bathed in the misty blue,</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">Oh! were Oneida here,</l>
							<l rend="ti-4">His troth would be more true,</l>
							<l>Pledged &apos;neath thy gentle cadences so very dear.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>And here she sank into a rhapsody,</l>
							<l>Lulled by the nightingale&apos;s sweet melody,</l>
							<l>As high upon a rough and jagged steep,</l>
							<l>She fell into a calm and quiet sleep,</l>
							<l>Where Flora&apos;s hand had gently strewn flowers,</l>
							<l>And woven them into sweet mountain bowers,</l>
							<l>And the plum&apos;d Dryad of the bending bough,</l>
							<l>Pours forth his melodies inspiring now:--</l>
							<l>There as she lay upon her thatch of flowers,</l>
							<l>Enjoying well the cool Elysium hours,</l>
							<l>The pale old moon came riding o&apos;er the plane,</l>
							<l>In her chaste dress, and lit the mountain chain,</l>
							<l>In streams of light thrown through the shim&apos;ring air.</l>

							<l>The moon hung low, the stars were peeping through</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Each floating cloud, and poured their gentle ray,</l>
							<l>For her alone, whose eyes of melting blue,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Were drinking the wan light there as she lay</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Upon a high projecting crag that swung</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Far out o&apos;er deep oblivious gulfs--among</l>
							<l>Deep chasms in the broad, and aery rocks,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Forever unexplored--Yawn in the glow</l>
							<l>Of this fair Princess--oft detached blocks</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Of massy weight go thundering swift below,</l>
							<l>Leaving behind a chasm dark and broad,</l>
							<l>To be replaced but by the hand of God.</l>
							<l>And mighty trees that stretch their giant arms</l>
							<l>O&apos;er the dark caverned base, rock&apos;d by the storms,</l>
							<l>Bend in a graceful loveliness, and there</l>
							<l>The sounding step of the Oneida Chief,</l>
							<l>Comes gently on the silent mountain air--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">He steals on tiptoe like some watchful thief,</l>
							<l>Toward Siouska&apos;s wild-wood couch--Oh! there,</l>
							<l>He gazes on a form more passing fair,</l>
							<l>Than longing eyes had ever yet beheld;</l>
							<l>And his poor heart within him heaved and swelled,</l>
							<l>While gazing at her gentle tresses play,</l>
							<l>And toy with each gale there as she lay,</l>
							<l>Upon her mountain bed: Oh! &apos;twere a sight,</l>
							<l>That life in high estate might envy quite:--</l>
							<l>Up to her couch so quietly he steals,</l>
							<l>And by her side so silently he kneels,</l>
							<l>That he can hear the throbbings of the heart,</l>
							<l>Which beats for him, and pleasantly impart,</l>
							<l>That which she would conceal, but her soft eyes,</l>
							<l>Are opened wide beneath the starry skies;--</l>
							<l>A kind of shudder quivered thro&apos; her veins,</l>
							<pb n="202" id="VAA3924-205"/>
							<l>A shriek and sigh rang o&apos;er the lofty plains,</l>
							<l>But quick subdued when her bright eyes discover,</l>
							<l>Beside her bending her own ardent lover,</l>
							<l>And thus he spoke--&quot;My own belov&apos;d mate,</l>
							<l>Why come you here unmindful of your fate</l>
							<l>On this projecting crag--a little move</l>
							<l>This way or that, and then oh! then my love,</l>
							<l>Would be no more, oh ! come, oh, come with me</l>
							<l>To yonder table land, and green-wood tree,&quot;</l>
							<l>&quot;Oh! leave me till the morrow thus,&quot; she cries,</l>
							<l>But sees a longing hidden in his eyes,</l>
							<l>For a more binding pledge. &quot;My Wildwood Flower</l>
							<l>Here on this very brink, this moonlit hour,</l>
							<l>Tell me our hearts may blend, and live, and be</l>
							<l>In one sweet concord of love&apos;s unity.&quot;--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">&quot;Here is my hand, my heart, my all,&quot; she cries,</l>

							<l>Back to the bank, forlorn, to her moor&apos;d skiff,</l>

							<l>By the lone willows, and o&apos;erhanging cliff,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Still thinking, Oh! how hard it is to part</l>
							<l>With him, till she approached the brink where lay</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Her birchen bark--with silent tread--Aghast!</l>
							<l>What did she see there toying on the spray,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Within her boat? A tremor o&apos;er her past,</l>
							<l>Revenge flow&apos;d through her veins, for there she saw,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Within the arms of Morpheus, &quot;Eagle Eye,&quot;</l>
							<l>The murderer of her chief within the bow</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Of her canoe. She heaved an angry sigh:</l>
							<l>Her wild glance flashed with anger, and the eye,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">That beamed forth love, shot forth its bitter hate</l>
							<l>With noiseless tread she drew up gently, nigh</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The sleeper in the boat, and fixed his fate;</l>
							<l>She threw the oars upon the brink and swung</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The boat far out, with wild exultant cry,</l>
							<l>Into the boiling rapids--the chief sprung</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Toward the shore--the fire flash&apos;d from his eye,</l>
							<l>But the swift waves press&apos;d hard against his breast,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">With which he battled manfully and brave;</l>
							<l>He saw his fate and did his very best</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">To near the shore from such a death to save</l>
							<l>His wretched life: all efforts were in vain,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And, seeing it, was hopeless to regain</l>
							<l>The brink once more. With one unearthly yell,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">He turns and plunges t&apos;ward the awful falls,</l>
							<l>And boiling waters ring his funeral knell,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">As down he plunges o&apos;er death&apos;s fearful walls.</l>
						</lg>

							<pb n="226" id="VAA3924-230"/>
							<l>And spent her life in memory and grief,</l>

						<l>But if in noble minds some dregs remain,</l>

					</epigraph>
					<p>My readers may regard me as a very presumptuous man, but I cannot help it, and after
						the <hi rend="i">literati</hi> of Crawfordsville, Indiana, away in the misty future,
						have experienced what I have attempted to describe, they will quietly acquiesce with me,
						and place a feather in my cap. They may now claim, that I am possess&apos;d with his
						satanic majesty, or the idiosyncracy peculiar to a monomaniac, neither can I help that,
						but Crawfordsville talent is too precious to be wasted, and too popular to be hissed
						from the stage of public favor, and I would not do one thing intentionally to retard the
						progress of that noble band of literary aspirants. I only wish to show them that when we
						all meet in that &quot;Sweet By and By,&quot; that I am correct, and when the Lethe
						disgorges its vast multitude, Crawfordsville will be represented as described. I have
						caused this to be published, not from malice toward any, but guided only by pure motives
						and the <hi rend="i">Muses</hi>. He who has never gazed out on the dark rolling Lethe of
						fancy has never enjoyed the pleasures of a deep and sweet reverie. Some uncontrollable
						feeling came over me, and I was permitted to look away over yonder in the future, and
						behold that contemporary line of poetic writers that this <hi rend="sc">Dear Athens</hi>
						(Crawfordsville) prides herself so much of. When <pb n="231" id="VAA3924-235"/>my fancy
						gazed out upon the waters, it saw millions of fairy aspects. At first they appeared to
						be mere shadows, phantoms, or what not, but I had not gazed long, however, till those
						shadows had grown into human skeletons, and each skeleton carried a wand, or banner with
						name engraven thereon, as candidate for the rank it thought it merited. I was permitted
						to see, just as the noble representatives of Crawfordsville, were receiving the
						commission for their reward. Among them I noticed Mayfield, (Dan Starus), Krout,
						Thompson, and Lew Wallace. Occasionally I would get a glimpse at Clodfelter, but he did
						not appear to figure very conspicuously.</p>
					<p>I hold that there is but a small space between heaven, and true poets. They are rare,
						and like the heavenly dove, that flies upon the same exalted level, and never touches
						the earth. It is not only one time in many millions, that genius arrives with us to live
						forever. Some few, may set eternal stars over our heads, many others, may scatter
						delicious flowers along our pathway, fragrant and beautiful in the morning to wither
						away in the first noon-day sun. You will perceive in the order of arrangement (which is
						just as I saw it), that the Judgment is by turns administered, and from the
						representatives of Crawfordsville, Frank Mayfield will be the first to arrive on the
						waters and appear before the Judgment Seat of St. Peter.</p>

						space, from the flowery bosom of the Lethe to the great mountain of Parnasus. The way up
						the rugged mountain was as splendid as pageantry could make it. The rocks were all
						covered by the fairest tapestry. Hundreds of fairy barks floated gallantly upon the
						Lethe, with their banners shining in splendor, and glassing themselves in the silvery

						gazing down on them with one of those grins peculiar to cherubs of his rank, and in a

						the aid of the Author of &quot;Little Brown Hands,&quot; he disperses his army, and
						shrinks unto a dark and dreary cave, content to let Mary Hannah occupy a higher position

					<p>The General&apos;s reception was a grand affair, for he had no more than dismounted
						when thousands of cherubs, appropriately equipped, came in cavalcades superb, in
						unbroken lines of splendor, each distinguished by those insignia of the Great
						General&apos;s favor, and striving to attract the attention of the distinguished comer.
						Around the curve wheels a golden chariot, drawn by snow white palfreys, in beautiful
						gold-embroidered trappings. The chariot was as famous, as it was beautiful, for it had
						drawn up this gorgeous mountain the immortelles from the early existence of the world,
						and in it were seated, Hugo, Scott, and Irving. When he entered this rare chariot, each
						one advanced, and placed about him an endless wreath of evergreens, beaded with choice
						diamonds, as a welcome, and emblematic of his eternal fame. On, on they go up the steep
						mountain, till they pass the hermit home of Maurice, who comes out to greet his old
						comrade and contemporary. But ere he had approached two paces toward him, the gulf of
						oblivion draws him in, and swallows him; and alas! and alas! poor Maurice is no more.
						And so passeth Mary Hannah Krout, and the world is the same as though they had never
						lived in it. Pity Thompson, Krout and Mayfield, for all their efforts were fruitless,
						and Clodfelter the most pitiful aspect of the fold only arrives at the mere of the
						mountain to have fingers pointed at him, when he slinks back to his natural place of
						abode, content to go down with the Plebian of the world. And thus we learn, that in the
						final ending of all things, only one from Crawfordsville is to eternally represent her,
						and that is the author of B.-- H.-- which is as eternal as the spirit that wrote
						it.----</p>

						<l>Oh! the gloomy thoughts, if gloomy;</l>

						<l>He privileged her to speak to those she loved.</l>
						<l>Tho&apos; only seven years of age she knew</l>

						<l>&quot;I&apos;ll have to leave you, papa, mama, and</l>

						<l>Closed down forever, and a spirit then</l>
						<l>As pure as heaven took its flight above.</l>
						<pb n="262" id="VAA3924-269"/>
						<l>And Oh, an aching void was left; but now</l>
						<l>Six days have passed and I have lived again</l>
						<l>With this sweet child; last night I grieved for her</l>
						<l>Metho&apos;t death was unkind in taking my</l>
						<l>Dear one from me, but ere the break of day</l>
						<l>I&apos;fell into a kind of sleep, and, Oh,</l>
						<l>What a sweet kind: for came my darling child,</l>
						<l>My little Alma, and, as she had done</l>
						<l>In life, placed her sweet arms about my neck</l>
						<l>And interlaced her fingers; then she lisped</l>
						<l>Within my ears and told me not to cry.</l>
						<l>I stooped to kiss the little lips as I</l>
						<l>Had done so oft before; but, Oh, they were</l>
						<l>So cold, I cried aloud, and my sweet child was gone.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Gone, gone, gone, into the heavens above us:</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Gone, to the home not made of hands on high;</l>
						<l>Gone the sweet spirit that will ever love us,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And await our coming by and by--</l>
						<l>Gone, gone, gone, the little birds are peeping,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Peeping for the hand that gave them care--</l>
						<l>Waiting, waiting, waiting; waiting while we&apos;re weeping,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Weeping while we&apos;re waiting to go There.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>&quot;Done, done, done&quot;--her little sister&apos;s sighing--</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">&quot; Done to sleep, papa, neber more to wake;</l>
						<l>I tan not do wi&apos;out her.&quot;--Then she went to crying,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Crying like her little heart would break.</l>

					<head>ODE TO MY LYRE.</head>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">1.</head>
						<l>"COME, come, my Lyre, and let us go</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Down to the clear and glowing stream,</l>
						<l>Whose laughing waters ebb and flow</l>
						<l>Along where water-lilies grow;</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Come thou and help me dream.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">2.</head>
						<l>Oh, thou, my Lyre, my gentle toy!</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I swept thy chords down in this vale</l>
						<l>When but a wayward, reckless boy,</l>
						<l>And thou didst all my soul employ</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">In fields and flowery dale.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">3.</head>
						<l>And yet, my Lyre, my humble song</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">May tremble into silence when </l>
						<l>I lay thee down among the throng</l>
						<l>Of those whose echoes still prolong</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The praise of worthier men.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">4.</head>
						<l>But now, my Lyre, my friend so dear,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">E&apos;en tho&apos; I am unworthy, still</l>
						<l>When lonely e&apos;er I call thee near,</l>
						<l>And if unworthy drop the tear</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">That sets my heart a-thrill.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb n="264" id="VAA3924-271"/>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">5.</head>
						<l>Oh Lyre! with thee I loved the place</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Where my poor father&apos;s cottage stood,</l>
						<l>Surrounded by the humble grace</l>
						<l>Of trees and vines in interlace,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Inspiring solitude.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">6.</head>
						<l>And there, my Lyre, in early days</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I roved the hills and forests drear,</l>
						<l>Sang of the dusk and milky haze--</l>
						<l>Of sallow leaves in Autumn days--</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The bleakest of the year.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">7.</head>
						<l>And thus, my Lyre, the early train</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Of my poor Muse was set aglow,</l>
						<l>The miller&apos;s daughter heard my strain,</l>
						<l>And praised its tones, and then the vein</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Of poesy did flow.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">8.</head>
						<l>And yet, my Lyre, submissive toy,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Vibrated to a youthful heart</l>
						<l>That beat the tender pulse of joy</l>
						<l>Within the breast of th&apos; dreaming boy,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And Cupid aimed his dart.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">9.</head>
						<l>And there, my Lyre, the feathered throng,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Sang hymns of love to us alone,</l>
						<l>We listen&apos;d to their chorus&apos;d song</l>
						<l>Above us, as they&apos;d float along,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And by love&apos;s heavenly throne.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb n="265" id="VAA3924-272"/>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">10.</head>
						<l>And there, my Lyre, in that sweet place,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Beneath the radiant mistletoe,</l>
						<l>O&apos;ershadowing the fair sward of grace</l>
						<l>Was our dear early trysting-place,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Where songs of love did flow.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">11.</head>
						<l>And there with thee, my gentle Lyre,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The young heart in my breast did swell,</l>
						<l>And worlds of beauty rose entire</l>
						<l>Around; and &apos;gainst love&apos;s kindling fire,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Two hearts could not rebel.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">12.</head>
						<l>And thou, fond Lyre, still day by day</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The love within my breast increased,</l>
						<l>And from my eyes chased sleep away</l>
						<l>And made them watchers of their prey</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">On which they could but feast.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">13.</head>
						<l>But then, alas! dear Lyre, alone,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Sweet sleep would close my wakeful eyes,</l>
						<l>And Morpheus, the night-god drone,</l>
						<l>Would steal about my downy zone,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And show love in disguise.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">14.</head>
						<l>Thou, Lyre, companion of my soul,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Called the fair love-dream down from heaven,</l>
						<l>Took my young heart from my control,</l>
						<l>And to another to condole,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">By thee and Allah given.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb n="266" id="VAA3924-273"/>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">15.</head>
						<l>That love-cup, Lyre, has been my life,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Inspired so near the turning mill,</l>
						<l>The miller&apos;s daughter &apos;came my wife,</l>
						<l>And strewed my way with pleasures rife</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And I am happy still.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">16.</head>
						<l>And yet, O Lyre! I&apos;ve swept thy strings,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Ofttimes since thou inspired&apos;st my mind</l>
						<l>For thee, and when my sweet muse sings</l>
						<l>Hope fans me with her snowy wings</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">When all the world&apos;s unkind.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">17.</head>
						<l>And Lyre; with thee I steal away</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And hold communion with the hills,</l>
						<l>Talk with the rocks so cold and gray,</l>
						<l>And strike thee, Lyre, in roundelay,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">With hymns sung by the rills.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">18.</head>
						<l>And, Lyre, when the fair day-god lies</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Beneath the horizontal rest,</l>
						<l>And streaks with fire the vaulted skies,</l>
						<l>Thou sometimes pour&apos;st forth melodies</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">That sooth an aching breast.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">19.</head>
						<l>And, Lyre, as one who hides to pray</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Where sweet oblivion reigns sublime,</l>
						<l>And pale-faced Luna pours her ray</l>
						<l>And rides majestic on her way,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I pour my soul in rhyme.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb n="267" id="VAA3924-274"/>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">20.</head>
						<l>But then, alas! dear Lyre, ere long</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Our parting hour shall surely come,</l>
						<l>And thy sweet tones shall not prolong</l>
						<l>The notes of my unchorused song</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">When both lie still and dumb.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<head rend="center">21.</head>
						<l>Farewell, dear Lyre!--farewell! farewell!</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Thou sole companion of my soul.</l>
						<l>I lay thee down, but still we dwell</l>
						<l>In sweet communion. It is well</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">We see our transient goal.</l>
