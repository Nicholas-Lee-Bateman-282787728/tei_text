				<p>There is a wide difference between our faculties and our qualities. The former belong to
					the intellectual, the latter to the moral and spiritual departments of our nature, or to
					use more popular language the one is the product of the Head the other of the Heart. The
					school the text book and the teacher educate our faculties. To that end curricula are
					framed and institutitions of learning are maintained. On the other hand our qualities are
					developed and trained by the parlour, the fireside, society, events, men and women.</p>
				<p>Success in life depends far more upon our qualities than our faculties. The social man,
					the man of good fellowship, the magnetic man, the influential man is usually the man of
					big heart altho by no means of deficient brain. The ideal man is he whose head is just as
					big as his heart and his heart as big as his head and both of the biggest size possible.
					Such men are only to be found only in novels. Among our local public men of present date
					in Colfax the qualities predominated. He possessed the power of moving great bodies of men
					as well as individuals by a direct appeal to their emotions. On the other hand in Morton
					the faculties controlled. Gov. Morton's public speeches were almost wholly intellectual.
					In Mr. Hendricks the balance between the head and the heart was more perfect that of any
					other of our eminent men that I now recall. In President Harrison the Head predominates,
					while in the greatly beloved Greshman the big Heart gives him a world of devoted
					followers.</p>
				<p>A philosophic inquiry into "the abysmal depths of Personaltius" is one of absorbing
					interest. Why am I I and you you? Why is the pronoun I always written, printed or spoken
					in capitals, and the smaller the man the bigger the capital? Why does every thing that I
					do so profoundly interests me while it is of such indifference or of such small <pb
						id="VAB8209-004" n="2"/> interest to you? Why is every thing that <hi rend="i">you</hi>
					do of such absorbing interest to you while I take no interest in it? Personality.
					Personality lies back of Head Hand and Heart. The great German philosophers hint at this
					deepest of all facts when they use the technical word "apperception" which is wittily
					defined as the "think that we are thinking of Victor Hugo who is the real author of this
					bon mot. Personality is that which sees with our eyes, hears with our ears, thinks with
					our thoughts and excutes with our wills. Personality lies at the base of civilization and
					is something more than the excutive powers of the soul, It is, in fact, the very soul
					itself.</p>
				<p>Personality is the key of our existence. Personality is the final, and perhaps the only,
					indivisible unit in the whole universe. The worthiest argument outside of Revelation for
					immortality lies in the indivisibility, the indestructability and insatiability of our
					personality. I cannot bear your pain or shame; I cannot suffer your punishment any more
					than you can perform and relieve me of my Duty. Alone we came into this earth and alone we
					must leave it. Birth is the organization of all that we know of our earthly personality
					and Death is its disorganization. In both as well as in all the other of the profound
					moments of life we are profoundly alone. The great Tennson (and I look upon him as in many
					respects the greatest of living Christian philosophers) thus speaks of the origin and
					possible purpose of personality: <q rend="blockquote">
						<lg>
							<l>The baby, new to earth and sky,</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">What time his tender palm is pressed</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">Against the circle of the breast,</l>
							<l>Has never thought: "This is I."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>But as he grows he gathers much,</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">And learns the use of "I" and "me,"</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">And finds I am not what I see</l>
							<l>And other than the thing I touch.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>So rounds he to a separate mind</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">From which clear Memory may begin,</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">And through the frame that binds him in</l>
							<l>His isolation grows defined;</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>This use may lie in blood and breath,</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">Which else were fruitless of their due</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">Had man to learn himself anew</l>
							<l>Beyond the second Birth of Death.</l>
						</lg></q></p>

				<p>Now this essay is not designed as an argument upon a philosophic subject; but rather an
					application of that subject to practical life and usefulness. Otherwise I should be glad
					to pursue this line of thought further. Personality is the underlying and open secret of
					personal influence. "As a man thinketh, so he is," says Holy Writ. Those of our associates
					that have the greatest influence upon us are those of the most marked personality. That
					truth that is personalized is invariably the effective truth. Personalized truth is truth
					set in position. This is the open reason why our Savior was made flesh and dwelt among us.
					It was to embody in a life the Gospel long before known as an abstraction that "Wisdom
					dwelt with mortal powers where Words in closest truth had failed, when Words embodied in a
					tale would enterin at lowly doors." We are so built that we will follow truth as taught by
					a beloved leader to the death while we leave that same truth to the moles and the bats
					when taught to us by book or maxims. Personality is the soul of manners. It is either real
					or assumed when it manifests itself in manners. Assumed personality often gives us very
					charming ladies or gentlemen, so charming that it is often very difficult to detect the
					real from the counterfeit. Counterfeit personality, however, like veneering or varnish, is
					dangerously liable to crack. Here, as everywhere else, sincerety is the charm and soul of
					personal influence. Personality is one of the open secrets of popular oratory. Those
					public speakers that are constantly studying the proprieties; that are constantly on the
					ragged edge lest they should say or do something not in the rhetoric books, seldom
					accomplish great successes. Abandon is only another name for an overflowing personality.
					The public speaker who has not acquired the art of forgetting himself in the occasion, and
					who has not lost the sense of time and person in his theme, has not reached the threshold
					of public speaking. In oratory the world over it takes like to reach like--a common medium
					must first be established between the speaker and audience before any effective work can
					be accomplished, and this is done by the speaker's personality.</p>
				<p>Personality is the soul of leadership. It is the thermometer by which we unerringly guage
					an organizer. <pb id="VAB8209-006" n="4"/> Julius Cæsar, so says tradition, was as
					marvelous in his personal power as he was in his intellectual equipment. It is said by
					those who seventy-five years ago were eye witnesses, that Napoleon in battle was equal to
					ten thousand soldiers. When the little Corporal rode down the decimated ranks and victory
					hung doubtful in the scales, at the sight of him the wounded forgot death, and Agony stood
					aghast until one more final charge was made that invariably brought defeat to the enemy.
					It vas the last charge of the old guard with the Emperor at the head that settled the
					battle. What is it that has given its marvelous vitality to the Church and the Christian
					religion so that after 2000 years; after persecution and criticism, have done their worst,
					and notwithstanding its innumerable errors and mistakes such as are inseperable from its
					humanity, it is to-day as fresh and undaunted as it was at its beginning? The answer is
					not far or difficult to seek. It is the divine and ever present personality of its
					incomparable leader. I often wonder whether the Holy Ghost is any other, or different,
					than the personality of the divine Galilean.</p>
				<p>A charming personality is the instinct and inheritance of womanhood. For this reason, and
					because they cannot help it, the Sex universally decorate their beautiful persons. For
					this reason, and to increase the charms of their beautiful personalities, our women
					eliminate from their conversation and surroundings all that is coarse and unbeautiful. It
					is as natural for a woman to dress in gay colors and graceful forms as for a bird tb sing,
					or a rose to blossom. Women know by instinct that their personality is their wealth, and
					hence their never ending study of the arts of the toilette and of graceful speech and
					manners. Personality is the open secret of presence. One of the most delightful things of
					life in either man or woman is Presence. Dr. Johnson once said of Burke: "Meet him under a
					bridge in a rainstorm and you could not help admiring him."</p>
				<p>Burke's portraits show him to have been the ugliest of mortals--in fact the traditional
					wild Irishman. A man of noble presence is a man of noble personality either acquired or
					inherited. A large bribe was once offered to some official connected with his household to
					call the father of his country "George" and <pb id="VAB8209-007" n="5"/> slap him on the
					back. The unfortunate contractor never got any farther than to call Washington
					"George."</p>
				<p>Personality is made up of divers elements, some of which I will briefly allude to. To
					make a great personality we must have: <q rend="blockquote">
						<list type="simple">
							<item>A great enthusiasm.</item>
							<item>A great optimism.</item>
							<item>A great unselfishness.</item>
							<item>A great purity.</item>
							<item>A great will.</item>
							<item>A great faith.</item>
						</list></q></p>
				<p>Enthusiasm is emotionalized earnestness. Enthusiasm in this world is what Faith is in the
					next--"the wings of the soul". Shut off a man or woman from enthusiasm and they become
					more or less plodding pedants or drudges. No half hearted person ever accomplished any
					great deed. Our Savior once said: "No man that putteth his hand to the plough and looketh
					back is worthy of the kingdom of God."</p>
				<p>No man has the power to greatly influence others whose own soul is not at white heat with
					the idea that he wishes accomplished. If you want to kill a church, an individual or an
					enterprise, write upon it, or him, or her: "No enthusiasm wanted here."</p>
				<p>It is worth considering whether the cause of the much lamented empty benches in our
					churches is not owing to the fact that they are all of them so securely locked ffrom
					Sunday night until Saturday evening, except, perhaps, for a brief hour of prayer mid week.
					One reason of the prosperity of the great Ca1tholic Church may be found in the fact that
					the mother church always keep her doors open and her religion, papistical as we
					protestants call it, is always at white heat. While the protestant pastor is absorbed in
					his home and the joys and distracting cares of wife and children his Catholic brother has
					no bride except the Church and no family other than the "my mother and my brethern" of the
					Master.</p>
				<p>The world is saved by its cranks. Enthusiasm gives its charm to youth and its absence the
					chill to old age. Occasionally we find white hairs and enthusiasm going hand in hand; but
					it is the misfortune of experience to part company with his beautiful neighbor. It has so
					often been <pb id="VAB8209-008" n="6"/> pointed out that Success is inseparable from
					enthusiasm that I am quite ashamed to speak of so hackneyed a fact. The winning lawyer,
					doctor, teacher, preacher, editor, artist, artisan or bread winner is the man whose soul
					is on fire with his work and who believes with all his heart, mind, soul and strength that
					his particular work is of all the manifold works in this working world the only true work,
					and the whole world will perish unless and until that work is accomplished. Show me the
					young lawyer that has always in hand a page of Webster or Burke, that he may acquire the
					great art of powerful expression, and I will show you a Matt Carpenter or a Choate. Show
					me the young doctor that is always pouring over the last treatise on Chemistry or Biology
					and I will show you a future Hammond or Agnew. Show me the young merchant that is always
					studying both markets and maxims and I will show you the future Clafflin or Field. The man
					who, after a few years of effort, lays down his arms with the reflection: Well, perhaps I
					have made a mistake; I am, after all, the square peg in the round hole! had better have
					never been born, for Nature and Mankind are brutal in their remorseless treatment of the
					weak. One reason why the State encourages early marriages is that her bread winners may
					before they are aware of it find themselves burdened with a dependent family and thereby
					compelled to toil. A hen without chickens will do no scratching. "There is," says snarling
					Thomas Carlyle, "but one happiness in the whole world and that is the happiness of intense
					activity in some congenial pursuit," The enthusiastic man is invariably the hanpy man.
					What is the secret of happiness? It is self forgetfulness. As no orator ever accomplishes
					his best until he has lost himself and all conscious embarassment in his subject, so the
					antidote to fully one-half the ills that flesh is heir to is work--cheerful and congenial
					work, if you can accomplish it; if not, then work regardless of surroundings. "To do the
					work you have, and to be well paid for it," said President Jordan once to me, "is the
					ideal of this life."</p>
				<p>As I have forgotten to speak of it at its proper place I now mention the fact that this
					terrific surfeit of I and me that ruins so many promising men and women comes from this
					same personality of which we are talking. When <pb id="VAB8209-009" n="7"/>. Nature has an
					end to accomplish she always proceeds in sublime disregard of numbers, or what we call
					proprieties. When she wants a big crop of apples she loads down a tree capable of maturing
					a thousand buds with a million or more of blossoms, so that in case of frost or blight, or
					other accident, there will be ample buds left for the capacity of the tree to mature. As
					wealth is indispensable to human progress, she in the same way overcharges all her
					children with acquisitiveness utterly regardless of the disagreeable incidents of misers
					and pecuniary dishonesty and meanness. And so with Personality. This is the open secret of
					self-respect, and also of the half dozen other of the cardinal virtues. Hence we find that
					Nature has after her wont overcharged her children with the precious fluid utterly
					disregardles of the proprieties or to use scientific language "She has overcrowded the
					tendency." But considering that personality is of so great benefit to humanity we
					cheerfully bear the inexpresible nuisance of the personal pronouns when uttered by third
					persons but which are as sweet as trickling honey when poured by our lips into the ears of
					our neighbors. But I linger too long upon this subject.</p>
				<p>Pessimism is an unfortunate moral disease with which every mortal is at some time more or
					less afflicted and which while it lasts not only darkens our own happiness but also that
					of our friends. The confirmed pessimist is "of all men the most miserable." The origin of
					this most unhappy disease is easy to be traced. Primarily it begins in introspection,
					disapointment and lack of society. I have had for a long time been of the openion that all
					insanity is a result of too much self, or to state it otherwise that insanity is self out
					out of order and the delicate sovereign of the soul--Personality "harsh jangled and out of
					tune." Another cause of this disorder is owing to the fact that every thing or person of
					which we have any knowledge is constitutionally a mixture of good and evil. Every person
					as well as every thing has its shadow and imperfection. Every person no matter how noble
					and beautiful has its harsh and cruel side. Even Revelation which we are taught is the
					only perfect thing in this world has its shadow and Imperfection. Some very savage things
					are to be found in the Bible and for the open reason that it was written, if not <pb
						id="VAB8209-010" n="8"/> of men at least, "by men and for men" and therefore contains
					the human element. This same human element exists in all religions and constitutes the
					perpetual drawback to all our churches. But the presence of this baleful human element in
					both the Bible and the church by no means prove that both are not of divine origin and
					purpose any more than the presence of evil in humanity proves that God is not our creator,
					and life is not divine.</p>
				<p>By a mysterious law of the Most High life is thrust upon us. We are not consulted about
					our arrival into any more than our departure from this world. And what is perhaps stranger
					still we cannot choose our surroundings in this life only to a limited degree nor have we
					much if any say so in our mental or moral environment or equipments. We are the creatures
					of inexorable limitations forced upon us by a higher power in whose hands we are almost as
					puppets. As a rule we must stay where we are put. We must make the best of hereditary
					defects, biasas and limitations. This great mystery never has been, nor, so far as we can
					see, never will be satisfactorily solved.</p>

				<q rend="blockquote">
					<lg>
						<l rend="ti-3">'Believe me,</l>
						<l>Who have chewed the bitter cud from year to year,</l>
						<l>No mortal from the cradle to the bier</l>
						<l>Dissolves that ancient leven.</l>
					</lg></q>

				<p>Therefore it is the most natural thing in the world that pessimism should grow up in the
					soul. It is like the rank weeds that spring up spontaneously in the best ordered garden.
					Pessimism is a confirmed habit of loooking on the dark side of things and of living in
					that atmosphere of imperfection and evil that is a part of the constitution of things.
					Pessimism is simply the dampness that perhaps unavoidably gathers upon the wall of the
					house of Life especially when that house is kept shut, as it must be, more or less, and
					which can only be expelled by a persistent habit of constantly opening the doors and
					windows of the soul and letting in the light and warmth of Nature and Humianity. This
					process of opening the doors and windows may be called, and perhaps not unfitly, optimism.
					Optimism is the beautiful privilege of Youth. When all the chords of life swell with sweet
					music, when expectation sits at the helm as it does in youth, it is easy and natural to
					see and live in <pb id="VAB8209-011" n="9"/> the bright, the beautiful and the good, and
					so living we become optimists. But bye and bye when youth fades and its promises, based
					almost exclusively on hope and inexperience, fail and are reduced to the littleness of
					performance; when gradually we find out all the pettinesses and malices and jealousies of
					humanity; when disappointment works its work and drudgery makes us slaves of unrequited
					and unappreciated toil, our sweet insensibly changes to bitter, and unless we are
					incessantly upon our guard, our optimism becomes pessimism. Worse! Not being able to
					reconcile the evil that overcomes us with the perfect goodness of God, we lose faith in
					the idea of God's goodness--and discard it as a dream of the theologians, and, alas!
					finally doubt whether there is any God. This struggle between the good and ill in the
					heart often lasts a lifetime, with the final victory in favor of pessimism even with the
					most gifted of the human race. One of the saddest facts in literature is that the same
					great singer that in his glorious youth wrote "Lockley's Hall" and in his manhood penned
					"The In Memoriam," perhaps the greatest Christian argument since the days of St. Paul,
					should when crowned with the pomp and glory of four score years, have written with the
					same pen the bitter lines of "Lockley's Hall Sixty Years After" and the blasting
					skepticism of "Despair." "Better, a thousand times better, that the great poet had died at
					three score and ten. In the terrific words of the New Testament: "If the light that is in
					thee become darkness, how great is that darkness."</p>
				<p>One of the potent and open causes of pessimism is our failure to see that all nature is
					arranged upon a system of checks and balances, and that everything in this world has its
					price and that price must be paid in full if we would possess the coveted sweet. Pardon an
					illustration. A beautiful house requires an army of servants and perpetual care and toil
					to keep it in order. Then the inevitable headache and bills that follow every feast, and
					which some one must pay, and which multiply by delay and grows by what they feed upon, are
					the price that must be paid for refined food and conversation. On the other hand the pains
					and snubs of poverty, and its brutalizing associations, are the price that we must pay for
					the joys of idleness. In the arrangement of the affairs of this world <pb id="VAB8209-012"
						n="10"/> God has decreed that upon no plea whatever can something be had for nothing.
					Pay or hands off is the inexorable law. To expect nothing without paying the price is the
					golden rule of a happy life.</p>
				<p>Perhaps the best disproof of pessimism is found in the universalty and cheapness of the
					means of happiness, and of happiness itself in a normal and healthy state of humanity.
					While the world now witnesses, and for thousands of years has witnessed, frightful wrongs,
					yet no thoughtful person can deny that the oppressed are often, and perhaps habitually,
					happy in spite of their wrongs. The slave sings even under the master's lash. The
					substantially equal distribution of happiness throughout the human race is a fact that can
					have escaped no one. My Lord in his coach is no happier than Jeems on the box. My lady in
					her parlour often justly envies Biddy in the kitchen. All the great essentials of life are
					cheap, almost inexpressably cheap. Sleep the sweetest thing in nature visits the poor and
					rich impartially. Sleep like sunshine treats the just and the unjust alike. The necessary
					food, shelter anrd clothing to comfortably sustain life are so cheap and plentiful that
					for any one willing to work to be denied either is almost universally the exception. It is
					our vices and frivolities and the imaginary wants that cost and keep us poor. All that
					there is in a roof is shelter; all that there is in clothing is warmth; all that there is
					in food is nourishment; and shelter, warmth and nourishment can all be had under humble as
					well as princely roofs, and from plain clothes and food as well as from costly raiment and
					fashionable hotels. We grow red and grey toiling for that which when we possess we find to
					be who ly unnecessary. Fashion makes life that otherwise were a pleasure a burden heavy to
					be born. And so with the literary necessities of life. They are so easily gratified that
					no one need hunger nor thirst. For ten cents you can buy a copy of the New Testament and
					for five more the Gospel Hymns. A very good copy of Shakespeare can be bought for fifty
					cents. Here then is a library for a lifetime at a cost of sixty-five cents. From my
					personal knowledge thousands of farmers and mechanics live happy and useful lives, and
					bring up large and splendid families beside firesides that are a perpetual joy, <pb
						id="VAB8209-013" n="11"/> and never accumulate sufficient property to fill the exemption
					laws that all civilized countries provide for the protection of their poor children.</p>
				<p>The cure for pessimism is society, work and activity. The reason why activity is so
					medicating to a diseased mind is that wben we are at work we forget ourselves. Happiness
					and self-forgetfulness are equivalent terms. Accordingly, with consumate wisdom, Nature
					has enacted the great health-giving law of the universe: "In the sweat of thy brow thou
					shalt earn thy bread." The man that is without the necessity of daily labor is indeed
					miserable. The salvation of a million dollars is the necessity of working to take care of
					it. Invest your million so that it takes care of itself and the owner, to save himself
					from death from ennui goes to work to make another million. Society we must and will have,
					or we die. A pure, cheerful, social atmosphere is as healthful to a pesimist as oxygen is
					to one afflicted with pulmonary diseases. An obstinate habit of thinking and speaking well
					of humanity is another indispensible prescription against pessimism. There is a vast deal
					of bad in the world; but a great deal more of good than bad. Unfortunately, the bad makes
					the most noise and has the right of way in the, newspapers. One disreputable woman will
					make more talk than ten thousand ladies but this by no means proves that the ladies are
					not in majority--overwhelmingly so. Besides in balancing the world's good and ill we must
					take into account the satanic press that was compartively unknown half a century ago but
					which now has agencies of untold efficiency for publishing crimes and whatever administers
					to a depraved appetite. Notwithstanding the publicity of vice, notwithstanding the
					mournful fact that after all our boasting man's only a savage with a clean shirt on, and
					civilization is external rather than internal, still I repeat the proposition that the
					good of the world vastly exceeds its bad. There could be no civilization if it were not
					so. Take one of the simplest illustrations. Leave your satchel in the crowded railroad
					car, see how perfectly it takes care of itself in a throng of strangers and takes care of
					your seat at the same time. See again how thoroughly the shallow maxim "Honesty is the
					best policy" has permeated society. If we will once honestly <pb id="VAB8209-014" n="12"/>
					try the simple experiment of noting the bright sunshiny days and the dark, dismal days in
					a year we shall be amazed at the vast preponderence of sun over clouds and brightness over
					gloom. So with men and women Humanity has its cruel side, but its barbarous maxim; "Every
					man for himself," is mostly confined to business and promotion. Some day this savage
					industrial principal of universal competition will give way to combination and mutual
					help. Even now men and women are better than their social and business maxims, and a
					thorough going optimism like honesty is invariably the best policy.</p>
				<p>I know of no remedy for cynicism like deep drafts of humanity. I have never found the
					truth about men better expressed than in these lines of Robert Burns: <q rend="blockquote">
						<lg>
							<l>I'll no say men are villains a',</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">The real and hardened wicked,</l>
							<l>Wha' ha' na check but human law,</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">Are to a few restricted;</l>
							<l>But ach! mankind are unco weak,</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">An' little to be trusted;</l>
							<l>If self the wavering balance shake</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">Its rarely right adjusted.</l>
						</lg></q></p>

				<p>These last two lines tell the whole story. The two great sources of all our troubles are
					self and lack of courage. Nine-tenths of the lies told by Humanity are so many fences
					thrown up to cover timidity. And so with these social lies, called for
					euphony--conventionalities. They are coverts and thickets for weak-minded men and
					women.</p>
				<p>With all your getting get optimism. And to that end be obstinate and persistent in taking
					men by the hand and never allowing the kindly human palm, that can send thrills of warmth
					and kindness through the soul, to become doubled up by rage and prejudice into a fist to
					smite and destroy. Next to work, frequent "people's baths" are a sure cure for pessimism.
					No matter how poor or humble, you will always find noble and generous traits in all sorts
					and conditions of humanity. The kindly human eye, the cheerful music of the human voice
					and the warm human hands are unfailing medicaments for "a mind deseased," the great
					Shakespeare's interrogatory to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
				<p>When I speak of the selfishness as a powerful element <pb id="VAB8209-015" n="13"/> of
					personality, I speak advisedly. Self is one of the great executive powers of the human
					soul. A noticable personality is strongly marked with either self or unself. Men of the
					world understand this principal perfectly and utilize it almost universally. The practical
					politician knows that by far the most effectual way to get office is to help others and to
					keep so doing until pay-day comes round. "Put others in your debt" is the A B C of the
					science of advancement. One of the most potent methods to business and wealth is good
					fellowship and geniality. "The liberal soul shall be made fat." All this, however, is the
					counterfeit of real genuine Unselfishness. Be it so. Still the fact remains that God has
					so made this world that selfishness is always destructive and in spite of itself is in the
					long run overruled and utilized by unselfishness. The water that does not run and thus
					fertilize the earth stagnates. The air that does not circulate becomes miasmatic. The
					wealth that is not used begins to dwindle. That is the growing fortune that is the busiest
					engaged in supplying some human want. The man that does not wear out, rusts out. Service
					is the law of the Universe. Any selfishness long persisted in ruins the possessor. This is
					the open reason of the innumerable wrecks of humanity and of the worthless men and women
					that are everywhere to be found. With infinite earnestness and toil we accomplish the
					selfish dream of our youth--wealth or business or reputation--only to find that the thing
					toiled for has made us its slave. The beautiful house owns the owner and instead of being
					the master he is only the servant who pays the taxes and keeps it in order for others to
					admire and enjoy. How many people are the bond slaves to their reputation! And this is
					quite as true of nations as individuals. The American people have now for a quarter of a
					century taxed themselves to death and cut themselves off from the great trade currents of
					the world by excessive Protection that they might become the richest nation on earth.
					Well, riches undreamed of have come to us and we are now just waking up to the fact that
					we are drifting in consequence of our enormous wealth into a pleutocracy that is a
					thousand times worse than Free Trade. It is not desirable for a republic to have great
					wealth for it invaribly breeds corruption and <pb id="VAB8209-016" n="14"/> substitutes
					money for merit in the conduct of public affairs.</p>
				<p>Some people are sponges. They absorb and absorb and never give off or out until bye and
					bye, like sponges, they mould and rot with that upon which they feed and grow. All
					fruitful work the world over is unselfish work. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the
					woman's reforms proceeds so slowly. Unlike men, women are gifted with the terribly
					exacting gift of Beauty. The requirements and the accompaniments of Beauty; the toilette
					and the distractions of personal adornment are so great as to smother the woman and to
					substitute in her place the elegang parlour ornament. The woman that dresses seven times a
					day has as hard a time to get to heaven as the rich man to get through the needle's
					eye.</p>
				<p>If you should ask me what is the greatest blessing in life, what investment will yield
					the largest returns in happiness, I should unhesitatingly reply--Purity. Of course there
					is such a thing as wearing your heart upon your sleevee for days to peck at, of which the
					great and good Mr. Pickwick was a bright and shining example. There is such a thing as
					casting your pearls before swine. Theere are emergencies where the highest wisdom is a
					severe silence. No reference is made to these cases when I say that one of the elements of
					a high personality is as the great poet puts it: "Keen knowledges shot through and through
					with purity." There is no greater scripture than that phase of charity expressed in the
					words "Thinketh no ill." Purity is the soul and ineffable charm of girlhood and womanhood.
					Why should it not be of manhood and boyhood as well? Parton, in his charming life of Ben
					Franklin, made some admirable remarks upon sexual purity in young men that I wish that I
					had the courage to copy. A pure-minded youth or man will go through life a hundred times
					easier and happier than a knowing, "up to snuff" one. There are some things that it is an
					unspeakable advantage not to know, "for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
					surely die." Happy the man to whom all women are so pure that he cannot tell a wanton.
					Innocence, temptation, guilt and sin: what after all is the story of Adam's fall than an
					allegory telling of these great facts and their unvarying results that some day become
					experience to us <pb id="VAB8209-017" n="15"/> all? All this is no doubt common place
					enough. If you want to verify it, make a study of faces. What is it that gives their charm
					to the faces of horses and dogs? In dogs it is their faithfulness and courage. In hores it
					is their honesty, intelligence and spirit. Why is it that we have such an aversion to and
					yet such a universal attachment for cats? The answer is easy and correct. A cat is
					dishonesty and elegance combined. When the French want to speak strongly of a certain
					phase of a dishonest female character they say "The old cat." But a dog is never thus
					villified. There is no study so altogether delightful as that of human countenances. See
					what an ineffable charm "To think no evil" lends to a man or boys face. There is no artist
					that can beautify a plain face like a pure soul. In my profession as a lawyer it has been
					a lifelong business to study witnesses' faces. An honest face is unmistakable. Often
					gloomy courtroom; are illuminated by countenances of men that don't know how to tell an
					untruth. They are like stars in a black night. It is wonderful how respectful badgering
					and bulldozing lawyers immediately become to such unconscious sovereigns. Let a man think
					no evil and eschew impurity and invisible chisels will carve this fact in every coign of
					vantage upon his countenance. Old George Herbert never uttered so splendid a truth as when
					he said: "For soul is form, and doth the body make." The world has two great sayings; one
					of revealed and the other of unrevealed wisdom: "The pure in heart shall see God," and
					"Evil to him who evil thinks."</p>
				<p>It is hardly necessary to remark that a weak will and a strong personality are
					incompatible terms.</p>

				<p>Ideality. Blessed be the man that is never without his Ideal that he is always striving
					after and never attaining and whose attainment or nonattainment is always full of
					delicious ambition or sorrow. Unhappy he or she who is content to feed and sleep and who
					lets preacher or teacher do their thinking. It is the thoughtful, dreamy, unworldly boy
					that does the world's thinking and work when he reaches manhood's estate. Blessed be the
					youth to whom early in life a great book or person comes along to open up the mighty
					problems of Humanity. George Elliott, with the intuition of genius, has given us portraits
					of such youths. The charm of "The Mill on the Floss" is the contrast between the keen,
					sharp, worldly, successful, yet for all that the essentially superficial brother Tom and
					the deep spiritual, all questioning unworldly sister Maggie, who is ever thirsting for the
					draft divine, and who only finds peace in the pages of a Kempis' Imitatione Christi. In
					the same way one of the delights of Romola is this same contrast between the profound
					idealism of the daughter of di Bardi and her all accomplished and subtle Greek husband.
					The man that is without ideals is worse than the man without music that Shakespeare has
					held up for the pity of the world. One of the reasons for the world's deification of Our
					Savior is the fact that he was the loftiest idealist that humanity has ever had in its
					midst. Herbert Spencer, in his "Data of Ethics," speaks of Christ's teachings concerning
					property, enemies and the conduct of life as "Transcendental altruistic nonsense." Renan,
					in his beautiful and very profitable "Life of Christ,"reiterates this same view, only in a
					different way and from a different standpoint. Now there is no doubt but that in one sense
					this arraignment of our Savior's teachings by Spencer is true. Who can possibly love his
					or her enemies? What Christian even practices or believes in that community of property,
					or rather in that contempt of property, that the Master taught? He was himself an early
					victim of hs own code of practical conduct. Mr. Spencer calls attention to the immense
					benefits that, had He <pb id="VAB8209-019" n="17"/> come to three score years and ten, the
					world might have received, all of which were lost by His neglect and contempt for those
					maxims of worldly purdence, the neglect and contempt of which brought upon Him the
					hostility of those in power and which cost him his life while He was yet in the flush of
					his young manhood. How is it possible human nature being as it is, to love our neighbors
					as our selves? Or to leave father, son or wife for gospel's sake? The practice of His
					church is the best commentary upon the attempt to follow his teachings in practical life
					even by the regenerate and baptized. And yet our Saviour was right. Do these objections to
					his precepts as transcendental and beyond the capacity of the average mortal prove them
					untrue? What does the word visionary realy imply? At no time or place does he or his
					apostles profess conformity with this world or its methods. The very fact that He was a
					trancendant idealist and that his church are as yet in the A B C stage of his teachings is
					only another proof of his greatness. The argument that Christianity does so little for
					men; that the world's unbaptized honesty is as current at our banks and in the trades as
					that of the elect and fore-ordained; that the church seldom, or never, leads in great
					reforms, but almost always follows, and that, after all, the average church is only a
					religious club house, only proves how deep-seated is the disease of sin and how crude and
					unworthy is the human material out of which the kingdom of God on earth is to be buit. It
					does not prove that humanity will not one day rise to that industrial level that Edward
					Bellamy describes in his "Looking Backwards," much less that a regenerated personality may
					not attain these lofty heights that the New Testament sets before us or that these heights
					are the dreams of a self-deluded dreamer. Idealism is the salt and waves that keep life's
					ocean sweet. The unrest of the soul; the ever present and ever torturing doubt; the
					unsettled questions that give the nations no peace; are the salvation of humanity.</p>
				<p>Pardon me an experiene. When I was a boy of thirteen an odd volume of Emerson's Essays
					fell into my hands. I conned its pages over and over until their subtle teachings entered
					like the atoms of medicine into my mental <pb id="VAB8209-020" n="18"/> and moral blood.
					Emerson easily lead to Wordsworth and Tennyson and the three combined made me a small
					idealist and a dreamer of dreams. This youthful habit has always interfeared with my
					practical life and success and yet for forty years it has proven to me a saviour of life
					unto life. These great authors have been to me interpreters of Nature in her thousand
					manifestations and forms as well as a constant source of refreshment and joy. When courts
					have cut to pieces my carefully prepared briefs and lawsuits; when painfully prepared
					plans have "gang aft aglay" and instead of ducats left me debts; when malice has put up
					her putrid lips to scandal's ear and whispered lies about me and mine; when
					disapointements have pessimized; Thank Heaven! owing to this early idelizing habit that
					come to me through Emerson's Essays I can always set down and in a moment forget all these
					disturbing influences and regain my strength and sanity in the sweet fields of innocent
					fiction and the drama; in the charms of poetry and in the inspirations and intoxications
					of recorded eloquence. Thanks to Emerson and Wordsworth vice has never had any attractions
					for me. Let me advise you to go and do likewise. One of the open secrets of the value and
					power of Education lies in its preoccupation of the mind with useful knowledge and refined
					and saving tastes, thus planting early in life the seeds that afterwards yield valuable
					fruits and crowd out those destructive tares that idleness, false taste and temptation
					invariably sow in the best and richest natures. Possessing such tastes and thus early
					schooling yourselves you will acquire a treasure that will never wax old but which will
					prove a constant joy all through your life's journey.</p>
				<p>Personality is the secret and soul of religion. Therlogy is an effort to express in
					measured and philosophic language our conceptions of the divine personality. The origin
					groath and development of the idea of God in the world is an exceedingly attractive study.
					From its earliest dawn every nation and every philosophic system of thought has had its
					great first cause. No sound system of thinking starts with any other premise. But the
					great first cause of philosophy, unpersonalized and the great first cause of religeon
					personalized are two entirely different matters. Philosophy unable to explain the ever
					present evil of the <pb id="VAB8209-021" n="19"/> world doubts the infinite goodness or
					the omnipotence of its concept. It reasons thus "If God were perfectly good He would not
					have created the whirlwind or miasma; therefore there must have been a limitation to his
					power." On the other hand the religious sentiment clothing this same concept with all that
					experience has found best in this world and multiplying the product by infinity gives us
					as the result a perfect father and discipline as a solution of the problem of evil with
					eternity as an answer for all its unanswered difficulities. An unpersonalized God--a great
					first cause is a barren abstraction and dangerously liable to run into all sorts of
					scientific speculation and skepticism. When the great essayest Matthew Arnold defined
					religion as emotionalized conduct he evidently referred to religion on its human side. On
					its divine side religion is God personalized. Of course there is a wide and deep
					diffenence which we do not forget between God as a fact and our human conceptions of that
					fact. All the great religions go almost infinitely farther in personalizing the Deity.
					They all have their incarnation--that is, "God-made flesh." The uderlying idea of this
					incarnation is the Deity expressing Himself in terms of human speech, thought and conduct.
					When the sage of three score and ten talks with the child of ten he drops sixty of his
					years and speaks in child language. In the same way Christ is God expressed in terms of
					human speech and conduct. All religions exhibit the same phenomena. For example, the
					Hindoos have the incarnate Buddha. The Free Thinkers claim that the world has had over
					twenty martyred saviors, all of whom claimed to be divine. This is the very open secred of
					the deification of the Virgin Mary by the Catholic church. Our catholic brethren have the
					advantage over us protestants in the possession of a mother as well as a father God. The
					Virgin represents to them the deification of the feminine affections while God the Father
					represents the deification of the more masculine ideas of law and justice. The personality
					of our Saviour, and its preservation and transmission to the world and humanity through
					the agency of an organized church, is nother most attractive study. What in the last
					analysis on human side is redemption, except the salvation and cure of our lower nature
					through contact with absorption <pb id="VAB8209-022" n="20"/> and from a higher
					personality--God made flesh? The New Testament has given us a marvelous historical record
					of this Divine person in printed words. But side-by-side with this testimony of apostles
					and evangelists, "eye witnesses of His Majesty," the church has found a dozen other almost
					equally effective agencies for handing down from generation to generation other unwritten
					and unspoken memories and phases of Christ's personality. Often one phase is called the
					spirit. Shakespeare, in Julius Cæser, speaks of "The spirit of the mightiest Julius still
					walks the earth." What is the apostolic succession but a transmission of this spirit; the
					personality of the Master, from century to century through the human devise of a laying on
					of hands? The Lord's Supper, with its now worn out dogma of the real presence or
					transubstantiation, is in the same line--a means of commemorating and perpetuating to the
					world the spirit and personality of Jesus Christ through a sacrament. From the beginning
					the church has always had its hymn book and poetry. What is an hymn book but a
					supplemental Bible, expressing in the subtle language of music all that is greatest and
					best in the human soul? "If you want to teach a doctrine," said the Methodist Bishop,
					"sing it. Moody and Sankey started the greatest of modern American revivals with giving
					the world a volume of Gospel Hymns, a book but little inferior in its power of spiritual
					exaltation to the gospel from which it takes its name. Music is an invisible bridge upon
					whose airy abutments and arches our spirits pass from the limitations and imperfections of
					this world to that world where time and space are unknown. The church has always
					cultivated all the arts for the perpetuation of the divine personality. Hence the truism
					"Art and religion are half sisters." The cathedral is an attempt, more or less successful,
					to express our religious ideas, hopes and aspirations in marble. In painting we seek to do
					the same in color. A picture becomes invaluable as distinguished from valuable only as it
					has pover to lead us up to the invisible and inexpressible. For one I have little sympathy
					with Coleridge's definition of a picture as "something between a thought and a thing." It
					is a great deal more than either. It is a great personalized hope or aspiration, clothed
					in color's wondrous robe. This personality <pb id="VAB8209-023" n="21"/> of our Savior is
					best illustrated by the spirit's influence upon human life. The transmission of His
					personality through his living epistles, known and read of all," is the most efficacious
					of christian agencies. "The noble army of martyrs praise thee." The world has never been
					without such witnesses to the christian faith. It is said that Plato's death, now over two
					thousand years ago, there has never been at any one time over a dozen men that fully
					comprehended the ideas of the great thinker. Yet these dozen men have kept the torch
					lighted and have handed it down from generation to generation in unbroken succession. So
					with the personality of Jesus Christ. It has been passed down from the day of his death,
					from land to land and from century to century, so that it is literally true that <q
						rend="blockquote">
						<lg>
							<l>The word by seer and sybil told,</l>
							<l>In shrines of oak and fanes of gold,</l>
							<l>Still whispers on the morning wind--</l>
							<l>Still echoes to the willing mind.</l>
						</lg></q></p>

				<p>This same spirit is the perpetual charm and inspiration of all true christian poetry. It
					is probable that Robert Browning more truly than any other poet of the nineteenth century
					has caught and expressed the inmost secretes of christianity. Upon his shoulders has
					fallen the mantle of the once christian Tennyson. All through Browning's gnarled and
					unwedgable verse this idea predominates, viz.: the regeneration of fallen and depraved
					humanity through its contact with an higher and superior personality--a personality which
					supplies that life and quickening spirit, and which elevates and uses our intellectuel
					faculties as its servant and mouthpiece. Browning makes the haughty intellect secondary in
					the regeneration of humanity. With him the religious sentiment is the supreme power in the
					universe, its Creator and Savior alone excepted. Browning's creed is emphatically "the new
					birth of the Spirit." His ablest American critic puts it thus: "The acquisition of
					knowledge is a good thing, the sharpening of the intellect is a good thing, the
					cultivation of philosophy is a good thing; but there is something of infinitely greater
					importance than all these, viz.: the hidden soul, which co-operates with the active powers
					and the conscious intellect, and as this <pb id="VAB8209-024" n="22"/> conscious intellect
					is either rectified or unrectified it determines the man as a power for either
					righteousness or unrighteousness."</p>
				<p>Finally. A great faith is an indispensable of a great personality. We all know in
					practical life what the word "Faithless" means. It is no less significant when applied to
					the unseen world. Huxley, in his recent articles in the Nineteenth Century, thus defines
					Agnosticism, of which he is the proud and happy parent: "It consists in a suspension of
					judgment until the facts are verified by sufficient evidence to satisfy our critical
					faculties."</p>
				<p>That definition rules out of court all that splendid portion of our moral and spiritual
					equipment except those faculties with which we observe, classify, reason and analyze. That
					compells us to make a religion as we make a Botany or a Geology with hammer, knife and
					note book. That is a good enough rule for science or business but a most destructive rule
					for the conduct of life or the building of a home or even for politics. Suppose we should
					in the building of a state ignore patriotism or that love of country that warms every
					human breast, and trust the whole to statesmanship? About how long under such a system
					should we as a nation have survived the great storms of 1861? The agnostics insist upon
					bringing every thing to the test of the scientific method.</p>
				<p>The scientific method is certainly the supreme rule when applied to objective truth. But
					in the fenceless and shoreless kingdom of emotive truth this method has little or no
					application. Any one would ridicule an attempt to apply to music the rules that are
					supreme in biology and finance. The wisest of earth once said "render to Cæsar the things
					that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's." A simple truthful application of
					this great maxim will soon show us how idle the attempt to usubject faith to the test of
					multiplication and division or to the syllogism. In the world of science unquestionably
					two and two always have and always will make four. But there are worlds where
					multiplication tables are unknown. Every man carries in his bosom a kingdom unconditioned
					by the laws of time and space. An emotion is one thing; a thought quite another and
					different thing. It is exactly this element that differentiates Science from Religion. To
					Science veryifying <pb id="VAB8209-025" n="23"/> all things with little formulae and
					measuring all things with compass and chain miracles seem nonsense. But the higher up we
					get the less difficulty we have with revelation. In our deep moments we find a profound
					consistency between the miracle and the message of the Master so that denying the one you
					must deny the other. There is a necessity in the Master of life leading captivity captive
					and bursting the bands of death. Suppose our Lord had not been crucified dead and buried
					and did not rise again the third day what becomes of all our arguments for the immortality
					of the soul? Suppose that our Lord did not heal the sick, open the eyes of the blind, what
					becomes of his claims to have been the great physician of the deseases of the soul? "I
					will be thou clean," what mockery these words and what an imposter their author if the
					fact recorded with them was a myth added after wards by a churchly pen for eccleastical
					purposes?</p>
				<p>Agnosticism, Positiveism and the Scientific religion so called have certainly some
					splendid principals and ideas. They had done a great work of late years in pointing out
					the weaknesses of christianity and thereby reforming them. In this respect Col. Ingersoll
					has been a benefactor of those churches and dogmas that he has so mercilessly ridiculed.
					Agnosticism believes in one world at a time and insists that our work here is to make
					man's life sweeter and better. Curiously enough it can see no higher sources of happiness
					even in this world than better sanitation, better social science and better education. It
					is the parent of great reforms in all that pertains to man's temporary well being. It
					vigorously espouses all enterprises for the elevation of the race and finds its
					immortality in the type and its happiness in the improvement of that type for the benefit
					of coming generations. It shows its disinterestedness in its carelessness for a personal
					hereafter. Among its great apostles are some of the most brilliant names of the present
					century, names like George Elliott, Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer and an host of
					others all of whom have by their noble labors made humanity their debtors. Never from my
					lips shall go forth a word of depreciation of the lives and labors of these men and women
					many of them the noblest, the bravest and brightest of the human race. And yet there is a
					painful <pb id="VAB8209-026" n="24"/> emptiness about agnosticism, positiveism and the
					kindred philosophies especially when compared with christianity. The epitaph upon the
					tombstone of Professor Clifford tells the whole story and is probably the best that his
					creed could give. Here it is; read it: <q rend="blockquote">
						<lg>
							<l>I was not,</l>
							<l>I was born and did a little work,</l>
							<l>I am not and grieve not</l>
						</lg></q></p>

				<p>Let us test Agnosticism by a few simple questions. Is there a God? Answer. I don't know.
					Did God create man? I don't know. Whence comes life? I don't know. Does God govern this
					world? I don't know. Is man divine? I don't know. Will we live hereafter? I don't know.
					Was Christ divine? I don't know. Is the Bible divine? No, or I don't know. Now to all
					these mighty questions Christianity returns a bold, unhesitating, affirmative answer. In
					addition it teaches the life of God in the soul--a fact incomprehensible to the agnostic
					or mere scientist. To the religion of science all that beautiful cluster of mighty hopes
					that heal our sorrows, calm our fears cheer our darkness and inspire us with enthusiasm,
					and which are to the spiritual man absolute certainties, are only perhapses. The agnostic
					and scientist are as narrow as their methods. "Reason, Observation and Experience" are
					their only trinity. Their sphere is the little world of the senses and intellect and the
					present. They have neither hymn nor prayer. Now it is almost self evident that this
					present is only an half world. Christianity is immeasurably its superior, because it opens
					up to us not merely man in his relation to the present and each other, but man in his
					relation to his Maker and the hereafter. In the deserts of pessimism it causes the roses
					of hope and the fountains of faith to spring up. It substitutes for the painful "I don't
					know" the cheerful "I believe." It fills and floods the soul with useful, life-saving
					emotion. It teaches that the Most High dwells in the humblest heart and that all men are
					His children, and that He is near, inexpressably near, to all those that call upon Him.
					For the unsolved and the unsolvable difficulties that fill our souls with doubt and pain
					christianity has a cheery "I can wait." "Now we see through a glass darkly; then I shall
					see Him face to face." For these <pb id="VAB8209-027" n="25"/> reasons christianity, with
					all of its weaknesses and errors such as are the inseparable incidents of its connection
					with humanity, is one of the vital forces of the world and as much superior to agnosticism
					and its kindred creeds and beliefs as the all-embracing and life-giving air that sustains
					and nourishes all animate and inanimate Nature is superior to a painfully-prepared and
					circumscribed vaccuum.</p>
				<p>More than all this--Christianity has an ever present, life giving Savior; a constant
					source of life, inspiration and enthusiasm. "In whose service pain is pleasure, in whose
					freedom loss is gain!" This is the supreme weakness of the skeptical creeds, viz.: the
					utter absence from them of any divine person, to whom the child in his weakness and the
					strong man in his strength can and does go for worship and rest, let alone His help in the
					awful hours of dissolution and his promises of "sweet fields beyond the swelling floods."
					When we compare the two systems we shall find that it is not altogether cant or
					superstition that causes the Christian to characterise the scientific religion as
					"husks."</p>
				<p>Said Thomas A. Hendricks: <q rend="blockquote">
						<p>(Holcomb's life of Hendricks, page 541.) "I care not which one of the highways you
							pursue towards knowledge, you will come to a place in the course of your travels when
							you will stop; when you can go no farther, as upon the road it shall be a mountain and
							an impassible gulf, and beyond that what is the distant land then becomes a question
							exclusively of faith. This side of that boundary line it is not allowed us to adopt
							faith; but I take is the Providence which intended that the human intellect should
							always be stimulated to enquiry, intended that we should always rely upon our efforts
							for investigation within the relm of proper inquiry. But we reach a line beyond which
							inquiry cannot go sometimes very early in our progress."</p>
						<p>"I know scarcely any question that does not have this limit and restriction. Take
							your own person and you know of its existence, you know of its faculties and powers,
							but really you know but little of yourself. Have you any idea how it is that your will
							governs your body? You know the fact that by the will the mind itself does work but
							how it is and why it is you know not. You know that some <pb id="VAB8209-028" n="26"/>
							faculty is connected with your body that conducts its action, but just what that
							faculty is you know as much as Adam and Eve when they stepped out of the garden. They
							know just as much as you do. No philosopher has gone farther. How is it that spirit
							dwells with matters and how it influences the action of matter no man knows or ever
							will know. So I might go on with illustrations, but I will not undertake it. For
							myself when I came to that boundary where faith begins I choose for my faith that
							which is the most beautiful--that which is the most cheering and that which will
							promote man's happiness to the greatest extent and add to the glory and honor of the
							Great Author of all things."</p></q></p>
				<p>I want now and here in this chapel and in this presence to put upon record my small
					protest against the scientific and agnostic skepticism of the day and the hour. Our
					worship, that worship that is born within us and is a part of our nature, is as ultimate a
					fact and is no more referable to some other fact, and its deliverences are as unanalysable
					as are the fact and deliverences of our eyes and ears. Who ever attempted to get back of
					sight and refer its working to supertition or ignorance? And yet our worship stands upon
					as impregnable a foundation. Destroy to-day every vestige of every religion in the world
					and in less than ten years every temple and church would be restored. I for one protest
					that our religion is not what we do not know, or that because it refuses to be placed upon
					the same plate as our philosophy, it is to be discarded. As well discard our music, our
					art or our poetry. I insist that there are other and higher species of evidence than
					either the demonstrative or the moral. The religious instinct, the higher laws of belief,
					the "gnosticism" of Dr. Lyman Abbottt, are all of the same class as our worship, and I
					believe that the proposition is sound, that upon subjects beyond the scope of evidence and
					beyond the scope of our reasoning powers, it is save to believe. Revelation without such
					evidence as we rightfully demand concerning matters which are the subjects of sight and
					sound, or even those higher ranges of subjects that fall within the scope and jurisdiction
					of our reasoning faculties. It seems to me that the weak spot in the attacks <pb
						id="VAB8209-029" n="27"/>of to-day upon the old faith and of the church's defense to
					those attacks is, in the language of the lawyer, in the advocates of christianity not
					pleading to the jurisdiction of the courts of science in trying at its bar and with its
					weapons the cause of christianity.</p>
				<p>Christianity as delivered to the world by its author was never intended as an
					intellectual system. It is and was, and always will be when rightly understood--a life.
					Hence, it came through unlearned men and a peasant teacher. So unlearned and unmodern was
					he that if He should come back to the world again to-day He would not be admitted to
					one-third of the temples that are built for His worship. And he would fare far worse at
					the hands of his colleges of theology. He would no more recognize himself in the grotesque
					dogmas of his schools than in the scarlet robes and episcopal rings and man millinery
					which claims to have been manufactured "in remembrance of Him." No wonder that the simple
					religion of the Master that is so travestied and handicapped by his disciples is the scoff
					of the scholars and critics of to-day! Fortunately these things do not represent the
					Master; they only represent the caricatures that sectarianism and self-interest has woven
					around Him in their efforts to make merchandise of Him and his words.</p>
				<p> For one I belong to the great and increasing army of Christian Free Thinkers. I brush
					away from the dear Master all the subtileties of the schools, all the travesties of the
					sectarin and all that sullies His simple majesty and grandeur. I take for my chart and
					guide the simple words of the evangelists. I want no church or school to put their
					interpretation or constructions upon them for me any more than I want a learned Latin name
					for the morning star. I allow myself full liberty to reject a few of the doubtful sayings
					attributed to him. I have no scruple about dropping an occasional miracle which appears to
					me to be either ecclesiastical or traditional. Making all these subtractions after now for
					over forty-five years reading both sides an gathering light from all sources, I yield to
					Him and His Divinity the allegiance of my gathering gray hairs and most matured judgment.
					In the words of our greatest American poet, <pb id="VAB8209-030" n="28"/> and who is still
					with us, bearing the snows of now rearly two and eighty years beautiful years--and who has
					uttered nothing base-- <q rend="blockquote">
						<lg>
							<l>Our friend, our brother and our Lord--</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">What may thy service be?</l>
							<l>Not schoolman's form nor churchman's word;</l>
							<l rend="ti-1">But simply following Thee?</l>
						</lg></q> But it is time these words were spoken.</p>
				<p>Oh, ye youths! for it is to you that I speak. Hear the end of the whole matter--<hi
						rend="i">Life is Divine!</hi> We came from God; to God we shall return; to God we must
					account for the use we have made of this trust called Life. The angel that taps at the
					window where the great mystery called birth is taking place, bearing a little child in his
					arms, came from God, and the same angel that three score and ten years afterwards bears
					away from the same chamber the disciplined, ripened spirit and bears it back to God. Oh,
					remember! and these are my final words to you.</p>

				<q rend="blockquote">
					<lg>
						<l>Life are not as idle ore.</l>
						<l>But iron dug from central gloom,</l>
						<l>And heated hot with burning fears</l>
						<l>And bathed in baths of hissing tears;</l>
						<l>And battered with the shocks of doom</l>
						<l>To shape and use A rise and fly--</l>
						<l>The realing faun, the sensual feast</l>
						<l>Move upwards, working out the beast--</l>
						<l>And let the ape and tiger die.</l>
					</lg></q>

				<p>"And the Lord God made man; out of the dust of the ground formed he him and breathed into
					his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul."</p>
