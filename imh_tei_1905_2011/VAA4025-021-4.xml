                    Society.</byline>
            <p>A paper read before the Society at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, August 28, 1925.</p>
            <p>It is the common belief in southern Indiana that the history of the state had its beginnings in that
                    section. There was the earliest permanent settlement at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and there at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the first territorial capital. There the judges first met to administer the laws.
                    In that section, too, was the first state capital at Corydon, the beautiful little town among the
                    hills of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName> not far from the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. And there at Corydon assembled the
                    first state convention which drew up our first state constitution. There first came the people from
                    the south and southeast, from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, the Carolinas and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, to settle our state; when the state capital was moved from Corydon to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1825 it was located far north of the center of population. Of the thirteen organized
                    counties that made the state in 1816 only <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> at the end of a strip of territory along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> border reached as far north as half way up the state. Nearly all of the population of
                    63,000 lived within a hundred miles of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>.</p>
            <p>Yet the truth still remains that here, where we now meet, white civilization first penetrated into
                    what is now the State of Indiana. Here, if we are to trace back our life story of discovery and
                    exploration, the history of Indiana begins.</p>
            <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-021-4-002"/>
            <p>The annals of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph County</region>
                    </placeName> reach farther back into our historical traditions than do those of any other county in
                    the State; and your landscape, so far as we know, is the first in Indiana that was looked upon by
                    the eye of the white man. That story has been preserved for us by one of your distinguished fellow
                    citizens of former times, to whom Indiana will be under lasting obligations. I refer to Judge
                    Timothy Howard, whom I had the honor to know, who with his co-workers in your Society has rendered
                    such inestimable service to Indiana and her history.</p>
            <p>I shall not "carry coals to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newcastle</settlement>
                    </placeName>" by re-telling here any of the story of this region, so well told in Judge
                    Howard's <hi rend="i">History of <placeName>
                            <region type="county">St. Joseph County</region>
                        </placeName>.</hi> But here in this county you have, as we all know, both the St. Joe and the
                    Kankakee. Here is the water shed—<geogName>Summit Lake</geogName> or <geogName>LaSalle
                        Lake</geogName>, or whatever it may now be called—which separates the waters of the
                    St. Lawrence from those of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. Here were some of the scenes of those great pioneer discoverers and explorers of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, which form the subject of my paper.</p>
            <p>What I have to say tonight is not the result of any historical discovery nor the product of an
                    original investigation on my part. My purpose is merely to recite again in simple words the old
                    story of romance and adventure. It may seem like a story for children, but it is one suitable for
                    children of a larger growth. It is a story that can not be too often told. Perhaps for lack of the
                    telling our children do not know it at all, and in the loss of it they lose one of the most
                    thrilling chapters of American history.</p>
            <p>After Oglethorpe had settled <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> in 1733, the English towns and settlements stretched for hundreds of miles along the
                    Atlantic seaboard. But, so far, they had not passed the foothills of the Alleghenies. Beyond these
                    mountains was an unknown land. There were great lakes and rivers, and forests, and fertile valleys,
                    and rich meadows, and vast prairies, which the English had not explored nor attempted to settle.</p>
            <p>While the English were settling the coast, was no one exploring these vast inland regions? Yes, the
                    French were exploring them, and the story of their exploits is the ambitious theme of this paper.</p>
            <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-021-4-003"/>
            <p>In the days of Colbert, the great colonizing statesman of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, the French ambition was to connect by a line of forts the mouth of the St. Lawrence
                    with the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>; and thus holding America by its two ends, establish a great inland empire for New <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. The dream came to an end in the French disasters of the Seven Years War.</p>
            <p>In carrying out their plan the French sent out explorers to learn about the country. They sent out
                    fur traders to control the fur trade with the Indians. They sent out missionaries to convert the
                    Indians and to win them over to help the French. The French had soldiers, too, who would build forts
                    and induce the Indian warriors to help them against the English. The French knew that the English
                    settlers would soon be coming over the mountains from the coast.</p>
            <p>On the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> in a contest over a few miserable huts the final conflict between these two national
                    forces began, which ended in the British empire in America. But I turn from this historic conflict
                    and its outcome to the beginning of the French adventures, not those of Cartier and Champlain in
                    lower <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, but those of the later great French heroes in what was then the far west.</p>
            <p>Let us notice first the adventures of Joliet and Marquette:</p>
            <p>Louis Joliet was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quebec</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1645. He was the son of a wagonmaker. He was educated by the Jesuits to be a priest.
                    But Joliet did not become a priest. Instead he became a fur trader. He was a bold, enterprising
                    merchant who was ready for a voyage of discovery and adventure.</p>
            <p>Jacques Marquette was born in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in 1637. As a young man he was very religious. He joined the Jesuits (Society of Jesus)
                    and became a priest. He was sent as a missionary to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and in 1668 he was living among the Indians in a mission station at St. Ignace, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. In six years he learned to speak six Indian languages.</p>
            <p>Father Marquette was of a gentle nature, but he knew no fear. He was an heroic, unselfish man, full
                    of missionary zeal and he was ready to give his life, if need be, for the sake of the Indian tribes.</p>
            <p>Joliet received orders from Frontenac, the Governor of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, to go with Marquette on a voyage of discovery to see <pb n="278" id="VAA4025-021-4-004"/> if they could find the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>. In
                    Indian, "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>" means the "Father of Waters". The French had heard tales
                    from the Indians about this great river so far away. They wished to find it for themselves.</p>
            <p>On the 17th of May, 1673, these two bold leaders embarked with five other men in two birch canoes.
                    They had a supply of smoked meat and Indian corn.</p>
            <p>They went through the Strait of Mackinac along the north shore of Lake <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. Over on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> side of the lake they came to the "Wild-rice" Indians. They told the
                    Indians the object of their voyage. The Indians did all they could to persuade them to go no
                    further. They said the banks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> were inhabited by wild tribes who put every stranger to death; they would tomahawk all
                    newcomers without cause. They said there was a demon in the river whose roar could be heard at a
                    great distance and who would drown them in the deep waters. The waters were full of frightful
                    monsters who would devour them and their canoes.</p>
            <p>These stories did not make Marquette afraid. He gave the Indians his blessing, taught them a prayer,
                    and bade them farewell.</p>
            <p>Marquette and Joliet with their men continued their journey. They came into Green Bay and went up the
                        <geogName>Fox River</geogName>. They dragged their canoes up the rapids and followed the
                    windings of the river through tangles of wild rice.</p>
            <p>They got two Indian guides to show them the way to the <geogName>Wisconsin River</geogName>. They
                    came to the portage, the land which separates two rivers flowing in opposite directions. There they
                    had to carry their canoes a mile and a half over the prairies and the swamps. Finally they launched
                    their little boats on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Then they bade farewell to the waters that flowed into the St. Lawrence. Where now were they going?
                    Would the Great River, if they found it, carry them to the Gulf of Mexico or to the Gulf of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>? They did not know. They were in a vast wilderness where, it seemed, no other white men
                    had ever been.</p>
            <p>They glided down the beautiful <geogName>Wisconsin River</geogName>, past islands covered with trees,
                    passing wonderful dells and rocks, <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-021-4-005"/> by forests and groves and
                    prairies, by thickets and marshes and sand bars. Finally, "with a joy that I can not
                    express," said Marquette, their canoes glided into the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Here was nothing but solitude. There was not a trace of a man. A big catfish almost upset
                    Marquette's canoe. The buffalo appeared on the bank, grazing in great herds.</p>
            <p>At night the explorers built their fire and had their supper of corn meal and deer meat. When they
                    got ready for bed they crept under their canoes and slept beneath the stars.</p>
            <p>For two weeks they journeyed without seeing a human being. Then they found footprints of men in the
                    mud, then a well trodden path which they followed to an Indian village. They came so near without
                    being seen that they could hear the voices of the Indians in their wigwams. Then they shouted to
                    attract attention. The Indians came swarming out of their huts. What are we to suppose they thought
                    of these strange white men who were so far from home and who looked so unlike
                    themselves,—Marquette in his long black priestly robe and Joliet and the others in their
                    buckskin hunting suits and fur caps? These Indians may never have seen white men before, and we may
                    well believe that they were astonished.</p>
            <p>Marquette lifted the Calumet, the symbol of peace. Four chieftains came forward to meet the
                    strangers. They had peace pipes decorated with feathers. They stood before the Frenchmen without
                    speaking a word. Marquette broke the silence and asked them who they were. "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>," a chieftain said, and offered the pipe of peace. They were among the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> tribe of Indians.</p>
            <p>Then they all went to the village, followed by a throng of warriors, squaws, and papooses. The Big
                    Chief welcomed them in a strange fashion. He stood stark naked at the door of his wigwam, holding up
                    both hands as if to shield his eyes from the sun. "Frenchmen," he said,
                    "how bright the sun shines when you come to visit us. See, our village awaits you, and you
                    shall enter our wigwams in peace."</p>
            <p>The Indians entertained their visitors. They fed them on buffalo meat and fish and Indian meal. They
                    offered some dog meat, which the visitors refused.</p>
            <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-021-4-006"/>
            <p>After this visit the explorers went on down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. After a little while they came to a torrent of rushing yellow mud that came sweeping
                    into the calm blue <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. The current of the new river was boiling and surging and carrying in its course logs
                    and branches of uprooted trees. They were in the mouth of the great <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, which flowed for 2,000 miles from the great Northwest.</p>
            <p>The travellers got safely by and they went on past the future site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, past the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, on to the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>. They saw other Indian tribes upon the shores, some of them fierce and threatening. As
                    they came near the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName> they saw a cluster of wigwams on the west bank. When the Indians saw the strangers they
                    began yelling their war-whoop, snatching their weapons and running to the shore. Several large
                    wooden canoes filled with savages put out from the shore above and below our explorers to cut off
                    their retreat. A swarm of headlong young warriors waded into the river; the current was too strong
                    for them to come very near, but one of the warriors threw his war club at the Frenchmen. The Indians
                    began to prepare their bows and arrows, but as Marquette continued to hold up the cross and the pipe
                    of peace, the older chiefs called off the young fighters. The travellers did not dare to go further
                    down the river for fear of hostile Indians and the Spaniards. They turned back for the homeward
                    journey.</p>
            <p>We may be sure they had a hard time paddling up the stream against the current. They turned into the
                        <geogName>Illinois River</geogName> and made their way over a portage to Lake <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and then up to Green Bay. When they reached there, they had paddled their canoes over
                    2,500 miles. They had certainly made a wonderful and romantic voyage.</p>
            <p>Joliet went to Quebec to give a report of their voyage. Good fortune had attended the travellers on
                    their long exploration, but now the luck seemed to turn. At La Chine rapids, just above Montreal,
                    Joliet's canoe was upset, two of his men and an Indian boy were drowned, his papers were
                    lost, and Joliet barely escaped with his life. He said he had passed forty-two rapids on his long
                    voyage and now his canoe had capsized when he was almost at home and the danger <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-021-4-007"/> seemed over. He had only his life left, but he said he was ready to
                    offer that again in the service of discovery. Of such spirit were the stout hearts of the devoted
                    explorers.</p>
            <p>Marquette had grown ill on the homeward journey and from that illness he never fully recovered. He
                    regained some strength and with two companions he started back to his old mission station at St.
                    Ignace. He was able to go only part of the way. In Northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, on the shore of the great lake, on the site of Ludington, near where Old Mission now
                    is, he died on May 19, 1677. His two companions dug a grave beside the hut and buried him. So lived
                    and died a great priest and a great explorer, who loved his fellow men and who has left a great name
                    in American history.</p>
            <p>Let us now look to the story of LaSalle, the greatest hero of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>LaSalle was born in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in 1643. He was not a Jesuit, nor a fur-trader, nor a missionary. He was a great leader
                    who loved wilderness exploration. He dreamed of a great empire for <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in America, and he wanted his country to control the valley of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>On one of his journeys south from Lake Erie he discovered the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Soon after, he concluded that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> flowed into the Gulf of Mexico, not into the Gulf of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. He wanted to find its mouth to fortify it and guard it against both the English and
                    the Spaniards.</p>
            <p>To carry out these plans he and his men explored nearly half a continent, and his travels and labors
                    reveal one of the most marvelous stories in American history.</p>
            <p>One of the first things which LaSalle did was to build a large vessel above Niagara Falls, to
                    navigate the Great Lakes. The carpenters and shipbuilders cut down great trees and set to work to
                    build the ship. The Indians were astonished at the vast ribs of the wooden monster.</p>
            <p>In the spring she was ready for launching. On her prow was carved a great image like a griffen, and
                        <hi rend="i">Griffen</hi> became the name of the ship. Five small cannon looked out from the
                    port holes. The cannon were fired and the French and Indians shouted in chorus as the Griffen glided
                    into the <geogName>Niagara River</geogName>. You may well believe that the Indians were amazed.</p>
            <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-021-4-008"/>
            <p>Sail was set and the Griffen, coming out of the <geogName>Niagara River</geogName>, began to plow the
                    waters of Lake Erie where sail had never been seen before. For three days they sailed over Lake
                    Erie, then into the strait of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There the sailors saw wild turkeys and bears and herds of deer. They crossed Lake St.
                    Clair, and then their eyes beheld Lake Huron spread out before them like a glassy sea.</p>
            <p>The Griffen went through some furious storms and gales, and at times the sailors almost despaired of
                    their lives. After a time they reached Mackinac and St. Ignace, where the French had mission
                    stations.</p>
            <p>LaSalle's party went on to Green Bay. There he sent the Griffen back to Ft. Niagara with a
                    valuable cargo of furs, while he and fourteen men continued on the journey.</p>
            <p>Hardships now came upon them. There were almost ceaseless storms; they were drenched and nearly
                    starved. Every night the canoes had to be dragged up the steep banks of the lake while the waves and
                    breakers dashed over them. Once in a lull in the storm they steered to a little island, made a fire
                    of driftwood, crouched around it, and drew their blankets over their heads. There, pelted with sleet
                    and rain, they remained in this miserable plight for two days. They ate some haws and wild berries,
                    which made them sick. It certainly was not a pleasure excursion.</p>
            <p>LaSalle and his party went around the southern end of Lake <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> to the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>. There he built a fort which he called the Miami.</p>
            <p>Then he went up the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> to the site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then over the portage to the Kankakee. The voyagers went down this sluggish stream
                    along boundless prairies, gliding along almost on a level with the banks. They looked like men
                    floating on the land.</p>
            <p>LaSalle's men became discouraged. Some of them tried to kill him, putting poison in his
                    food. Some of them deserted him, going off with the runners of the forests, <hi rend="i">courers de
                        bois.</hi> These were French adventurers who had abandoned civilized life and who wandered from
                    place to place through the woods, at times living with the Indians, marrying Indian squaws, and
                    living in Indian fashion, or as outlaws in the wilderness.</p>
            <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-021-4-009"/>
            <p>With a few trusted men LaSalle went on to the <geogName>Illinois River</geogName> and down that
                    stream to the point where Peoria now stands. Here he built another fort.</p>
            <p>Here let us leave LaSalle for a time while we tell about two of the men who were with him. One of
                    these was Tonty, the other was Father Louis Hennepin, a Franciscan priest.</p>
            <p>Tonty was a faithful friend and follower of LaSalle. He was a brave soldier, with only one hand. He
                    had lost the other hand in battle and he now wore an artificial hand of iron. For this reason he was
                    called "Tonty, of the iron hand." He was a strong man and he could hit very hard
                    with his iron hand. LaSalle depended very much upon Tonty.</p>
            <p>Father Louis Hennepin was born about 1640. In his youth he heard old sailors tell stories of their
                    travels. This increased his desire to visit distant countries. He was educated and became a priest.
                    He was glad when his superiors sent him to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> as a chaplain to join LaSalle on his expedition.</p>
            <p>Hennepin often went ahead of the party to explore. Once in the beginning of this long journey he went
                    as far as he could in his canoe up the <geogName>Niagara River</geogName>. He then climbed the steep
                    ascent and pushed through the forest on a tour of inspection. He saw the furious river at the rapids
                    raging below. Then in primeval solitude the great Niagara Falls burst upon his sight! Here before
                    his gaze was one of the wonders of the world.</p>
            <p>Was Hennepin the first white man who had ever seen those wonderful falls? We do not know. But we know
                    that the falls were new to him and that the sight impressed him beyond measure. His description of
                    Niagara Falls is the earliest known to exist. He said the Falls were 500 feet high. He was indeed
                    greatly impressed, as they are only 160 feet high. Hennepin was a great explorer, but sometimes,
                    like Caesar's scouts among the Helvetians and the Gauls, he reported for seen what he had
                    not seen. Both the explorer and the historian have much need of imagination, but sometimes they
                    allow their imaginations to run into riot and exaggeration. Perhaps Hennepin did this; some say he
                    deliberately falsified his story.</p>
            <p>While LaSalle and his party were stationed at the fort <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-021-4-010"/> near the
                    site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Peoria</settlement>
                    </placeName>, LaSalle sent Hennepin and two companions to explore the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. They went 600 miles up the great river. They killed buffalo and deer, and beavers and
                    wild turkeys, and now and then a bear swimming in the river. One day Hennepin was daubing his canoe
                    with pitch to keep it from leaking and the other men were cooking a turkey. Suddenly a fleet of
                    Indian canoes came into view carrying a war party of 120 naked savages. They were out on the
                    war-path to fight the Miamis. When they saw Hennepin and his men they raised a hideous war-whoop.
                    They pushed their canoes to land, leaped ashore and quickly surrounded the astonished Frenchmen.
                    They refused to smoke the pipe of peace and forced the explorers to row across the river, the
                    Indians following behind with yells and howls that almost froze the blood in a man's veins.</p>
            <p>When they came on shore the Indians were about to split open the heads of their prisoners with war
                    clubs. Hennepin rushed to his canoe, brought some presents and gave the chief a hatchet with which
                    to kill him. He then bowed his head in submission. This act took faith and courage, and it satisfied
                    the Indians that the Frenchmen would do them no harm; so they spared the lives of their prisoners.</p>
            <p>Then the Indians danced a medicine dance. Their bodies were painted from head to foot; their black,
                    straight hair was oiled and decorated with red and white feathers.</p>
            <p>These Indians were the Sioux or the Dakotah Indians. They compelled their prisoners to go with them
                    far up into <placeName>
                        <country reg="mnu">Minnesota</country>
                    </placeName>. After journeying nineteen days they came to the site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There they hid their canoes and started out on foot across the prairies to their
                    villages.</p>
            <p>These Dakotahs were tall Indians and they could walk much faster than the Europeans. It was in the
                    spring of the year, but in this northland there was frost at night. The marshes and ponds were
                    glazed with ice which cut Hennepin's legs as he waded through. They swam the larger rivers
                    and the cold current nearly froze Hennepin to death. As Hennepin was lagging behind, the Indians, in
                    order to spur him on, built a prairie fire in the dry grass behind him. Then taking him by the hand
                    they ran forward to escape the flames.</p>
            <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-021-4-011"/>
            <p>At times they were nearly starved. They were given only a small piece of smoked meat each day. When
                    they reached the Indian villages they saw stakes driven in the ground with bundles of straw tied to
                    them, and it seemed the Indians were preparing to burn their prisoners alive.</p>
            <p>Such were some of the hardships of these daring pioneers and explorers.</p>
            <p>Their lives were spared, but Hennepin and his two companions lived for eight months as prisoners
                    among the Sioux. Finally they were released.</p>
            <p>On the journey homeward Hennepin discovered the falls near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>
                    </placeName> to which he gave the name of St. Anthony. Hennepin went back to Montreal through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and Lake Huron. He returned to Europe and wrote an account of his journeys. He could
                    tell as much as any living man about Indian life and customs. He died in 1701.</p>
            <p>We left LaSalle near Peoria. There he left Tonty with most of the party while he started with five
                    men back to Niagara. He wanted to get more supplies and to learn what had become of the Griffen, of
                    which he had heard no word.</p>
            <p>This was one of the hardest journeys ever made by white men in America. Much of the way they had to
                    go on foot. The rain fell in floods. The men had to sleep on the wet ground and often had to go
                    without food. They had to watch by night and march by day. They carried heavy loads, blankets,
                    clothing, kettles, hatchets, guns, powder, lead, and skins for moccasins.</p>
            <p>At times they waded to their waists in swamps and creeks. They struggled through thorns and brambles
                    in the wilds of southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. Their clothes were drenched at night when they took them off and were frozen so stiff
                    in the morning that they could not put them on without building a fire to thaw them out.</p>
            <p>Finally LaSalle and his men came to the <geogName>Detroit River</geogName>, then to Lake Erie. There
                    they built a canoe which brought them to Niagara. They had come 2,000 miles over a course beset with
                    danger and obstruction.</p>
            <p>LaSalle went on to Montreal. There he obtained supplies and started back. He had not gone far before
                    two messengers <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-021-4-012"/> met him bearing a letter from Tonty. This letter
                    contained the discouraging news that nearly all the men at the Peoria fort had deserted, that they
                    had destroyed the fort and had stolen the stores of supplies.</p>
            <p>LaSalle, with his few men, went on back over the long journey to Peoria, hoping to find and rescue
                    Tonty. When he came to where the fort had been there was nothing but bleak desolation. Everything
                    was gone. Only the howling of the wolves filled the air.</p>
            <p>Was LaSalle downhearted? He certainly had enough to make him so. He had been betrayed and defeated
                    and had suffered enough trials and disappointments to discourage the stoutest heart. But LaSalle was
                    not dismayed. He bore up amid his difficulties, showing how great he was. He seemed to have a frame
                    of iron, and an unconquerable mind.</p>
            <p>He pushed on down the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. But with so small a force of men he could not go on down that river. He went back on a
                    long journey to Fort Miami on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>. There he learned that Tonty was at Mackinac. He went the whole length of Lake <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> to find him, and there he heard from Tonty's own lips the long tale of
                    disaster. "Any one else," said Tonty, "would have thrown up his hands and
                    abandoned the enterprise. But far from this! With a firmness and constancy that never had its equal,
                    I saw him more resolved than ever to continue his work and push forward his discovery."</p>
            <p>Dunn, the historian of Indiana, says of LaSalle: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>There was something almost touching the supernatural in the courage and resolution of
                            LaSalle. At that rude fort on the bank of the <placeName>
                                <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                            </placeName>, in the discomforts of a severe winter, hundreds of miles from the French
                            settlements, his faithful Tonty carried captive, killed, or a fugitive, he knew not which,
                            his remaining comrades disheartened, his colony swept from the face of the earth, his credit
                            shattered, his means dissipated by disasters of flood and field, LaSalle calmly
                            reconstructed his plans and prepared to renew his enterprise on a more extended basis.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>LaSalle had caught his first glimpse of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and he was determined to go on to reach its outlet. He and Tonty went back to Ft.
                    Frontenac, <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, for more supplies and then they were ready to begin all over again.</p>
            <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-021-4-013"/>
            <p>In the fall of 1681 the explorer was again on his way to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> country. There were twenty-three Frenchmen and eighteen Indians, and the Indians
                    insisted upon taking ten squaws and three children, making fifty-four in all. Some of these were a
                    burden, not a help.</p>
            <p>By the time they reached the lower end of Lake <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> it was the dead of winter and the streams were frozen over. They made sledges and
                    placed their canoes on them. This time they went up the "Checagou" River, as the
                    Indians called it. Over the portage they passed to the <geogName>Illinois River</geogName>. They
                    dragged their sleds over the frozen course of that river until they came to open water near Peoria.</p>
            <p>Then launching their canoes they rowed and floated down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. The ice was drifting down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, so they had to remain in camp a week till the great river was safe for their canoes.
                    Then they paddled and drifted downward past the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, by the place where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was afterwards built, and on down past the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Like Marquette and Joliet, they were astonished at the muddy water of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, which spoiled the clear water of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> so they could not drink it.</p>
            <p>Near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName> they built another fort. Then they went on down past Vicksburg to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and then on to the Gulf (April 6, 1682). Here they erected a pillar and sang a hymn of
                    the church. LaSalle had triumphed at last. After all his trials and tribulations he had discovered
                    the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>LaSalle took possession of the country under the name of <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                        </placeName>
                    </hi>, in honor of his King Louis XIV. He claimed for his king "all the nations, peoples,
                    provinces, cities, towns, villages, mines, minerals, fisheries, streams and rivers," from
                    the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to the sea, and on to the "River of Palms," or Rio Grande. You will
                    see that this was a very large claim.</p>
            <p>LaSalle was told by the Indians that they were the first Europeans that had ever gone up or down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. In this we know they were mistaken, as DeSoto, a Spaniard, discovered the river 140
                    years before, and Marquette and Joliet had gone down, but not so far as LaSalle.</p>
            <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-021-4-014"/>
            <p>LaSalle returned safely to Quebec. Then he went to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. A few years later he embarked on another expedition. He wished to fortify the mouth of
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, and this time he sought to find it by way of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
            <p>Unluckily his ships went too far to the west and his party landed on the coast of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>. From there they tried to reach the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> overland, but in vain. LaSalle and some of his strongest followers struck out northward
                    determined to reach the Great Lakes, where help might be found. They suffered hardships, their
                    provisions ran low, and they were in constant danger of attack from hostile Indians. His men
                    mutinied and on March 19, 1687, LaSalle was murdered by one of his own party. Here in the far
                    Southwest, lost on the plains, LaSalle died at the age of forty-four—the greatest
                    explorer of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, whom Tonty called "One of the greatest men of his age."</p>
            <p>LaSalle's dream never came true. It was a great dream for the glory of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. But when LaSalle died there were twenty times as many people in the English colonies
                    on the seaboard as there were in all New <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. The French had some forts and soldiers, and brave explorers and fur traders and
                    missionaries; but they had very few colonists and settlers. For this reason, the English overcame
                    the French in the struggle for the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>.</p>

            <p rend="center">A paper read at the meeting of the Southwestern Indiana Historical Society, May 27,
                    1925, at Newburg.</p>
            <p>It is a matter challenging the notice of the people of southwestern Indiana, and especially of those
                    of them who are descended from the pioneers of the early years of the nineteenth century, that, on
                    the part of the biographers of Abraham Lincoln, apparently very little effort has been made to
                    ascertain the degree that the development of his nature and character was influenced by his
                    environment, and associations, during the fourteen years that he spent as a boy and young man in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName> and the surrounding localities. The attitude seems to have been that Lincoln's
                    contacts and associations during this period were negligible, and the impression conveyed by some of
                    them is that the people of southwestern Indiana, at that day, were ignorant, uncouth and lawless.</p>
            <p>In view of this attitude, and of the impression which it engenders in the minds of the readers of
                    these productions, it behooves the good people of the locality in question, and those of them
                    especially who are the descendants of the pioneers, to take up arms in defense of the character and
                    qualities of those who have gone before them. Persistence in ignoring, and misrepresenting, the
                    people with whom the boy Lincoln came in contact in his early years, while he was growing from
                    childhood to man's estate in this region, and in conveying the impression that these people
                    were ignorant, uncouth and lawless, not only becomes tiresome, but demonstrates that those who have
                    assumed to portray the life of Lincoln, and to define the process by which he became the man he was,
                    have been wanting in industry, and have neglected one of the most promising fields of inquiry.</p>
            <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-021-4-016"/>
            <p>This condition of affairs has arisen, in part, from the circumstance that some of the early
                    biographers of Lincoln were residents of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and wrote from personal contact with the subject and from personal memory. There was
                    some excuse for the shortcomings of these, especially of those of them whose books are, more
                    properly speaking, in the nature of chronicles or reminiscences; but for those who have entered the
                    field later, and have essayed to write from inquiry and investigation, the excuse is not apparent.
                    They have not had the inspiration of personal acquaintance with the great emancipator, nor have they
                    set forth their individual recollections, but have undertaken to reach an estimate of the man, and
                    to set forth the process of his development, from historical sources. In their case, neglect of one
                    of the most promising fields for investigation is difficult to condone. It may be susceptible of
                    explanation upon the assumption that biographers, like sheep, follow the bell-wether. Their apparent
                    assumption that nothing commendable in the nature or character of Abraham Lincoln became a part of
                    him while he was growing up among the pioneers of southwestern Indiana, is little less than
                    criminal.</p>
            <p>The child, born a savage, becomes a creature of civilization by gradual process. He begins to gather
                    impressions in his earliest infancy, and continues to receive them throughout his life. It is out of
                    these impressions that his nature is formed. It may be that he inherits some mental and moral
                    tendencies from his ancestors, but these at most are mere tendencies; his nature is built, almost
                    entirely, from that which he derives from his surroundings and from his contact with those about him
                    as he grows up and matures. It is for this reason that one who seeks to ascertain the nature and
                    character of a matured man, and the processes by which these have been developed, must necessarily
                    begin his inquiries at the beginning, and must pursue them to the end. This means that the fourteen
                    years of the boyhood and adolescence of Abraham Lincoln, which he spent in southwestern Indiana, and
                    among its pioneer people, can not be neglected by any one who seeks to learn, and to portray, the
                    process of his building. There is probably no period of his eventful life which influenced more
                    largely his nature in manhood.</p>
            <pb n="291" id="VAA4025-021-4-017"/>
            <p>The pioneers of southwestern Indiana were not ignorant; they were not uncouth; they were not lawless.
                    That there were reprehensible people among them can not be denied, but very superficial
                    investigation into that which took place in early days will convince the inquirer that these were
                    the exceptions, not the rule, just as our modern bandits are the exceptions today. These
                    reprehensible people were at war with society, as similar people are at war with society now, and
                    they finally were overcome and dispersed by the lawabiding elements, who were in large majority; it
                    was the sound and useful citizens that survived to lay the foundation of the social life of the
                    great commonwealth of Indiana.</p>
            <p>The late Sampson Brass, in conversation with our inimitable friend, Dick Swiveller, is reported by
                    competent authority to have remarked, "It's a pleasant world we live in, sir, a
                    very pleasant world. There are bad people in it, Mr. Richard, but if there were no bad people, there
                    would be no good lawyers."</p>
            <p>There have been bad people, everywhere, throughout all of the generations of humanity. Cain lived at
                    a very early period. He was the son of Eve, and all of us recall, in sorrow and regret, the heedless
                    error on her part which so sorely has affected the lives of all that have come after her. Did the
                    transgressions of the mother have anything to do with making Cain a bad boy?</p>
            <p>Bad men and bad women in southwestern Indiana, during the first three decades of the nineteenth
                    century, contrived, as bad men and bad women do always, to excite attention and comment while they
                    lived, and to linger in tradition after they were dead, but they were not of the essence of the
                    population. One vicious man can excite more attention in an hour than a hundred quiet, law-abiding
                    citizens do in a lifetime; a large part of history is made up of the contacts of bad men and bad
                    women with the better elements of society. In truth, if there never had been any bad men and bad
                    women, there would be now very little readable history.</p>
            <p>The brave and earnest men and women, who sacrificed their comfort, and their lives, to build this
                    commonwealth, and to plant the seeds which have grown into the culture of its <pb n="292" id="VAA4025-021-4-018"/> society as it is today, in point of useful and practical information,
                    decency of demeanor, soundness of citizenship and disposition to right living, were much the same as
                    the commonalty of the better people of today.</p>
            <p>This is not mere surmise, it is truth, substantiated by history. The book is open and may be read of
                    all men, even those engaged in the writing of biographies of Abraham Lincoln. If this were not so, a
                    little exercise of common sense and reason would bring to any sound mind a realization of the
                    manifest truth that the many highly respectable families, which have been a credit to southwestern
                    Indiana for more than a hundred years, are not the offspring of cut-throats and vagabonds.</p>
            <p>For the present purpose, and to illustrate these suggestions, no effort shall be made to go beyond
                    the limits of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName>, since there is no doubt that that which may be said of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName> can be repeated, in truth, of any other county of southwestern Indiana.</p>
            <p>What were the limits of the neighborhood in which Abraham Lincoln lived for fourteen years in
                    Indiana? Neighborhood is a term of relative meaning, dependent upon local conditions. Was the
                    neighborhood of the boy, Lincoln, confined to a small, compact community, such as we regard as a
                    neighborhood today? Can we suppose for a moment that the people whom Lincoln knew, and with whom he
                    came in contact, as a boy, lived within a stone's throw of his father's cabin, or
                    within the confines of what is now a single township or county? Is it not more probable, indeed
                    practically certain, that he with his family, and his nearer neighbors, went long distances to
                    preachings, camp meetings, public gatherings, house raisings, log rollings and political

                    </placeName>, with a sheet of wool to be carded, remained at least one day and fell in love with a

                    awkward appearance. It was on this occasion that he saw the sign of Robert Stockwell, in gilt
                    letters, over the door of his store at the southwest corner of the public square, across the street
                    from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, where he and his family, and the family of Mr. Flower, resided for some nine months or
                    more. He became a citizen and a voter. At an election, held at <placeName>

                    the majority who cast their votes in the affirmative. Another voter at this election was Dr. Joel
                    Fraser Casey, whose granddaughter, at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and grandson, at Patoka, are residents of the county today. Dr. Casey sustained the
                    reputation of a gentleman and an upright citizen during his life, a reputation which has survived
                    him for more than fifty years.</p>

                            There prevails so much good sense and useful knowledge, joined to a genuine warmth of
                            friendly feeling, a disposition to promote the happiness of each other, that the man who is

            <p>There are many interesting passages in Birkbeck's <hi rend="i">Notes</hi>, which cast light,
                    not merely upon the progress of the new country, but upon the nature of its inhabitants as well.
                    Here is his description of the founding of a town: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>On any spot where a few settlers cluster together, attracted by an ancient neighborhood, or
                            by the goodness of the soil, or the vicinity to a mill or by whatever cause, some
                            enterprising proprietor finds in his section what he deems a good site for a town; he has it
                            surveyed and laid out in lots, which he sells, or offers for sale, by auction.</p>
                        <p>The new town then assumes the name of its founder:—a storekeeper builds a little
                            framed store, and sends for a few cases of goods; and then a tavern starts up, which becomes
                            the residence of a doctor and a lawyer, and the boarding-house of the store-keeper, as well
                            as the resort of the weary traveler: soon follow a blacksmith and other handicraftsmen in
                            useful succession; a schoolmaster, who is also the minister of religion, becomes an
                            important accession to the rising community. Thus the town proceeds, if it proceeds at all,
                            with accumulating force, until it becomes the metropolis of the neighborhood. Hundreds of
                            these speculations may have failed, but hundreds prosper; and thus trade begins and thrives
                            as population grows around those lucky spots; imports and exports maintaining their just
                            proportion. One year ago the neighborhood of this very town of Princetown was clad in
                            buckskin, now the men appear at church in good blue cloth, and the women in fine calicoes
                            and straw bonnets.</p>

                    same stock, with similar culture and like antecedents and instincts. If Mr. Birkbeck required
                    corroboration, it is to be found in the lives and qualities of the early <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-021-4-022"/> immigrants to <placeName>

                    their share to the establishment of the good order and society of the community. Let us pass some of
                    these in review.</p>
            <p>In November, 1800, David Robb and his young wife, Nancy, reached the present site of Hazelton. They
                    spent their first night in the stick and mud, floorless cabin of Daniel Hazelton, at the mouth of
                    what is known as Robb Creek. The Hazelton family remained prominent and respected in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName> from that time until this. In 1804, Governor William Henry Harrison issued to Gervase
                    Hazelton a license to maintain a ferry across <geogName>White River</geogName>, at the present site
                    of the town of Hazelton, and the family continued to operate the ferry for at least eighty years.</p>
            <p>David Robb established his home on lands south of Hazelton which are owned today by his descendants,
                    by direct inheritance from him. He reared a large family, prospered beyond the measure of most men
                    of his day, served several terms in the legislature and was an active member of the Constitutional
                    Convention of 1816. Those descending from him have occupied high social position in the county from
                    his day until the present time.</p>

                    the Milburns and the Heinmans came, and they remain today, as they were at first, respected and

            <p>James Smith came in 1808, was very prominent, much trusted, and highly respected for many years, and

                    numerous Wilkinsons and Stricklands had their origin in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1808 and they have been good citizens from generation to generation.</p>
            <p>The Armstrongs came in 1809 and they have been trustworthy and respected citizens to this day; the
                    same is true of one branch of the Evans family, and the Skelton family, who date back to 1810.</p>
            <p>Joshua Embree, with his wife and five children, came from Lincoln County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1811. He died a citizen of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1813. His will was the first will to be admitted to probate in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName>. His son, Elisha, self-educated and self-supporting from childhood, married Eleanor,
                    eldest daughter of David Robb, located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, practiced law successfully, reared a family, served his state in the legislature, and
                    for ten years as circuit judge, and represented his district in the popular branch of congress. Here
                    he became an associate and friend of Abraham Lincoln, of Horace Greeley, of Elihu B. Washburn and of
                    divers other men of national prominence. He had the distinction of declining nomination by the Whig
                    party for governor of Indiana. When he died, he was followed to his grave by the <pb n="298" id="VAA4025-021-4-024"/> children of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who marched in procession and strewed flowers upon his grave. His son commanded a
                    regiment in the great battles of <geogName>Stone River</geogName> and Chicamauga, and his
                    descendants still remain respected citizens of the county.</p>
            <p>In 1813, the Emerson and Kirkman families entered the county, where they have remained to this day,
                    respected and honored with the confidence of their fellow citizens. Upon the organization of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName> and the establishment of its county seat, William Prince moved with his family from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he served with honor as circuit judge. At his death in 1824, he was
                    representative of his district in congress. His daughter, Elizabeth, became the wife of Samuel Hall,
                    and their descendants are among the best people of the county today, as they have been for a
                    century. Samuel Hall was a circuit judge, and one time lieutenant governor of Indiana.</p>
            <p>The Brownlee family came in 1815, and were followed in 1816 by the Jeraulds and the Cockrums. These
                    three families for more than a hundred years have been prominent in the social, political and
                    business life of southwestern Indiana.</p>
            <p>In 1818, another branch of the Jerauld family and the Benson family became residents of the county;
                    they were high-class citizens from the beginning and have continued ever since to be of the first
                    rank. Sylvester Benson, born in the county about a century ago, lived more than eighty years,
                    enjoying the highest estimation, and a son of his sister has served with distinction for twelve
                    years as judge of one of the highest courts of the state.</p>
            <p>This is a rude catalog of more than thirty families who became identified with the county before 1819
                    and who have occupied positions of confidence and respect and have been of the highest social
                    influence from that time until this. The greater part of them have been numerous from generation to
                    generation, and there has not been a time for more than a hundred years that they have not had the
                    deserved respect and confidence of the community. The pioneers of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName> were, for the most part, deeply religious. In their day there was still faith in God,
                    and their lives were those of men and women of pious observances and simple faith.</p>
            <pb n="299" id="VAA4025-021-4-025"/>
            <p>The families here cataloged did not spring from vagabonds, and it is safe to assume that a similar
                    showing can be made by every county in southwestern Indiana.</p>
            <p>It was with people of this sort, engaged in honest and toilsome effort on behalf of their families
                    and their communities, and conducting themselves as honorable citizens, that Lincoln in his youth
                    came in contact; it was people such as these that impressed their nature upon the growing boy and
                    young man; it was neighbors such as these, who by their association and example implanted in him the
                    solid qualities that influenced his life to the end.</p>
            <p>The list is by no means complete. It stops at the end of 1818, and does not include all of the people
                    of the same sort who became a part of the population of the county of Gibson before that time. It is
                    sufficiently full, however, to indicate to anyone, who cares to know the truth, that the population
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName> was not constituted of ruffians and questionable characters. It supplies corroboration
                    of the testimony of Morris Birkbeck, and no doubt indicates the quality of the pioneer families of
                    the other counties of southwestern Indiana.</p>
            <p>Families such as these survived, and, in doing so, were the beginnings of the commonwealth; they
                    planted in it the seeds of its culture and social preeminence. Is there any reason to suppose that
                    their nature did not become a part of the young man Lincoln, who parted from them in 1830. If it did
                    not, Lincoln was the only boy of all time who lived in a community for fourteen years without being
                    influenced by it.</p>

            <p>Going back to the beginning of the last century, we find the vast region of country lying north and
                    west of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, now become the well cultivated and well ordered state,
                    an almost unbroken wilderness. In the depth of this wilderness dwelt several powerful tribes of
                    Indians. Exclusive of the savage tribes and nations occupying it, was a white population of 4,875,
                    of which a small portion in Clark's grant at the Falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> was of English descent; the other mostly of French extraction and residing at or near
                    Kaskaskia, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Along with men of other religious faiths there were Presbyterians among the first
                    Anglo-Saxon settlers in the country about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1783 Patrick Simpson came from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Glasgow</settlement>, <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
               </placeName>, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. About 1796 Daniel McClure, with several stalwart sons, settled near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and in the year 1800 several other Presbyterian families came and took up their
                    residence in the community. It is altogether probable that Samuel Thornton Scott, who afterward
                    became the first resident Presbyterian minister in Indiana, in the year 1802, taught a school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and, having the ministry in view, held religious services in the country on the
                    Sabbath. Some of the earliest settlers have left written testimony to this effect and that after
                    this Scott returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and studied for the ministry. At the spring meeting of the Transylvania Presbytery in
                    1803, the Reverend Alexander Cameron and the Reverend James Vance were appointed to preach in the
                    settlements in the <placeName>

                    Presbyterial authority for Indiana Territory. But at the fall meeting these brethren gave reasons
                    for not fulfilling the mission to which they were appointed, which reasons, say the records of
                    Presbytery, were sustained.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1804, a communication was received by Transylvania Presbytery from Post <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> asking for supplies to be sent them,—that is, supplies of the Bread of Life
                    through the ministry of the word. Supplies were also asked, through the Reverend James Vance, for
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> grant. Mr. Vance was appointed, and doubtless filled his appointment. But no supply was
                    appointed for Post <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At the spring meeting of the same Presbytery, in 1805, a petition from a number of the
                    inhabitants of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana Territory, praying for supplies, was presented and read. This implies that at
                    this time there were a number of Presbyterians in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName>, and that they were anxious to have preaching. The Reverend Thomas Cleland was
                    appointed to supply in Indiana Territory as much of the time as he could, with convenience to
                    himself. From a memoir of Dr. Cleland published in 1859, we have a record in his own words of the
                    fulfillment of this Presbyterial appointment. He says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In the Spring of 1805 I was directed to visit <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                            </placeName> and the adjoining regions. It was an uninhabited route I had to go; a small
                            wilderness trace with only one residence on the way, in the most destitute part of the way,
                            to entertain me during the night. There was my poor animal tied to a tree, fed with the
                            grain packed in a wallet at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                            </placeName>, and myself stretched on a puncheon floor of a small cabin for the
                            night's rest. All passed off, however, without any detriment or discomfort. The
                            next evening made up for all previous privations. I was welcomed and entertained at the
                            Governor's palace during my stay in <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                            </placeName>. The late William Henry Harrison [continues Dr. Cleland, writing a few years
                            after the death of President Harrison], then a young man with a Presbyterian wife, was
                            Governor of Indiana Territory as it was then. He had recently held a treaty with a certain
                            tribe of Indians assembled at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                        <p>The first sermon ever preached in the place, at least by a Presbyterian minister, was in the
                            Council House but a short time before occupied by the sons of the forest. I preached also in
                            a settlement twenty milss up the <placeName>

            <p>The next year after Mr. Cleland's visit in 1806, the Indiana church was organized near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and embracing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This organization was effected by Samuel B. Robertson, pastor of New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Cave Run churches in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. In this same year, 1806, the General Assembly appointed Samuel T. Scott a missionary
                    for three months in Indiana Territory and especially at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Whether Scott performed this service and the organization of the church under the hand
                    of Robertson was the result, or whether he was unable to go and Robertson went in his stead, at
                    least for a shorter time, and while so ministering organized the church, is not known. But there is
                    no doubt about the organization of the church in this year and by Mr. Robertson. The organization
                    occurred in a barn of Colonel Small, about two miles and a half east and north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In 1807 Scott was again appointed by the General Assembly to the same missionary work to which he had
                    been appointed the year before, and record is made by the Presbytery of West <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>

            <p>The General Assembly, from time to time, commissioned men as missionaries to labor in Indiana. In
                    1809, James H. Dickey was commissioned to labor four months in Indiana Territory. In 1811 Mr. Dickey
                    was again commissioned to labor three months between the <geogName>Scioto</geogName> and
                        <geogName>Wabash</geogName> Rivers, at discretion. He probably reached no settlements in Indiana
                    that year, as there were no settlements at that time on the upper <placeName>

                    of Tecumseh and his brother, the Shawnee prophet, to the sale of lands by the Indians to Governor

                    the year preceding, 1811, Mr. Wallace had been commissioned to preach for one month on missionary
                    ground in Miami Presbytery. This Presbytery included the eastern part of Indiana. Its western
                    boundary was a line running north from the mouth of the <geogName>Kentucky River</geogName>. Stephen
                    Bovelle was also commissioned the same year to labor for three months in Western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and in Indiana. James McGready was also commissioned the same year to preach for a
                    period of three months in Indiana. In 1812 these same appointments of these three men, Wallace,
                    Bovelle, and McGready, were renewed by the Assembly.</p>
            <p>In the year 1812 the church of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName> was organized and the members of the Palmyra church were united with it. Because of
                    this merging of the Palmyra church with that of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>

                    although it ought more properly to be regarded as the third.</p>
            <p>In 1813 the only missionary appointed by the Assembly for Indiana was William Robinson, who was
                    commissioned to labor for one month in the Whitewater settlement.</p>
            <p>Doubtless the war with Great Britain which began in June, 1812, and continued until the beginning of
                    the year 1815, interfered seriously with the prosecution of mission work. The Indians were the
                    allies of Great Britain and in 1813, to preserve the settlements in Indiana from attacks by the
                    Indians, there was a good deal of active military service along a line from the northern part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName> to Fort Harrison on the <placeName>

            <p>In 1814 the General Assembly again commissioned William Robinson to labor for one month in the
                    Whitewater settlement. The Reverend Joseph Anderson was also commissioned to labor for four months,
                    at discretion, in the State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

            <p>In December, 1814, the Reverend William Robinson came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and took up his abode there, the second resident Presbyterian minister in Indiana. But
                    there was no church at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> or nearer to it than <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a captain of rangers and had been in active service with his company until it was
                    mustered out of service in the spring of 1814, on his return from his military service, desiring to
                    unite with the church and make a public profession of his faith in Christ as the captain of his
                    salvation, and there being no church nearer than <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, twenty-five miles from his home, he went there and was received into the church.</p>
            <p>Mr. Robinson, who had taken up his residence in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, taught a school there and late in 1815 organized the Presbyterian church of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> with fifteen or twenty members. But previous to the coming of Mr. Robinson into Indiana
                    another Presbyterian church had been organized in the summer of 1814, at the Forks of
                        <geogName>White River</geogName>, by the Reverend S. T. Scott of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with seventeen members. Several years afterwards when <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess County</region>
                    </placeName> was organized and Washington was laid out and made the county seat, this became the
                    Washington church. In December, 1814, John M. Dickey, who had been licensed by his Presbytery August
                    29th of the same year, visited this church in the Forks of <geogName>White River</geogName>, spent a
                    few Sabbaths with them, and agreed to return in the spring and labor among them as their minister
                    one-half of the time, they promising him a salary of eighty dollars for this portion of his labors.
                    Mr. Dickey came with his family to this church in May, 1815.</p>
            <p>In 1815, upon petition of the Synod of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, which had been constituted in 1814, the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> was made the
                    boundary between the Synods of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. This placed all the churches of Indiana nominally in Miami. But in 1817, upon petition
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Presbytery, which had been organized out of Transylvania Presbytery in 1815, so much of

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. By this action of the General Assembly the larger part of the churches of Indiana came
                    within the limits of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

            <pb n="306" id="VAA4025-021-4-032"/>
            <p>About this time the restoration of peace with Great Britain and with the various Indian tribes
                    brought a great increase of population to the Territory and the legislature initiated measures to
                    secure the admission to which it was entitled by the ordinance of 1787 upon reaching a population of
                    60,000. By the official returns of the census ordered by the legislature, the population reported to
                    the legislature at its session, which began December 4, 1815, was 63,897.</p>
            <p>In May, 1815, the Reverend James McGready was commissioned by the General Assembly as a missionary
                    for three months in the Indiana Territory in the counties of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark</region>

                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName>. A portion of his labors seems to have been performed in the early part of 1816, for in
                    1816 several churches are reported as having been organized by McGready in this region. On the 6th
                    of February he organized the church of <geogName>Blue River</geogName> in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington County</region>
                    </placeName>, with seven members. At <placeName>

                    </placeName> on the 16th of February he organized the Union church of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with seventeen members, Thomas Posey, the Governor of the Territory, and Joel Scribner
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> being made elders. On the 27th of the same month, February, 1816, Mr. McGready
                    organized the Pisgah church in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName>, with fifteen members. In the Assembly of 1816 the commission of McGready as a
                    missionary for the same length of time and in the same counties of Indiana was renewed. During this
                    same year he organized the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>

                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName>. But the missionaries appointed by the General Assembly were not the only Presbyterian
                    ministers who labored in missionary work in Indiana. The Reverend Samuel Shannon organized the
                    church of Livonia in February, 1816, with thirteen members. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> church was also organized by Shannon in 1816. The number of members at its organization
                    is not known, but in August, 1817, the number was twenty-seven. In 1816 the Reverend Nathan B.
                    Derrow, who had been sent into Indiana by the <placeName>

               </placeName>, to take
                    charge of the little church there and to preach the gospel in the adjacent regions. But in a few
                    months death removed him from the scenes of his earthly labors. In October, 1817, the Reverend John
                    Todd took up his abode in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName> as minister to the church there, nine years after his first temporary residence in the

            <p>In 1815, after the Indian troubles were over and the Territory had become a State, three-fourths of
                    the State was in possession of the Indians. As late as 1818 the maps of the State represented the
                    Indian boundary as starting from a point in the northern part of Jackson County and running
                    northeast to the <placeName>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, succeeded in purchasing from the Indians all of the lands south of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, except a few reservations. On account of this purchase and the new lands that were
                    thrown open to settlement, increasing streams of immigration flowed in upon the State, and in 1820
                    the population had increased to 147,178, considerably more than double what it was four years
                    before, when Indiana was admitted as a State into the Union.</p>
            <p>In 1818 the Reverend W. W. Martin of West <placeName>

            <p>In 1818 and 1819 the Reverend Orin Fowle spent a year in the State under the direction of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Missionary Society. The church of Jefferson, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                    </placeName>, was organized by him, October 25, 1818, with 20 members. In October, 1818, the
                    Reverend Isaac Reed located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> as the supply of the church for one year. In this year a house of worship was built, a
                    Sabbath School Society formed, and a Sabbath School of sixty scholars was gathered and instructed.
                    This, says Mr. Reed, was the first Sabbath School organized in the State. The church numbered 35
                    members by the end of the year. After the close of his year's labor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Reed returned to <placeName>

            <p>In April, 1819, Mr. Dickey, of Washington, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess County</region>
                    </placeName>, received a call to Pisgah and New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> churches. He says that when he visited the church of the Forks of the <geogName>White
                        River</geogName> in 1814, he found many of the members unsettled. They had come into the region
                    about the beginning of the war and were fenced in by the Indians. When the war closed, the Indian
                    fence gave way, and the members moved into the regions beyond, seeking lands that would suit them
                    better. Because the church was thus weakened and there were no immediately adjacent fields for labor
                    and no provision for the necessary support, he removed to Pisgah. He was installed over the Pisgah
                    and New <placeName>

            <p>John, James and Samuel McCormick built the first house in what is now the capital of Indiana,
                    settling here in 1820.</p>
            <p>The McCormicks are of Scottish extraction; the ancestors of this branch moved from <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName> to the north of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>, whence the early ancestors in America emigrated. They crossed the ocean about 1700 and
                    settled first in Pennsylvania, then moved to near Winchester, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. When the trouble which culminated in the Revolution began they sympathized with the
                    colonial cause and John, Sr., enlisted three times—two times from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and once from Pennsylvania, being in service from 1775 to 1783.</p>
            <p>John, Sr., was born August 13, 1754, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, and on March 24, 1785, married Catharine Drennan, who was born January 25, 1769. They
                    had eight sons and six daughters. The family moved from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Butler County</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and in 1808 settled near the present site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, where they built the first cabin in the settlement. The Indian fort was still
                    there and occupied.</p>
            <p>John McCormick, Sr., was a man of fine character, highly regarded for his ability and intelligence,
                    and took an active part in the organization of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette County</region>
                    </placeName>. The first grand jury met in his house. He died April 18, 1837; his wife survived him
                    many years, having reached the age of ninety-three when she died February 22, 1862. She received a
                    pension as a widow of a Revolutionary soldier until her death.</p>
            <p>James, son of John and Catharine, was born in 1797 in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>, <region type="county">Butler County</region>
               </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and was only a boy when his parents came to Indiana. While still young he learned the
                    trade of millwright, which he followed all his life; many of the old-fashioned water mills in
                    central Indiana were of his construction.</p>
            <pb n="312" id="VAA4025-021-4-038"/>
            <p>His brother John, born September 25, 1791, moved with his family to the paternal home near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> after the War of 1812, in which he served. There he remained until after the treaty of
                    St. Mary's in 1818, when he decided to remove to the "New Purchase," the
                    tract of land in central Indiana secured by that treaty. Samuel, James, and John and his family
                    started for the new location February 18, 1820, accompanied by twelve employees, who helped to cut
                    the road. Even though the distance was but sixty miles, the journey by sleds took eight days, the
                    party reaching the banks of <geogName>White River</geogName> February 26, 1820. They camped on a
                    spot near where the old National Road bridge was afterward erected, and the double log cabin which
                    was to become historic as the first white man's dwelling in what is now the capital of
                    Indiana was commenced at once. It was located on <geogName>White River</geogName>, on the narrow
                    wedge-shaped piece of ground lying between what is now West Washington Street and the National Road,
                    and stood between the two bridges which later were built across the river at the base of the wedge,
                    being just north of the east end of Washington Street bridge.</p>
            <p>The log house was typical of the times. It contained two rooms, each eighteen feet square and
                    separated by a passage eight or ten feet wide. The outside was often decorated with coon, bear and
                    frequently deer skins stretched out to dry. John McCormick located on the east bank because the
                    stream could not be forded. The abundance of fish was an advantage not to be overlooked in the days
                    when an immediate food supply was a question of greater importance than it is now.</p>
            <p>James and Samuel helped John to erect the cabin, after which they returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Part of James' family had made the journey and he came back with his wife and
                    the rest of his household in March. Samuel removed here in the fall.</p>
            <p>The Indians were still in the neighborhood at that time and the nearest white settlers were on the
                    bluffs of the river near what is now Waverly. On June 7, 1820, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was chosen for the seat of government and the members of the delegation were
                    entertained at the McCormick cabin.</p>
            <p>James and John lived here for two years and then moved <pb n="313" id="VAA4025-021-4-039"/> about
                    four miles up the river on the southern edge of Washington township. They bought government land,
                    built on the east bank, almost directly west of the Woodstock Country Club. There John built the
                    first sawmill in the county.</p>
            <p>The brothers continued to live together and to operate the mill until James moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1824, after which John ran it until his death in 1825. He had married in
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, in 1811, Bethiah Case, and they had a family of eight children,
                    their twin daughters Sabitha and Lavina celebrating their fourth birthday the day after the family
                    arrived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After her husband's death Bethiah married a Mr. King, by whom she had four
                    children. She survived him and continued to live near the Bluffs until the close of the Civil War,
                    when she moved to Arcadia to live with her twin daughters until her death in 1879. The twin
                    daughters married twin brothers.</p>
            <p>At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> James married Patsy Martha Perkins, a native of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> and daughter of John Perkins, who was also born in that state. John Perkins and his
                    wife were both of German descent. They were pioneers in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush County</region>
                    </placeName>, where Mr. Perkins engaged in farming, kept a dry goods and grocery store and also
                    bought stock. He and his wife died in that county.</p>
            <p>Eight sons and six daughters were born to James and Patsy McCormick. The mother died in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1880 at the age of 77. She was a Methodist, while James was a Baptist. He was one of
                    the first three commissioners of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>One history gives Patsy Perkins as being the daughter of Jacob Perkins and his wife, Elizabeth
                    Sailors. They had twenty-one children and eighteen lived beyond infancy. Jacob Perkins died in 1837.</p>
            <p>James McCormick went back to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1824; in 1826 he moved to <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Marion</region>, <region type="county">Shelby County</region>
               </placeName>, then returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1832. His home was on the ground now included in <geogName>Crown Hill</geogName>
                    Cemetery, which he had bought the previous year. There he built a house in which he lived for three
                    years when he moved to Millersville to build a mill for Noah Leveston, on the site of the present
                    mill at that point. <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-021-4-040"/> He stayed there one season and in the
                    spring of 1836 moved to a farm which is now a part of Riverside park and traversed by the Big Four
                    railway. In 1838 he bought the old mill site where his brother John had built a mill, putting up one
                    which he conducted for several years. In 1853 he moved to Hendricks County, near Cartersburg, where
                    he bought land and built the mill which he was operating at the time of his death, October 6,
                1858.</p>

            <p>The "consolidation" or removal of Indian tribes from their homes to reservations

                    </placeName> Commissioner, Abel C. Pepper, in securing cessions of former reservations,
                    1834–1837, paved the way for the removal of the Potawatomis. The band, whose removal is
                    described in the document printed herewith, lived in and near the village of Menominee, near Twin
                    Lakes, in <placeName>

            <p>The first emigration of Potawatomis from Indiana was directed by Abel C. Pepper in 1837; the Indians

                        <p>A party of forty-two Indians were brought into camp, and the business of the

                        <p>Tuesday, 4th Sept.</p>
                        <p>Left Encampment at Twin Lakes at half past 9 o'clk A. M. leaving behind on
                                    account of sickness of the chief San-ga-na, with his family consisting of thirteen
                                    persons, three of whom are very sick, and proceeded on our march. Messrs. Wheeler
                                    &amp; Hopkins agree to furnish provisions during the sickness of the family, and
                                    until such time as San-ga-na may be able to report himself at the agency at <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, preparatory to his emigration west. The day was exceedingly sultry,
                                    and the roads choked up with dust. Travelling was attended with much distress on
                                    account of the scarcity of water. Reached Chippeway at sunset having travelled a
                                    distance of twenty-one miles—five miles further than it was the intention
                                    of the Conductor to have gone, but for the want of water. The number of horses
                                    belonging to the Indians is estimated at two hundred and eighty-six—the
                                    number of wagons engaged in the transportation twenty-six. Provisions and forage
                                    rather scarce and not of the best quality.</p>
                        <p>Wednesday, 5th Sept.</p>
                        <p>Fifty-one persons were found to be unable to continue the journey, the means of
                                    transportation not being at hand—they were therefore left, the most of
                                    them sick, the remainder to wait upon them. Proceeded on our route, and reached at
                                    half past 12, at noon, the point determined upon as the location of our second
                                    encampment, a distance of nine miles from the encampment of the-day before. The
                                    scarcity of water in the country again retarded the progress of the
                                    emigration—the distance being either too great or too short between the
                                    watering places. A child died on the evening of this day, and was buried on the
                                    morning of the 7t. A child was also born during our encampment. A party of three
                                    Indians joined us today shortly after coming into camp. Subsistence generally
                                    consisting of beef and flour, and that very difficult to ac-<pb n="318" id="VAA4025-021-4-044"/>quire—having in most cases to transport it

                        <p>Left the Encampment at Una Creek at 9 in the morning, and travelled encountering
                                    fewer difficulties on our route, than on either of the previous days, to the
                                    encampment settled upon in the immediate vicinity of <placeName>

                                    seventeen miles. During the Evening of our arrival, nine of those left at Chippeway
                                    came up.</p>
                        <p>Friday, 7th Sept.</p>
                        <p>Two wagons with the thirteen persons left at Chippeway arrived in camp today.

                                    eighteen persons, came into camp today. A child died this morning.</p>

                        <p>A child three years old died and was buried—The chief We-wiss-sa came in
                                    with his family consisting of six persons, to join the
                                    emigration,—himself sick. Two wagons that had been sent to Chippeway
                                    returned bringing with them twenty-two persons, the whole of the number of those
                                    left behind, save the few who had effected their escape, and nine others who wished
                                    to remain until they are better able to travel. C. Martin has agreed to furnish them
                                    while sick at that place.</p>
                        <p>Sunday, 9th Sept.</p>
                        <p>Physicians came into camp today, and reported three hundred casas of sickness,
                                    generally of a temporary character, and which they are of opinion, may be removed by
                                    a two-day course of medicine. A kind of Medical hospital has been erected to-day,
                                    which is likely to facilitate the course of medical regime proposed by the
                                    physicians. A child died to-day. The priest formerly attached to the Catholics among
                                    the Pottawattamies, asked and obtained leave to say mass to-day and perform the
                                    ceremonies of his church in camp. The rites are now being performed. This Evening
                                    Sidney Williams and Wm. T. Polke, who had been dispatched in pursuit of the Indians,
                                    who escaped from Chippeway, returned, having reconnoitred the villages and
                                    cornfields on the Reserve without receiving any intelligence of the fugitives. They
                                    brought into camp three Indian horses which they had found on the road. A child died
                                    since dark.</p>

                                    twenty-one. The day was hot—we had the advantage [how] ever, of being in
                                    the vicinity of water, our route lying on the northern bank of the <placeName>

                                    </placeName> the whole distance. We reached our encampment at Winnemac's
                                    old village, at about 5 o'clk. a distance of perhaps ten miles from the
                                    camp at Logan. Provisions of the same character of those of yesterday and the day
                                    previous. Bacon is not to be had—beef and flour constitutes generally our
                                    provisions. A child died since we came into camp. A man also died tonight after
                                    several day's sickness.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday, 11th Sept.</p>
                        <p>Left Winnemac Encampment at 10 A. M. and journeyed westward. Our route lay through an
                                    open, champaign, country, which circumstance rendered the travelling more pleasant
                                    than that of any previous day. The sick along with us appear to be recruiting and
                                    everything bids fair for a comfortable and prosperous emigration. If we may be
                                    allowed to judge from the gayety of our encampments—the bright smiles
                                    that gild the sunny faces of our unhappy wards, and the contentment which seems to
                                    mark the sufferance of imposed restrictions, we may safely calculate upon the
                                    pleasantest and happiest of the emigrations west. We reached our present encampment
                                    (Pleasant Run) at 5 o'clk.—having accomplished a distance of
                                    seventeen miles. Provisions beef and flour, bacon difficult to be procured. A source
                                    of considerable expense is the foraging of Indian horses. We generally, however,
                                    manage to pasture them during our encampment, as cheaply as possible.</p>
                        <p>Wednesday, 12th Sept.</p>
                        <p>At half past 8 o'clk. we struck our tents and started on the march. At 11 we
                                    reached and forded the <geogName>Tippecanoe river</geogName>. A little after 12 we
                                    passed the Battle Ground and at 1 arrived at our present encampment (Battle Ground)
                                    Distance from the Encampment of yesterday fifteen miles. Immediately after our
                                    arrival the Indians were collected, and Dry Goods consisting of Cloths, Blankets,
                                    Calicoes, etc., to the amount of $5469 81 were distributed among them.
                                    Nothing of importance occurred during the remainder of the day. The Indians appeared
                                    to be well satisfied with the distribution of the Goods. A very old
                                    woman—the mother of the chief We-wiss-sa—said to be upwards of
                                    an hundred years old, died since coming into camp.</p>

                        <p>We commenced our journey this morning about 9 o'clock, and after traveling
                                    until 4 this afternoon, reached the encampment near <placeName>

                                    exception of the sultry heat of noon-day and the excessive dust of the roads, our
                                    marches are very pleasant. This Evening two neighboring physicians, Drs. Ritchie

                                    journey—passing over a dry and seemingly unhealthy portion of the
                                    country. Our party continues to mend in health. Occasionally however, and indeed not
                                    unfrequently, persons thro' weariness and fatigue take sick along the
                                    route. This occupies much of our time. We place them in the wagons which are every
                                    day becoming more crowded and proceed. Reached our camp ground near <placeName>

                                    </placeName> at 4 P. M. As we advance farther into the country of the prairies water
                                    becomes more scarce—the streams are literally dried up, and we have
                                    reason to fear that unless soon refreshed with rain, our future marches will be
                                    attended with much pain, and suffering. To-day we made 18 miles. Two deaths took
                                    place this evening.</p>

                        <p>Early on this morning we were on our way, and travelled without interruption until 12
                                    o'clk. M. when we arrived at an unhealthy and filthy looking stream, at
                                    which, from the reports of the citizens of the country, we were forced to encamp.
                                    The young men among the Indians during the afternoon, to the number of twenty-five,
                                    were permitted to go on a hunting excursion—a permission which they have
                                    for some time seemed to covet. We travelled to-day about 10 miles. Two small
                                    children died along the road.</p>
                        <p>Sunday, 16th Sept.</p>
                        <p>At 8 o'clock we were loaded and in our saddles. Seven persons were left sick
                                    in camp, among the number a woman who was about to be confined. A few minutes travel
                                    brought us to the Grand <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, a portion of which we passed over, arriving at our present Encampment
                                    at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, Ill., at about 3 o'clk. P. M. The heat along with the dust is
                                    daily rendering our marches more distressing. The horses are jaded the Indians
                                    sickly and many of the persons engaged in the emigration more or less sick. The
                                    whole country through which we pass appears to be afflicted—every town,
                                    village, and hamlet has its invalids. We travelled to-day fifteen miles, passing the
                                    dividing line between the two states at about 11½ o'clock. We
                                    find provisions and forage, the further we advance, demanding most enormous prices.
                                    It is worthy of remark, perhaps, that such a season for sickness in this country is
                                    almost unparalleled. In the little town, adjoining which we are now encamped,
                                    containing a population of from eight hundred to a thousand four persons died
                                    yesterday.</p>

                        <p>Monday, 17th Sept.</p>
                        <p>Left the Encampment at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> at 9 in the morning, and proceeded to Sandusky's
                                    point—a distance of six miles, where we encamped for the remainder of the
                                    day and night. Soon after our arrival in camp, Joseph Mouland who was left as
                                    Interpreter for the sick remaining at the camp of Saturday last, came up with his
                                    part, it having received an accession by the birth of a child. Provisions and forage
                                    we find scarce. Subsistance generally beef and flour. A young child died directly
                                    after coming into camp.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday, 18th Sept.</p>
                        <p>The accumulation of business, together with the discharge of a number of troops in
                                    service, rendered it necessary that we should remain in camp a day or
                                    so—beside which the weak condition of many of the emigrants demanded
                                    rest. During the evening a woman and a child died. A child was also born today. The
                                    health of the emigrants continues very bad. Scarcely a day but new cases are
                                    reported. In the main however, a daily improvement may be calculated upon. Dr.
                                    Jerolaman, the physician to the emigration arrived in camp to-day, and commenced the
                                    discharge of his dut[ies]. He is assisted for the time by Dr. James H. Buell of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Williamsport</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, Ia. whose services were enlisted during the absence of Dr. Jerolaman.
                                    In their report of to-day they say, "there are at this time sixty-seven
                                    sick—of that number there are forty-seven cases of intermittent
                                    fever—thirteen of continued and three of diarrhoea, and two of scrofula.
                                    Of the whole number eight may be considered dangerously ill. Provisions and forage
                                    still continue to be scarce.</p>
                        <p>Wednesday, 19th Sept.</p>
                        <p>The business for which we remained yesterday in camp, is but half concluded. The sick
                                    require active treatment such as they cannot receive whilst on the march. We remain
                                    to-day. To-morrow morning most of the volunteers will be discharged, when we expect
                                    to proceed on our way. The report of the physicians varies but little from that of
                                    yesterday. They report six or eight cases as very dangerous. A child of six or eight
                                    years old died this Evening. Also late at night an adult person.</p>
                        <p>Thursday, 20th Sept.</p>
                        <p>At 3 o'clock we were up and busily preparing the discharge of the
                                    volunteers. At sun rise they were mustered and marched to Head Quarters, where,
                                    after being addressed for a few moments by the General in command, they were
                                    discharged and paid off. Sixteen of the mounted volunteers, upon a requisition of
                                    the Conductor of the emigration were retained in service and are now under the
                                    immediate charge of Ensign Smith. At 9 o'clk. a few hours before which an
                                    elderly woman died, we prepared for our march. We left the camp at half past 9, and
                                    reached our present encampment at <pb n="322" id="VAA4025-021-4-048"/> about 2 P. M.
                                    During the march of the party, Gen. <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                                    </placeName> who has heretofore been in command of the volunteers, and superintended
                                    the removal of the present emigration, took his leave, and left us in charge of the
                                    Conductor, Wm. Polke, Esq. While on the march a child died on horseback. A death has
                                    also occurred since we came into camp this Evening. We are now encamped at
                                    Davis's Point, a distance of ten miles from the camp ground of yesterday.
                                    To-morrow we expect to reach Sidney, which is reported to be a good watering place.</p>
                        <p>Friday, 21st Sept.</p>
                        <p>Left Davis's encampment at half-past 9. At a little before 2 we reached
                                    Sidney, near the spot selected for encampment. The health of the Indians is the
                                    same—scarcely a change—the worst of the cases in most persons
                                    proves fatal. Physician reports for yesterday, "their condition somewhat
                                    better. There are yet fifty sick in camp—three have died since my
                                    last." The farther we get into the prairie the scarcer becomes water. Our
                                    present encampment is very poorly watered, and we are yet in the vicinity of timber.
                                    A child died since we came into camp. This morning before we left the Encampment of
                                    last night, a chief, Muk-Kose, a man remarkable for his honesty and integrity, died
                                    after a few days' sickness. Distance travelled to-day 12 miles. Forage not
                                    so scarce as a few days ago. Bacon we occasionally procure—beef and
                                    flour, however, constitute our principal subsistence.</p>
                        <p>Saturday, 22nd Sept.</p>
                        <p>At 8 o'clock we left our Encampment, and entered the prairie at Sidney. The
                                    day was exceedingly cold.—The night previous had brought us quite a heavy
                                    rain, and the morning came in cold and blustry. Our journey was immediately across
                                    the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, which at this point is entirely divested of timber for sixteen miles.
                                    The emigrants suffered a good deal, but still appeared to be cheerful. The health of
                                    the camp continues to improve—not a death has occurred to-day, and the
                                    cool bracing weather will go far towards recruiting the health of the invalids. A
                                    wagoner was discharged to-day for drunkenness. Dissipation is almost entirely
                                    unknown in the camp. To-night, however, two Indians were found to have possessed
                                    themselves of liquor, and become intoxicated. They were arrested and put under
                                    guard. Some six or eight persons were left at Davis's Point this morning,
                                    for want of the means of transportation. They came in this evening. We are at
                                    present encamped at Sidoris'a Grove, sixteen miles distant from Sidney.
                                    Water quite scarce.</p>
                        <p>Sunday, 23rd Sept.</p>
                        <p>Left our encampment at 9 o'clk. having been detained for an hour at the
                                    request of the Rev. W. Petit, who desired to perform service. The day was clear and
                                    cold. Our way lay across another portion of Grand <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, which, as was the case yesterday, we <pb n="323" id="VAA4025-021-4-049"/> found without timber for fifteen miles. Physician
                                    reports the health of the camp still improving. "The number of
                                    sick" the report says "is forty. There have been two deaths since
                                    my last report, and four or five may be considered immediately dangerous."
                                    A child died early this morning. One also died on the way to our present Encampment.
                                    Distance travelled to-day fifteen miles. We are at present, encamped on the Sangamon
                                    river, along the banks of which our route to-morrow lies. Subsistence, beef and
                                    flour—better, however, than usual.</p>
                        <p>Monday, 24th Sept.</p>
                        <p>At 9 this morning we left Pyatt's Point (the encampment of yesterday) and
                                    proceeded down the <geogName>Sangamon river</geogName> fifteen miles, to the place
                                    of our present Encampment, Sangamon Crossing. Physician reports "there have
                                    been two deaths since my last, and the situation of several of the sick is much
                                    worse. I would recommend that twenty-nine be left until to-morrow." At the
                                    suggestion of Dr. Jerolaman twenty-nine persons were accordingly left behind with
                                    efficient nurses. They will join us to-morrow. We find a good deal of difficulty in
                                    procuring wagons for transportation—so many of the emigrants are ill that
                                    the teams now employed are constantly complaining of the great burthens imposed upon
                                    them in the transportation of so many sick. Subsistence and forage the same as
                                    yesterday. A child died during the evening.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday, 25th Sept.</p>
                        <p>To allow the sick left at Pyatt's Point yesterday time to join us, and to
                                    give the emigrants generally a respite, and to bring up the business of the
                                    emigration, it was determined to remain in camp to-day. The baggage wagons were
                                    weighed and reloaded during the day and the matters of the emigrants made more
                                    comfortable. Sometime in the afternoon the sick left at the encampment of yesterday
                                    arrived. Directly after their arrival a woman among the number, died. The rest were
                                    but little if any improved. A child also died this evening. The farther we advance
                                    the more sickly seems the character of the country. It is sometimes very difficult
                                    to procure provisions and forage owing to the general prostration of the husbandry.
                                    &amp; Most of the Indian men were permitted to go on a hunting excursion to-day.
                                    They brought in a considerable quantity of game.</p>
                        <p>Wednesday, 26th Sept.</p>
                        <p>Left our Encampment at the Crossing at 8 o'clock in the morning and
                                    proceeded on our route. The sick appear somewhat recruited. Owing to the
                                    indisposition of our physician no report has been made since Monday. We have reason
                                    to believe that the health of the camp is returning. The weather still continues
                                    delightful—the roads, however, are again becoming dusty. Provisions and
                                    forage seem not so scarce as farther back.—the country through which <pb n="324" id="VAA4025-021-4-050"/> we are now passing is more thickly settled.
                                    &amp; Distance travelled to-day fourteen miles. We are now encamped near <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Decatur</region>
                                    </placeName>, 111. forty miles from <placeName>

                        <p>Thursday, 27th Sept.</p>
                        <p>At 8 this morning we were loaded and on our horses. We travelled until 2 p. m. and
                                    reached our present encampment, Long Point, about fourteen miles from the camp of
                                    last night. During the march, and indeed for the last three days, a considerable
                                    number of the Indian men were scouring the prairies in search of game. Their success
                                    has been such as to supercede entirely the necessity of isuing rations. The camp is
                                    now full of venison. Mr. Shields, one of the Assistant Conductors, left us this
                                    morning on account of indisposition. A substitute, it is thought, will not be
                                    necessary as the emigration is already far advanced on its route. We find no
                                    difficulty in procuring water, and we have every reason to believe that the greater
                                    portion of our route will be found to furnish a sufficiency for the party. Physician
                                    still indisposed. Forage and subsistence the same. We find less difficulty in
                                    procuring sufficient quantities.</p>
                        <p>Friday, 28th Sept.</p>
                        <p>Left Long Point at a little before 8 and crossed the prairies intervening. At 2
                                    o'clk. P. M. we reached the Sangamon (on the banks of which we have
                                    encamped for the last five days) after crossing which we pitched our tents. We are
                                    now within a few miles of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, which place we shall pass through to-morrow. Judge Polke, the
                                    Conductor, on the occasion of passing through a village of the character of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, requested I-o-weh, one of the principal chiefs, so to arrange and
                                    accoutre the Indians as to insure a good appearance. The chief was delighted with
                                    the proposition and no doubt the emigration to-morrow will present quite a gaudy
                                    appearance. As an inducement they were promised some tobacco, which they have been
                                    much in want of for several days. The day has been very warm, which added to the
                                    length of our march, fatigued much the emigrants. The illness of the camp is
                                    disappearing gradually, and we may safely calculate upon a great diminution in the
                                    number of sick at the next report of the physician. Forage and provisions becoming
                                    plenty, as we nearer approach the settled portions of the state. Distance travelled
                                    to-day Eighteen miles. Two children died during the night.</p>

                                    </placeName> at as early an hour as possible, we rose before light, and at 8
                                    o'clock were on our way. The Indians amongst whom a degree of pride was
                                    excited, arranged themselves into line, and with an unusual display of finery and
                                    gaudy trumpery marched through the streets of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. The wayfares were covered with anxious spectators, so much so indeed
                                    as to threaten <pb n="325" id="VAA4025-021-4-051"/> for a time to impede the
                                    progress of the Emigration. We passed clearly through however, and that too without
                                    the detention of a single Indian. At 3 we reached our present Encampment,
                                    McCoy's Mills, distant from last night's camp seventeen miles.
                                    This morning, Dr. Jerolaman on account of his continued indisposition, requested
                                    leave to remain in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                                    </placeName> a few days to recruit. Permission was granted. Our march today was
                                    through a very dry region of Country. We are now encamped on a stream affording
                                    little water.</p>
                        <p>Sunday, 30th Sept.</p>
                        <p>We left McCoy's Mills at about 9 o'clk. and at 12 reached Island
                                    Grove, the place of our Encampment 6 miles distant from the Camp of last night. Our
                                    march was made necessarily short on account of the scarcity of water—this
                                    being the only watering place nearer than ten or fifteen miles. The death of a child
                                    occurred a few hours after our encampment. Health of the sick still improving.
                                    Provisions and subsistence good and healthy. The Indians still bring in large
                                    quantities of game—sufficient for their subsistence—and they
                                    greatly prefer such provisions as they acquire by the chase. One of the Dragoons was
                                    dismissed last night for intoxication—Nothing of the kind is permitted.</p>
                        <p>Monday, 1st October.</p>
                        <p>Early in the morning we left Island Grove—travelled over a dry prairie
                                    Country, seventeen miles, we reached our encampment, near <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Jacksonville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Nothing occurred during our
                                    march save that a child fell from a wagon, and was very much crushed by the wheels
                                    running over it. It is thought the child will die. To-night some of the chiefs
                                    reported two runaways, who left this morning. During the Evening we were much
                                    perplexed by the curiosity of visitors, to many of whom the sight of an emigration
                                    or body of Indians is as great a rarity as a travelling Caravan of wild animals.
                                    Late at night the camp was complimented by a serenade from the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Jacksonville</settlement>

                        <p>Tuesday, 2nd Octr.</p>
                        <p>We struck our tents at 8 this morning, and prepared for a march. Owing to the very
                                    great curiosity manifested by the citizens generally, Judge Polke, after being
                                    solicited, marched the emigration into the square, where we remained for fifteen or
                                    twenty minutes. Presents of tobacco and pipes in abundance were made by the citizens
                                    to the Indians, who appeared quite as much delighted with the favor shown them as
                                    with the excellent music of the Band which escorted us around the square. We
                                    continued our journey, and at 3 o'clock reached our present encampment
                                    about sixteen miles from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Jacksonville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. The day was excessively warm and the dust very afflicting, added to
                                    which water was scarcely to be found on the route. Provisions and forage we find in
                                    considerable quantities, without difficulty.</p>

                        <p>Wednesday, Oct. 3d.</p>
                        <p>Left Exeter encampment at a little before 8 o'clock, and without any
                                    occurrence of note reached the <geogName>Illinois River</geogName> at about
                                    11—9 miles distant from last night's camp. Preparations were
                                    made for ferrying the river, and we embarked in keel and flat boats directly after
                                    our arrival. The day was spent in crossing and re-crossing the stream, and by 9 p.
                                    m. we succeeded in landing the last of the baggage wagons. We are now encamped on
                                    the opposite shore from Naples, where we shall perhaps remain to-morrow, to recruit
                                    the fatigues of the last few days. A child died directly after our arrival at the
                                    river.</p>
                        <p>Thursday, 4th Octr.</p>
                        <p>Although the ferriage of the river was completed last night before we slept, it was
                                    thought advisable by the Conductor to remain in Camp to-day. The Indians made use of
                                    the opportunity thus afforded, to furnish themselves with moccasins, wash their
                                    blankets and clothes, and do many other things necessary to their comfort and
                                    cleanliness during the remainder of the journey. The health of the Indians is now
                                    almost as good as before we commenced our march from Twin Lakes—a few
                                    days more will entirely recruit them. A young child died in the Evening.</p>
                        <p>Friday, 5th Oct.</p>
                        <p>Left Encampment opposite Naples at 8 o'clock, and reached at a little after
                                    12 our present encampment, at McKee's creek, twelve miles from the
                                        <geogName>Illinois River</geogName>. We were forced to-day to leave the Road and
                                    travel a considerable distance to find water—even such as it
                                    is—standing in ponds.—The streams are nearly all dry.
                                    Subsistence, beef and flour. Forage of a good character.</p>
                        <p>Saturday, 6th Oct.</p>
                        <p>At a little before 8 in the morning we left the encampment of last night. During the
                                    night we were visited by a fall of rain which rendered the travelling to-day
                                    unusually pleasant. The dust has been completely allayed, and the air much cooled.
                                    Water on the route was only to be found in stagnant ponds. At 3 o'clock we
                                    reached our present encampment, which from the barreness of the spot in everything
                                    save grass, brush and weeds, we have appropriately named Hobson's Choice.
                                    Beef and potatoes were issued to the Indians this Evening. Forage, corn and hay. A
                                    child died since we came into camp. Distance travelled to-day eighteen miles.</p>

                        <p>We were on the march this morning at half past 7 o'clk. The journey was
                                    pleasant and the road better than usual supplied with water. The distance to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, of which we are now within six or seven miles, was too great for one
                                    day's journey; we therefore encamped at Mill-creek, but twelve miles
                                    distance from Hobson's <pb n="327" id="VAA4025-021-4-053"/> Choice camp.
                                    To-morrow we shall reach <placeName>

                                    </placeName> at an early hour, and as soon as possible cross the river on the
                                    opposite bank of which we expect to remain two or three days to allow the teamsters
                                    and others engaged in the service, sufficient time to repair their wagons, etc. A

                                    the emigration were detached and sent a-head at 7 o'clk. At 10 a great
                                    portion of the emigrants had reached the river, seven miles from the camp of last
                                    night. A steam ferry-boat which had been previously employed, was in waiting for,
                                    and the Indians were immediately put on board. By night we succeeded in crossing all
                                    the Indians, horses, and several wagons. The remainder will be brought over as early
                                    as convenient, to-morrow. It is with the utmost difficulty that many of the Indians
                                    are restrained from intoxication. A guard has to be kept under arms in every town
                                    through which we pass.—Tomorrow will be employed in the payment of the
                                    officers and troops. Three children died since morning.</p>

                        <p>The wagons belonging to the emigration were early engaged in ferrying the river, and
                                    by night time all were over. During the day the officers were busily employed in
                                    making out the accounts of the officers, laborers and wagoners engaged in the
                                    emigration most of whom will be paid and settled with up to the 30th ult. Two
                                    Dragoons Messrs. Kelley &amp; Smith declined going further with the
                                    emigration—they were accordingly discharged. Dr. Jerolaman came into camp
                                    to-day—his health is still very delicate. Several of the chiefs assembled
                                    to-day, and requested of the Conductor liberty to remain in Camp each succeeding
                                    Sabbath for devotional exercises. Leave was granted. The health of the Indians is
                                    still improving. We shall continue in camp to-morrow. Mr. H. Barnett, a dragoon, was
                                    also discharged to-day, at his own request.</p>
                        <p>Wednesday, 10th Oct.</p>
                        <p>The settlements of yesterday was concluded to-day, and every person engaged in the
                                    service, save the Officers of the emigration, was paid up to the 30th ult. In order
                                    to allow the wagoners an opportunity of repairing their wagons, shoeing their horses
                                    and making other repairs necessary for the safe prosecution of the journey, much
                                    extra ferriage was done during the two days of our encampment at the river. This
                                    might have been avoided by remaining on the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                                    </placeName> chore, but the dissolute habits of the Indians and their great
                                    proneness to intoxication, forbid such a step on the part of the agents of the
                                    government. At sunset all the wagons that had been repairing, were in camp, and we
                                    were prepared for next day's journey.</p>

                        <p>At 9 o'clock the emigration moved from the encampment of the last two days.
                                    The rest of yesterday and the day before had much recruited the health and spirits
                                    of the Indians. The march was pleasant and without the occurrence of any
                                    difficulties. We are encamped at Pleasant Spring, near Palmyra, Mo. Capt. J. Holman,
                                    of Peru, Ia. arrived in Camp to-day. He serves in the capacity of Assistant
                                    Superintendent, having received his appointment at the suggestion of reports
                                    unfavorable to the health of the officers attached to the emigration. A woman died
                                    shortly after we encamped today. An ox wagon engaged in the transportation of
                                    Indians, having lost its cattle was forced to remain behind with its load. The wagon
                                    along with those left to hunt the oxen will be up to-morrow. Distance travelled
                                    to-day thirteen miles.</p>
                        <p>Friday, 12th Oct.</p>
                        <p>Early this morning we prepared for marching, and at 8½ o'clock
                                    were under way. We passed through Palmyra at 10, and had little difficulty in
                                    preventing the excesses of the Indians. After we arrived in camp, however, two or
                                    three Indians were found to have procured liquor, and become much intoxicated. They
                                    were immediately arrested and put under guard. We are now encamped on See's
                                    creek, thirteen miles from Pleasant Spring, the camp of last night. The health of
                                    the Indians is considered so good that medicine has not for some time been
                                    administered to them. Subsistence beef and flour. Forage corn and corn fodder. The
                                    Indian horses are suffered to graze through the woods. The wagon left behind
                                    yesterday came up this evening after dark. Gen. A. Morgan, who has heretofore been
                                    acting in the capacity of Assistant Superintendent in the emigration gave notice
                                    that he should offer his resignation to-morrow.</p>
                        <p>Saturday, 13th Oct.</p>
                        <p>This morning as we were on the eve of leaving our encampment, a number of the Indians
                                    headed by the chief Ash-kum came up to Head Quarters, and requested an interview
                                    with the Conductor and Gen. Morgan. Ash-kum arose and in a short talk informed the
                                    Conductor that the Indians were unwilling that Gen. Morgan whom they had been taught
                                    to recognize as principal in the emigration, should leave them. They felt, he
                                    continued, that Gen. M. was near to them as a protector—he had made them
                                    pledges upon which they depended, and the fulfilment of which induced them in part
                                    to consent to their emigration. The Indians also requested thro' Ash-kum
                                    liberty to travel less and remain longer in camp. Judge Polke answered. He informed
                                    them that Gen. Morgan had voluntarily offered his resignation, and that he had been
                                    appointed to conduct them to their new homes, with the consent of Gen. M. etc. etc.
                                    Gen. Morgan also responded and returned his thanks to the Indians for <pb n="329" id="VAA4025-021-4-055"/> the interest which they manifested in his welfare. The
                                    chief I-o-weh dissented in strong terms from the sentiments expressed by Ash-kum. He
                                    stated that these men (alluding to Ash-kum and his associates) were not
                                    chiefs—that they were not entitled to respect as such. He wished that
                                    Judge Polke should conduct them to their new homes, and that Gen. Morgan should
                                    return. He was contented with the Officers remaining with the emigration. The
                                    emigration left at 9 o'clock. Gen. Morgan having previously departed. The
                                    day was very windy, and the dust exceedingly afflicting. At 3 o'clock we
                                    arrived in camp at Clinton—a distance of seventeen miles from
                                    See's creek. To-morrow we shall remain in camp.</p>
                        <p>Sunday, 14th Octr.</p>
                        <p>To-day according to a promise made the chiefs a few days ago, we remained in camp.
                                    The Indians attended service during the day, and seemed quite to enjoy themselves.
                                    In the Evening the chiefs Ash-kum, I-o-weh and others, along with a number of the
                                    Indians, assembled at Head Quarters, and shook hands for a talk. They came, I-o-weh
                                    said, to demand the dismissal or suspension of Dr. Jerolaman, the physician for the
                                    emigration, whom they had ceased to like, and did not wish him longer to accompany
                                    the emigration. Judge Polke answered and informed them that their request was one of
                                    so much importance and so unusual in emigrations, that he hoped he might be allowed
                                    time not only to decide himself but to counsel with his officers. The Indians then
                                    retired, with the understanding that an answer would be given them to-morrow
                                    evening.</p>
                        <p>Monday, 15th Oct.</p>
                        <p>At 8 o'clk. this morning we were on the march. The day was very windy, which
                                    rendered our passage across the prairie very disagreeable. Many of the Indians
                                    suffered a good deal. At noon we reached our present encampment, near <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, twelve miles distant from the camp of last night. During the evening
                                    the chiefs, according to arrangement of last night, along with a large number of the
                                    Indians, came up to Head Quarters, and repeated their request of last night. The
                                    Speaker said that he did not demand it for himself or for his associates alone, but
                                    for every man, woman and child in camp—they all united in soliciting the
                                    discharge of Dr. Jerolaman. The Conductor briefly informed them that Dr. J. had
                                    received his appointment from government—that he felt a delicacy in
                                    discontinuing an officer of government—that the Indians were not
                                    compelled to receive the services of Dr. J—they were free to choose for
                                    themselves—that he thought it his duty to retain his services as
                                    physician for the officers of the emigration, and that viewing their request in the
                                    light he did, he could not consistent with his duty, grant their request. He hoped
                                    they would forget their prejudices, and still continue friendly with Dr.
                                    J.—and that his decision might not affect the feelings of unity which had
                                    so far subsisted between <pb n="330" id="VAA4025-021-4-056"/> the officers and their
                                    red brethren. In conclusion he informed them that he had purchased, in the hope of
                                    allaying their discontent, a keg of tobacco, which he wished them to smoke in token
                                    of continued friendship. The Indians then retired, not, without, however, first
                                    requesting leave to renew the subject again. Subsistence, beef, corn and potatoes.
                                    Forage corn &amp; hay.</p>

                        <p>Left Encampment at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                                    </placeName> this morning at 8. Our march was unusually long—water being
                                    scarce throughout the country. At 3 o'clk. we arrived at
                                    Burkhart's Encampment, eighteen miles from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. The day was quite cold—last night having frozen water in
                                    camp. Health still improving. Complaints of sickness are scarcely to be heard.</p>
                        <p>Wednesday, 17th Octr.</p>
                        <p>Although the appearances of the weather were unfavorable, we were at an early hour
                                    preparing for the day's journey. At 8 the snow commenced falling very fast,
                                    and continued during the greater part of the day. Travelling was difficult, the road
                                    being exceedingly slippery, and the snow falling so fast as to render very cold and
                                    unpleasant the whole journey. At 3 o'clk, we reached our encampment near
                                    Huntsville, about thirteen miles from Burkhart's. The Indians travelled
                                    without complaint, and seemed greatly to approve of the exertions of government to
                                    place them at their new homes. Subsistence flour and beef. Forage corn and hay. The
                                    snow at night changed to rain, which almost inundated the encampment. A quantity of
                                    straw was procured, which generally distributed throughout the camp rendered the
                                    Indians tolerably comfortable for the night.</p>
                        <p>Thursday, 18th Oct.</p>
                        <p>To-day owing to the continued rain we were forced to remain encamped. Added to which
                                    the state of the roads forbid our travel. Nothing occurred during the day, save the
                                    drunkenness of a few of the Indians who had procured liquor at Huntsville. To-morrow
                                    we expect to move. Provisions and forage the same as yesterday.</p>
                        <p>Friday, 19th Octr.</p>
                        <p>Early this morning the Indians were busily engaged in making preparations for a
                                    march. At 8 o'clock we were on the way. At 12 we reached encampment on
                                    Middle Chariton, eleven miles from the camp of last night. The day was cold and
                                    clear—the journey, however, was accomplished without the distress of
                                    Wednesday. The Indians still seem to be anxious to reach their destination.</p>
                        <p>Saturday, 20th Octr.</p>
                        <p>Left Chariton Encampment at 8 o'clock this morning. The road was quite
                                    muddy, and the air very cold. At 12 we reached our present Encampment on Grand
                                    Chariton, two miles from Keatsville. <pb n="331" id="VAA4025-021-4-057"/> To-morrow
                                    being the Sabbath we shall remain in camp. The health of the Indians is almost
                                    completely restored. There are perhaps scarcely a dozen cases in camp. Subsistence
                                    beef and flour—of which the Indians are becoming tired. Bacon and pork
                                    cannot be procured. Forage hay and corn. Distance travelled to-day eleven miles.</p>
                        <p>Sunday, 21st Oct.</p>
                        <p>To-day we remained in camp to allow the Indians, according to a request made by them,
                                    an opportunity for worship. During the day a considerable quantity of apples and
                                    cider was purchased and given to the Indians. The health continues good. One or two
                                    of the Officers have within the last few days been much indisposed.</p>
                        <p>Monday, 22nd Oct.</p>
                        <p>At an early hour this morning we left our encampment, and passing through Keatsville,
                                    journeyed towards the <geogName>Missouri River</geogName>. At 2 o'clk. P.
                                    M. we reached <geogName>Grand River</geogName>, preparations for the ferriage of
                                    which had before been made, and immediately commenced its crossing. By dark all the
                                    Indians and many of the wagons were over. The remainder will cross in the morning
                                    early and by 12 we hope to be able to continue our journey. Distance travelled
                                    to-day fifteen miles.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday, 23rd Octr.</p>
                        <p>The morning was early employed in ferrying the remainder of the wagons. By 12

                                    journey. The bottom lands of the <placeName>

                                    </placeName> being too flat and wet to encamp upon an hour longer than was
                                    essentially necessary, at 1 o'clk. we left <geogName>Grand River</geogName>
                                    Encampment, and passing over prairies (the cold being severe) arrived at
                                    Thomas' Encampment at a little after 4, a distance of ten miles.
                                    Subsistence beef, flour and corn. Forage corn and corn fodder.</p>

                        <p>This morning before leaving Camp a quantity of Shoes were distributed among the
                                    indigent and barefooted Indians, the weather being too severe for marching without a
                                    covering to the feet. At 8 o'clock we left Thomas' encampment, and
                                    at 12 reached Carrollton, near which place we are now encamped. Distance twelve
                                    miles. Nothing occurred on the way. The cold was intense on the prairies. The
                                    country through which we passed to-day is very much excited. Nothing is
                                    heard—nothing is talked of but the Mormons and the difficulties between
                                    them and the citizens of Upper <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>

                        <p>Thursday, 25th Octr.</p>
                        <p>Having an unusually long journey before us, across a prairie, we moved from
                                    Carrollton encampment at half past 7 o'clk. and without meeting with
                                    difficulties or obstructions, but somewhat fatigued, <pb n="332" id="VAA4025-021-4-058"/> we arrived at Snowden's, near whose farm we
                                    encamped. The journey was made unnecessarily long because of the scarcity of water
                                    and timber, and the absence of provisions and forage. Some time after our encampment
                                    the Conductor was waited upon by a gentleman, who it appeared had been delegated by
                                    the citizens of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                                    </placeName> (a village near us) to request assistance as they really anticipated an
                                    attack from the Mormons tonight. Judge Polke informed the gentleman that such a step
                                    on his part would be entirely without the line of his duty. His duties were
                                    particularly delegated to him by the government, to which he was responsible for the
                                    faithful performance of the same. He hoped that the excitement would abate, and the
                                    aid which he required be rendered unnecessary. Provisions and forage as usual.</p>
                        <p>Friday, 26th Octr.</p>
                        <p>At 8 o'clock we left our encampment, and at 10 reached the
                                        <geogName>Missouri River</geogName>, opposite <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. We immediately commenced ferrying, and shall perhaps be able to get
                                    the wagons all over before night. We found the ferry engaged in transporting females
                                    who were flying from their homes. Great excitement prevails. Reports are rife
                                    throughout the country of bloodshed, house-burning, etc. The people seem completely
                                    crazed. By sunset all the wagons save a few were on the opposite bank of the river.
                                    Early in the morning we shall proceed to cross the Indians.</p>
                        <p>Saturday, 27th Octr.</p>
                        <p>At sunrise the ferry boats were busily plying from shore to shore. As fast as the
                                    Emigrants reached the southern bank they were hurried on their journey. At 2
                                    o'clk. the party were all over the river, and hastened to join the front of
                                    the emigration. At 4 o'clock the front of the party reached our encampment
                                    at Little Schuy creek, eight miles from last night's camp.</p>
                        <p>Sunday, 28th Octr.</p>
                        <p>To-day we remained in camp. We have performed a good week's travel, ferrying
                                    two rivers in the time. Health of the camp as good as it has been. This morning the
                                    Indians with Ash-kum at their head, came to Head Quarters and informed the conductor
                                    of some difficulties which they were fearful might occur in the exercise of the
                                    unrestricted power claimed by I-o-weh, whom they did not choose to acknowledge as a
                                    chief of the blood. They also requested information in regard to their annuities,
                                    etc. Judge Polke hoped that they would cease to speak of a subject which could not
                                    be of benefit to them, but on the other hand might affect the progress of the
                                    emigration. When the journey was completed they were at liberty to speak and decide
                                    among themselves. He had yet some tobacco, which he should offer them in hopes that
                                    they would still continue in peace and harmony. He also informed them what he knew
                                    of their annuities, etc. The Indians then retired apparently contented. <pb n="333" id="VAA4025-021-4-059"/> A child died after night some time—the first
                                    for the last four weeks.</p>
                        <p>Monday, 29th Octr.</p>
                        <p>At 8 o'clock we resumed our journey—the morning being delightful
                                    and fine for travelling. At 12 we reached <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                                    </placeName> creek ten miles from Schuy creek. Subsistence flour, corn-meal, beef
                                    and pork and game of every kind. Forage, corn, hay and fodder. About 5
                                    o'clock Capt. Hull arrived in camp with the Indians left at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>

                                    </placeName>, numbering in all some twenty-three. They are tolerably good health and
                                    spirits and will perhaps accomplish the remainder of the journey in the company of
                                    our party.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday, 30th Octr.</p>
                        <p>We marched from <placeName>

                                    </placeName> creek this morning at a little before 8, and at 1 p. m. reached our
                                    present encampment at <geogName>Blue River</geogName>, fourteen miles from this
                                    morning's camp. The journey was unusually pleasant—the day warm,
                                    and the emigrants in the company of their friends, who came up yesterday evening,
                                    very gay and cheerful. Some time after our encampment Capt. Hull reported himself to
                                    the conductor and the number and condition of the emigrants under his charge. They
                                    number in all twenty-three, having five horses and three transporting wagons in
                                    company. They will be attached to the emigration under the charge of Judge Polke
                                    to-morrow.</p>
                        <p>Wednesday, 31st Octr.</p>
                        <p>Left Encampment this morning at half after 7 o'clock—the company
                                    under Capt. Hull being attached to the emigration—and at 12
                                    o'clock passed through Independence. At 1 we reached our present encampment
                                    two miles south of Independence, and ten miles from the camp of yesterday. After
                                    reaching camp in the evening a small quantity of shoes were distributed among the
                                    emigrants. Many Indians came into camp during the afternoon much intoxicated.</p>
                        <p>Thursday, 1st Novr.</p>
                        <p>Left camp Independence at a little after 9—one hour or so having been
                                    allowed the Indians for their religious exercises. At 3 o'clk. we reached
                                    our present encampment on <geogName>Blue River</geogName>, sixteen miles. The
                                    journey was exceedingly pleasant—the weather being warm and the road very
                                    good. Subsistence and forage of a good and healthy character, and to be had in
                                    abundance. To-morrow we shall cross the state line, and thereafter experience some
                                    difficulty in provisioning—the country being almost an entire wilderness.</p>
                        <p>Friday, 2nd Nov.</p>
                        <p>This morning broke upon us rainy and disagreeable. The Conductor being anxious,
                                    however, to complete the journey now so near at an end, gave the word for a move,
                                    and at 8 o'clock we were on the road—the rain increasing as we
                                    advanced. At 9 we crossed the boundary line, and found ourselves in the heart of a
                                    prairie, with <pb n="334" id="VAA4025-021-4-060"/> scarcely any traces to mark our
                                    route. The journey was continued and at 12 a large portion of the emigrants on
                                    horseback became detached from the wagons, and wandered over the prairie four hours
                                    in search of the trace of the wagons. It was found at length, and we reached the
                                    camp ground set-out for at 3 o'clock, having travelled a distance (it was
                                    computed) of twenty-five miles, although we are now but twelve miles from the
                                    encampment of yesterday. Our encampment is known as the North fork of <geogName>Blue
                                        River</geogName>. Subsistence beef and corn. Forage corn.</p>
                        <p>Saturday, 3rd Nov.</p>
                        <p>At an early hour we left our encampment at Oak Grove, and travelled until 2
                                    o'clock when we reached a settlement of Wea Indians, on Bull creek, and
                                    camped adjoining Bull-town. Our journey was pleasant, and was marked by the anxiety
                                    of the Indians to push forward and see their friends. During the evening an attempt
                                    was made to enroll the Indians, but not very successfully. They did not seem (or
                                    would not) to understand or appreciate the object. Late in the evening several of
                                    the chiefs came to Head Quarters, and requested to remain in camp to-morrow. But the
                                    journey being so nearly completed, and the scarcity of forage and provisions induced
                                    the conductor to deny their request, and insist upon travelling.</p>
                        <p>Sunday, 4th Nov.</p>
                        <p>Left Bull-town encampment this morning at 9 o'clk. two hours having been
                                    allowed the Indians for devotional purposes. At 2 we crossed the Osage, where the
                                    Indians were met and welcomed by many of their friends, and at half after 3 reached
                                    Pottawattomie creek, the end of our destination. The emigrants seemed delighted with
                                    the appearance of things—the country—its
                                    advantages—the wide spreading prairie and the thrifty grove, the rocky
                                    eminence and the meadowed valley—but particularly with the warm and
                                    hearty greetings of those who have tested (and but to become attached to,) the
                                    country assigned them by government. The evening was spent in preparing for some
                                    settlements of to-morrow. The distance of to-day's travel is computed at
                                    twenty miles. Mr. Davis, the Agent, we found absent.</p>
                        <p>Monday, 5th Nov.</p>
                        <p>The day was consumed in making settlements with the Officers. During the afternoon a
                                    considerable number of the Indians, assembled at Head Quarters, and expressed a
                                    desire to be heard in a speech. Pe-pish-kay rose and in substance
                                    said:—That they had now arrived at their journey's
                                    end—that the government must now be satisfied. They had been taken from
                                    homes affording them plenty, and brought to a desert—a
                                    wilderness—and were now to be scattered and left as the husbandman
                                    scatters his seed. The Agent, Mr. Davis, they knew not, and his absence would not
                                    afford them an opportunity of deciding what they might expect from him. The Indians
                                        <pb n="335" id="VAA4025-021-4-061"/> did not think such treatment of a character
                                    with that promised them in their treaties. They hoped Judge Polke, their friend,
                                    would remain with them and see that justice should be rendered. Judge Polke informed
                                    them that considering their request too important to be disregarded, he would return
                                    from Independence, whither it was necessary he should go to attest the settlements
                                    of the emigration, and remain with them until Mr. Davis's return. He would
                                    leave his son (Mr. B. C. Polke) who would in company with them visit and select such
                                    localities in the country as might please them. They returned for answer that they
                                    would reply in the morning. The Council then broke up. Quite an old man died after
                                    coming into camp last night. Beef and corn were delivered to the Indians in the
                                    afternoon. During the evening, a wagon belonging to and owned by Andrew Fuller, a
                                    Pottawattomie, containing six Indians, came into camp. They had travelled from <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                                    </placeName> with the intention of becoming citizens of the Western Territory, and
                                    borne their expenses for the whole route. They came without any instructions from
                                    the Agent at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>

                        <p>Tuesday, 6th Novr.</p>
                        <p>We were early preparing to move on our return—the Officers and wagoners
                                    generally expressing much anxiety to hasten their return. The Indians assembled
                                    again, and after a repetition of the requests and arguments of yesterday, informed
                                    the Conductor that they were willing he should leave them, but they should expect
                                    his return. In the meantime they hoped that Judge Polke would interest himself in
                                    their affairs. They had confidence in him, and hoped he would not abuse it.
                                    Immediately we left our encampment, and proceeded on our return. Much feeling was
                                    manifested at our departure. On our way we passed a wagon containing two dead
                                    persons. A sick family of Indians had been left at Bull-town—two of the
                                    sick had died. They reached the camp of the Indians before night. We arrived at our
                                    encampment of Saturday last at 3 o'clock. To-morrow we shall proceed to
                                    Westpoint.</p>

                        <p>Travelled from Bulltown encampment to McLean's Grove, a distance of
                                    twenty-five miles. It had snowed the night previous and continued most of the day,
                                    which was very windy and excessively cold. But a small number of the Teams kept in
                                    company—most of them selecting their own routes.</p>
                        <p>Thursday, 8th Nov.</p>
                        <p>Left McLean's Grove and travelled to Westpoint a distance of nine miles to
                                    breakfast. After breakfast we continued on our way, and arrived at Camp near
                                    Independence at 5 o'clock. Several of the teams were already in camp, and
                                    others coming in. To-day we travelled a distance of twenty-one miles.</p>

                    </placeName>, 1925, pp. xviii, 446.</head>
            <p>Including the index, this volume contains 446 pages, of which the account of the Swiss settlement of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName>, as compiled by Ferret Dufour, fills 215 pages, while the Appendix of 128 pages
                    consists of a collection of documents bearing on the same subject. There is likewise a brief
                    introduction by Harlow Lindley. Perret Dufour, the compiler of the History of the Swiss Settlement
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName>, was born in 1807 and died in 1884. He was the son of John Francis Dufour, a native of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland</region>
                    </placeName>, who arrived in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1801, and a nephew of John James Dufour, the <hi rend="i">avant-coureur</hi> of the
                    Swiss emigrants, and the real founder of the Swiss settlement in the <geogName>Ohio
                    valley</geogName>. During his entire life Perret Dufour was an active participant in public affairs
                    and an assiduous and painstaking collector of history material. He served his community at different
                    times as postmaster of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, justice of the peace and as a member of the General Assembly. The historical material
                    collected and compiled by Dufour was put into narrative form in 1869 and in 1876. It is the
                    narrative of 1876 which is used as the text of this volume, the revisions thereof and the additions
                    thereto, together with appropriate material from the manuscript of 1869, being printed as notes to
                    the text which they are designed to fortify and elaborate.</p>
            <p>The Dufour history is of first-class historical importance, not alone because its compiler lived
                    through and was a part of the formative period of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName> and southeastern Indiana, but because he has incorporated many important documents in
                    his narrative, has drawn on many sources of information no longer readily accessible, and has
                    transcribed <pb n="338" id="VAA4025-021-4-064"/> and preserved many significant and illuminating
                    local traditions.</p>
            <p>Aside from a brief introduction, setting out with the year 1765, the Dufour narrative begins with an
                    investigating trip made to America in 1796 by John James Dufour, on behalf of the Vineyard Society
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland</region>
                    </placeName>, the members of which were contemplating a migration to America for the purpose of
                    raising grapes and producing wine. After extensive wanderings, trafficing and adventures, which took
                    him from <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>

                  <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
               </placeName> and Marietta, and back to <placeName>

                  <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, a site for the first vineyard was finally selected
                    by John James Dufour in the Big Bend of the <geogName>Kentucky River</geogName>. This vineyard was
                    so prosperous and the outlook so encouraging that in 1800 Dufour wrote to his family in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland</region>
                    </placeName>, urging them to join him in the prosecution of the new enterprise. Accordingly,
                    seventeen members of the Dufour family, including John Francis Dufour, the father of Perret Dufour,
                    left <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland</region>
                    </placeName> for the new world, and arrived in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, on July
                    3, 1801. The Dufour family continued to operate the first vineyard as a common property until 1804.
                    Meantime, in 1802, upon request of John James Dufour, Congress passed an act by virtue of which John
                    James Dufour and his associates obtained possession of a tract of land, on a portion of which the
                    city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> was subsequently laid out. These lands were divided among the vine dressers and
                    operated for the "cultivation of the vine" under a covenant, executed on January
                    20, 1803, which constitutes the origin of the famous Swiss settlement of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its environs, which has contributed so extensively to the development of the state
                    and the evolution of its political institutions.</p>
            <p>From the date of the foundation of the Swiss settlement of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the Dufour history, which is an exceedingly interesting and sprightly narrative, sets
                    forth with considerable particularity the ethnological ingredients of the new colony; the social and
                    economic life of the early settlers, together with their various occupations; the abundance and
                    mischievous ravages of the wild life of the wooded frontier, such as wolves, bears, squirrels and
                    wild turkeys; the origin and development <pb n="339" id="VAA4025-021-4-065"/> of schools; the Indian
                    depredations, with their attendant uneasiness and distress; the organization and adventures of
                    ranger and militia companies; the establishment of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName> and the beginning of county government; early taverns and tavern life; newspapers;
                    churches and religious life; canal companies; state banks; physicians and early medical practice;
                    punishment by whipping, under the ancient code; steamboating on the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>;
                    the visit of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>; the development of public highways; and a miscellaneous collection of equally
                    diverting and informing subjects. One especially useful item of information is the geneological data
                    relative to the early families. Owing to the fact that various items of information seem to have
                    been compiled at various times and have been placed in a more or less logical juxtaposition in the
                    text, the narrative has a somewhat sketchy character, but the picture as a whole is vivid and the
                    general impression gained by the reader is that the Dufour's work has been compiled with
                    care and has been written judiciously and the volume constitutes a worthy addition to the historical
                    literature which the Historical Bureau is making available by its publications.</p>
            <p>The appendix contains a reprint of five original documents of great value, including an
                    "Account of the Possessions of the Dufour Family in America, Rendered to the
                    Father" and an elaborate "Daybook of Jean Jaques Dufour of Sales of Montreux,
                    Bailiwick of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on His Travels". These documents are given in the original French with the
                    accompanying translation on the opposite page.</p>
            <p>The Editors of this volume have done an excellent and painstaking piece of work. The text is set out
                    as Dufour wrote it, with all its imperfections and idiosyncrasies intact, as such documents should
                    be. Its value is enhanced by facsimili copies of the Deed of Vineyard Lands granted to the Swiss
                    colonists during the administration of James <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>

                    stored. The notes appended to this volume should be particularly commended, as they represent a
                    marked advance in craftsmanship over some of the former volumes in this series. So far as the
                    reviewer is aware, there is not a single reference, allusion or incomplete statement in the
                    narrative, which would otherwise be obscure, which does not have a supporting note, skillfully
                    selected and compactly worded, to supply the facts which are essential to a complete understanding
                    of the text. If editorial skill, persevering industry, and a professional grasp of the
                    subject-matter are essential to acceptable historical compilations of this character, the reviewer
                    ventures the prediction that this volume has "arrived". In conclusion, it should
                    be stated that the volume is supplied with a very satisfactory and usable index.</p>

            <p>Readers of this magazine know of Elmore Barce as a painstaking delver in local history whose
                    offerings in this field for the last ten years prove his interest to be more than ephemeral. Some of
                    his productions during that period have been contributed to these pages, and others have taken the
                    book form. His latest is the <hi rend="i">Annals of <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Benton County</region>
                        </placeName>,</hi> a neat little volume of 119 pages, which is announced as the first one of a
                    series to follow on the same theme.</p>
            <p>The first expression of appreciation of the work of Mr. Barce and of a very few others like him
                    (notably Mr. J. W. Whickcar, of Attica) should, I take it, be of that abiding love for historical
                    inquiry that persists regardless of its thanklessness, so far as the public is concerned. The county
                    history which is frankly that and nothing else does well if it pays the printer, hence the great
                    majority of such productions are hooked up with cheap commercial ventures which use history as a peg
                    on which to hang biographical puffs that are of little interest to anybody except those puffed.
                    Shelves of books of this character prove that history compiled under these conditions is apt to be
                    of limited value, and they are but an aggravation to the person who goes to them in search of
                    worthwhile information.</p>
            <pb n="341" id="VAA4025-021-4-067"/>
            <p>From such superficial manifestations of the history exploiters one turns with a feeling of
                    thankfulness to a sincere piece of work like the <hi rend="i">Annals of <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Benton County</region>
                        </placeName>.</hi> Obviously, the author's foot is on his native heath, or at any rate
                    he betrays a familiarity with his subject equivalent to that, and he handles his material with a
                    zest that shows it inspires him. Every section of Indiana (as of every other place) has its
                    distinctive features—it is a separate environment that more or less modifies the history
                    of which it is a part. Whoever penetrates to the spirit and character of a community through the
                    facts of its history and physical environment is making a genuine contribution to history in the
                    sociological sense, and I think Mr. Barce apprehends this inner meaning of his theme. The physical
                    surroundings with which he has to deal were markedly different from those of a forested country. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> was a prairie county, so devoid of natural drainage that spots dry enough to be
                    cultivated were little better than islands in the swamps, and ofttimes the farmer could not get into
                    his fields for the wetness. The prairie soil, from lack of aeration, baked hard when it was dry, and
                    broke up in great clods, yielding poor crops in spite of the great fertility locked up in it; the
                    sod was tough and hard to work. One of the standing menaces to the pioneer in the dry weather of
                    early autumn was the dreaded prairie fire, which might on short notice sweep away his home and
                    garnered crops, and even imperil human lives. The art of fighting those fires was one he had to
                    acquire. Thus, the plainsman, like the woodsman, had to adapt himself to his own peculiar problems,
                    and in this case he did it so well that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton County</region>
                    </placeName> was, in time, converted from a bog where every crop was of doubtful growth to the
                    richest agricultural section in all Indiana. This inherent agricultural value has given a character
                    to the county, which is largely rural and homogeneous, and various other modifications arising from
                    the same source may be traced through Mr. Barce's text, either directly or indirectly.</p>
            <p>The author is aware of the picturesque aspects of his subject and gives some graphic descriptions of
                    the face of the county as visible from its few elevations, with its wide exhibit of growing crops,
                    and also, by contrast with these, of the old-time sea of waving prairie grass which grew so rank
                    that it <pb n="342" id="VAA4025-021-4-068"/> would hide from view a horse and its rider. The prairie
                    fires and the curious "tumble weeds" that could be seen rolling across the plains
                    by tens of thousands after the first frosts of fall, also make good reading. Not least interesting
                    is the account of some seven hundred acres of primeval forest, presenting gigantic specimens of
                    Indiana's typical trees, which, by some strange ordainment of nature, stood in the midst of
                    these wide prairie spaces.</p>
            <p>Having given us thus much of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton County</region>
                    </placeName> as a beginning, it is to be hoped Mr. Barce will continue his intensive study and
                    complete the proposed series. In the writing of our county histories, generally considered, much
                    remains to be desired, and every one that aims at a higher standard should be accorded an
                    appreciative welcome.</p>

                    the Middle West, will welcome R. L. Rusk's <hi rend="i">The Literature of the Middle
                        Western Frontier,</hi> which has just come from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University Press. Dr. Rusk was for some years a member of the English department of
                    Indiana University, going recently to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, so his book has an added interest to Indiana readers.</p>
            <p>Dr. Rusk sets 1840 as the limit to the period of which he writes. He does not attribute any great
                    literary achievement to any of the Western writers whose work he chronicles, but he considers that
                    the work, both of the more obscure writers and of the more outstanding, has value because in it is
                    written the history of the growth of civilization during a unique epoch, the epoch in which the
                    territory known as the Middle West was settled and took on, in a sense, the form it now has.</p>
            <p>Naturally, the first literature of the Middle West, the Middle West toward which the emigrant from
                    the eastern <pb n="343" id="VAA4025-021-4-069"/> seaboard was lured by the thought of freedom and
                    the romance which clothes a little known frontier land, was not written by Middle Westerners,
                    engaged in settling the new territory, but by travelers, many of them travelers from foreign
                    countries, such as DeTocqueville, Levasseur, Volney, Collot, and many others, covering the period
                    from the earliest settlement to the coming of the sharp-tongued Mrs. Trollope. Besides their
                    descriptions, there was another literature of travel, the books prepared for the prospective
                    emigrant, the Western gazetteers, guide books and travelers' directories.</p>
            <p>Other chapters of Dr. Rusk's book discuss the newspapers and magazines of the period, the
                    controversial writings, political and religious, the past named particularly interesting because
                    such controversy was the breath of life to the Western pioneer, and his oratorical style herein
                    displayed, says Dr. Rusk, was more Western than anything else in the West. Scholarly writings and
                    school books, fiction, poetry, the drama, and the vogue of British and Eastern authors, are the
                    subjects of other chapters. Of these, the one on the drama is of particular value, since information
                    concerning the amateur theatricals and the traveling players of the pioneer period is exceedingly
                    difficult to find.</p>
            <p>The greater part of the second volume is occupied with a bibliography which renders the work
                    additionally valuable. <hi rend="i">Literature of the Middle Western Frontier</hi> will be welcomed
                    as a reference book indispensable to all students of the pioneer period of the Middle West.</p>
