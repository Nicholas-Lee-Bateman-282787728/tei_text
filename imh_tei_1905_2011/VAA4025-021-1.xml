                    <p>He had few books, but they were choice and great, Read o'er and
                        o'er. Then, ranging far and wide, Through all the settlements, for

                    <p>Far blue horizons beckoned from these hills, Great visions mirrored in the

                        spread heavens re-told the ancient dream.</p>
                    <p>The heavens declared to him the glory of God, But did they give him, too, a

            <p rend="center">For the meeting of the Southwestern Indiana Historical Society,
                    Lincoln Park, October 14th, 1924</p>
            <p>In the year 1920, a short time after Mr. John E. Iglehart, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, had founded the Southwestern Indiana Historical Society, he coined
                    the phrase "The Lincoln Inquiry". Knowing that Lincoln was the
                    Southwestern's greatest asset, he warned the members against letting
                    that inquiry overshadow their other work. In an annual address a year later,
                    published in <hi rend="i">Bulletin 16,</hi> he said he had changed his mind and
                    he now saw no inconsistency between the two kinds of work, for the reason that
                    the missing chapter in Lincoln's life could not be written until the
                    missing chapter in the life of the people in this section of the state where
                    Lincoln found his environment was written. To this view Ida Tarbell, who has
                    spent more time and investigation and labor probably than any other historian
                    upon the subject of Lincoln's life in Indiana, has given her fullest
                    assent and she recognizes that in the work this society has done and is doing
                    will be found the solution of the problem as Mr. Iglehart has defined it.</p>
            <p>Since the organization of this society, however, the "Inquiry"
                    has grown to such proportions that much publicity has been given the
                    Southwestern and many papers have been written about the people whom Lincoln
                    knew while a resident of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName> and the influence they undoubtedly had on his early life.</p>
            <p>After all it is the people who live near the scenes of Lincoln's early
                    life who are best able to interpret its environment. They are intimately
                    acquainted with the descendants of his boyhood friends, have heard the stories
                    of his life as related by their elders and therefore ought to be in a position
                    to write more understandingly of those early days and those pioneer people.</p>
            <pb n="4" id="VAA4025-021-1-010"/>
            <p>It took our own able historian, Mr. John E. Iglehart, to realize that the missing
                    chapter in Lincoln's life could never be written by outsiders who would
                    perhaps spend a few days or a few hours in investigation in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName>, but it must be written by the children and grandchildren of those
                    people who knew Lincoln in his boyhood days. This inspiration of Mr. Iglehart is
                    going to mean much to the historians of the future because this historical
                    material must be preserved by this generation or much will be lost that can
                    never be supplied by a later generation.</p>
            <p>It is a very strange but true fact that of the many histories written about
                    Lincoln little is told of his boyhood days or of those friends and acquaintances
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName> and yet he lived here fourteen years and we will all agree that
                    those years were the formative ones in Lincoln's life.</p>
            <p>The people with whom he came in contact must have helped to mold his character
                    and give him the desire to make something of himself.</p>
            <p>I have always deeply resented the impression given by many historians and writers
                    that those early pioneers in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName> were uncouth, illiterate people. True there were some such, as
                    there were in all other states, but the brave men who came to make their homes
                    in what was then a vast wilderness were often men of culture and education, many
                    from the aristocratic families of the Virginias, Carolinas and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> who have left to their children and children's children
                    heirlooms of linen, silver, furniture, books, historical documents and pictures
                    which prove their ancestry and education.</p>
            <p>Now those pioneers' children, of whom we speak as the next generation,
                    were not well educated because of the lack of proper schools but there were many
                    men in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> and adjoining counties whom Lincoln knew, such as Pitcher and
                    Brackenridge, that possessed the most brilliant minds that Indiana has ever
                    claimed.</p>
            <p>Having been born in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName> and lived here practically all my life, I have known intimately the
                    children and grandchildren of those early people. My mother told me much of the
                    lives and histories of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName> pioneers, as her <pb n="5" id="VAA4025-021-1-011"/> father, Thomas
                    P. Britton, was one of those who came from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> about the year 1825 and my mother was born in one of the few log
                    houses that made up the then little village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Among the men who lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName> between 1816 and 1830 and were upstanding men of the county and
                    many of them men whom Lincoln no doubt knew well are the following, all of whom,
                    with two exceptions, have descendants still living here and whom I know
                    intimately, the Grasses, Gentrys, Richardsons, Jones, Crawfords, Brittons,
                    Garretts, Medcalfs, Barnetts, Snyders, Bunners, Wrights, Berrys, Naneys,
                    Proctors, Grahams, Lamars, Rays, Hammonds, Browns, Logsdons, Montgomerys, Boyds,
                    Mattinglys, Deweeses, Hacklemans, Whittinghills, Langfords, Turnhams, Haskins,
                    Crooks, Kellams, Grigsbys, Cottons, Roberts, Romines, Taylors, Greathouses,
                    Carters, Lindseys, Huffs, Wilkinsons, Huffmans, Morgans, Veatchs, Pitchers,
                    Dorseys, Lucas, Parkers, Meeks, Gwaltneys and many others. But these I mention
                    especially as being men of public office, ministers, farmers, lawyers, doctors,
                    teachers, judges and business men with whom Lincoln would perhaps come in
                    contact in his own locality and also when he would come to the county seat at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                    </placeName> as he frequently did. These men were all the type that would be an
                    inspiration to a young boy and so their biographies are important to the
                    "Inquiry".</p>
            <p>My grandmother and mother were delightful conversationists and we children
                    interested listeners and so the stories of those pioneer days in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                    </placeName> were told and retold until we were all as familiar with the names
                    and lives of those early settlers as with our own.</p>
            <p>The settlement at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a subject of frequent discussion among the older people and no
                    doubt much of this reached Lincoln and he may have journeyed there to see and
                    hear for himself.</p>
            <p>In the State University library at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> are something like one hundred and fifty histories of Lincoln and
                    many others elsewhere, yet it was not until Mr. Iglehart started the
                    "Inquiry" in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pocket</region>
                    </placeName> counties, that any special thought or study was given to the lives
                    of those men who lived near the <pb n="6" id="VAA4025-021-1-012"/> Lincolns
                    during their residence in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName>. In these past four years, however, the following papers have been
                    written and inquiries made by those who are realizing the importance of the
                    work:</p>
            <p>1. "How Abe Saved the Farm", written by C. T. Baker, editor of
                    the <hi rend="i">Grandview Monitor,</hi> and published in that paper August 26,
                    1920.</p>
            <p>It is the personal recollection of Mrs. Mary J. Scott, whom I remember quite
                    well. She is a niece of Joe Richardson who was a clerk in the store of William
                    Jones of Gentryville where the Lincolns traded. Mrs. Scott said Thomas Lincoln
                    was not in favor of book learning and often hid or threw away the books with
                    which Abe "was foolin' away his time". He often found
                    fault with Abe for thus using time that he thought might have been better
                    employed at other things, but that one day he gave good evidence of the value of
                    his learning.</p>
            <p>One autumn Abe was cutting corn for a Mr. Carter at the wage of ten cents a day
                    and his employer and Thomas Lincoln bargained to transfer a portion of the
                    Lincoln farm. Carter wrote the deed and presented it to Lincoln for his
                    signature. Abe looked over the deed before his father affixed his signature and
                    said, "If you sign that deed, you have sold the farm". The
                    bargain was for a certain field and not the whole farm. Thomas Lincoln looked
                    Carter in the eye and said, "Somebody lied and 'taint
                    Abe". As was the custom in those days, a fist fight followed. After
                    this event Thomas Lincoln never found fault with Abe for reading books.</p>

            <p>I knew Rev. Bunner who died the past year at the age of ninety-two years. His

            <p>4. Paper by Helen Rhoades on "Life of James Gentry", written in

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>This paper relates the friendship of the Gentrys and Lincolns and mentions many
                    incidents in the life of Lincoln. It also records the history of the Gentry
                    family in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName>. The Gentrys no doubt had a great influence on Lincoln during his
                    boyhood days and the writer of this paper is a great granddaughter of James
                    Gentry.</p>
            <p>5. Copy of "Remarks of Honorable Charles Lieb in the House of

                    presented to me in 1920.</p>
            <p>These remarks include the dedication ceremonies held at the grave when the marker
                    at Sarah Lincoln Grigsby's grave was dedicated, a poem by Max Ehrman,
                    entitled "Sarah Lincoln", and a paper by Mrs. Nancy Grigsby
                    Inco, daughter of James Grigsby, and a paper by the late Captain J. W. Wartman
                    on "The Lincoln Family". In this paper Captain Wartman makes
                    the statement that Lincoln was no doubt influenced by the example and
                    conversation of his neighbor pioneers such as Turnham, Jones, Crawford, Gentrys,
                    Taylors and Grigsbys.</p>
            <p>6. Paper by Mrs. Alice Harper Hanby read before the Historical Society, January

            </p>
            <p>In Mrs. Hanby's paper she dwells on the thought that the fourteen years
                    Lincoln dwelt in Indiana determined his character and that he went forth to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> in 1830 almost if not entirely equipped mentally for the great
                    future that lay before him.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Hanby proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that Pitcher loaned Lincoln books.
                    She saw herself the two volumes of Blackstone in which Lincoln had written his
                    name.</p>
            <p>I quote the following from Mrs. Hanby's paper: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>However the present inquiry may end as to individual claims, it will
                            beyond doubt settle some very important questions. It will determine the
                            debt Lincoln owes his Hoosier environment and the world's debt
                            to those generous-hearted lenders of books in Indiana. Too it will
                            silence forever that cry of illiteracy which we hate and which we know
                            to be false.</p>

            <p>Having been a school teacher Mr. Armstrong wrote much on the early schools and of
                    Lincoln's schooling, what little he received. He made a pencil drawing
                    of the Lincoln home in the back of one of his books, which book is a cherished
                    possession of his children. He also published a vivid word picture of
                    Lincoln's mother, the color of her eyes and hair, complexion and
                    general appearance.</p>
            <p>In his first published history of the Lincolns he states that the first teachers,
                    who "boarded round" and taught Abe, said he could read well at
                    the age of eight years.</p>
            <p>I knew Mr. Armstrong and remember well his interesting personality and
                    conversation. He was always deeply interested in all Lincoln history and I have
                    in my possession a copy of a letter written February 18, 1901, a short time
                    before Mr. Armstrong's death, showing his interest in the Nancy Hanks
                    Memorial Association. The letter is written on stationery of the General
                    Assembly of the state of Indiana.<text>

                    mentioned elsewhere. Mr. de la Hunt quotes Mrs. Scott as saying, "If
                    more children of today were as ambitious for an education today as was Abraham

            <p>24. A paper on General W. Johnson by Mr. George Wilson and read before the
                    Southwestern Indiana Historical Society at its fifth annual meeting in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>

                        Magazine of History</hi>.</p>
            <p>This paper is one of the ablest papers ever delivered before our society and
                    belongs to the "Lincoln Inquiry", because it deals with the
                    question of slavery at the beginning of the state, a matter of vital interest to
                    the Lincolns, particularly Abraham. General Johnson was perhaps more generally
                    known than any other man who lived in southwestern Indiana from 1820 to 1830,
                    and so the Lincolns must have known a great deal about Johnson and could have
                    had access to General Johnson's report on the slavery question.</p>
            <p>25. "The Birth of a State", by George R. Wilson, read before
                    this society, January 31, 1922, and published in <hi rend="i">Bulletin No.
                    16</hi>.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilson says "If you wish a good historical vision of a city you must
                    know the history of the county; if you wish a good vision of a county, it is
                    well to have the vision of a state; and, if you wish a knowledge of a state it
                    is well to know the history of a nation and so on". I think this is
                    necessary when we study the history of a man and so the "Lincoln
                    Inquiry" is concerned with "The Birth of a State".</p>
            <p>26. George Wilson's article on Judge James Lockhart, written for the
                    Southwestern Historical Society and published by the Indiana State Historical
                    Society, <hi rend="i">Publication 8, No. 1,</hi> deals with the early period of
                    Indiana a little after the Lincolns left, but should belong to the
                    "Inquiry".</p>
            <p>27. Another paper by Mr. George Wilson which should be included in this list is
                    one on George H. Proffitt and which was published in the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Magazine of History.</hi> This is a history of Proffitt's life in
                    the thirties after Lincoln left Indiana, but it deals to some extent with that
                    period.</p>
            <p>28. Paper by Mrs. Samuel Orr on the Casselberry family and read before this
                    society, February 12, 1924, and published in the <hi rend="i">Bulletin</hi> of
                    that date.</p>
            <p>This paper shows that one of the large prominent families of the early period
                    lived both on the east and west of Abraham <pb n="13" id="VAA4025-021-1-019"/>

            </p>
            <p>Judge William Prince filled a large place in southern Indiana history and had so
                    much to do in public affairs that the Lincolns undoubtedly came under his
                    influence.</p>
            <p>31. A paper on "Materia Medica of Pioneer Indiana", by Mrs. H.
                    C. Knapp, and read before the society, June 10, 1924, might be linked with the
                    "Lincoln Inquiry" because a part of the life of every
                    community in pioneer days was the pioneer doctor.</p>

               </hi> is a chapter devoted to the Lincolns and although this
                    history was written in 1916, four years before the Southwestern was founded, I
                    feel that this should belong to the Southwestern as Mr. de la Hunt has given us
                    much pioneer history.</p>

                    throw a searchlight for three and one-half years in the early twenties nowhere

                    </placeName> and was doing law business generally in the district. There is
                    independent testimony settled beyond controversy that Lincoln used to go once a
                    year to Evans at <placeName>

                    </placeName> to have his wool carded. So you have Lincoln in touch with the
                    Evans family, one of the leading families in southern Indiana, the family which
                    gave <placeName>

                    with whom he transacted business was a brother to Robert M. Evans, who was a

                    the Southwestern up to that time and especially that of the "Lincoln

                        <p>The purpose of the "Lincoln Inquiry" is to collect from
                            many new sources information concerning Lincoln from 1816 to 1830. Mr.
                            Iglehart considers it "one of the chief assets of the
                            Society". If it is carried on with the energy which has
                            characterized the other work of the society, it also will be one of the

            <p>This newspaper article brought a letter of inquiry to Mr. Iglehart from Senator
                    Beveridge who is engaged in writing a history of Lincoln. Senator Beveridge
                    expressed a deep interest in the work of the Southwestern and desires to become
                    more intimately acquainted with it.</p>

            <p>Miss Ida Tarbell wrote Mr. Iglehart in 1922 in which she sought to obtain
                    information concerning Lincoln for her newest work In the Footseps of the
                    Lincolns, not then issued.</p>
            <p>In later correspondence Miss Tarbell states: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I do not believe that Lincoln can be understood without understanding
                            better than I do, at least, Southwestern Indiana. What that country was,
                            what its people thought and did, had, I am convinced, a deep influence
                            on the young Lincoln.</p>

            <p>On retiring from the office of president, refusing to stand for re-election,
                    after which he was chosen president emeritus, Mr. Iglehart in his address stated
                    as definitely as the subject permitted, the sources of evidence and inquiry in
                    original research, open to investigators in pursuing the Lincoln Inquiry, in
                    which field he seemed to think there was ample evidence to justify the
                    conclusions at which he had arrived. On account of absence of historical record,
                    this is largely circumstantial evidence furnished from many well established
                    facts, making clear the opportunities which Lincoln had, and if he had them
                    there is no doubt that he availed himself of them.</p>
            <p>Being unable, as Mr. Iglehart stated, on account of time required in the work and
                    his advanced age, to follow this inquiry in the future, as he had sought to aid
                    in doing through the channels of this society work in the past, he submitted a
                    summary of the sources of information in such research, relating largely to the
                    opportunities of Lincoln while he lived in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Of the first importance on this subject, he quoted the statement of Leonard
                    Swett, that Lincoln said to him that he had read through every book he had ever
                    heard of in that country for a circuit of fifty miles from the farm upon which
                    he lived. The limit of this radius included <placeName>

                    Company) lived, and were men of much influence (David Hart, an able man, one of
                    such descendants, was judge of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> circuit court in 1818), and Mr. Iglehart evidently thinks it
                    probable that the Lincolns knew very well the story of the Hart brothers and of
                    Richard Henderson &amp; Company, so important in the first settlement of <placeName>

                    </placeName> where Abraham Lincoln was born and where Thomas Lincoln lived till
                    he moved to Indiana.</p>
            <p>After summarizing many sources of information, too numerous to be mentioned here,
                    which should be investigated in our future work, and through which opportunities
                    were then open to a man of Abraham Lincoln's ability and habits of
                    inquiry, and showing in that address, as well as in other of his published
                    papers and addresses (with reference to reliable historical authority) the means
                    of reasonably easy communication for those days, both north and south, and east
                    and west, in southwestern Indiana, particularly the eight counties embraced
                    within the territory of this society, which were then embraced in a single
                    congressional and judicial district, Mr. Iglehart gave his conclusions as to the
                    opportunities of Lincoln within the radius of fifty miles mentioned. That
                    conclusion was that Lincoln had availed himself of all the opportunities
                    existing in pioneer life in this section when he lived in Indiana, and that
                    Lincoln knew many of the people who lived within a reasonable distance of his
                    home, which for that time might reasonably be considered a distance of fifty
                    miles, and that he knew about all worth knowing of them, and that in 1830
                    Abraham Lincoln knew pretty well all that was worth knowing in his locality, and
                    within that radius, which could be learned by reading the papers, intelligent
                    inquiry, and personal acquaintance with the better class of people whose history
                    has not (with honorable exceptions) been properly recorded up to the time of the
                    organization of this society.</p>
            <p>He further said that he believes that his conclusion is the correct explanation
                    of the equipment of the man Lincoln, as he is found in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> in 1830 and later, and that such an interpretation would furnish
                    the method of solving the problem <pb n="17" id="VAA4025-021-1-023"/> underlying
                    "The Lincoln Inquiry", none other having been furnished by the
                    historians.</p>
            <p>This now, as nearly as I am able to tell, completes the work done on the
                    "Lincoln Inquiry" up to the present time, by the Southwestern
                    Indiana Historical Society. I feel that this material being collected is going
                    to be of greatfuture worth.</p>
            <p>All that has been done along this line is due to the energy and perseverance of
                    John E. Iglehart and this is but a beginning in a great work, and what more the
                    next four years will bring I am not prepared to state, but Mr. Iglehart has
                    begun the investigation that will no doubt grow in importance with each year.</p>
            <p>Gathered here near Lincoln's mother's grave, let us today pay
                    tribute to the woman who gave to the world the mightiest man America has
                    produced.</p>

            <p>The drive was then made to Parish Grove where John Robertson and wife and a few
                    others are buried. Here also the old <placeName>

                    giving an interesting talk on the life of Mr. Robertson and his son Henry, also
                    one of the outstanding figures in early <placeName>

                    place a suitable marker at the resting place of their former brother.</p>
            <p>On the western slopes of Parish Grove were held the first camp meetings in the
                    county. Here in the days before the war, the Methodists drew large crowds most
                    of the people going miles to and from the meetings on horseback with their
                    children mounted behind them. A circuit rider by the name of McMullen, stirred
                    the people to the highest pitch by his eloquence.</p>
            <p>At Sugar Grove, the home of the late Edward Sumner, Mr. Barce gave an interesting
                    talk on Mr. Sumner and the "Indian Float"—the
                    section of land given to Topenebee, the great Pottawatomie war chief, at the
                    treaty of the <geogName>Tippecanoe</geogName> in 1832. Topenebee traded this
                    section to Alexander Coquillard, the founder of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the maker of the Coquillard wagon, for wagons to the value of
                    $800. In the year 1835, Sumner bought this section of Coquillard and
                    made it his home. Around it he added to his possessions until he owned 35,000
                    acres. His monument, which cost $25,000, was visited on the journey
                    home.</p>
            <p>Beautiful Blue Ridge, bright in the dews of the morning, was passed on the way to
                    Earl Park, where, in the Presbyterian church, a wet and hungry bunch of
                    enthusiasts did justice to a fine dinner taken by the travelers and added to by
                    several of the good ladies of Earl Park.</p>

            <p>Man has been strangely moulded by this thing called conscience. It has driven him
                    in winter through stormy seas to bleak and barren wastes. It has made him face
                    the savage and endure the pangs of cold and hunger. John Robertson in 1834 was a
                    man 53 years of age. He had sturdy sons at his side and he loved liberty. Those

                    liberty. Slaves could not breathe there nor bondmen suffer from the
                    master's lash. To this land of promise he would send his sons to found

                    venison. They passed the forks of the White, emerged at last upon the banks of
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

            <p>Henry, the leader, was twenty-one years of age, tall, raw-boned,
                    sinewy—a fine specimen of the hardy and fearless pioneer of that day.
                    About his waist was buckled a leathern belt and in this belt he carried his
                    father's wealth and his own. To view this Canaan, to raise a cabin and
                    plant a field, to return in the fall and bring on his father's flocks
                    and herds—these were the tasks set to his brave and willing hands.</p>
            <p>Let us for a moment indulge in pleasing fancy. As these youths advanced on their
                    great adventure they entered upon the famous path of the Kickapoo and the
                        Potawatomi<hi rend="sup">2</hi> that wound o'er hill and dale to
                    the banks of the Pine and its western fork—that passed on to the
                    prairies and to the grove of Parish—that passed to Sugar and to the
                    river of the Iroquois—that swept by the land of the mink and the
                    beaver and crossed the Kankakee—a path that joined the trading posts
                    of the French on the river <geogName>Wabash</geogName> with the lakes of the
                    north. Over this pathway the Jesuits had traveled—the feet of red men
                    for century upon century. Marks of that old trail live today near
                    Reinsville—the traces we will show you plainly through this very
                    grove. Over that trail, after the Prophet's fall, the white man passed
                    with his covered wagon, the "prairie schooner". He halted in
                    these pleasant woodlands when night came on and listened to the hoot of the owl
                    and call of the whipporwill. He saw on the hills to the west the graves of the
                    Miamis where their saddened warriors came to dance. He watered his horses at the
                    pleasant springs and cooked his meals in these cooling shades. With the morning,
                    he and his children, his dogs and his oxen, passed on through the prairies to
                    the great Northwest. Thus were the hills of <placeName>

                    by a narrow strip of foliage on either side. If you could have ridden the paths
                    here with Henry and Samuel Robertson in the month of June, 1834, you would have
                    seen from right to left, at your very feet and leagues beyond, a rolling sea of
                    grass filled with flowers and blossoms. To relieve the eye, and add a pleasing
                    variation to these grassy stretches, little groves nestled here and there on the
                    bosom of the prairie, that on a bright summer morning, resembled islands of blue
                    in a sea of green.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> To enter these groves, filled with the
                    songs of the thrush and gay with the blossoms of the crab-apple and the wild

                    listen to the chatter of numberless birds and the caw of the great black crows
                    that nested and raised their young there, to climb into the tallest hickory or
                    walnut and catch glimpses of the prairie through the vistas of the woods, was to
                    realize the pure joy of living. An old man who saw these green savannas in 1852,
                    once told me: "It's almost the same today as when it first
                    came from the hands of God". To us, it is a garden beautiful, basking
                    in the sunlight of abundance and plenty, the glorious ripening and harvest of
                    years of peace.</p>
            <p>Henry Robertson was an invaluable man in a new country and there was plenty of
                    work for a strong man to do. Though a youth, he easily stood at the head of his
                    father's family. He possessed, moreover, some degree of learning, and
                    was accustomed, like many of the early Virginians and Kentuckians, to use the
                    instruments of the land surveyor. Stowed away in the attic of his old home, we
                    found the tripod and compass with which in the early 40's he marked out
                    the limits of the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the first county seat, and later, the old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> road, that connected these prairies with the early navigation of

                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                    of this county. Robertson, carrying compass and tripod on horesback, laid out
                    and divided a major portion of the Ellsworth estate, and <list type="footnotes">

                    bridges. All his lines and corners were established with accuracy, and he became
                    an authority on landmarks and monuments.</p>
            <p>Henry Robertson had the vision to see here, in 1834, what Edward C. Sumner and
                    Moses Fowler saw in later years—the beginning of a new empire. He was
                    wise enough to discern that the sway of the redskin had passed away; that some
                    day this raw prairie would be filled with fields and pleasant homes. He lived to
                    see the day of fulfillment. Six years after his coming to Parish Grove, the
                    legislature of Indiana, began to open and survey roads across the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and into the prairies beyond; cabins appeared here and there along
                    the streams where wood and water were plentiful, and a few years later came the
                    marking out of villages, the building of pioneer schools and the institution of
                    courts of justice. In all these dramatic events the youthful kentuckian played a
                    leading role. His knowledge of books and land surveying, his commanding presence
                    and keen common sense, gave him instant leadership. In a rough country, and
                    among rough men he was an inspiration during his lifetime. He was a man of few
                    words, but he loved enlightenment, law and order. He became in turn school
                    master, surveyor, organizing sheriff of the county, and county commissioner
                    after the organization. Out of a wilderness and the wild grass, came schools and
                    churches, courts and railroads.</p>
            <p>Robertson early conceived the idea of making his home of Parish Grove the center
                    of a new county. To the south lay the hills of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>; to the north, the watershed between the Iroquois and Sugar creek;
                    to the east, the stream of Big Pine. Within these limits lay an almost unbroken
                    prairie; a part of the vast plain of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. To separate this tract from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jasper county</region>
                    </placeName>, of which it was then a part; to establish a separate jurisdiction
                    with courts and schools of its own, became with him a fixed idea. It is certain
                    that in the spring of the year 1838, a session of the board of commissioners of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jasper county</region>
                    </placeName> was held at Parish Grove. The members of this board were Amos
                    White, Joseph Smith and Frederick Conoyer. What occurred at this session is thus
                    related by Duncan McArthur Williams, an early editor of this county, <pb n="24" id="VAA4025-021-1-030"/> who received the account first hand from Henry
                    Robertson himself: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>About this time he (Henry Robertson) conceived the idea of organizing the
                            three southern tiers of townships into a new county. He said to the
                            commissioners at one of their meetings that he had a request to make of
                            them before their adjournment; consequently, at the conclusion of their
                            session they called him in and inquired what he wanted; taking a paper
                            from his pocket, he said he had prepared a petition which he desired
                            they should sign, praying for the organization of a new county
                            consisting of our present limits. They freely accorded his request. A
                            few days thereafter he started for <placeName>

                            </placeName> with his petition, the legislature being in session. His
                            petition met with the general approval of the legislators. He stayed at
                            the capitol until his petition was enacted into law and came home with a
                            certified copy of the law authorizing the organization of <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                            </placeName>, and himself commissioned its first sheriff. We might with

                    We also know that he was enthusiastically received by Governor Wallace who
                    helped him in the accomplishment of his task. The fact remains, however, that he
                    did not actually secure an act of the legislature until the 18th day of

                    4th day of November, 1840, and thus it was that by perseverance and courage
                    Robertson brought forth the first forms of orderly government in a new land.</p>

                    Coming here in the first flush of manhood, after a long and perilous journey, we
                    find him when less than thirty years of age, taking the lead in the organization
                    of a new county, in the establishment of schools and courts of law, in the
                    laying out and building of new highways, and in fact in the establishment of all
                    those institutions and instrumentalities that make for civilization, and the
                    betterment of the community. Throughout his long career there was nothing of
                    ostentation or show. Men remembered him as a silent force, standing on the side
                    of law and order, decency and decorum. At the time of his death he owned broad
                    acres and flocks and herds. Nature was generous to a generous man, who had
                    helped many a poor settler with willing hand.</p>
            <p>He is buried today in the cemetery at Boswell, with whose early history he was
                    closely identified. At a beautiful spot in the old grove and near the old
                    homestead, he buried the father and mother that he had brought forward from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> in 1835. That is where we stand today. At the four corners of this
                    sacred spot he planted four evergreens and encircled the whole space with a
                    secure fence. No man of his race or blood now lives in this county, but his name
                    and fame should be held in reverence by us who enjoy the fruits of his labor.</p>
            <p>A beautiful story has come down to us about this grove, which we think worthy of
                    repetition at these humble gravesides. In the days before the Civil war great
                    revivals of the Methodists were held at Parish Grove. Men and women rode to the
                    meeting place on horseback, often mounting their children behind them. It is
                    related that to one of these meetings came the mother of Lee Templeton. She rode
                    from the hills of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren county</region>
                    </placeName> and little Lee was in the saddle with her. Great and earnest souls
                    attended these gatherings and amid the inspiring scenes of the wilderness the
                    tide of devotion rolled high.</p>
            <p>One bright morning in June an eloquent orator by the name of MacMullen addressed
                    a multitude assembled on the hillside west of the grove. As far as the range of
                    vision extended the waving grass was filled with the blossoms of the
                    sweet-william <pb n="26" id="VAA4025-021-1-032"/> and the gentle zephyrs of the
                    morning wafted the fragrance far and near. MacMullen became inspired and
                    pointing to the flowering plains and beautiful grove, declared that they alone
                    were proof enough of the greatness and the goodness of the Creator; that God
                    Himself was present in this His glorious creation and that His great hands had
                    moulded the woodlands and the prairies for the habitations of peace.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>My brothers, these boundless prairies were dedicated to the ways of freedom.
                        Amid such surroundings there can be no slaves; there can be no masters. If
                        that our forefathers wrote with fearless pen that neither slavery nor
                        involuntary servitude should ever exist here, they obeyed but the voice and
                        heeded but the behest of Almighty God. We stand today by the graves of the
                        redmen. Savage though they were; roaming these plains in all the wild
                        abandon of their naked out-door existence, they loved the open air and the
                        unrestrained freedom of woodland and prairie. Warrior and sachem have passed
                        away. A stronger and a sturdier race have seized their heritage. The day
                        fast approaches when all these plains will be filled with the homes and with
                        the buzz of industry of a new people. Still, the council fires of liberty,
                        kindled from of old, shall burn on. Strong men will abide here, who will
                        hate oppression and despise tyranny. And their sons, with the sunlight of
                        the prairies and the sunlight of freedom shining in their faces, will
                        shoulder the musket and buckle on the sword to put down forever the curse of
                        slavery.</p>

            <p>In northwestern Indiana lies a gently undulating plain, which, except for a few
                    scattered groves, is almost devoid of timber. This plain forms the eastern edge
                    of the Grand <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> which forms the corn belt of the middle west. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, lies wholly within this belt.</p>
            <p>It is not our purpose to attempt a description of this region in its primeval
                    state, as there are many people living today who knew it in its early beauty,
                    and knew it better than we can describe it from information obtained from
                    others; but, for a vivid, forceful, and somewhat poetical description of this
                    interesting region, allow us to refer you to <hi rend="i">The Land of the
                        Potawatomi</hi> by Elmore Barce. Suffice it to say that, even at that time,
                    it was capable of supporting a considerable population; that then as well as now
                    its products were abundant; but, that its products were of a kind to delight the
                    heart of primitive man, rather than to furnish the needs and luxuries of more
                    enlightened people. Its vast stretches teemed with game; its rivers abounded
                    with fish; while its swamps and lakes harbored many fur-bearing animals.</p>
            <p>It is interesting, and in the light of later events somewhat consoling, to know
                    that the first white men who visited the early inhabitants of this region, were
                    not actuated wholly by selfish interests, but sought to bring to this savage
                    race a knowledge of the uplifting influence of the story of the Christ.</p>
            <p>Later came the trader to barter with the red man, and sad to relate, to introduce
                    some of the demoralizing influences of so-called civilization which did so much
                    toward his extermination; but finally, there came a class of men with keener
                    vision, a broader view, and the ability to realize the great advantages of a
                    development of the vast possibility and resources of the country.</p>
            <p>At this present time, when our agricultural advisers are urging the corn-belt
                    farmer to give more attention to the <pb n="28" id="VAA4025-021-1-034"/> raising
                    of live stock, it may not be inappropriate to hark back to the time when live
                    stock, or cattle raising, was the only extensive industry within the boundary of
                    what is now <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>

            <p>The first cattle men of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                    </placeName> were those who, instead of moving into the country to establish a
                    home, wouid collect a herd of cattle, drive them to the prairie for pasture
                    during the summer, then drive them east to market in the fall.</p>
            <p>It would be folly to attempt a complete history of this movement, or to give a
                    full list of the names of men thus engaged, but to allow a single instance to
                    suffice: As early as 1824 (J. W. Whickcar: May I ask a question here,
                    isn't 1824 too early? Mr. Geary: That is the date given me, and taken
                    from the history of the Atkinson family. Mr. Whickcar: I am certain that Mr.
                    Atkinson was herding cattle in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                    </placeName> before 1832, but I am of the opinion that that date should be 1829.
                    Mr. Burch: I too would favor the date of 1829, thinking 1824 too early. Mr.
                    Geary: I have copied this from the family history.) Mr. Thomas Atkinson, a lad
                    of eighteen, was herding on these plains a drove of cattle belonging to his
                    brother. For his services he received the princely sum of $7.00 per
                    month. In the fall he drove the herd east to Pennsylvania, receiving for the
                    service the equivalent of one-half month's pay, or $3.50.
                    Mr. Atkinson said later: "I walked that entire five hundred miles for
                    three dollars and fifty cents." Mr. Atkinson's range of
                    territory that summer extended from the present site of Pine Village north to
                        <geogName>Beaver Lake</geogName>, in what is now <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Newton county</region>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Atkinson being of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> descent and belief, easily made friends of the Indians, and they in
                    turn, to show their appreciation of his friendship, would exercise great care
                    when near his herd, not to cause a stampede of his cattle. Mr. Atkinson returned
                    in 1848 to the scenes of his early experience, settling in the southern part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                    </placeName>, where, by industry, frugality and perseverance he acquired a tract
                    of land in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> counties, consisting of about 1300 acres. Here he again engaged in
                    the cattle industry, buying and selling. He <pb n="29" id="VAA4025-021-1-035"/>
                    also took his place as a citizen, doing his part in any public service necessary
                    to the welfare of the community in which he lived; he was one of the early
                    county commissioners of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                    </placeName>, and at one time represented <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> counties in the state legislature. His descendants, many of whom
                    live in the county, are highly respectable, honest, useful citizens.</p>
            <p>Among the many men, who, like Mr. Atkinson, bought, fed and sold cattle by the
                    hundreds and thousands were: The Boswells, in the southwest part of the county,
                    including Parish's Grove; the Templetons and Stembels in the south, the
                    Jennings in the southwest, Eastburn and Sheetz in the east and northeast. This
                    leaves the west and northwest part of the county to the man, who in his day was
                    probably the cattle king of that part of Indiana lying west of the
                        <geogName>Wabash river</geogName>, Edward C. Sumner.</p>
            <p>It may seem somewhat presumptuous in the writer to attempt a sketch of this man
                    whom he never knew, in this locality where yet live many who knew him well, and
                    where many of his descendants yet survive.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sumner was of mixed Yankee and Irish descent, born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> in 1811, in manhood he came west with the tide of emigration,
                    settling in Indiana on the section known as "The Indian
                    Float". This he bought from the Indian Chief Topenebee and to this he
                    added from time to time, until at his death he was the owner of some twenty
                    thousand acres of some of the best land lying in Indiana and also 16,000 acres
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>He built his residence in the edge of what came to be known as Sumner's
                    Grove, or Sugar Grove; this being on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> road became virtually an inn where travelers from either direction
                    were wont to stop and be entertained. His door was always open and his house
                    usually full.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sumner's herds frequently numbered into the thousands, and the need
                    of grain to feed these cattle through the winters started the development of
                    agriculture in the county which in a few years almost supplanted the cattle
                    industry. Mr. Sumner was a dominant figure in the community in which <pb n="30" id="VAA4025-021-1-036"/> he lived, virtually a king on his own ranch, and
                    became a very familiar and prominent character around the stock yards at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the cattle markets of the east.</p>
            <p>To quote from Barce's <hi rend="i">Land of the Potawatomi</hi>: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It follows naturally, that the building up of this immense business
                            finally attracted the attention of the outside world. The great cattle
                            men of that day collected about them a group of small-grain farmers who
                            furnished the winter's feed. These farmers in turn developed
                            the wonderful soil, learned its great value in the production of
                            cereals, drained it, and finally turned the prairie into the paradise of
                            farms of the present day.</p>

                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                    </placeName>. His father, Joseph Heath, came to <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> counties in 1859; that is, his house was in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren county</region>
                    </placeName> and his stable in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName>. The elder Heath bought cattle wherever he could get them, feeding
                    them in the wood-lots and around stacks built for their protection. He usually
                    had about one thousand cattle in his herd.</p>
            <p>At the death of Joseph Heath his mantle fell on his son, David, who continued the
                    business, but not on quite so large a scale; yet he frequently tops the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> market. Only a few years ago he fed 500 cattle at one time.</p>
            <p>Mr. William S. VanNatta, late of Fowler, Indiana, was like the other cattlemen of
                    the county, a buyer, feeder, and shipper of cattle during and immediately
                    following the Civil war. In partnership with the Fowlers he bought and shipped
                    cattle by the train-load for the government. Later, conceiving the idea of
                    improving the grade of cattle in the country, he engaged in the breeding of
                    registered Hereford cattle. He was led to a selection of this breed by noticing
                    that wherever he found a white-faced steer in a bunch of cattle, it was always
                    in better condition than the others, showing that it was a better rustler, or
                    that this breed would make better gains on the same feed than would other
                    breeds.</p>
            <p>Securing a few imported animals as a foundation for a herd, he systematically
                    began to build up a business that soon became beneficial to the country at large
                    and profitable to <pb n="31" id="VAA4025-021-1-037"/> himself. His herd became
                    famous and carried off many honors at the county fairs, different state fairs
                    and at the Fat Stock show in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After handling for several years cattle from the plains of the
                    west, even some of the famous long-horns of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, Mr. VanNatta conferred a signal favor on his fellowman by shipping
                    many car-loads of thorough-bred Herefords back to the west for breeding
                    purposes, thus guaranteeing a better grade of meat supply for the nation.</p>
            <p>Being desirous of producing a hardier animal that could better withstand the
                    rigors of winter on the western plain, Mr. VanNatta and a friend of his in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> conceived the idea of crossing the buffalo with the Hereford. The
                    get was a peculiar animal, having the white face and head of the Hereford, but
                    the shoulders and body of the buffalo. The hair was long like that of the
                    buffalo, but straight like that of the Hereford, while the color was a shade
                    between the two. There are many people yet living who have seen several of these
                    animals, which they called the Cattleo, running with Mr. VanNatta's
                    herd. Finding the breeding of this animal both impracticable and unprofitable,
                    the scheme was abandoned.</p>
            <p>Mr. VanNatta was largely instrumental in organizing the American Hereford
                    Breeders association, was its first president, and continued an active and
                    influential member until the time of his death. The <hi rend="i">Breeders
                        Gazette</hi> of June 7, 1911, contains an article of appreciation of the
                    life and services of Mr. Van Natta, and I am sure you will pardon me for quoting
                    from it, as the writer says the things I want to say in a much better way than I
                    can.</p>

                    <p>William S. VanNatta was nothing if not practical; and yet in the production
                        of those marvels of symmetry with which he so often marched triumphantly
                        through American showyards there was a depth of pleasure, a well of
                        satisfaction, a consciousness of the exercise of genuine creative power ever
                        present; something above and far removed from mere comfort growing out of
                        the monetary value of the animals themselves.</p>
                    <p>He who finds joy in the production of a perfect specimen of the animal
                        kingdom, is brother to all the other artists since the world began.</p>

                        bull Fowler, he was exercising mental faculties such as were demanded of Sir
                        Christopher Wren in designing <placeName>

                    <p>In a proper way he had full faith in his own judgments and did not hesitate
                        to follow them; and yet there was no trace of bigotry in his make-up.</p>
                    <p>This is fully shown by the freedom with which in later years he acknowledged
                        the high merit of the great rival breeds of cattle.</p>
                    <p>He was ever acceptable as a judge even where champions from competing camps
                        were locked in combat.</p>
                    <p>He loved good cattle, however bred.</p>

            <p>In making a survey of the homes of the pioneers of our community as a rule our
                    thoughts revert to the John Hay home and the old DePauw homestead so recently
                    lost to us, an interesting landmark. And again our thoughts revert to the old
                    Academy of the Morrison and May schools and to the Eikosi Academy of the
                    May's, as representatives of the early educational interests of our
                    community. But if we take a closer survey we will find many homes of historic
                    note worthy of our study.</p>

            <p>Two places well worth our interest which we will consider first, were the two
                    taverns and halls connected with these buildings. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> Hall was located on the lot where the sheriff's residence
                    and the jail are now located. William Baird was the landlord or proprietor and a
                    very quaint and business-like announcement of his house is found in the Western
                    Annotator for December which reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            the best kind to a!) who may feel disposed to patronize him. He pledges
                            himself that no exertion shall be wanting to render general satisfaction
                            and on accommodating terms. He feels under obligations for the very
                            liberal patronage he has received for the last 12 months. It is well
                            known to those who have travelled much that accommodations are in
                            proportion to the business. Patronage gives encouragement and life to
                            every kind of business. Travellers will be furnished with waybills.</p>

            <p>Union Hall was located on the southeast corner of the public square. It was built
                    and occupied as a hotel by Andrew Weir, a pioneer tanner. Later it was run by a
                    Mrs. Hoge and daughters, Jane Howland and Polly Kelso. In later years it was
                    managed successfully by J. F. Persise, Jessie Hungate, Thomas Williams and
                    others.</p>
            <p>Many important and interesting meetings were held in Union Hall. It was the
                    social center of the community. The first cooking stove in the county was
                    installed by Andrew Weir in his tavern in 1834.</p>
            <p>Mr. Weir recognized the value of advertisement as shown in the Western Annotator
                    for December, 1829, J. Allen, editor, as to the merits of entertainment assured
                    to his patrons. The advertisement reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Mention of the old Dawson Lyon home on Water street brings to mind a picture of
                    the long, low, rambling type of house with its porches and porticoes. It was
                    most attractive <pb n="35" id="VAA4025-021-1-041"/> in appearance in the setting
                    of spacious grounds, a beautiful yard with evergreens and shrubbery and flowers,
                    a fine garden and all the comforts and conveniences of the times. While the old
                    house and all of its surroundings have ceased to be, the spot is deeply
                    interesting to the community because of the educational purposes for which it is
                    now used. This also is due to the liberality of the Lyon family who gave the old
                    home as a site for the present high school building.</p>

            <p>Many of the homes were located on the public square. The home of Eli Malott was
                    located on the lot where the Farmers Bank and the Etzler Undertaking
                    establishment now stand. This residence was a brick, two story structure with a
                    basement. He had a place of business where the Boggs store is now located. The
                    building between this and the residence was at an early date occupied by Foster
                    Nixon as a residence and a business place. This was also at one time the home of
                    Jeremiah Nowland, who had the distinction of planning or designing the rooster
                    that adorned the top of the old courthouse for so many years.</p>

            <p>The house on the southwest corner used now as a creamery was a frame building and
                    was originally the home of one William Carter, a Virginian who had met reverses
                    in his native state and came to <placeName>

                    all who knew him, possessed of a peculiar charm of manner which attracted on all
                    occasions. He was county clerk from 1827 to 1838. The frame building gave way to
                    a commodious brick building erected and occupied by Dr. James B. Wilson and in
                    later years it was known as the Lewis Casper home and also the Dr. J. R. Bare

                    wife was Elizabeth Reyman, from a family prominent in the early days of the
                    town. These homes were substantial buildings with basements and large and
                    commodious rooms and well constructed. These have been remodeled and converted
                    into business houses with exception of the old Wilson house which was replaced

                    Starr". She lived a very secluded life and her great interest was in
                    the beautiful flower garden at the back of her lot. This old house was replaced
                    by the present building by B. T. Pace and Charles Mobley. It is now occupied by

                    administration of Andrew Johnson.</p>
            <p>The large lot next, between this property and the Presbyterian church, was a
                    vegetable and flower garden cared for by Mrs. Curry, after she became quite
                    aged. The garden was very beautiful and attractive. The home and office was the

                    The lot, which extended from the square to High street, was filled with
                    shrubbery and flowers. Mr. Harrison was never married and lived a very secluded
                    life. Outside of his activities in public life he devoted his time to his books
                    and painting. He was an accomplished artist.</p>

            <p>Dr. Simeon Lamb, one of the very earliest settlers, and the first practicing

                    </placeName> on lot 83, where the E. D. Williams home now stands. It was built
                    about the year 1814 and was little more than a pole pen with doors cut out and
                    with no windows or chimney. Later this cabin was replaced by a good substantial
                    brick home which still remains as one of the substantial, attractive homes of
                    the town. The building was erected by Mark o'Neal, a business man
                    connected with the Coffin family. His wife was the daughter of James Coffin, son
                    of Matthew Coffin.</p>

            <p>On the lot on the corner of High and Market streets on which the Weir Memorial
                    church is located was the home and business house of Andrew Weir, a
                    cabinet' maker. Much of his fine furniture is still in the possession

            <p>Mr. Weir was active in the interests and advancements of the early life of the
                    town. In the modest little home was the birthplace of Merrill C. Weir, his son,
                    who became prominent in business and acquired a competent fortune, and as a
                    memorial to the lives and activities in the community of his parents, built and
                    presented to the Methodist congregation, the Weir Memorial church and parsonage

            <p>The Mrs. Ellen Paynter Davis home on East Market street, a large brick residence,

            <p>On South College avenue is the historical home which was erected for educational
                    purposes and known as the Grammar School, conducted by John I. Morrison, a
                    Pennsylvania boy of nineteen, and he here began his career as a teacher. The
                    modest little building soon became too small for this purpose. Dr. Charles Hay
                    married a sister of Evelyn Marie Leonard, the wife of John Farnham, and this
                    brick building became their home. This was the birthplace of John Hay, who
                    studied law in the office of Abraham Lincoln, and who later was one of
                    Lincoln's biographers.</p>

                    in McKinley's cabinet in 1898. As secretary of state, Mr. Hay gained a
                    standing equal to that of the most eminent men who have held that office.</p>
            <p>This home was surrounded by a large plat of ground with trees, mounds, shrubbery
                    and flower beds. As in early days, the house is in good condition with only a
                    few changes. The property in 1843 was purchased by George Telle, a tanner and
                    prominent business man, and has been in the family continuously since. The <placeName>

            <p>On South Main street stood for many years the home of Jonathan Lyon, the richest

                    characters, honorable and exact in all of their business relations and respected
                    by all. This early home was a large two-story house of logs with a double porch
                    running entirely across the front. Later it was destroyed by fire. The lot is

                    homes stand as an evidence of his good work. William Kemp was born February 17,

            <p>East of this home was the home of John Lemuel Menaugh. This was a large,

                    relative to his abduction by the Indians when he was a small boy. He was a
                    hatter by trade and was active in the political life of the county and held
                    offices both by election and by appointment. The old pioneer home was replaced
                    by a modern and more commodious home by the son, Eli W. Menaugh, who followed
                    the father in the activities of the community, and bore the honored record of a
                    Civil war veteran. This son married Miss Alice Kemp, daughter of William Kemp,

                    his public utterances along this line he was bitterly assailed and relentlessly
                    condemned. Nothing daunted him. He battled manfully for what he thought was
                    right against all opposition. It was acknowledged by every one that he was a man
                    of sterling ability. His wife was Eveleen Marie Leonard, sister of the wife of

            <p>Across the street from the Peck home is the site of the old DePauw place. This
                    was the home of John and Elizabeth Batiste DePauw, and the birthplace of W. C.

            <p>It was erected by John DePauw in the early 20's. It remained in the

                    family. It was a well built, two-story frame house, with very spacious grounds,
                    surrounded by trees and shrubbery. In the street fronting the house, was the old
                    block-house graveyard.</p>
            <p>It was destroyed, much to the regret of many, that lack of appreciation of the
                    possibilities of the old mansion, as an outstanding feature with its historical
                    setting, was not preserved for our community.</p>

            <p>The old home on North Main street known as the Dr. Warren Tucker home was built
                    by one Jonah G. Lucas, a blacksmith. An early citizen says that this house had

                    picket fence, all others stood on the sidewalk. It was built in a manner that
                    was common at that time, the ends being of brick and the front and back of logs
                    with weather-boarding which gave it the appearance of frame.</p>
            <p>Being strongly built the house is well preserved and the only change is a verenda

                    Their home was the center of culture and refinement. Mrs. Parke was an ideal

            <p>The two story frame house at the end of Water street, known in later years as the

            <p>On the west side of town stood the home of Benoni and Rebecca Trueblood Morris,
                    grandparents of Mr. Harvey Morris. The following description was given by a
                    granddaughter, Sarah Parke Morrison: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The main part of the house was built of brick and faced the east front
                            door in the middle, over which was the little latticed, vine-covered
                            portico of the period. The front door opened into a hall from which the
                            stairs ascended. The parlor was on the left of the hall down stairs and
                            on the right two rooms each one-half the size of the parlor. West of
                            this was the living room and beyond this the large kitchen with a large
                            pantry at the end. This part of the house was one story high. Along the
                            full length of this one story portion on the south, was a wide porch or
                            "piazza" upon which the hall in the front part, the
                            living room and kitchen opened and from which the cellar stairs
                            descended to the large cellar under the parlor and hall. There was a
                            fireplace in each one of the rooms, both below and above. The yard
                            around the house was inclosed by a picket fence, and east of the yard
                            was the vineyards and south was the spring lot in which the spring was
                            located. North of the house and barn was the large apple orchard, famous
                            for its fine spice apples much prized by the younger as well as the
                            other members of the family. There were also the tall, graceful lombardy
                            poplars, oaks and hickory trees, round topped maples, white mulberries
                            and the then almost universal balm-in-Gilead. The large barn erected by
                            Benoni was considered, and justly too, a wonderful specimen of the
                            builder's art and was then if not yet, the largest and most
                            commodious barn in this part of the country, and it, with the main
                            portion of the house, is still standing as a monument to the
                            thoroughness and care with which he did his work.</p>

            <p>Sarah Parke Morrison, a granddaughter of Benoni Morris was born at this home,
                    September 9, 1833. She had the distinction of being the first woman graduate of
                    Indiana University, helping to bring forward the idea of coeducation. She was a
                    well known temperance and suffrage worker and author of several books, mostly

            <p>Just south of this is the well preserved and attractive home which has been
                    graced with two prominent families which were closely connected. When it was
                    first built by Nixon Morris, son of Benoni, it was a one story frame house, but
                    when it became the home of John I. Morrison, an early educator and statesmen, it
                    was enlarged and remodeled by him into the attractive and imposing home that now
                    stands. John I. Morrison married Catherine Morris, daughter of Benoni Morris.
                    Later it was the home of Robert Morris and his wife, Ada Peck. Robert Morris was
                    the son of Benoni Morris. This home was ever noted for its culture and
                    hospitality. Just recently it passed into hands outside of the Morris family.</p>

            <p>About 1831, Marston G. Clarke disposed of his brick home on South Main street.
                    (In later years it was occupied by his daughter, Martha, and her husband, Wesley
                    Smith, who was an undertaker for many years.) He then retired to a farm east of
                    town and built a comfortable home on the site of the modern home of Thomas
                    Loudon which is known as Maple Shade, and here he spent the rest of his life. He
                    and his wife and children were buried on this farm. He was a master of the first
                    Masonic Lodge organized in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1815. His body was removed by the Masons to <geogName>Crown

            <p>Elisha Hobbs and his wife, Lydia Coffin Hobbs, came from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> to Indiana in 1814, and located on a farm <pb n="52" id="VAA4025-021-1-058"/> near the <geogName>Blue River</geogName> church.
                    They built a cabin of rough hewed logs just west of the site of the home of
                    Albert Thompson and with their four children lived here until, later and more
                    prosperous, they built near the Thompson home, a more pretentious home, a two
                    story log house and some years later built an annex to this. It was a two story
                    brick with a passage way between, as was the custom at that time, with a
                    stair-way running to the rooms above. One of the descendants, who was born here,
                    said he could not say whether "he was born in a log or a brick
                    house".</p>
            <p>Later the estate became the property of Dr. Seth Hobbs, a son of Elisha and Lydia
                    Hobbs, and in 1863, he built on the site of this home the present substantial
                    and comfortable home. For years on the west side of the house and farm was an
                    attractive grove. The Hobbs Grove was a great place for county and community
                    gatherings. The first Old Settlers' Day in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName>, was held Wednesday, September 29, 1875, in Hobbs' Grove.
                    This home was ever noted for its hospitality. The most noted guests and the
                    least hospitality shown was to the Morgan Raiders on July 10, 1863. A number,
                    taking advantage of the shade of the grove for rest on their hurried dash
                    through the country, called at the home and found it in the care of Mrs. Hobbs,
                    her eldest daughter and the youngest children of the family, (Dr. Hobbs and the
                    sons being away at other duties). Their call was brief much to the relief of the
                    Home Guards.</p>
            <p>This home and estate remained in the family of Elisha and Lydia Coffin Hobbs
                    until purchased by Mr. Thompson from Elisha M. C. Hobbs, a grandson of Elisha
                    and Lydia Hobbs.</p>

            <p>Matthew Coffin secured and entered a tract of land west of the Hobbs home. Here
                    he built a small but comfortable home, on a rather high location. It was
                    plastered on the outside which made it different from the other homes of that
                    time. It was a neat appearing and a well kept home. Mr. Coffin was a tanner and
                    established the first tannery, his tan-yard being connected with the farm. Later
                    this was the home <pb n="53" id="VAA4025-021-1-059"/> of George and Polly
                    Barnett, and here they reared a large family.</p>

                    Moody for $1,000 about 1814. The homestead was called
                        "<geogName>Cypress Hill</geogName>" because of a cypress
                    tree which was planted by the eldest daughter, who had brought the seed from <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The home was large, having a parlor and guest room on the west,
                    sitting room and two bedrooms, dining room, pantry and kitchen with other little
                    rooms on the north. It had a veranda running the whole length and a number of
                    bedrooms in the second story. It was usually painted white. There was a
                    beautiful view from the home. There were two fine springs at the foot of the
                    hill on which it was built. It was noted for its hospitality to friend and
                    stranger, rich and poor. It is still standing fairly well preserved and is still
                    an attractive old place. In later years it was the home of a son, Joseph
                    Trueblood and wife, Semira Lindley. Soon after the Civil war, W. C. DePauw
                    offered a fabulous sum for the farm.</p>

            <p>Next to this is the William B. Lindley home known as
                    "Glenwood." This historic old dwelling-house is one among the
                    few houses yet remaining in the county as a partial prototype of pioneer days.
                    The old home has been in the Lindley family for more than a century. The house
                    is somewhat remodeled but still retains much of the original pattern. Part of
                    the house is made of logs and was erected by the father of its present owner, W.
                    B. Lindley, about a hundred years ago, when the country was practically a
                    wilderness. At the time it was built, seven mammoth poplar trees stood within
                    one hundred feet of the house. Evidences of the primitive inhabitants of the
                    county—mound builders—are to be found on the farm. A mound
                    was dug into and examined many years ago by persons living in the neighborhood.
                    In it were found human bones in a decomposed state, fragments of pottery, flint
                    arrow heads, etc.</p>

                    house. It was a large, two story brick house, located well back from the road,
                    which ran in front. Between the house and the road was a fine, old apple
                    orchard. Afterwards a frame addition of two rooms was added at the north end.
                    Nearby, typical of the old <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-021-1-061"/> homes, was a

                    miles northeast of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> and one-half mile west of Canton. Time has effaced the original
                    home and a modern building has taken its place on the prominent and attractive
                    site of the early modest home, which in its construction was typical of the
                    well-to-do pioneer homes. Christian living predominated in this home.</p>
            <p>William Hobbs was a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> minister. He was earnest and zealous in his ministry, giving much
                    of his time to the services in the meetings at the various points. He did much
                    of his traveling on horseback.</p>
            <p>In 1829 occurred the division of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church and William Hobbs espoused the orthodox branch and services
                    were held in his home until the new <geogName>Blue River</geogName> meeting
                    house was built.</p>
            <p>William Hobbs was an ardent friend of peace and was one of the promoters and
                    officials of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> Peace society, which had its origin in the <geogName>Blue
                    River</geogName> Friends' church at a meeting held December 19, 1818.</p>
            <p>In this home occurred the birth of Barnabas C. Hobbs, October 4, 1815. He was the
                    youngest of eight children, five sisters and two brothers.</p>
            <p>In the teaching and preaching of the gospel, this son followed in his
                    father's footsteps and became a noted minister of <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-021-1-062"/> the society of Friends' church and
                    probably the greatest scholar en Biblical literature in any Friends'
                    church.</p>
            <p>In the decade of 1830, he became a pupil of John I. Morrison, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, having as classmates a number of associates that gained high
                    places on the roll of honor, in the various lines of their chosen work.</p>
            <p>In 1837–1838, Professor Hobbs was assistant principal of the
                        <geogName>Blue River</geogName> Friends' academy, and the following
                    year was made the principal. In 1866, he was appointed by Governor Morton to the
                    board of trustees of the new State Normal at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As a trustee of the State Normal school and the Rose Polytechnic
                    he contributed largely to their success. The same year he was elected first
                    president of Earlham college. Two years later he was elected to the office of
                    state superintendent of public instruction. Professor Hobbs was the first in
                    this country to give attention to the subject of graded public schools.</p>
            <p>In 1872 he made a geographical survey of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Parke county</region>
                    </placeName>, the county in which he resided. He was a strong advocate of higher
                    education for women and through his influence Bryn Mawr college was opened. For
                    some years he worked in the interest of the education of the Indians in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In 1869, the Friends of America were moved to send a message to Alexander of
                    Russia and another to William, Emperor of Germany. Professor Hobbs was chosen to
                    perform this mission. At St. Petersburg he presented to the prime minister a
                    memorial that the Mennonites of the Empire, a sect conscientiously opposed to
                    war, might be relieved from military service. At Berlin he presented to the
                    crown prince a memorial, which advocated the settling of all international
                    disputes by arbitration rather than war.</p>
            <p>These are some of the outstanding points in his life: "In all he was a
                    busy man, a fine scholar of unusual attainments, of strong integrity, a good
                    man".</p>
            <p>His death occurred at his home in Bloomingdale, Indiana, June 22, 1892.</p>

                    </placeName> and became identified with the Friends' community and the
                        <geogName>Blue River</geogName> church, in which the record shows the
                    certificate of church membership bearing the date of 1818, from Buttons Creek

                    </placeName>. They established a home north of Canton, on a farm that is now
                    known as the Stout-Tucker fruit farm.</p>
            <p>Three sons and three daughters constituted the family at the time of emigration.
                    John Parker Moore, the second son, born in 1810, and married to Martha
                    Cadwalander in 1829, had his first home in Canton and after the death of Joseph,
                    his father, he moved to the home farm. A portion of the original house still
                    remains and indicates the pioneer type of building. Here a large family of
                    refinement and culture was reared.</p>
            <p>Joseph Moore, a son born here, February 29, 1832, became a well known scholar and
                    educator in the Friends' church. He was second president of Earlham
                    college and held this position for a number of years. He established the college
                    museum which was his work. He is credited with the collection and arrangement of
                    the admirable cabinet.</p>
            <p>Ella Moore, a daughter of John P. Moore, cared for her invalid mother, Martha
                    Moore, for a number of years and after the death of the mother, she spent some
                    years in Japan, with a nephew, Rev. Frank Cosand, a missionary.</p>
            <p>Later another home was established on a high hill or bluff overlooking the
                    roadway, west of Canton, on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Canton highway. This was a two story house, on a romantic site
                    with the wooded hillside opposite and with the stream flowing through the
                    valley. There were numerous springs flowing from the hillsides, the most famous
                    known as Moore's spring, the best known to the public.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This was a home of early date established by Samuel King and his wife, Isabella,
                    on North High street, about the location known in later years as the Thomas
                    Beeman home and in still later years known as the Judge T. L. Collins place. It
                        <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-021-1-064"/> was a modest, comfortable, brick house,
                    built on the plan of many houses of that time, which replaced the early log
                    cabin. East and back of this lot was the site of the first Presbyterian church,
                    of which the King family were active in the organizing. And just south of this
                    was the old seminary.</p>
            <p>In 1833, the father died of cholera, leaving the widow and seven children. The
                    eldest son, A. W. King, then only 14, was his mother's chief support.</p>
            <p>This son was born in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe county</region>

                    </placeName>, August 21, 1825, but when he was 1 year old, his family moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. We quote from his own words: "I early learned to
                    work, alternated as chore boy at hotels, on the farm, in cotton and woolen
                    factory, blacksmith shop, tannery, printing office and store".</p>
            <p>Dr. King received his education largely in the school of Prof. John I. Morrison.
                    He was a teacher and taught in the schools of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and took a course in the Rush Medical college and became a
                    practicing physician. He owned a drug store and was local financial agent of

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Although engaged in so many occupations, Dr. King never lost
                    interest in his early home town. In 1893, he moved to Redlands, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, which has been his home since then.</p>

            <p>At one time there existed in the day of the first settlement of the Highland
                    neighborhood, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName>, three log buildings within a radius of three miles. Two of them
                    were built especially for school purposes and the third for church and school.
                    Each in its own way contributed to the later development of the county, state
                    and nation.</p>
            <p>First, in the order of the time of their construction was the Overman, sometimes
                    called the Marks, school. It was located on a bluff overlooking the
                        <geogName>Rush Creek valley</geogName>, on a corner of the Benjamin Overman
                    farm, in the N. E. quarter of the N. W. quarter, of section 26, town 3, range 3
                    east, and about one hundred yards south of the entrance to the Marks place, now
                    known as the Carl Watts farm on the Sparks Ferry road. One mile and a half south
                    of this school, the Friends built a church where several terms of school were
                    taught. The lot on which it was built was donated by Dr. Joshua Trueblood,
                    located in the N. E, quarter, of the S. W. quarter, of section 36, town 3, range
                    3 east. The farm is well known as the Anderson Morris farm on the road leading
                    to the church. Last, but not least, was the Naugle school. The house was located
                    on a corner of the Emanuel Naugle farm, on the Rush creek road leading south
                    from the Brooks schoolhouse, in the S. E. quarter of the N. E. quarter, of
                    section 2, town 3 north, range 3 east. The farm is now known as the John Baynes
                    farm.</p>
            <p>The patrons of these schools covered a wide range of territory; from
                    Rinker's creek and the western hills of Rush creek on the north, to the
                    head waters of Mill creek on the south, with Highland's creek for its
                    eastern boundary. On this watershed site was laid the foundation for a large
                    portion of the educational structure of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName>; a condition <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-021-1-067"/> that made Prof.
                    John I. Morrison (the Arnold of America) possible, and won for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> the high sounding title of "The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Athens</settlement>
                    </placeName> of the West". Our grandfathers laid well the solid
                    foundation, our fathers erected thereon the superstructure, and we of today and
                    the future days to come are and will be assessed for its maintenance and
                    continuation. This assessment will be the test of our mental equipment and moral
                    fiber.</p>
            <p>The question arises, whence came all these people with such a thirst for
                    knowledge? The answer is many of them were descendants of well educated families
                    who had moved from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and other <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> states to <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> to establish new homes, but later were compelled by the curse of
                    human slavery to flee to a new country and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, was their landing place. They settled here and helped to
                    make a fact the act of congress, that "The Northwest Territory shall be
                    free". Soon after the <geogName>Blue River</geogName> settlement was
                    founded where the first school was taught in the Friends church in 1817, another
                    Friends settlement was laid out on the boundary between the N. W. quarter and
                    the S. W. quarter of section 5, in Vernon township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, one-quarter of a mile north of the present location of
                    Smedley station and on the head waters of Twin creek, in 1819, called Mount
                    Pleasant. In the log church, erected that year, a school was started in 1824,
                    regular sessions were taught, both winter and summer. I find in a sketch written
                    by that learned professor, James G. May, the following list of some of the
                    teachers who taught that progressive pioneer school: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Jacob Mendenhall, Jesse Stanley and John Nixon. Anna Coffin was one of
                            the female teachers. Mount Pleasant had its literary society. For a time
                            this was full of life. Often the boys grew eloquent. They talked in
                            thrilling speech of Demosthenes and Cicero, Pitt and Emmet, Rittenhouse
                            and Otis. The active members of the society were Levi Knight, George
                            Knight, Samuel Coffin, Edom Cox, John Bush, John Nixon, James G. May,
                            Jesse Stanley, James Maudlin, that took part in the debate, the work of
                            this society began in 1825.</p>

                </p>
            <p>Prof. May was teaching his first school in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName> just across the line in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> township at that time. <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-021-1-068"/> It was
                    from this community that a number of the leading Friends and their families came
                    across to the head waters of Rush creek, settled and helped to found what was
                    afterward called Highland. Prof. May in the conclusion of his Mount Pleasant
                    sketch says: "The men of these families were reputed excellent
                    citizens". The families that came were: Elizabeth Coffin, widow of Levi
                    Coffin and her daughter Miss Mary Coffin, her son Samuel Coffin and family; her
                    son-in-laws, Benjamin Overman and family. Here they joined the following
                    Covenanter families; Matthew Marks, Jacob Banta, John Faris and others. The
                    Friends and the Covenanters were each equally austere in their manner of worship
                    and mode of living, but there was a great difference in their scripture beliefs.
                    Both, however, we are led to believe in the light of modern research, are of
                    Hebrew origin. Like Moses of old, they smote the rock, but unlike him they
                    fervently thanked the Lord for the stream of knowledge that burst forth, in
                    order that they might emerge from the wilderness. The blessings that were
                    bestowed upon them as a reward for their obedience and observance of the first
                    commandment have been handed down to the present generation. What a wonderful
                    inheritance we have! Spreading out in the passing of time like oil upon the
                    waters, its influence has in a measure been felt all over <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName> and far beyond is borders.</p>
            <p>The first entry of land, dated July 2, 1827, was made by Benjamin Overman in
                    section 26, town 3, range 3 east. Soon after his fathers-in-law, Levi Knight and
                    Samuel Coffin purchased a portion of his entry, one on the north and the other
                    on the south. Elias Davis and others came in later and these were then enough
                    families to constitute a school district. Accordingly about 1830 they built the
                    log school house. It was 20x24 with wide chimney and huge fireplace in the east
                    end. The roof was riven boards held on the rafters by weight-poles, the floor of
                    heavy slabs and there was a bottom door on wooden hinges in the west end of the
                    south side. It was lighted by three windows, two of them contained twelve 8x12
                    panes, they occupied the north side and west end respectively, <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-021-1-069"/> and the other a half window by the door. The rough
                    benches, innocent of backs, were slabs set on wooden pegs. There were no desks.
                    A sloping shelf also made of a slab, laid on wooden pins driven in the wall on
                    the north side under the window, served as a writing desk for the pupils. A
                    short shelf, with a bench beneath to sit on, was on the south side and must have
                    been for the schoolmaster. From this post of honor the masters reigned with the
                    rod of correction and taught the three R's. Some of them were very
                    severe, while others were very capable instructors. Some of the teachers were
                    Robert Loudon, Matthew Marks, William Neely, two terms, Dr. Thomas Tucker, whom
                    John Davis remembered as wearing a glossy black leather cap, Patty Mark, Toms
                    Nixon, William Cox, Phoebe Hoggatt and Eunice Knight. Some of the patrons were,
                    Levi Knight, Matthew Marks, James Thomas, Benjamin Overman, Elias Davis, Samuel
                    Coffin, Joseph Reyman, William J. Neely, Jacob Banta, John Faris, John Loudon,
                    Daniel Bowers, Wallace Branaman, William Casper, John Williams, the Robison
                    family, the Gerlis family and perhaps others. They were most of them large
                    families.</p>
            <p>One of the teachers I wish to mention in particular was Miss Phoebe Hoggatt,
                    daughter of William and Elizabeth Coffin Hoggatt and granddaughter of Mathew and
                    Hannah Mendenhall Coffin. She was also a relative of Dr. Barnabas Coffin Hobbs.
                    My mother often spoke of her as a teacher who was loved by her pupils and of her
                    rare ability. She afterward became prominent as a teacher in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName> schools, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana.</p>
            <p>This school sent out from its ranks the following young men to the Civil war:
                    John Loudon, John Marks, Thomas Marks, Mabin D. Coffin, Joseph R. Coffin, Cyrus
                    Overman, Capt. A. J. Banta, Capt. A. C. Trueblood, Riley Thomas, James K. P.
                    Thomas, making a total of thirteen soldiers and all lived to return home.</p>
            <p>It was in this school that Andrew Benton Davis, the grandfather of Dr. Lotus D.
                    Coffman received his education. Two other pupils sent their sons to medical
                    college, William the son of John Overman and Edward the son of Samuel Overman.
                        <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-021-1-070"/> They were prominent physicians in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Andrew Knight, another pupil, is the father of Charles Y. Knight,
                    the inventor of the famous Knight motor.</p>
            <p>The Friends church, constructed on the same lines as the Overman school, was
                    built in 1839. Nathan Hollowell was undoubtedly the first teacher and taught at
                    least two terms of school. He was noted for his fine penmanship and rigid
                    discipline. He used to strike on the side of the house with a piece of wood and
                    call in loud tones—"Books". This was the signal
                    that called the boys and girls from their play to diligent study. If any of the
                    pupils became remiss in their conduct he would throw his pen knife at their feet
                    and they would have to pick it up and take it to him and receive a reproof. He
                    would make them good quill pens, the only pens they had to write with in those
                    days.</p>
            <p>At one time during Nathan Hollowell's term of teaching the pupils asked
                    for a treat at Christmas time. He did not comply with their wishes and
                    accordingly the next morning they preceded him to the school house and welcomed
                    him with the door closed and securely barred. He cast about to find means for
                    their punishment, and climbing to the top of the chimney he placed a board over
                    it and then hastily descending he fastened a hook on the door, and nailed the
                    windows so that the pupils could not raise them for the smoke to escape. But
                    alas! one of the boys, William Hardy, crawled out at a window on the opposite
                    side of the house and running around interrupted "Uncle
                    Nathan", making him mash his fingers so badly that he gave up in
                    despair and treated the mischevious pupils with apples and candy. <placeName>

            <p>Miriam Cox also taught a summer school here and Mrs. Barbara Cauble Baker tells
                    me that she learned her A B C's under her instruction. She said on days
                    of week-day meeting: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We that were not Friends were sent out to build play-houses during the
                            service. If it was not a business meeting we were allowed to stay if we
                            liked.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>She said there was a coarse linen curtain extending across the house and fastened
                    up to the rafters when not in use, but <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-021-1-071"/> when
                    they held a business meeting it was lowered to separate the men and women.</p>
            <p>The patrons of this school were Dr. Joshua Trueblood, Thomas Morris, Nathan
                    Trueblood, James Trueblood, Abram Bundy, Adam Cauble and perhaps others. One
                    soldier went to the Civil war from this school, Joshua Morris.</p>
            <p>The Naugle school house built about 1840, was like the others with the exception
                    of its windows, a log removed on the north side to admit a row of 8x10 window
                    glass from corner to corner and beneath this a sloping shelf that rested on
                    wooden pegs driven in the wall, with a bench beneath also made of a wide slab
                    resting on wooden pegs which served as a writing desk for the pupils. A
                    fireplace six feet wide was made in the west end where great logs were burned to
                    heat the room. According to a sketch just furnished me by Isaac Brooks, the
                    house was much changed in late years. Mr. Brooks was only six years old when he
                    attended the last school taught there in the winter of 1852 and 53, but he
                    remembers all the teachers who taught there by tradition. The old fireplace had
                    been torn away and a twelve-light window filled the opening, also one of the
                    same size on the north and south. The slab benches used for seats were some of
                    them fitted up with a sort of back. An old-style stove served in the place of
                    the fireplace to heat the room. The walls were chinked with pieces of wood and
                    daubed with mud to keep out the cold.</p>
            <p>So far as I can learn, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Norman</settlement>
                    </placeName> Cook was the first teacher. He was from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>. The following conversation between
                    Abram Bundy and Nathan Trueblood, shows the attitude of Friends toward
                    Bostonians. Abram said to Nathan, "I don't know what about
                    Cook, he comes from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> where they hanged Quakers," and Nathan replied,
                    "I don't know". However, when Cook arrived and took
                    up the work their fears were all banished. As once described by one of his
                    pupils, he was of medium height, with brown hair, approaching sandy, and blue
                    eyes that lit up his strong intellectual features. Added to his intellectual
                    accomplishments was that of a well trained athlete. Not one of the large boys,
                    men they were in stature, ever dared to wrestle with him on the playground. As
                    to the rod of correction, that he never used <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-021-1-072"/>
                    but once and that was for two boys who fought on the play ground. Ard and Rude
                    were their names. They were of the "Hurry Harry" type and
                    would not understand any other punishment. Cook stood them in the corner, took
                    his hickory from its long resting place, grasped it firmly with both hands and
                    whipped each of them in turn severely. Father, who was an eye-witness, used to
                    say "they never batted an eye, and stood perfectly still through it
                    all". But it was said that they never again gave the teacher any
                    trouble. He ruled more with do's than with don'ts. He was a
                    terror to the miscreants, and the joy of the well-behaved and studious, but by
                    all was he respected, by the former through fear, the latter through love. All
                    spoke of him in unstinted terms of praise.</p>
            <p>The impact of his strong personality made a lasting impression on all who came
                    under his instruction. The name and personality of the man is before me through
                    tradition as vividly as if I had known him personally. He and his works made the
                    most lasting impress on the community of any teacher who ever taught there and
                    the result of his endeavor lives in the county, state and nation today. His
                    perception was so great that it was a common expression among the pupils that
                    there were eyes in the back of his head. Thorough in every undertaking, whether
                    it be penmanship, drawing, spelling, mathematics, or on the play ground,
                    wrestling, boxing, or the ball game called bull-pen, in all he was always the
                    winner. He was the chum of the pupils on the play ground and their master in the
                    school room where they were expected to study with as much diligence as they had
                    played with enthusiasm. He taught for several consecutive winters and when the
                    Civil war broke out enlisted in the service of his country. After the close of
                    the war he went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> to make his home.</p>
            <p>The next teacher, Thomas D. Stillwell, was another <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> man. Unlike Cook he was not athletic, rather the opposite, a purely
                    scholastic type, rather above medium height and slim, with black hair and fair
                    complexion. He was a fine penman, altogether well educated and fully prepared to
                    instruct the studious pupils. He taught the winter of 1850 and 51. At that time
                    there was a saw mill just west of where <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-021-1-073"/> the
                    Monon railroad crosses the Rush Creek road. It was known as the Hoal and Reid
                    Mill. The school children went to the mill to play. Two girls were seesawing one
                    day, one jumped off, the other fell off and was killed. My Informant, Mr.
                    Brooks, cannot recall the names. Mr. Stillwell taught a term of school in the
                    summer of 1851. My mother boarded with her brother John Overman, who was a
                    patron, and attended this term. He gave her certificates for good spelling
                    during the term. They were written on unruled paper with a rather artistic

            <p>Few names of historic interest to Indiana have appeared in so many guises as that
                    of Colonel Archibald Lochry. Colonel Lochry came to southeastern Indiana in

            <p>We are now one mile east of the northeast corner of the present corporation of
                    the city of Attica. There was located here a sawmill which sawed nothing but
                    pine timber, and from this dam the water was afterwards taken to Attica to run
                    the old woolen mill, grist mill, tanning yard, and this dam practically made the
                    town of Attica. This stream and location are called Stone Cut, you could spend a
                    day here looking over the scenery, but here at the dam is the historical spot.
                    One of the first sawmills, probably the first in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName> run by water power, stood here. This is the old mill race. They
                    took the water across the stream in a wooden flume and turned it into the mill
                    or water wheel. The saw was an up and down saw, a muley, and sawed nothing but
                    pine timber. Some of the logs which were sawed into lumber here were brought
                    from north of Independence. This sawmill was run by a man named William Brown.
                    He is buried at Bethel, and was a Methodist preacher. On his tombstone is carved
                    "Rev. William Brown". This mill started in 1829 or 30 and run
                    until 1845, when Dan Yount and John Yount, two brothers, bought the mill site
                    and dam, built a race and continued this water on down to Attica, two and
                    one-half miles, it is only one mile direct to Attica. The first thing that was
                    operated by this water power was a distillery, Standards Distillery, then
                    Grant's Tanning Yard, and next the sawmill, then the grist mill, and
                    last the old woolen mills, belonging to the Younts. It was bringing this water
                    power to Attica that made all the industries, that brought Mayesville and Robroy
                    to Attica.</p>

                    worked in the stone quarry just below the dam. This creek is now called Stone
                    Cut. In the early days the stone bluffs came so close together along the top

                    doesn't know of this place. Here is where most of the pine timber grew.
                    The balance came down the river. They hauled the timber in over this ridge with
                    ox teams, and a chute was arranged here and the logs shot down into the mill
                    pond, and floated there until they were ready for them. The mill ran all the
                    time, winter and summer. After the lumber was sawed it was hauled up the river
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fulton</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Not a nail was used in making these flat boats. They were made
                    with wooden pins. When the boats were finished, the men went out in the timber
                    and got two large poles, which were fixed on each side of the boat. On the back
                    of the poles they laid a floor, over which they stretched a tent, under which
                    they lived, and where they kept the hay for the animals which they took with
                    them on the boat. When they got to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> they sold the flat boats to the ship yards, and these poles were
                    sold for masts. Everything they handled was at a profit. The Flint Bar was the
                    only place in the country where flat boats were being made extensively at that
                    time. The man who ran the sawmill was Brown. The man who made the boats was <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fulton</region>
                    </placeName>, and the man who oversaw the shipping of goods, was Jesse Marvin.
                    He went on practically all the trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Perhaps some of the people here today remember Jesse Marvin. I saw
                    him practically every week, and it was Jesse Marvin who told me of the mill. I
                    have been there and to Flint with him, and I am telling the story as it was told
                    to me by Marvin.</p>
            <p>The first Swedes brought into the state of Indiana, were brought by the Wabash R.
                    R. to work in the stone quarry. <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-021-1-080"/> One hundred
                    and twenty-five of them bought the land up and down this creek and there were at
                    least fifty Swedish families who built cabins here. Leifs, Burkes, Johnsons,
                    Lyons, Run-grains, Humstedts, Munsons, Swansons, and many other families were
                    raised here. Practically all the Swedish families in Attica and a lot of these

                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> counties came from here and many Swedish families went from here to

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. It was called Sweden, and when I went to school there would be as
                    many as eighty Swedish children in the little school house. I knew one Swede,
                    twenty-two years of age, who came here and learned his English letters,
                    afterwards became very prominent in educational work in <placeName>

            <p>On the road to Riverside, two and one-half miles northeast of the corporation of
                    Attica. Over to the south here, across the railroad, was the old James Killin
                    stone quarry. All the old tombstones that you see in the old graveyards in these
                    counties, practically all of them, were made there. There were thirty-five men
                    making these tombstones, and stones for foundations, etc. The first nursery in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName> was in the west end of this field, and all the splendid old
                    orchards that your fathers tell you about, all of those trees came from that
                    nursery. It was operated by a man by the name of Jonathan Swain. His wife was a
                    sister of Dan Yount's.</p>
            <p>When Jonathan Swain got his money out of this nursery he went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> and bought four sections of land.</p>
            <p>There is a little stone spring house just the other side of James
                    Anderson's residence, built by Jonathan Swain ninety years ago, out of
                    stone taken from this quarry, which is still in a good state of preservation.</p>
            <p>Straight across the road and railroad lived a family by the name of Slusser, and
                    when Judge John R. Porter started from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsport</settlement>
                    </placeName> to make his circuit, he stopped here at the Slusser house to take
                    dinner. Just beyond where the house stood is a graveyard where five hundred
                    early settlers are buried, who mostly died of the milk sickness. Abraham
                    Lincoln's mother died of the same illness.</p>
            <p>Just a little southeast of here is where Adam Rhodes and <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-021-1-081"/> son, Pearce Rhodes, made all the furniture for the
                    early settlers, by water power. They used mostly blue ash timber because it
                    split straight.</p>
            <p>The rarest tree is not the sassafrass tree in Ravine park in Attica, but it is
                    the blue ash which you will see just as you enter the park, going up the hollow,
                    which was very valuable, and there are only a few of them left in the state.</p>

            <p>Right in front of the Baptist church at Independence, looking toward the river.
                    On the ridge is where the first log house was built north of the
                        <geogName>Vermillion river</geogName>, probably we better say the first fort
                    north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The stone you see was in the foundation. The logs were numbered.
                    They were brought up the river from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The fort was built by Zachariah Cicot. When he built the stockade
                    he included a spring of water. Cicot landing is up the river about half a mile.
                    The Pottawattomie trail came through here and then went on to Thorntown and
                    Strawtown. This same Pottawattomie trail went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It started at Greensville, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dark county</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and crossed the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> at Independence, an east and west trail. We are now in the old town
                    of Independence. The town wasn't laid off till 1832. The fort was
                    established in the spring of 1817. There were so many Indians here that when the
                    first white settlers came they could not settle on this side of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>There was 640 acres in the Cicott reservation here. It was given to Perig. He was
                    a Pottawattomie chief, and the father-in-law of Cicott. Perig gave the land to
                    John Baptist Cicott and John B. sold the claim to his father, Zachariah Cicott.
                    When Zachariah Cicott was about ten years of age he went down to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There he received a good education. We are going to the spot where
                    Cicott was born. He was born October 19, 1781, the same day that Cornwallis
                    surrendered to Washington. Cicott lived all his life here and died within 100
                    feet of where he was born. There is a lake in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Cass county</region>
                    </placeName> named for Zachariah Cicott and a street in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was indeed a fortunate thing for William Henry Harrison that he
                    had a man like Cicott, thirty years <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-021-1-082"/> of age,
                    who knew this country. It was Cicott who piloted his army through this country.</p>
            <p>Cicott began raising horses here in the year 1800 and by 1811 he had mounted all
                    of the Pottawattomie and the Kickapoos. The Kickapoo country came up along the
                    river, to the water shed of the Kickapoo creek and from there north was the
                    Pottawattomie country. No Pottawattomies lived across the river from Attica.
                    This was Kickapoo country and the Kickapoos lived there. The old chief, Pisqua,
                    who is buried at Kickapoo is not a Kickapoo, but a Pottawattomie. The battle
                    that was fought by Hardin is down the river below here and on this side of the
                    river, on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren county</region>
                    </placeName> side. Here is where they killed the six warriors and captured the
                    fifty-two prisoners. That was in 1791, on the first day of June. We will see the
                    place later. The battle took place on the right hand side of this river road,
                    just as you go up the hill after you cross the C. E. I. railroad at Kickapoo
                    crossway.</p>

            <p>We are now at Zachariah Cicott's grave in the old cemetery at
                    Independence.</p>
            <p>We spoke to you about the old stones in the cemetery, this is one of them. All of
                    these old grave stones are from that old quarry that I showed you across the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>I have a little personal pride in the lettering on these grave stones because it
                    was done by my father's oldest brother, Luke Whickcar.</p>
            <p>This is the grave of Zachariah Cicott, and here is the grave of his wife. She was
                    a full-blooded Pottawattomie Indian, the daughter of Perig. She died in 1838 at
                    the age of 38 years.</p>
            <p>The inscription of Cicott's wife's tombstone is: "In
                    Memory of Elizabeth, Consort of Zachariah Cicott, who died Nov. 18, 1838, aged
                    38 yrs."</p>
            <p>Zachariah Cicott died in 1850, at the age of 69 years. This woman he married was

            <p>This is the grave of the father of Dan Mace, and here is the grave of his mother.
                    Dan Mace represented this district in congress for many years. He was the
                    democratic candidate <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-021-1-083"/> in 1851, and his
                    opponent was David Brier, who lived at Robroy. Mace lived at Independence and
                    practiced law here. After Dan Mace was elected to congress he moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">LaFayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and was later postmaster there. While he lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">LaFayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> he practiced law, and was attorney for Ed Sumner of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                    </placeName>, in a long lawsuit which went to the supreme court. This litigation
                    that Ed Sumner had was with the Pottawattomie heirs of Toppenebee and Dan Mace
                    was Sumner's attorney. He won the case.</p>
            <p>This is the Pottawattomie trail that we came out, running north from Independence
                    to Pine Village. It was at one time planked and was called the Plank road. Job
                    Cassel collected the toll at Independence. He was the father of Job Cassel who
                    was at one time recorder of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                    </placeName>, and James Cassel of West Point.</p>
            <p>After the destruction of old Fort Ouiatenon in August, 1791, when Wilkinson
                    destroyed the fort, which was never rebuilt, Cicott came here and began raising
                    horses and trading in furs in 1800. All the furs of the northwest country, up to
                        <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> and on north, were brought down here,
                    down this trail and traded to Cicott, traded for whiskey, horses and
                    merchandise. Cicott then took the furs down the river to <placeName>

                        and traded. Also on this trail when you come to Morocco, just north of

                        Morocco. It is an outlet of <geogName>Beaver Lake</geogName>, which at one
                        time covered several sections of land and that was a famous trading region,
                        and practically all the furs which were shipped south came from the

            <p>This spring, Big Spring at Independence, should be called the Pottawattomie
                    spring. The spring used to come from under the large oak tree, but finally
                    changed to this spot. This spring formerly operated a grist mill just below
                    here, and furnished plenty of water, year around, for the mill, until the mill
                    burned. I have taken many a grist to that mill.</p>

            <p>Here is the site of the old town of Mayesville and the Range line, range 7, on
                    this side and 6 on the other side. We are about 18 rods west of the range line.</p>
            <p>When this land was laid off it was laid off three miles on each side of the range
                    line, two miles in Logan township. It is just one miles from here to Riverside,
                    and the township line. The government laid off this land in 1823. This point is
                    directly south of Gilboa church and Gilboa cemetery in Gilboa township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and directly north of Newtown, Mellott, and Wallace in <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Pottawattomie trail came down and through the level country on this side of
                    the creek, and across the river was the Cicott landing and fort. There were so
                    many Indians around this post when the early settlers came here in 1824 to enter
                    the land, they couldn't stay at Cicott's. They came over here
                    and built a public hotel. The lumber for the hotel was sawed at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and like Cicott's cabin, was rafted up the river. That
                    hotel was built in the spring of 1824. There were twenty-two rooms upstairs and
                    downstairs a big dining room and <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-021-1-085"/> a kitchen
                    and a big front room all with fireplaces and then a room where they had
                    groceries and things of that kind. Nobody paid anything to stay in the hotel but
                    everyone had to furnish flour or meal or cut wood for the fireplaces.</p>
            <p>These early settlers went up and down the river for three miles and took up the
                    land on north into <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                    </placeName> and south into <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName>, a distance of 25 miles, all the land was taken up by people who
                    were related. This was the center of their operations. They came here and
                    selected their land on the prairie. This country here for six miles wide and 50
                    miles long was settled from this point. The two men most active in the early
                    settlement of this territory were George Worthington, my great grandfather, and
                    Thomas Hemphill. Thomas Hemphill had five boys, Andrew, Thomas, Edward, James
                    and John. The old man began operating a grist mill, the first grist mill in
                    northern <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName>. This mill operated from 1825 till 1860 when the War broke out. At
                    one time there were probably 800 people living here in the town of Mayesville.</p>
            <p>When the flatboat industry went out and the canal came in, and water was taken to
                    Attica, all the people of Mayesville went to Attica. John and James Hemphill
                    built the Rivere House in Attica with money made here in Mayesville. Mr. Duncan,
                    who ran a general store here built the store room in Attica where
                    Crigler's drug store is now located, and the store room this side of
                    it, with money made here, and so on with many other industries of Attica. The
                    money to start them was made here in Mayesville. When the Hemphills left, the
                    whole town left. That was in 1846 when the canal reached Attica. The grist mill
                    was south and west beyond the railroad about a quarter of a mile from here. This
                    was the business district of the town here and most of the houses were over in
                    the field across the railroad. We are six miles northeast from Attica.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal destroyed the town of Mayesville. Here is where
                    Jesse Marvin had his cooper shop and made barrels. Here they loaded wood, lumber
                    and whiskey.</p>
            <p>On account of the condition of the bottom lands we cannot get to the Flint Bar.
                    That is where the flat boats were <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-021-1-086"/> made.
                    Flint is right on the river, about three miles south of here.</p>
            <p>Mr. Goodwine: You didn't tell us how this hotel was maintained. You said
                    it didn't cost anything to stay there.</p>
            <p>Mr. Whickcar: It was maintained by donations. These people came from Mayesville, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. They brought flour and meal, and the men fished and shot deer and
                    brought the game, fowl, and fish in and the women cooked them.</p>
            <p>You remember Curtis Newell. There was a window in the old Presbyterian church at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsport</settlement>
                    </placeName> in his memory. His wife was one of the women who came here and
                    helped cook. She was one of the most interesting women I ever knew. She was the
                    grandmother of Mrs. Will Cronkhite of West <placeName>
                        <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                    </placeName>. She lived till about 1880. She is buried in the old cemetery at <placeName>

            <p>George Worthington, who was a brother of Thomas Worthington, the first <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator and third governor of the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and William Morrison, who was excongressman Morrison's
                    grandfather, were among the early settlers here. Peter Weaver was the first
                    settler in this locality who had no Indian blood in his veins. He came here to
                    make his home. He was originally from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, but came here from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. He and his son, Patrick, came up the river in 1822. My
                    uncle married Patrick Weaver's daughter. I spent my early childhood
                    bothering him. They came up to Flint in 1822. Peter wanted land on the Wea <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> but didn't know how to get it and Cicott solved the
                    problem for him with the Burnetts. Mrs. Burnett was Kaukeama, a sister of
                    Topenebee, the only sister so far as I know, but I think he had a half brother.
                    Topenebee was the principal chieftain of the Pottawattomie tribe. He signed more
                    treaties than any other Indian. He always signed first. He was not only the head
                    of the Pottawattomie tribe as a state, but also at the head of their religion.
                    They were the largest tribe of Indians in northern Indiana, much the largest.
                    Unfortunately for Topenebee he acquired the drink habit, but one thing greatly
                    to his credit, he was one of the Indians who saved a portion of the lives at the
                    massacre of Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName>. There is a monument in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName>, where Wells was killed. Topenebee was there and stopped the
                    massacre. He was the brother of Kaukeama, and she married William Burnett, and
                    the Burnetts lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in what is now the barnyard of Fred Latourette. Burnett
                    was a Frenchman, but he wasn't from the Ouiatenon settlement, he was
                    from up on the lakes. The land laid off to his heirs was called
                    Burnett's reservation. Burnett's creek, which flows by the
                    battle ground in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe county</region>
                    </placeName>, was named for this famly.</p>
            <p>Zechariah Cicott and Peter Weaver got Kaukeama and her children to locate six
                    sections of land as a reservation, including the home of Peter Weaver. One
                    section is in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName> and the other five sections in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe county</region>
                    </placeName>. It is known as Burnett's reservation on the Wea. After
                    the Burnetts claimed this land, before the entry of lands at Craw-fordsville,
                    Peter Weaver purchased of the Burnett's all of this tract of land,
                    afterwards entering other lands from the government in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe county</region>
                    </placeName>. All the lands in this country were offered for entry at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the 24th day of December, 1824. Fortunately we have a splendid
                    description of this day in <hi rend="i">Old Settlers</hi> written by Sanford Cox
                    in 1860. Among others that he names there is Peter Weaver, who had gone to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to enter land. We will go to the land that Cox's father
                    took up from the government. Most of Cox's <hi rend="i">Old
                    Settlers</hi> was written at the forks of Cold creek, which is Veedersburg. No
                    one living there knows that one of the finest pieces of Indiana history was
                    written near Veedersburg. Cox didn't like it there, so he moved up on
                    the Wea <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and finally died there. Sanford Cox went into the Civil war and
                    was in the 72nd Ind. He was the historian of that regiment, and it was my good
                    fortune to sit at the side of Sanford Cox and talk to him about the Civil war
                    and the early history of this country, while riding on the Monon railroad to
                    Battle Ground, and we spent the day together there. A son of Sanford Cox, within
                    the last three weeks, has visited in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">LaFayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>. No one can write a history of the state of Indiana correctly
                    without quoting from Sanford Cox.</p>

            <p>When the canal was built through Mayesville in 1846, the workmen were attacked
                    with Asiatic cholera. The first few deaths were at Flint, probably eight or ten,
                    then about one hundred died here, and they were buried in that mound up there in
                    that little bunch of trees. There are a few markers up there. Then down by the
                    river schoolhouse, two miles this side of Attica, on the river road, there is a
                    big marl bed. There were at least five hundred Irishmen working on this canal.
                    The first hundred that died were taken to Attica and buried in the old grave
                    yard. I oversaw the rearrangement of the cemetery there and we unearthed a woman
                    with the most perfect set of teeth I ever saw. I regret that I didn't
                    keep them. She had died at that schoolhouse of the cholera. They died so fast
                    they could not take care of them so they put the bodies in that marl bed and
                    covered them with the marl and lime. There was one German lady, who took care of
                    all these people at Flint till they died, then came over here and stayed at
                    Mayesville till all these people died and then went down to the schoolhouse and
                    took care of the people there until they died. She lived till June 16, 1911, in
                    Davis township. I knew her well all my life. Her name was Ann Crouch, before she
                    was married and she married a man by the name of Jahue Martin and still lived in
                    Davis township.</p>

            <p>North of us are the Wea plains, over beyond the timber, this land requires no
                    ditching. There is only one stream that has the impudence to try to cross that
                    plain, and it goes only a short distance and is swallowed up. This is the
                    territory that the Indians fought for, and we cannot blame them for fighting for
                    a country like this. They raised more corn here than in any other place in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>General Charles Scott reached here on June 1, 1791. When he reached this spot,
                    after having traveled in a straight line from the mouth of the
                        <geogName>Kentucky river</geogName>, he stopped for dinner about a mile and
                    a half southeast of here, on the <geogName>Shawnee river</geogName>. They saw an
                    Indian on horseback a few miles north of them. They made an effort to intercept
                    him but the Indian had a very speedy horse and rode through the gap in the <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-021-1-089"/> timber, just to the west of where we are now
                    standing. Scott advanced as rapidly as circumstances would permit and at one
                    o'clock in the afternoon he had reached a point about two miles west of
                    here, where he divided his army, on that range of hills over there to the west,
                    at what is called Round Top. A portion of the army went down toward Flint Bar
                    and on to Kickapoo, crossed the river at Kickapoo ford. A battle between this
                    portion of the army and the Indians was fought on what is now called the
                    Milligan farm, in which six Indians were killed and fifty-two captured. While
                    this portion of the army was down there the rest of the army turned west and
                    went to Ouiatenon. That was on the 1st day of June, 1791, when this army came
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to this splendid prairie. In August following, Wilkinson, who was
                    second in command to Scott, led an army from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and came down to Fort Ouiatenon and decided to destroy that town.
                    He found on this side of the river 400 acres of corn in the roasting ear, and he
                    and his men destroyed that corn with broadswords. After that the Indians left
                    that spot and went on the other side of the river to the left of the little
                        <geogName>Vermillion river</geogName>, near Cayuga, and camped there.</p>
            <p>The following year, 1792, a man by the name of John Hamtramck, General Hamtramck,
                    led an expedition of Indiana volunteers and militiamen from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and made an attack on the Indians and their villages on the north
                    banks of the Big <geogName>Vermillion river</geogName>, near where that river
                    empties into the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. After the raid of Scott in the previous June, and Wilkinson in
                    August, the Indians in this locality were very much weakened, on account of the
                    destruction of their food, and many of them had died, but the remnants of these
                    tribes were camping near the mouth of the Big <geogName>Vermillion
                    river</geogName>. This was a favorite hunting ground for the reason that about a
                    mile up the <geogName>Vermillion river</geogName> from the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> are rapids and the fish could be easily caught going up stream, as
                    they could not get over the rapids, and the adjoining territory was filled with
                    wild strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, plums, haws, and grapes, and was
                    known far and near as the plum patch. This expedition of brave Hoosiers when it
                    came near the Indian camp divided into two columns. One column <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-021-1-090"/> marched up the <geogName>Vermillion
                    river</geogName> and crossed it and was to attack the Indians from the north,
                    while the main army came directly up and across the <geogName>Vermillion
                    river</geogName> and attacked them from the south. The warriors and braves were
                    off on a hunting expedition, and there was no one there to molest but the worn
                    out old men, the women, and children. Those were unmercifully slaughtered in the
                    coldest of cold blood. There were so many of them killed that this portion of
                    the army, on their return, are said to have boasted that they crossed the
                        <geogName>Vermillion river</geogName> on the dead bodies of women, and
                    children, and the water ran red with their blood.</p>
            <p>The first white settlement in the state of Indiana was made at Ouiatenon. The
                    army of Kentuckians crossed the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> on the 23rd day
                    of May, 1791, and consumed seven days in traversing what is now the state of
                    Indiana, traveling on almost a straight line, and if you divide 155 miles, which
                    is the distance between the mouth of the <geogName>Kentucky river</geogName> and
                    this point, by seven, you will find the average mileage per day. They were on
                    horseback, and carried ground corn and strips of venison for food.</p>
            <p>Captain Bull, the Indian chief, came directly down through this gap in the timber
                    with the Kentuckians following him. Some light can be thrown on why the
                    Kentuckians followed the Indians up here. The Indians had stolen 15,000 horses
                    from them and had killed 1500 Kentuckians, and when these white men came through
                    this gap after those Indians they came with blood in their eyes.</p>
            <p>This was all in timber at that time, except the gap. Colonel Harden, for whom <placeName>

                    </placeName>, is named, was at the head of this army. The division of the army
                    was made down west about two miles. Colonel Harden went to the left, and Captain
                    Bull went east toward Ouiatenon. He notified the Indians in that direction but
                    the Indians down the river were not notified. Harden and his army followed those
                    Indians and as fast as they could they gathered in all the Indians on the east
                    side of the river and crossed the river at Kickapoo ford, going toward Kickapoo,
                    and the principal battle was fought in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren county</region>

                    </placeName> bottom land, but Wilkinson's army stopped up here on the
                    hill. The Wea Indians were on this side of the <geogName>Wabash
                    river</geogName>. This was the Miami country. Mr. Barce is a Pottawattomie and
                    you from West <placeName>
                        <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                    </placeName> are Kickapoos. The Pottowattomie and Kickapoos both came from the
                    north and they kept encroaching on the Miami territory, driving the Miami south
                    and east. If the Miami had given the same attention to the Pottowatomies and
                    Kickapoos to drive them back, that they did to making raids down in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> on white settlements, they could have held this territory. The
                    Miami made one mistake, they were timber Indians, Indians who lived in the
                    woods, and they refused to be mounted—they didn't take to
                    the horse, while the Kickapoo and Pottawattomie were mounted. Cicott helped to
                    mount them, and for that reason they were able to take over the Miami country.
                    The Kickapoo and Potttawattomie were more hostile to the whites. Abel Godfrey
                    told me that the Miami Indians did not take kindly to Tecumseh's
                    confederacy. I heard him make a speech at Battle Ground, and that particular
                    speech is one that you can get from Alva Reser very easily. The Kickapoo Indians
                    are related to the Chippewa Indians of the north, and also to the Iroquois
                    Indians. There is a question as to whether the Shawnee is an Indian at all
                    because many of them had blue eyes and straight brown hair.</p>
            <p>The first of the Great Lakes to be discovered by the white men was Lake Huron.
                    When the white man first found Lake Huron, the Shawnee lived there. The next we
                    hear of the Shawnees is down at Shawneetown in <placeName>

            <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-021-1-092"/>
            <p>In the autumn of 1807 there was a meeting of all the Indians, beneath an oak
                    tree, within the corporate limits of Attica. This splendid tree was cut in 1866,
                    and was called the "Council Tree". The council held there was
                    a council of Indians. Cicott was the only white man in that council, and he
                    always lived with the Indians. The tree was in what is now Frank
                    Merrick's yard. At that conference the Kickapoo, Pottawattomie, Miami, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> and Shawnee Indians all met, and the Shawnees were given a hunting
                    territory in the Miami country, from the shed waters of the Shawnee creek to the
                    south and reaching to the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> on the north, and
                    extending up the <geogName>Tippecanoe river</geogName>. The Shawnees came to
                    this territory in June, 1808. The meeting was in the fall of 1807. The Shawnees
                    made their headquarters at the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, or at Prophetstown, and from there Tecumseh began his
                    confederation of all the Indians. Cicott was valuable to Harrison for the reason
                    that he lived all his life with the Indians, in fact he was an Indian. He could
                    speak the language of all the tribes in this locality, he could speak both
                    French and English. He had as much education as could be secured at old Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and equipped with full knowledge of the Indians and with their
                    confidence, he made a most valuable ally of Harrison's in the Indian
                    country. He was considered among the Indian tribes as one of them. He had been
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>

                    </placeName>, and he had a remarkable amount of native ability.</p>
            <p>Cicott did not like Tecumseh's brother, the Prophet. The Prophet
                    pretended to read the hands, and claimed that he was invulnerable, could not be
                    wounded, that he could turn the white man's bullets to snow or ashes.
                    He said that the <geogName>Wabash valley</geogName> would grow pumpkins as large
                    as a house, that this was a paradise on earth.</p>

                    I drove a horse. I made three trips along here in 1874 and worked on a dredge,
                    dredging the canal. In 1875 I again drove a horse on the canal from Riverside to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">LaFayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Here is the best view of the old canal bed that you can get from
                    any place. The canal was filled with water high enough to run a boat and the
                    horse came up the north side, on the tow path. When the boats passed one boat
                    would pull over to the side and drop the rope and the other boat would run over
                    the rope. There was about seven feet of water in the canal.</p>
            <p>Across the river are the Indian hills. If you haven't read Sanford
                    Cox's <hi rend="i">Old Settlers</hi>, you should. He describes those
                    hills. He went up there at sunset. He also describes his fight with wild hogs,
                    and a wild boar. There at the end of the Indian hills is a creek, which is known
                    as Indian creek, but it was formerly known as Rivier de Bois
                    Rouge—river of the Redwood. It was marked on a map of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> by an early geographer, who knew this valley as far back as 1777.
                    You are standing in the presence of a well known stream. The English were the

            <p>We ought not to get away from one thing, that is the treaty of 1783, which

            <p>About $40,000 worth of fur was handled in that fort in a year. The old
                    town of Cincinnatis was on the raise just north. It flourished for a little
                    while and then disappeared. The town of LaGrange was about 4 miles down the
                    river. This was the fort (pointing to it). It was owned by the English in 1765
                    but later fell into the hands of the French Canadians. The Fort was on top of

                    Railroad, on the north side of the wagon road, <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-021-1-095"/> was fought the battle of Kickapoo, June 1, 1791. It is certain that six
                    Indians were killed and 52 Kickapoo Indians taken prisoner. Just west of where
                    this battle was fought, across the road from the Milligan farm, was the old town
                    of Warrenton, the first county seat of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in the home of Enoch Farmer. About a quarter of a mile up the road
                    is Kickapoo Falls and near these falls in 1822 the Kickapoo and Pottawattomie
                    Indians lost a pitched battle and about 80 Indians or 40 on either side were
                    killed.</p>

                    </placeName> claimed and actually took possession of all of the northwest

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and her institutions were established here. When <placeName>

                    </placeName> beheld from the sunset side of her western mountains the
                    northwestern territory and sent her militia to do battle for its possession, she
                    claimed it beyond the rivers that skirted her western boundaries to the Father

                    central states, and these six states now stand as enduring and lofty monuments
                    to the magnanimity and princely liberality and devotion of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> to the general government.</p>
            <p>"Since God gave the fruitful land of Canaan to Moses and Israel, such a
                    gift of present and future empire has never been made to any people",
                    as this territory which made these sovereign states, drained by the
                        <geogName>Mississippi river</geogName> and its eastern tributaries, an
                    empire of present and future wealth, capable of supplying all the needs of the
                    restless, ceaseless current of humanity in these great and growing states.</p>
            <p>It was <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s title to the northwestern territory that <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> acknowledged in the treaty of 1783. Previous to this, in the
                    various treaties of the white people, at the conclusion of other wars in which
                    the native Red man took no part and had no interest, this territory was bartered
                    and traded as a pawn, to be used in driving a good bargain at the conclusion of
                    war, the title passing as part of the terms of the various treaties. With the
                    Red man of the forest this land was not a thing to pawn and barter, to him it
                    was a sacred thing, a gift of the great Manitou to the Indian, a perpetual
                    benediction <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-021-1-097"/> of love from the source of his
                    being. Here was established the family from which he sprang, and here were the
                    graves of his fathers and his loved ones; here he had loved, and wooed and
                    mated, and here his children were born; here he had quenched his thirst from
                    bubbling springs, and lived beneath the spreading branches of boundless forests,
                    or gone to the chase for furs and raiment, food and tents for shelter. He
                    pitched his tent beneath the twining vines, where his children could play and
                    his squaw could care for the family, protected by its shelter from the rays of
                    the summer sun, the rain and the storm. He too had his religion and his faith in
                    a neverending summer land of the soul, he hoped for sparkling streams and rivers
                    and the fadeless verdure of an eternal forest, "The Happy Hunting
                    Ground", where sorrow never entered, misfortune, sickness and death
                    never came. His hope and faith in his religion was as fixed and unfaltering as
                    any of the bravest disciples that ever died for the cause of the Cross. He sang
                    his death song under slow tortures, recounted his deeds of merit and proclaimed
                    his hope and faith in eternal happiness beyond his earthly trials, and
                    anticipated a blissful reward hereafter with all the calmness and confidence of
                    a Christian philosopher.</p>
            <p>The Indian who inhabited this country at no time recognized the title of
                    ownership of it in any government of the white race. They denied the claims of
                    titles made by France, by <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, by the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. They claimed this northwest territory as their own, and along the
                    valley of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, from the mouth of the <geogName>Tippecanoe river</geogName> to
                    where the waters of the Vermilion mingled with the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, all of this valley, from the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> to the Vermilion, was "Ouiatenon". But with this
                    the Red man was not content, and, as other races, he visioned happiness beneath
                    an arched canopy of blue, set with different stars, and wandered far away in
                    search of the fulfilment of this hope. They always returned to Ouiatenon.</p>
            <p>On the 1st day of April, 1791, Antoine Gamelin, an intelligent French merchant,
                    was sent up the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> by Major John Hamtramck, then commandant under St. Clair at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for the purpose of making a sincere <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-021-1-098"/> and honest offer to bring about peace with the
                    Indians in the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> country. Gamelin stopped in the Piankeshaw village on the
                        <geogName>Vermilion river</geogName> near where it empties into the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and the Kickapoo village in the same neighborhood, and from there
                    he visited the Kickapoos on Kickapoo creek, and Pine creek across the river from
                    Attica, and on the 14th of April, 1791, held a council with the Wea and Kickapoo
                    Indians at Ouiatenon. Here he found everything hostile. As a Frenchman he was
                    welcomed, but was plainly told that it was useless to ask them (the Indians) to
                    restrain their young men, for they were "being constantly encouraged by
                    the British", and one of the chiefs said to him, "Know ye,
                    that the village of Ouiatenon is the sepulchre of all our ancestors".</p>
            <p>Marauding bands of all the tribes in and about the territory of Ouiatenon
                    journeyed far to the east, and far to the south, in search of spoils, and
                    adventure, and to attack the scattered settlements of the white man then coming
                    into the frontier forests. It was these attacks of the marauding bands that
                    justified General Charles Scott and his seven hundred and fifty <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> soldiers in their march to Ouiatenon in the spring of 1791.</p>
            <p>The Indians felt secure in the land of Ouiatenon. The French had been in this
                    country as early as 1688, and the English had a trading post called Ouiatenon as
                    early as 1718. The English colonel, George Groghan, who was in charge of the
                    Indian department for the British government, visited the Ouiatenon territory
                    and stopped at the trading post in 1765, and at that time found fourteen French
                    families living there at the fort. At this time the Ouiatenon country was the
                    most densely populated by the Indians of any in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and it has been estimated that there were 15,000 Indians living in
                    that territory.</p>
            <p>A letter to Thomas Jefferson, dated August 7, 1785, gives an account of a council
                    of many of the Algonquin tribes at Ouiatenon. Charles A. Goodrich says, in his
                    history, that <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>between the years 1783 and 1790, not less than 1500 inhabitants of <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                            </placeName>, or emigrants to that country, <hi rend="i">and probably
                                double that number</hi>, had been massacred by the Indians, and that
                            repeated efforts had been made by the government to obtain peace,
                            notwithstanding which <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-021-1-099"/> the butcheries
                            of the savages still continued in their most appaling forms.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>Another historian estimates that during this same period 2,000 children were
                    carried captive from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> by the Indians, and Elmore Barce says that 15,000 horses were
                    stolen from the Kentuckians by the Indians during this period. Many of the
                    marauding Indians in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, who took part in the killing of the citizens and carrying away the
                    children and the horses, were from Ouiatenon, and when these Kentuckians
                    enlisted under General Scott in 1791 to march to Ouiatenon, they were a
                    determined body of men, bent on revenge for the depredations the Indians of this
                    locality had made in their marauding warfare in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Many of them had lost their children or their parents, killed by
                    the Indians, and nearly all of them had lost horses, stolen by the Indians of
                    the Ouiatenon country. The government, owing to the pressing demands of the
                    western people, had authorized the establishment of a local board of war for the
                    district of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. This board was composed of Brigadier General Charles Scott, leader
                    of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> militia, Harry Innes, John Brown, Benjamin Logan and Isaac <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Shelby</region>
                    </placeName>, and they were vested with discretionary powers for the defense of
                    the settlement, and the prosecution of the war. The government had now fully
                    determined on a definite plan of action.</p>
            <p>On the 2nd of January, 1791, between sunset and daylight, the Indians surprised
                    the new settlement on the Muskingum, called the Big Bottom, forty miles above
                    Marietta, killing eleven men, one woman and two children, and General Rufus
                    Putnam wrote to President Washington on the 8th of the same month saying that
                    the little garrison at Fort Harmar, consisting of a little over twenty men,
                    could afford no protection to the settlements, that the whole number of
                    efficient men in the Muskingum country would not exceed 287 and that many of
                    them were badly armed, and that unless the government speedily sent a body of
                    troops for their protection they were a ruined people. <placeName>

                    that it was a fortunate circumstance for the future of the <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-021-1-100"/> great west that George Washington was then

            <p>On the 16th of May, the American prisoner, Thomas Rhea, captured by a party of
                    Delawares and Munsees, arrived at Sandusky. An Indian chieftain was there with
                    150 warriors, and parties of Indians were coming in daily with prisoners and
                    scalps, and on the 24th of May the alarm came that a large body of American
                    troops, in three columns, was moving towards the Miami towns. The Indians burned
                    their houses and moved to the Maumee, where they were living in clever cabins
                    built by the Pottawattomie and other Indians, and stores of corn, pork and beans
                    and other provisions, together with arms and ammunition, the English were daily
                    issuing to the Indians. The savages were coming in in parties of one, two and
                    three, and as many as four and five hundred at a time, and receiving supplies
                    from the English and the French Canadians, and preparing for an attack on the
                    Americans. The Indians in the Ouiatenon country were allied to the British and
                    were taking part in these arrangements for war, and on the 19th of March, 1791,
                    the secretary of war issued orders to General Charles Scott of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to lead an expedition against the Wea or Ouiatenon towns on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. The expedition was not to proceed until the 10th day of May, as
                    hopes were entertained that John Proctor might negotiate a peace. The force to
                    be employed was to consist of 750 mounted volunteers and officers. All the
                    Indians who ceased to resist were to be spared. Women and children and as many
                    warriors as possible were to be taken prisoner, but to be treated with humanity.
                    This expedition was to be led by Charles Scott, brigadier general, then in
                    command of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> militia.</p>
            <p>The 10th day of May arrived, but Proctor was not heard from. The hostilities of
                    the savages were daily increasing. Scott delayed a few days longer in the hope
                    that intelligence might arrive, but on the 23rd day of May, 1791, he crossed the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> at the mouth of the <geogName>Kentucky
                    river</geogName> and launched into the wilderness. Before him lay 155 miles of
                    forest, swamp and stream. The rain fell in torrents and every river was beyond
                    its banks. His horses were soon worn out <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-021-1-101"/> and
                    his provisions spoiled, but he and his brave army pressed on.</p>

                        <region type="county">Warren</region>

                    after George Rogers Clark had taken <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, five months before St. Clair's defeat, three years before <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> fought the battle of Fallen Timbers (Scott was with <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> in this battle) and twenty years before the battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>. Without bearings, without compass, guided by the North star, he
                    entered a forest that had never been penetrated before by the Americans. Soon
                    his provisions failed. His horses tired but he marched on, fording the flooded
                    creeks and bottom lands, wet from the cold spring rains, he and his Kentuckians
                    marched through the unbroken forests. His march was practically a straight line.
                    The army found game, deer and water fowl, and parched corn and dried venison
                    sufficient for their food.</p>
            <p>At eleven o'clock on the morning of the first day of June, 1791, they
                    stopped for dinner on a beautiful stretch of prairie. Dinner over, before twelve
                    o'clock they were mounted and moving on. Scott was in the Shawnee
                    prairie, south and east of the Wea Plains, when his army saw a lone Indian
                    horseman to the right, northwest of them. They tried to intercept him, but the
                    Indian had a good mount, knew the country and rode away.</p>
            <p>Dividing the Wea from the Shawnee prairie is a ridge of high hills, at that time
                    covered with heavy timber. Cutting the ridge in two was a gap in which no timber
                    grew. The lone Indian horseman rode through this gap in a southwesterly
                    direction, about three miles from where he first entered it. Scott's
                    army followed him as closely as it could. When they got through the timber and
                    through the gap they stood at the foot of the Round Top Hills, and beheld north
                    of them, <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-021-1-102"/> for the first time that an American
                    army had ever gazed upon it, the beautiful Wea Plain, the land of Ouiatenon.
                    Colonel Richard P. DeHart describes the occasion thus: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Awake from dreams, the scene changes. The morning breath of the first day
                            of summer has kissed the grass and flowers, but it brings no evil omen
                            to the Kickapoo villages on this shore, nor to the five Wea towns on the
                            adjacent plain. High noon has come, but still birds and grass and
                            flowers bask in the meridian splendor of a June sunshine, unconscious of
                            danger, or the tramping of hostile feet. One o'clock, and over
                            High Gap hostile horsemen are galloping. They separate; one division
                            wheels to the left, led by the relentless Colonel John Harden, still
                            smarting from the defeat of last year by the great Miami, Little Turtle.
                            But the main division, led by the noble Scott, afterwards the

                        <p>On the morning of June 1st, 1791, the landscape of the Wea was a thing of
                            beauty. To the north lies the long range of Indian hills, crowned with
                            vast trees and scarped with many sharp ravines. At the south edge of
                            these hills flows the <placeName>

                            to the river. Within this enclosure of wood and stream lie the meadows
                            of the Ouiatenon, dotted here and there with pleasant groves and filled

            <p>When General Scott and his 750 mounted men rode through the gap in the high land
                    and timber, and paused at the foot of the Round Top Hills, and looked across the

                    rifle and shot at the lone Miami chieftan as he rode off in the direction of
                    Ouiatenon. The Indian Hills echoed back across the peaceful, placid <placeName>

                    </placeName> the reverberating sound of the tocsin of war. This army bore the
                    beacon light of a new government through the wilderness to the frontier, to
                    blaze the way for civilization. The sound of this rifle resounded along the <placeName>

                    </placeName> down to Black Rock, past whose cliffs and bluffs the river coursed
                    its winding way, and the men on horseback from the south, the American
                    cavaliers, beheld the <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-021-1-103"/> beautiful, fertile
                    valley of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. This valley had been the home and hunting ground of the Red man of
                    the woods, wild in his habits, satisfied with his mode of living, finding his
                    food, his raiment and his shelter in the woods bordering the river and the
                    prairies beyond, and now for the first time the cavalier had reached the Red
                    man's home, his stronghold, had reached Ouiatenon.</p>
            <p>Scott stopped only long enough at the foot of the Rouna Top Hills for the shot to
                    be fired in the direction of the lone horseman, and to give his orders to his
                    officers. He and Col. James Wilkinson rode after the horseman, toward Ouiatenon,
                    northwest three miles, on the river bank. Colonel John Harden, with his sixty
                    mounted infantry, and a troop of light horses under Captain McCoy, rode to the
                    left where off to the distance of two miles they could see a small village and
                    four miles further on, was another village. These villages were temporary only,
                    established by a few Kickapoo warriors who had come across the river to hunt
                    with the Miami. The Miami chieftain rode to Ouiatenon and alarmed his tribes.
                    The Kickapoos had no knowledge of the approach of the army until Colonel Harden
                    and his mounted men were within a mile of their village. These Indians mounted
                    their horses and rode for the Kickapoo ford. This ford was eight miles distant
                    down the river, the only ford with a rock bottom between the
                        <geogName>Tippecanoe river</geogName> and the Vermilion, the best and safest
                    ford, the only place, on account of the river being up, where the river could
                    then be forded. Harden's men followed close onto the Kickapoos. The
                    Kickapoos rode straight for the ford and across the river, Harden's men
                    following, and in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren county</region>
                    </placeName>, about two miles north of the mouth of Pine creek, Harden fought
                    the Battle of Kickapoo. Here he knew he had killed six warriors and captured a
                    few women and children, and as he returned he picked up those that were left
                    behind, and at six o'clock in the evening, when he joined Scott and
                    Wilkinson, he reported having killed six warriors and taken fifty-two prisoners.
                    Upon the approach of Scott and Wilkinson to Ouiatenon, a small Indian camp in
                    the bottom lands of the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName>, near the mouth of Wea
                    creek, these Indians got into their canoes and crossed the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. A <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-021-1-104"/> brief skirmish ensued,
                    during which several Indian warriors were killed and two Americans wounded.</p>
            <p>Scott's victory was complete. His men had committed no depredations,
                    they had taken no scalps, they had acquitted themselves with credit, and proved
                    their bravery. A large quantity of corn, a variety of household goods, peltry
                    and other articles were burned with the Ouiatenon village, which consisted at
                    that time of about seventy houses, many of them well furnished. Scott lamented
                    that the condition of his troops prevented him from sweeping on to the head of
                    the <placeName>

            <p>On the 4th of June he released sixteen of the weakest and most infirm of his

                    same day, the 4th day of June, he destroyed the villages about Ouiatenon and the
                    growing corn and gardens, and started on his return trip to <placeName>

                    and without the loss of a single man, and without a discreditable deed committed
                    by one of his troops, he had killed thirty-two warriors and taken fifty-eight
                    prisoners. Forty-one of these prisoners he delivered to Captain Joseph Ashton of

                    news in the Indian camp, for some day he would be the chief of the tribe. The
                    elder Cicot was adopted into the tribe. He hunted and fished with the Indians
                    and accepted their habits and dress. He loved his wife and her people and was
                    proud of his first-born child. He was happy and content with his life on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and the red men of the forest. The child grew apace with the red
                    children of the tribe, and as he grew into boyhood he became an expert with the
                    bow and arrow, and with his father's rifle he was the best marksman in
                    the tribe. He was at home in the waters of the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName>
                    and could paddle a boat, could swim and dive like a fish or water fowl, and he
                    liked the water. He grew very fast with almost perfect form, and with the
                    natural and wild life of the river and the woods, he was fully developed at the
                    age of 16.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1793 his father took him to old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and placed him in the care of the priest to be tutored in the ways,
                    arts, and religion of his father's people. He was studious and soon
                    learned to read and write. In three years he had mastered all the branches
                    taught in the schools at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-021-1-107"/> and during those three years
                    he had taken several journeys south to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> with the priest and became acquainted with the Seminoles, Creeks,
                    Chickasaws, and Chocktaws of the south and the French in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They were three eventful years, a great and beneficial experience
                    in his life. In the spring of 1797 he returned to his parents and the Indian
                    tribe at Independence. The next year, 1798, his father died leaving five
                    children, Zachariah the eldest. Without complaint he assisted his mother in
                    rearing the four younger children. In the year 1800 he began raising horses. He
                    was then 19 years of age. He soon had a small herd of good riding horses and
                    some cattle and started on his career as an Indian trader, trading horses for
                    furs and converting the furs into cash, and by this means, Zachariah Cicot
                    mounted the Pottawattomie and the Kickapoo tribes. The Miami was a better
                    warrior than either of these tribes, but he was a man of the woods and did not
                    take to the horse. This was his undoing and for the reason that they were
                    mounted, the Pottawattomie and the Kickapoo (though they were inferior in every
                    way to the Miami) were able to, and did encroach upon their hunting grounds. For
                    six years he continued his vocation as a trader undisturbed.</p>
            <p>In the autumn of 1807, Tecumseh and the Prophet with a few Shawnee warriors, held
                    a conference beneath the spreading branches of a magnificent oak (ever after
                    known as the Council Oak), which stood within the corporation limits of Attica,
                    (this tree was cut down in 1866). In this council it was agreed that the
                    Shawnees could locate at the mouth of the <geogName>Tippecanoe river</geogName>
                    and have a hunting ground of their own over the territory drained by Shawnee
                    creek and north to the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName>, and east to the mouth
                    of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, then up the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>. All the land south of the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> was
                    Miami territory, and all that part of the hunting ground granted near
                    Cicot's trading post was Miami territory.</p>
            <p>Zacariah Cicot attended this council, listened to all the discussions and took an
                    active and earnest part in them. He knew Tecumseh and the Prophet and did not
                    like either of them, and he did not like the Shawnees and was bitterly opposed
                    to letting them have grounds upon which they might <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-021-1-108"/> hunt. He was opposed to their coming to this
                    territory. He believed Tecumseh to be nothing more than a hired representative
                    of the British and a trouble-maker, and he had no better opinion of the Prophet,
                    whom he considered a religious fanatic. He frankly told the Indians in the
                    convention his opinion of them. He did not want the Shawnees across the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> from his trading post. He was not fond of the Miamis, but he much
                    preferred them to the Shawnees.</p>
            <p>His grandfather was yet living and chief of his tribe, and his grandfather
                    thought the three years at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his knowledge of the white man's learning had been the
                    undoing of Cicot, before this meeting, and now he knew it. The old chief favored
                    the coming of Tecumseh and the Prophet and the Shawnees and his tribe, and all
                    his family sympathized with the chief. While Cicot was alone in his immediate
                    tribe, there were among the Pottawattomie, Kickapoos, Miamis, and Delawares some
                    who believed as Cicot believed and said so, but they were a hopeless minority.</p>
            <p>The great chief and sachem of the Pottawattomie, Aniquiba, was the father of
                    Topenebee and his sister Kaukeema. After the death of Aniquiba for nearly half a
                    century, Topenebee was principal chief and sachem of all the tribes of the
                    Pottawattomie. Kaukeema had married a French trader by the name of William
                    Burnett, and by him had raised a large family of children, and they were all
                    anxious to join and become a part of Tecumseh's confederacy. In
                    accordance with the long fixed custom of the Pottawattomies, Zachariah Cicot
                    would, at the death of his mother's father, become the chief of his
                    tribe; but he was so determined in his objections to the Shawnees and so
                    pronounced in his denunciation of Tecumseh and the Prophet and their scheme of
                    confederation, that after the conclusion of the conference beneath the spreading
                    branches of the Council Oak in Attica, his mother's father passed the
                    chieftainship over his head and announced that the younger brother, George
                    Cicot, would become chief at his death. At the conclusion of the council, in the
                    presence of the chiefs of all the tribes, with great ceremony George Cicot was
                    declared the successor of his mother's father as chief of the tribe.
                    Soon after this treaty the old chief died, <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-021-1-109"/>
                    and George Cicot became a chief of the tribe of the Pottawattomie, and with
                    equal ceremony, Zachariah Cicot, at this council was banished from all the
                    tribes in the <geogName>Wabash valley</geogName>; denounced as a white dog; a
                    traitor to the redmen; and a coward. Zachariah Cicot spent that winter in
                    Independence with his mother. His life was in danger, and in the spring of 1808
                    he went south and spent a year or more with the various tribes of southern
                    Indians. He warned them against Tecumseh and the Prophet and the danger of
                    becoming a party to the Shawnee confederation. He was now 27 years of age,
                    possessing the grace and bearing of an Indian with the suave and artistic
                    demeanor of a French gentleman. He stood full six feet in height; weighed one
                    hundred and ninety pounds; had dark swarthy complexion; keen black eyes; was
                    quick and wiry and very strong for his weight; skilled in the hunt; enduring in
                    the chase; acquainted with the stealth of the redman's woodcraft; brave
                    and possessed of an iron constitution. Tecumseh viewed him as a dangerous enemy;
                    and Governor Harrison considered him a true American, a faithful friend, and a
                    valuable scout, and soon learned of his actions and attitude at the Indian
                    council held at Attica. Governor Harrison knew Zachariah Cicot and he was his
                    most trusted friend, scout, and sharp-shooter on the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> frontier. He possessed the keen insight of his French father to
                    drive a good bargain, and the stealth and endurance of his Indian ancestors in
                    the chase or on the march, and doubtless the governor knew something of his
                    purpose in his journey south to spend some time among the various Indian tribes
                    in the early spring of 1808.</p>
            <p>In the month of June, of this year 1808, Tecumseh and the Prophet and about forty
                    Shawnees established themselves at the mouth of the <geogName>Tippecanoe
                    river</geogName>. It is interesting now that a few weeks before the Shawnees
                    came to their alloted hunting grounds, Zachariah Cicot, their out-spoken enemy,
                    who at that time was acquainted with more Indians, knew the purposes of the
                    French, English, and American traders, still lingering along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, better than any one person in the Northwestern territory, should
                    leave his family, his friends, and the haunts of his youth to spend a year or
                    more <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-021-1-110"/> among the southern Indian tribes. He
                    had a purpose in this journey. It was the psychological time to inform the
                    Indian tribes of the south of the aims and purposes of Tecumseh and the Prophet,
                    apprise them of their true character, and warn them of the danger of allying
                    themselves with the Shawnee confederacy. No one was so well qualified as he for
                    this mission. He had attended the council of 1807 and in that council he had
                    told Tecumseh, the Prophet, and the Shawnees to their teeth that the Prophet was
                    a shrewd deceiver and religious fanatic and nothing more, that Tecumseh himself
                    was a paid hireling of the British, that the Shawnee confederacy was nothing
                    new, that it had been the slogan of King Phillip, of Pontiac, and Red Jacket and
                    was now presented to them as something new that had originated with Tecumseh and
                    the Prophet; that the fair fabric of this dream had been presented to the
                    Shawnees by the British; that the conversion and inspiration of the Shawness to
                    this cause had its source in British gold. He had but recently had the epaulets
                    cut from his shoulders and the ermine of a chief and the blessing of his
                    grandfather taken from him and given to his brother. Small honors they may have
                    been, but the events of the council of 1807 cut deep, and he determined that he
                    would repay. It was his visit to the southern Indian tribes in 1808 and 9 that
                    prepared Pushmataha, the loyal Choctaw chief, for Tecumseh's visit in
                    1811, and forestalled his plans for a confederation of all the Indians in one
                    concerted effort to stop the whiteman's encroachment. He had impressed
                    Pushmataha with the true character of Tecumseh and the real aims of the Shawnee
                    confederation. In the early spring of 1810 Cicot returned to his home at
                    Independence, stopping with Governor Harrison at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> for a few weeks on his way home and continued trading horses for
                    furs. He was now the only man upon whom Governor Harrison could depend, living
                    along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> north of the Ten o'clock line. In the late spring of 1810
                    he took his furs to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and he went back to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> again in the autumn. He, perhaps, was more fitted than any other
                    man to get the information desired by Governor Harrison as to the activities of
                    the British and Indians. On his return he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to consult with the governor.</p>
            <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-021-1-111"/>
            <p>With the approaching summer of 1811 Cicot began making preparations to leave the
                    Indian camp at Independence, and whenever Governor Harrison called, join him at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He arranged with some friendly Indians, in the south part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren county</region>
                    </placeName>, to take care of forty head of his horses. He arranged to take his
                    furs to the mouth of the Big <geogName>Vermilion river</geogName> to be taken,
                    on a flatboat by a French-Canadian of his acquaintance, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. When he left Independence, he knew that what property he could not
                    take in his boat would be destroyed or appropriated by the Indians for their own
                    use. Thus he was prepared, waiting and ready to go. When in the summer of 1811
                    he received a note from Governor Harrison directing him to come immediately,
                    prepared to act as a scout for the army which would soon prepare to march
                    against the Indians at the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, Cicot had noticed that the Indians of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren county</region>
                    </placeName> were in a state of great excitement. He soon became aware that some
                    great disturbance was on foot, as the Indians were holding war and scalp dances
                    and were arming themselves. They were ornamenting their persons with red and
                    black paint and other horrid paraphernalia of savage warfare.</p>
            <p>The note was no sooner received than Cicot began making hurried preparations for
                    his departure. He secretly packed everything of value that he could take in his
                    progress, and, unknown to the Indians left Independence at night, pulling
                    rapidly down the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It was on the 26th of September, 1811, that Governor Harrison with an army of
                    about nine hundred men left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> on his expedition against the Indians in the upper <geogName>Wabash
                        valley</geogName>. Captain Touissant Dubois was in command of the scouts,
                    whose duty it was to guide the army to the Prophet's town at the mouth
                    of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>. Dubois and his trusted guard relied on Zachariah Cicot to
                    determine the route the army should take from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the Prophet's town. Zachariah Cicot was now 30 years of
                    age. He had lived all his life along the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> and
                    most of it at what is now Independence, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. He knew the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> country; he knew the forest; he knew the <geogName>Wabash
                    river</geogName> and its tributaries; he knew the Indians and their habits and
                    methods of warfare; and Harrison and <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-021-1-112"/> Dubois
                    considered him and his knowledge of the country in which they were going to be a
                    valuable addition to their army. He had lived all his life with the Indians on
                    the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. He had raised the horses, and mounted on horse back the
                    Pottawattomie and the Kickapoo. His mother and all his family were Indians. The
                    French priest, during the three years he was with them, had instilled in him a
                    bitter dislike for the English and a love for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> of America, and his love for his government was stronger than his
                    family ties or tribal relations. It was not that he loved the Indians less, but
                    he loved the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> more. That tells the story of Zachariah Cicot, Harrison's
                    most trusted scout. He was ready and willing to sacrifice all he possessed, even
                    to his life, for his country. The time had come; the die was cast; and he was
                    now soon going to meet on the field of battle the chieftains who had banished
                    him from his people and his tribe. He was glad of the opportunity to serve his
                    country and battle for its cause.</p>
            <p>From Fort Harrison, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the army came up the river on the east bank to the south edge of
                    Montezuma in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Parke county</region>
                    </placeName>, here they crossed the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. It took them two hours to cross the river here. From this place,
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vermilion county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, they marched near the west bank of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> to a point near the mouth of Coal creek a little below the south
                    line of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName> near Cayuga. Here on the west bank of the river they built a small
                    fort as a base of supplies and sent forty men back to Ft. Harrison to take care
                    of the women, children, and supplies there. Eight men were left to guard the
                    fort. From this point Cicot guided them west and north. They crosses the
                        <geogName>Vermillion river</geogName> near where the upper bridge at Eugene
                    now spans this stream. From there they went nearly direct to or near State Line
                    City, where they entered <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren county</region>
                    </placeName>. From there they went to the Round Grove near Hedrick or Sloan,
                    where they camped. The first night out from there they marched to the Army Ford
                    where they crossed Pine creek, always continuing in the open prairie, and about
                    ten miles west of the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> and from the Army Ford
                    through open prairie to the battle ground, and away from the possibility of
                    surprise or ambush by the enemy.</p>
            <pb n="107" id="VAA4025-021-1-113"/>
            <p>He took an active part in the battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, with bravery and valor worthy of the soldier that he was. After
                    the battle he returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> with the army, and again as a scout in 1812 he came up the east
                    bank of the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> with General Samuel Hopkins. He
                    remained in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> until the spring of 1815, found his horses and their increase safe
                    with his trusted Indian friends in the hills of Possum Run, north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>

                        <region type="county">Warren county</region>
                    </placeName>, and again at Independence resumed his trade with the Indians. The
                    cause for which he had fought having won, he was respected more than ever by his
                    dusky Indian friends.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1816 he returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and had prepared a large, hewed log house. The logs were numbered
                    and like the stone for King Solomon's temple fit exactly as they were
                    set in place. This log cabin he rafted up the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, and erected it in the early spring of 1817. It was the first house
                    north of the ten o'clock line in Indiana.</p>
            <p>On the 2nd day of October, 1818, he married Elizabeth, the daughter of Perig, a
                    Pottawattomie chief, and to this union three children were born. One son, John
                    Baptist Cicot, and two daughters, Emily and Sophia. On account of Zachariah
                    Cicot having been banished by the Indians, his active part in the War of 1812,
                    his loyalty to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government, he took part in all county, state and national affairs
                    as a citizen of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government alloted to Z. Cicot and his children about three
                    thousand acres of land in Adams township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Carroll county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, fronting on the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> for
                    about two miles. This is known as Cicot's reservation and the village
                    of Lockport is situated in about the center of this reservation. This in
                    addition to the Independence reservation of 640 acres granted to Perig, who gave
                    it to the son of Cicot, who sold or traded it to Zachariah. There is a lake in
                    Jefferson township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Cass county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, named Lake Cicot for Z. Cicot and a street in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> called Cicot street for him. His two daughters were given a half
                    section each and his son received one section from Perig, his grandfather.
                    Zachariah Cicot bought this section or the right to locate it from his son and
                    laid it at Independence, including his house and the Big spring. On this section
                    known as Cicot's reserve he laid out the town of <pb n="108" id="VAA4025-021-1-114"/> Independence in 1832. His log cabin stood until
                    about 25 years ago when it was torn down and used on the highways for bridge
                    timber. Emily, his oldest daughter, received a good education, was a respected
                    and intelligent woman, and was government interpreter at some of the Indian
                    treaties as shown in the government archives at Washington, D. C. In the Indian
                    treaty, January 21, 1832, Zachariah Cicot received $950. In the
                    treaty at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, September 21, 1833, he received $1,800. This was his
                    last allowance as an Indian trader. At this time he was considered a wealthy
                    man. In 1832 he suffered a light paralytic stroke from which he recovered. While
                    Isaac Naylor was judge of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> circuit court, he and Zachariah Cicot and several others who had
                    been in the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> went over the route or trail of the army and identified its camping
                    places and related many interesting anecdotes of the march. Much of the route of
                    the army lay along an old Indian trail, which was afterwards travelled
                    considerably as a highway.</p>
            <p>After a life of toil and struggle, in the year 1850, Zachariah Cicot died very
                    near where he was born, and he had not received even a slight recognition of his
                    valuable services. His burial place is known but no monument begs memory of him.
                    He lies by the side of his wife in the old grave-yard at Independence. His
                    wife's grave is marked.</p>
            <p>He was a noble-hearted, zealous and patriotic hero. His achievements may never be
                    fully appreciated, and his glory may go unsung, yet it is to be hoped that this
                    patriotic soldier of the <geogName>Wabash valley</geogName> may be given the
                    glory and the honor and the place beside his comrades-in-arms, in the history
                    and conquest of the northwest, and the <geogName>Wabash valley</geogName> that
                    is so justly his, and his name and memory should be linked with the other noble
                    and heroic souls whose labors were united on that victorious march and crowned
                    with success in the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>. Like a golden chain linking the past to the present in the rosary
                    of years, is the record of the pioneer, the glory of whose labors rests like a
                    benediction on every hill and stream along the <geogName>Wabash
                    valley</geogName> and whose names like incense are redolent with deeds of
                    bravery, chivalry, and valor.</p>
