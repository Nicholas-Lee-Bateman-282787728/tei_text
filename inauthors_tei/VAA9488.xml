   <div1><head rend="center">PREFACE</head>

    <p>In  presenting this unpretentious collection of
verses, written during the course of a busy life,
largely devoted to other than literary pursuits, it
does not seem to me that an apology of either less
or greater length is demanded. Very fully realizing
that there was no large demand for the
election itself, I feel, with equal force, that those
partial friends who have engaged themselves, before
the event of publication, to become buyers
and readers of this little volume, do not wish to be
wearied with tedious excuses for the short-comings
and crudities of its contents; and I have not the
temerity to address myself to any merely prospective
audience of readers, lest I should be wasting
words upon a goodly company that shall never
exist in a more real domain than that of the imagination.</p>
     <p>The intelligent reader needs not to be told that
many of the "pieces" in this collection have been
included on account of the experiences with which
they are associated rather than for their supposed
literary merits. This is true of much that the
volume contains, and especially so of the "Pioneer
Poems" and "Memorial Verses."</p>
     <p>When an author sits down to tell why he has
not written better, he not only dishonors his work,
but also makes an exhibition of egotism and self-
consciousness that furnishes a better key to whatever

ever failures he may have made than he would be
able to supply in any other way. I should be glad
if what I have written were worthier, but I have
no notion that the reader will expect anything
great. Indeed I am persuaded that the anticipation 
of the limited public that will interest itself to
any degree with my little offering is so modest in
this respect that the performance will be quite
equal to it.</p>

<lg><l>B<hi rend="sc">ACKWARD</hi> gazing through the shadows.</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">As the evening fades away,</l>
 <l>I perceive the little footprints,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Where the morning sunlight lay,</l>
  <l>Warm and mellow, on the pathway</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Leading to the open door</l>
  <l>Of the cabin in the clearing,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Where my soul reclines once more.</l></lg>
  <lg><l>Oh! that cabin in the clearing,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Where my Mary came, a bride,</l>
  <l>Where our children grew to love us,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Where our little Robbie died:</l>
  <l>Still in memory blooms the redbud</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">By the doorway, and the breeze</l>
 <l>Tingles with the spicewood's odor</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">And the catbird's melodies.</l></lg>
<lg><l>And I mind the floor of puncheons,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Rudely laid on joist and sill,</l>
  <l>And the fireplace shaped and beaten</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">From the red clay on the hill;</l>
<l>With the chimney standing outside,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Like a blind man asking alms,</l>
<l>Wrought of sticks and clay and fashioned</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">By the builder's ready palms.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>Half way up the flue, wide-throated,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Does the hickory crosstree rest,</l>
 <l> Whence depend the pot and kettle,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Where the great fire blazes best.</l>
  <l>Oh! I smell the savory venison,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Hear the hominy simmer low,</l>

<l>As my Mary stirs the embers</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">That were ashes long ago.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Once again I hurry homeward,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">When the day of toil is o'er,</l>
<l>And my heart leaps up in gladness,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">For in this wide open door,</l>
<l>Mary in her homespun habit,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">With her hand above her eyes,</l>
<l>Gazes all around the clearing</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Till my coming form she spies.</l></lg>

<lg><l>'Tis for her I am a hunter,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And the fleet deer's sudden bound</l>
<l>Tells how swift and sure my aim is,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Ere his life-tide dyes the ground;</l>
<l>'Tis for her I am an angler,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And the spotted beauties woo</l>
<l>From their paradise of waters,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Ere the sun has dried the dew.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And the wild rose and the bluebell</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That I pluck with gentle care,</l>
<l>Are for her who rules the cabin-</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Mary, of the raven hair;</l>
<l>'Tis for her I smite the forest</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Day by day with myriad blows;</l>
<l>'Tis for her the cornstalk tassels,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And the golden pumpkin grows.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Often, winding through the woodlands,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Neighbors come with song and shout,</l>
<l>Eager for a day of pleasure</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Where the latch-string hangeth out,</l>
<l>And with ready hands assist us</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">At our labors, while the zest</l>
<l>Of our conversation heightens</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Till the sun goes down the west.</l></lg>

 <lg><l>Aye, Once again I see them,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">On a sad, sweet summer day</l>
       <l>When the Robin on the maple</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Seems to sing his soul away;</l>
       <l>And the clearing swims around me</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">In a tangled dream of woe,</l>
       <l>and my weeping Mary whispers,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">"Tell me why he had to go?"</l></lg>
     <lg><l>"Why he had to go?" O Heaven!</l>
       <l rend="ti-1">"Did God want our little boy?"</l>
   <l>'Tis the old, unanswered question,</l>
       <l rend="ti-1">Cankering in the heart of joy,</l>
   <l>And subduing many a pleasure,</l>
       <l rend="ti-1">As I see those friends of old,</l>
   <l>Hiding tenderly our darling</l>
       <l rend="ti-1">In the forest's virgin mold.</l></lg>
 <lg><l>Now, that cabin in the clearing</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Is but dust, blown here and there,</l>
 <l>Where the palpitating engines</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Breathe their darkness on the air;</l>
 <l>Where my forests towered in beauty,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Now a smoky village stands,</l>
 <l>And the rows of factories cluster</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Grimly on my fertile lands.</l></lg>
 <lg><l>Scarcely room enough is left me</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">For this double, clustering rose,</l>
 <l>Were the baby and its mother</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Side by side in earth repose;</l>
 <l>Soon the last fond trace will vanish</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Which proclaims that they have been;</l>
 <l>But no matter--heaven's gateway</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Opened wide to let them in.</l></lg>
<lg><l>Yet with Mary oft I linger,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Where the well-sweep slanteth low,</l>

  <l>For the rolling and the quilting,</l>

  <lg><l>H<hi rend="sc">IS</hi> form is bent, his head is gray,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">His limbs are long and slender;</l>
  <l>But still beneath his woolen vest,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">The heart is true and tender.</l></lg>
  <lg><l>His comrades long are in the clay;</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Their wooden head-boards rotten;</l>
  <l>And in the modern neighborhood,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Their very names forgotten.</l></lg>
  <lg><l>He walks serenely thro' the fields;</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Old shadows seem to follow,</l>
  <l>Again he sees the tawny deer</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Go leaping down the hollow.</l></lg>
  <lg><l>He hears once more the rifle's ring,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">The hunters shouting gladly;</l>
  <l>On yonder hill the wounded bear</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Again gives battle madly.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>He hears the pheasant's booming drum,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">He hears the turkey calling;</l>
  <l>The thudding maul, the ringing axe,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">The crash of timber falling.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>He sees the little cabin home,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">The tiny patch of clearing,</l>
  <l>Where once he dwelt with wife and boys,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">No breath of evil fearing.</l></lg>

<lg><l>"Ah, well!" he sighs; "she's sleeping now;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The eldest boys are with her:</l>
  <l>I very soon shall go to them,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Since they may not come hither."</l></lg>

  <lg><l>The tear that glistens in his eye</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Falls down a moment after;</l>
  <l>For, silvery, echoing up the lane,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">He hears his grandchild's laughter.</l></lg>

 <lg><l>The past and present strangely blend</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Before his mental vision;</l>
 <l>Yet love, that makes the dreary wolds</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Appear like fields elysian,</l></lg>

 <lg><l>Still paints along his early days</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">The fairest scenes of pleasure,</l>
 <l>And garners stores of happy thought</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">No rhythmic art can measure.</l></lg>
 <lg><l>No words bespeak his heart so warm</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">As did the backwoods greeting;</l>
 <l>No preacher has such power as he</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Who held the backwoods meeting.</l></lg>
 <lg><l>He knows of many a merry time</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">At reaping, rolling, raising,</l>
 <l>Or, on the jolly husking nights,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">With cheerful torches blazing.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>From many a good wife's quilting bout</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">He treasures home-spun blisses;</l>
  <l>Where old folks talked, and young folks
        played</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Their games of forfeit kisses.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>The lazy Indian still he scorns,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">His squaws and his papooses;</l>
  <l>He thinks, God made them; but, no doubt</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">For undiscovered uses.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>Where now a dozen turnpikes stretch</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Stiff lines between the meadows,</l>
  <l>He knew a single Indian trail</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">That wound thro' forest shadows.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>A dozen villages he sees</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Beside their railroad stations,</l>
  <l>Where once a single trading post</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Supplied the settlers' rations.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>A hundred rushing trains go by;</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">He hears them scream and thunder,</l>
  <l>And laughs to think how they'd have
        stormed</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">His backwoods world with wonder.</l></lg>

<lg><l>"How strange the ways they practice now,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">This new time emphasizing,"</l>
  <l>He says, and with the uttered thought,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Grows loud soliloquizing:</l></lg>
<lg><l>"With chattering instruments at church,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And dapper youngsters preaching,</l>
  <l>And for the congregation's hymn,</l>

<l>And loads the air with sweet perfume,</l>
<l>And gives a thousand charms unknown</l>
<l>To any but its native zone;</l>
<l>The olive and the fig tree stand</l>
<l>Along the slopes of that fair land,</l>
<l>Wherein, of old, the Jewish maids</l>
<l>Were wooed and won; their ample shades</l>
<l>Have fallen round kings and prophets old,</l>
<l>With silent blessings manifold.</l>
<l>But though we yield the blissful powers</l>
<l>Of olive shades, magnolia bowers,</l>
<l>And where the vine and fig tree grow,</l>
<l>See plenty smile on all below,</l>
<l>No better, fairer trees are they,</l>
<l>When decked in summer's glad array,</l>
<l>And when the ripening autumn time</l>
<l>Bequeathes its wonders to the clime,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">They ne'er present such canopy</l>
<l>Of waving leaves and brilliant dies,</l>
<l>In myriad optic harmonies,</l>
<l>To contrast with the sober skies,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">As our own sugar maple tree.</l></lg>

<lg><l>What though for Afric's sons the palm</l>
<l>May yield its shade, the hermit's psalm</l>
<l>Of old Armenian origin,</l>

<l>Fresh from the tropic lands that bloom</l>
<l>With countless flowers of loveliest dies,</l>

 <l>Grow garrulously loud and gay.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The rugged pine, the mountain fir,</l>

<l>Not he, who nurtured in the west</l>
<l>Of memories that he deems the best,</l>

<l>Of rustic girls and hardy boys,</l>
<l>Where fell in fleecy clouds the damp</l>
<l>Evaporations from the camp,</l>

<l>Through all the year, till March should bring</l>
<l>The sugar-making and the spring.</l></lg>

<l>His vaunted sweets, that are the cost</l>

<l>Red with the gore from many a gash,</l>
<l>Where human chattels toil in pain</l>
<l>To rear the sugar-yielding cane;</l>
<l>When by the cheerful work of hands</l>
<l>That never felt the hissing brands</l>
<l>That mark the currency of hell,</l>
<l>Where planters buy and traders sell,</l>
<l>Here, in this northern bower, is wrought</l>
<l>A more luxurious sweet than aught</l>
<l>The world had ever known until--</l>
<l>A good return for many an ill--</l>

       <lg><l>But a voice of song and laughter</l>
         <l rend="ti-1">Cheerier far than brooklets make,</l>
      <l>Echoes down the beaten highway,</l>
         <l rend="ti-1">Scares the wild hare to the brake;</l></lg>

     <lg><l>And the merry sleigh bells tinkle,</l>
       <l rend="ti-1">Chiming to a wordless rhyme,</l>
     <l>While the voices of the sleighers</l>
       <l rend="ti-1">With the melody keep time.</l></lg>

     <lg><l>It is by the country school house,</l>

   <l>But within the district school house</l>
     <l rend="ti-1">All is jollity and fun.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>Hark! the warning word is given,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">"Silence all!" the teacher cries,</l>
  <l>And the champions take their stations,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Followed by a hundred eyes.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>One, a rosy little maiden,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Just arrived at "sweet sixteen,"</l>
  <l>'Tother, lad of eighteen winters,</l>

 <lg><l>Just as quick as thought can travel</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Runs a titter round the room,</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">Half forgetful of his shame,</l>
 <l>Gazes round the room a moment,</l>

 <lg><l>Then the merry maiden chooses,</l>

  <lg><l>F<hi rend="sc">ATHERS</hi> and mothers of our native land,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">I hail you, through the mists of passing years,</l>
<l>And fain would grasp each labor-hardened hand</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">And speak a blessing to your listening ears;</l>
  <l>For ye are blessed that your toils have won</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Far better fruit than any idle praise;</l>
  <l>And, as you calmly face life's setting sun,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">You know the peace that follows well-spent
          days.</l></lg>

 <lg><l>You found a wilderness of mighty woods,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Thick set with giant trees and tangled vines,</l>
 <l>With brush and weeds; where all the vernal floods</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Of drift-choked streams, o'erflowing their confines</l>
  <l>Of bank and channel, filled the oozy swamps,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Stagnated and grew foul in summer heat,</l>
  <l>Bred torrid fevers, agues, frigid cramps,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Till death came oft to darken and defeat.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>But we who follow, where your hands have
     wrought,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">See smiling cities, hamlets, fruitful fields,</l>
 <l>School, church and college, homes of cultured
          thought,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">And every good a generous progress yields:</l>
  <l>And so we bow to you, gray pioneers,--</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Strong men, brave women of the early days!--</l>
 <l>Ye came and conquered by your toils and tears,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">And now this garden land shall speak your
      praise.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Gone are the tangled woods, the swamps no more</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Breed pestilence, but blossom like the rose,</l>
<l>And happiness and health reign, where of yore</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The hardy settler battled fever foes.</l>
 <l>Gone are the drifts, the river floweth free</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">By farms that smile in morning's golden light;</l>
 <l>With his long howl of wailing deviltry</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The wolf no more sends shivers through the
   night.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But lost with these is much of highest worth,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The broad, unstinted welcomes of the past,</l>
<l>The hospitality that blessed the earth,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The generous love, unwearied to the last,</l>
<l>That held a neighbor's weal beyond your own,</l>
   <l>The mutual interest, linking heart to heart</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In truer compacts than the world had known,</l>
  <l>Or dreamed, or taught, or typified in art.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Your cabin homes, with rudely-puncheoned floors,</l>
  <l  rend="ti-1">Wherein the great wheels hummed their busy
        tunes,</l>
<l>Ne'er on the weary wanderer closed their doors</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">With selfish coldness, but the precious boons</l>
<l>Of cheer and sympathy you freely gave</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And such small comforts as were at command,</l>
<l>While with your outer latch-strings there did
        wave</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A welcome ever warm, from heart and hand.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Gone with the latch-strings are the welcomes old,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And formal manners now usurp the place</l>
<l>Once filled by love; but yet some fadeless gold</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of early days survives; the tender grace</l>
  <l>Of many true and priceless things are ours,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Bequeathed from happy homes of "Auld Lang

<lg><l>O U<hi rend="sc">RANIA</hi>! I whisper thy name with a sigh,</l>
<l>For I know that the moments are hurrying by,</l>
<l>That the ages are chasing and hurrying by.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And I know I shall wander with thee but a day,</l>
<l>And the day like a shallop is sailing away,</l>
<l>And thy life like a shallop is fleeting away.</l></lg>

<lg><l>A fairy white shallop, keel, rudder and sail</l>
<l>All enwove of the gossamer found in a vale,</l>
<l>Of the gossamer found in a fabulous Vale.</l></lg>

     <lg><l>In a fabulous Vale where the sensitive trees</l>
     <l>Shade and avenue leading to fairest of seas,</l>
  <l>While they throb to the pulse of that fairest of
  seas.</l></lg>

     <lg><l>O Urania! thy life is a musical tone</l>
     <l>From the harp of an angel that sings by the
     throne,</l> 
     <l>Of an Angel enchanted by Allah's high throne.</l></lg>

     <lg><l>As you fade from my sight, as your loss I deplore,</l>
     <l>Still it stings in my soul as you fade evermore,</l>
     <l>And your life to my life gathers sweet evermore:</l></lg>

     <lg><l>And no lark ever sings to the beautiful sky</l>
     <l>But in dreams my Urania is wandering by,</l>
     <l>But I see the white mist of your garments go by.</l></lg>

<lg><l>O Urania! the earth and the air and the sea</l>
<l>And the infinite spaces are vocal with thee,</l>
<l>And the sunset and moonrise seraphic with thee.</l></lg>

<lg><l>'Tis but dust that is fading beyond our control,</l>
<l>And Urania forever is queen of my soul,</l>
<l>And thy love makes my heaven, O, queen of my
        soul!</l></lg>

     <l>I heard a thousand happy psalms,</l>

  <l>Its flood we sailed our vessels down</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Full freighted with a myriad loves:</l>
  <l>Our souls went floating to the gales,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">With scarlet leaves and shreds of bark;</l>
  <l>We named them cutters, schooners, sails,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And watched them fade in shadowy dark,</l>
  <l>Then down the waters flowed the song,</l>
<l>'"Tis morning and the days are long."</l></lg>

  <l rend="ti-1">And youth and innocence are wed,</l>
 <l>And every grove is full of song,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And every pathway void of dread,</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">Or rightly dreams it o'er again,</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">And shrunken all the hopes of men,</l>
 <l>He shall rewaken with his song</l>
   <l>"The morning when the days were long."</l></lg>

     <l rend="ti-1">The thrills of many an old delight,</l>
   <l>And dimpled hands that lightly meet,</l>
     <l rend="ti-1">And hearts that tremble to unite,</l>
   <l>Arise upon the rosy morn,</l>
     <l rend="ti-1">Pass down the lovely vales and stand</l>
      <l>The picture of a memory born,</l>
     <l rend="ti-1">The mirage of a lotus land--</l>
        <l>A land where once we trolled the song,</l>

            <div3 type="poem"><head rend="center">THE POET'S REED</head>

<lg><l>W<hi rend="sc">HEN</hi> young Apollo, from the heavens cast
      down,</l>
<l>Stripped of all splendor and his robe of light</l>
<l>Torn from him by the thunderer's royal hands,</l>
<l>Walked on the earth--a god without a crown,</l>
<l>Leading Admetus' herds across the sands,</l>
<l>Through ragged deserts and uncultured lands,</l>
<l>With cries and plaints he wearied not the night.</l></lg>

<lg><l>He wearied not the night nor vexed the day</l>
<l>With vain repinings nor discordant woe,</l>
<l>But plucked a reed which stood in bannered pride</l>
<l>Beside the sylvan stream's enchanted way,</l>
<l>Wrought it into a flute, which, wonder-eyed,</l>
<l>Held fast by longings new, unsatisfied,</l>
<l>The savage shepherds heard him blow and blow.</l></lg>


<pb

<lg><l>The immortal artist, painting with his flute,</l>
<l>His breath for pigment, for perspective sound,</l>
<l>Woke answering echoes from the rocks and
        plains,</l>
<l>And placid waters which till then were mute,</l>
<l>Save to discordant winds or noisy rains,</l>
<l>Soothed man the beast with his delightful strains,</l>
<l>Till man the soul his sense of being found.</l></lg>

<lg><l>From wonder passed the shepherds to delight,</l>
<l>Delight grew into interest, interest thought,</l>
<l>Then many reeds were plucked and wrought and
        blown,</l>
<l>With stunning discords, till, by patience taught,</l>
<l>The god within each breast stood up alone</l>
<l>Answering Apollo's music with his own,</l>
<l>And earth had something from the heavens
     caught.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And thus came art from heaven, when earth was
        young,</l>
<l>Cast downward by the thunderer, as in wrath,</l>
<l>Its form a god's in banishment, its need</l>
<l>Asserted not by any muse's tongue</l>
<l>Nor seven-stringed phormix, but by simple reed,</l>
<l>Broken and bruised and made to cry and bleed</l>
<l>And murmur down the musky zephyr's path.</l></lg></div3>

  
               <div3 type="poem"><head rend="center">THE GUEST</head>

 <lg><l>T<hi rend="sc">HERE'S</hi> a bird that stays with us the whole
        winter long,</l>
   <l>Sgladdens our hearts with its beautiful song ;</l>
 <l>plumage is plain and its notes are not loud,</l>
 <l>r would they excite the applause of the crowd ;</l>


<pb
                    id="VAA9488-034"

   <l>Yet, somehow, we love it and cherish it so,</l>
   <l>That when other birds fly it refuses to go.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Its songs are strange questions and gentle replies,</l>
<l>Set to music as soft as the light of the skies,</l>
<l>With a hint, here and there, of Promethean fire,</l>
<l>And some notes from Pan's reed and the old
         Orphic lyre,</l>
  <l>But so mixed and mingled with plain homely
         things,</l>
  <l>That critics and pedants despise all it sings.</l></lg>

<lg><l>No bird of the wildwood was ever so free,</l>
<l>No prison-bound warbler so hampered as he :</l>
<l>Now soaring he sings with the sweet English
         lark,</l>
<l>Now tremblingly pipeth sad notes in the dark,</l>
  <l>Or, casting a backward glance over the snow,</l>
  <l>In the treble of age, chants the sweet long ago.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But more often his notes are as glad as the woods</l>
<l>When spring bursts the buds and unlooses the
         floods;</l>
<l>He sets children romping with innocent joy,</l>
<l>And gives the old gray-beard the heart of a boy;</l>
  <l>The matron reneweth her youth in his strain</l>
  <l>And feels the sweet coyness of girlhood again.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And so, with our blessings, he ever remains,</l>
<l>When summer rejoices, when winter complains;</l>
<l>We love him and cherish him more as the years</l>
<l>Run past us and leave us their sadness and tears,</l>
  <l>And smile with content at the critical scowl</l>
  <l>Of the pedant who swears that our bird is an
        owl.</l></lg></div3>

    <l rend="ti-1">With toil and debt increasing,</l>
  <l>We sighed not, but we ate enough,</l>

    <l rend="ti-1">And care's demands unceasing.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>Beyond the clouds the future stood</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">With gifts of joy or sorrow;</l>
  <l>We trusted God to make them good,</l>
  <l>And waited still, in thankful mood,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">The dawning of the morrow.</l></lg>

<lg><l>"Things might be worse," the father said;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">"Hope darkened more," said mother;</l>
 <l>"The household memories are not dead,</l>
  <l>The household angels have not fled--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">God saves us to each other."</l></lg>

 <lg><l>And so that old thanksgiving day,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">In doubt and darkness rising,</l>
 <l>Was full of praise, and love's sweet way</l>
 <l>Held over all its gentle sway,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Our souls in joy baptizing.</l></lg>

 <lg><l>O, not from pleasure's idle reign,</l>

    <l>Chattering blackbirds on the trees</l>

  <lg><l>He felt the pressure of her lips,</l>
  <l>It warmed him to the finger tips;</l>
  <l>Her breath was on his tangled hair,</l>
  <l>And left a tender halo there.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>A hint of heaven's benignant grace</l>
  <l>Was kindled in the blind boy's face;</l>
  <l>His quickened pulses seemed to run</l>
  <l>Like insects sporting in the sun;</l></lg>

  <lg><l>His spirit sight was apt and keen</l>
  <l>For things that eyes have never seen,--</l>
  <l>The thrills by which the grasses grow,</l>
  <l>The force that makes the pansies blow,--</l></lg>

  <lg><l>Each spicy odor from the woods,</l>
  <l>The fainting boom of far-off floods,</l>
  <l>The shirr of rapid, winnowing wings</l>
  <l>And all spring's gladly quickened things,</l></lg>

  <lg><l>His fancy clothed with form, and made</l>
  <l>Soft pictures of the sun and shade,--</l>
  <l>The sun and shade he never saw,</l>
 <l>But knew through feeling's subtlest law.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>He knew when buckeye leaves unfold,</l>
  <l>When burst dandelion's floods of gold</l>

  <l>Far more to him than mortal eyes?</l></lg>

      <l rend="ti-1">A blossom on a lover's tomb,</l>
    <l>A bud expanding into leaf,</l>
      <l rend="ti-1">A dewdrop in a clover bloom;</l>
   <l>How sweet, how sad, how wondrous fair,</l>
      <l rend="ti-1">How soon forgot, how quick to fade!</l>
    <l>The song, the bloom, the infant care,</l>
      <l rend="ti-1">Pass like the play of sun and shade;</l></lg>

    <lg><l>But in their passage quicken thought,--</l>
      <l rend="ti-1">As sunbeams melt on field and plain</l>

<l>And leave their slightest impress wrought</l>
      <l rend="ti-1">In blooming grass and ripening grain,--</l>
<l>And though each individual form</l>
      <l rend="ti-1">Grows indistinct, its glow remains,</l>
<l>A halo round us in the storm,</l>
      <l rend="ti-1">A genial warmth that fills our veins.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The critic comes with awful frown</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To crush the artist, like a gnat;</l>
<l>Frosts nip the tender blossoms down,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And childish griefs, for this and that,</l>
<l>Are merged in sorrow's large estate,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That widens round our frosted heads;</l>
<l>And yet the varied web of fate</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Is woven of such slender threads.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The little things of time are most</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Secure of influence, promise, power:</l>
<l>The flying seed, the insect host,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Dissolving dew and transient shower;</l>
<l>They multiply, build up, tear down,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And write their excellence and grace</l>
<l>On arid waste and mountain brown,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Till naught is bare nor commonplace.</l></lg>

<lg><l>So little murmurs, joined in song,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Light bubbles that in music break--</l>
<l>When youth is glad and days are long--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In low, soft ecstacies, may wake</l>
<l>The living chords of that sweet lyre</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Which trembles in the human heart</l>
<l>And prompts the genius to aspire,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The man to act a noble part.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Then, scorner, spare the little things!</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">From atoms all the worlds are wrought,</l>

  <lg><l>T<hi rend="sc">HEY</hi> kissed beneath the mistletoe</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Upon that Christmas day;</l>
  <l>They kissed beneath the mistletoe</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">And then he went away;</l>
  <l>He went away, he went to sea,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">He sailed on many a ship,</l>
  <l>But still the mistletoe was green,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Her kiss was on his lip.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>He sailed a score of years and four,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">His head was getting gray,</l>
  <l>But fortune that had dodged him long</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">At last was brought to bay,</l>
  <l>And came down handsomely in fine</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">With half six oughts or so;</l>
  <l>The ship in which he sailed was called</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">"The good ship Mistletoe."</l></lg>

  <lg><l>He turned unto his men and spoke,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">His words were soft and fair,</l>
  <l>Of Christmas cheer and wedding bells</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">And sweet domestic care:</l>
  <l>He homeward turned his vessel's prow;</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">How should the sailor know</l>
  <l>That she had sworn herself to Christ</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">He kissed so long ago.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>He sailed across the tropic line,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">He saw the great cross fade,</l>

<l>He sailed for home, for happy yule,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">For mistletoe and maid:</l>
<l>His soul with rapture overflowed,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">His heart was wild with joy;</l>
<l>He capered up and down the deck,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">He whistled like a boy.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The bashful moon her image cast</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Upon the laughing sea,</l>
<l>He murmured in his sailor way</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">"'Tis like my bride shall be;"</l>
<l>"I see her image in the wave,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">She lights my soul as when</l>
<l>We kissed beneath the mistletoe;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">So shall we kiss again."</l></lg>

<lg><l>Entranced by one delightful thought,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">He leaned beyond recall;</l>
<l>He fell upon that phantom moon,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">'Twas shivered by his fall:</l>
<l>He sank; with sudden motion drawn</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The vessel's keel below,</l>
<l>Went warm with love's remembered kiss</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Beneath the mistletoe.</l></lg>

<lg><l>They lowered their boats, they searched
    the sea,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">They chased the shining wave;</l>
<l>But he was on his coral bed</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And she was in her grave;</l>
<l>And when that eve at anchor lay</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The good ship Mistletoe,</l>
<l>The little port was mourning half</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And half in Christmas glow.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The best beloved, the guardian saint</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of all the straggling town</l>
<l>Was underneath the frozen clods</l>

     <l rend="ti-1">No cloud of despair in the etherine sea,</l>

     <l rend="ti-1">While fame just stood waiting to crown you

    <l rend="ti-1">That feathery title I gave Florabel,--</l>

<lg><l>Ah, well! Shall I say they are forty and florid,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">With never a notion of Shakespeare, nor Moore,</l>
 <l>Nor the phrensies of poets, but mate with some
         horrid</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And well-to-do bores, as their ma's did before?</l></lg>

 <lg><l>You remember the fervor that flamed in our
         bosoms</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">As we tilted at slavery, the terrible foe;</l>
 <l>Heroical Gracchi we sought the red blossoms</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Of radical honors, a score years ago.</l></lg>

<lg><l>We pulled at the ropes and we shouted as loudly</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">As any who launched the old liberty ship;</l>
<l>Then felt sweetest joy as, her sails swelling
         proudly,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">She flew o'er the waves like a hawk from the
         slip.</l></lg>

<lg><l>"Ah! boys, you've helped launch her," cried old
         politicians,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">"You've labored, good hearties, when laborers
         were few,</l>
<l>Now work for your lives for success, scorn divisions,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The future waits radiant with promise for you."</l></lg>

<lg><l>We toiled, we petitioned, we talked and we battled;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The tough rind of slavery was punctured at last,</l>
<l>Then up came the war and the musketry rattled,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And all the sweet heavens were with clouds
         overcast.</l></lg>

<lg><l>You went to the front, not a leader, poor fellow,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A private were you and a private you fell;</l>
<l>The stars and the eagles, the shoulder-straps yellow,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Were seldom for those who loved freedom too
        well.</l></lg>

         sighing,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Your soul, like John Brown's, has been marching
         along</l>
<l>Through all of these ten years, while I have been
         trying</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To gain for your memory one poor tribute song.</l></lg>

<lg><l>I'm forty to-day, yesterday I was twenty,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The conflict of ideas, the conflict of arms,</l>
<l>The conflict of interests with all their addenda</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Have swept past my youth and destroyed all its
         charms.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And some wave of time, with most headlong
         assurance,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Has borne me far off from the happy old days,</l>
  <l>Till here at this plain half-way house of endurance</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">I sit without honor, or fortune, or bays.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Ah, me! When at twenty we long for the battle</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And storm of life's earnest campaign to begin,</l>
<l>How little we think to be driven like cattle</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Or slaughtered like sheep in the shambles of sin.</l></lg>

<lg><l>How little we guess that in life's rough endeavor</l>
  <l>The vulture gains more than the paradise bird,</l>
<l>That over the song of the skylark forever</l>
  <l>The howls of the wolf and the jackal are heard.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Rest sweetly, dear friend, not a storm shall awake
         thee,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Thy pulses to anguish no more shall respond,</l>
<l>No more shall the false and the fickle forsake thee,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">For love springs eternal and life lies beyond</l></lg>

<lg><l>This beautiful world, that we men make Gehenna</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">By selfish ambitions, unhallowed desires,</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">The high soul repressing, destroying the fires</l></lg>
                     
<lg><l>That genius has kindled on many a pure altar,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Where love and love's author are worshipped
         alone,</l>
<l>Giving merit to penury, truth to the halter,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And Janus-faced impudence scepter and throne.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Ah, well! it is past, youth is over, I know it,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">No more shall the days breathe their olden
         delight;</l>
<l>When Jove seeks the west, nevermore shall the

<l>Nor whispers us soft of some toil-begot merit</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That one day shall bring its reward of true
        praise.</l></lg>

                     <lg><l rend="ti-1">Yet life's bitter wine is far better at forty</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">For then all our good lay in creed, sect and party,</l>
  <l>But now, thanks to sorrow, we cheerfully say</l></lg>

<lg><l>Whatever God places right plainly before us,--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To rise with the future, or tremble and fall,--</l>
<l>That way shall be ours, while we lift up the

<l>All elements of earth, or air, or sun,</l>
<l>That are required to build the pure physique,</l>
<l>The rounded excellence of the perfect form ;</l>
<l>Nay, more than this, from all their hidden founts</l>
<l>She gathers up the vital germs that make</l>
<l>The new force of her offspring, and again</l>
<l>The mystery of human life renews.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The father does but quicken, she it is</l>

      growth</l></lg>

<lg><l>And yet more marvelous the office seems</l>
<l>The mother fills, wherein from out the sou</l>
<l>That fills and thrills the universe, she draws</l>
<l>The powers, whose limits man can not define</l>
<l>That gathered in one whole we christen mind,</l>
<l>The spirit that can thread the universe,</l>

<l>Or dwell securely in a beggar's hut,</l>
<l>Courting the friendship of a mangy dog</l>
<l>Whose thought is scarce inferior to its own.</l></lg>

<lg><l>These powers we can not fathom; these we think</l>

<l>The procreatress of immortal minds</l>
<l>Touched deeply with the essence of her own</l>
<l>And of the soul of him her love adores.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Aye! here's a mystery of His handiwork--</l>

<l>The infinite spirit that provoketh life</l>
<l>Binds mortal and immortal into one,</l>

<l>For all of frightful, pastoral, sublime,</l>

<l>In all her aspirations, acts, desires,</l>

<lg><l>And now, before the roses bloom,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A richer rose is in the glen,</l>
<l>Where redbud in the forest gloom</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Has lit her vernal torch again.</l></lg>

<lg><l>A thousand coming splendors show</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In those soft tufts of crimson flowers,</l>
<l>Prophetic of the ardent flow</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of life and growth in glad June hours.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Where, peeping up from winrowed leaves</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of last year's fall, the stellar eye</l>
<l>Of pale anemone perceives</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And greets once more the April sky,</l></lg>

<lg><l>I stand, a child again, and see</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The seraph forms of other days</l>
<l>Float 'round the flaming Judas tree</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">With jocund mirth and cheerful praise.</l></lg>

<lg><l>I count no more the varied store</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">These budding fields and woods shall bring,</l>
<l>But lightly walk the pleasant shore</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of endless youth and boundless spring.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The buck-eye's leaves are broadly green,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The ash puts forth its tiny hands</l>
<l>Of new-born verdure, while serene-</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A gauzy joy--the willow stands.</l></lg>
            
<lg><l>I hear the squirrel's bark ring out,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The frogs are chattering in the pool,</l>
<l>By lane and field I hear the shout</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of children just released from school.</l></lg>
            
<lg><l>Spring starts the sap and thrills the blood,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And gives new life and song and cheer</l>
<l>To fill the earth as with a flood</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of budding bliss, but once a year.</l></lg>

<lg><l>So life's warm tides in billows rise</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And overflow the soul with joy,</l>
<l>In that sweet season when the skies</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Bend fondly down for girl and boy.</l></lg>

<lg><l>To those glad days of ardent life</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The redbud's splendor calls us back</l>
<l>From fruitless toil and bootless strife,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To walk again the pleasant track</l></lg>

<lg><l>That leads beneath the rural shade,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Where once we watched the opening
      spring,</l>
<l>And--eager lad and trusting maid--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Saw hope's sweet swallows taking wing.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Alas! their flight has been too high,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">They never perched for you or me;</l>
<l>But still we love the soft spring sky</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And bless the crimson Judas tree.</l></lg></div3>

<l>Let its ecstasies awaken,</l>
<l>As the evening mists are fading</l>
<l>From the path the sun has painted,</l>
<l>Many sorrowing souls forsaken,</l>
<l>And, their loneliness invading,</l>
<l>Overflow them, fill them, thrill them</l>
<l>With a rapture all pervading.</l></lg>

<l>All his spirit,--he will deem it</l>
<l>But the maid's melodious sighing.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Blow, oh, blow the enchanting bugle!</l>
<l>Let it fill the cot and mansion</l>

<lg><l>H<hi rend="sc">e</hi> was a poet, and his prophet eyes</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Were large and dark, and dreamily beheld</l>
<l>Bliss in the fields and wonders in the skies,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Joys for the future, shadowy myths of eld,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Or saw fame templed in a drop of dew,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">And Cupid nestling where the violets grew.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The vocal seasons, silent as their songs,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And cold as their dead lovers' empty nests,</l>
<l>Had passed to join the unreturning throngs,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The armies of oblivion's dreamless guests;</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">And yet the poet tarried, with a tear,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">To sing his comfort to the dying year.</l></lg>


<pb

<lg><l>And while he lingered, lo! a silence sped</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Across the heavens and under all the stars;</l>
<l>The old year made no sign, and he was dead,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Dead in his beauty; neither wounds nor scars</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Nor aught that man had wronged him with
           was there</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">In his dead face nor on his snowy hair.</l></lg>

<lg><l>A peace abounding as the peace of God</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Fell on the poet's spirit, and a thrill</l>
<l>Of instant joy that warmed and spread abroad</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Quickened the peace, but made it holier still.</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">He turned his raptured vision toward the
           morn,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">And knew, at once, another year was born.</l></lg>

<lg><l>"And I have watched," he cried, "the fruitful
           sun</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Rise o'er the gardens of the enamored east,</l>
<l>Heard the last echo when the song was done,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Sipped the best wine at fancy's royal feast,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">But never such calm sea of joy as this</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Lapped all my soul in gentle waves of bliss.</l></lg>

<lg><l>"Silent is death, and life comes silently,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">But joy and music grow with life's increase,</l>
<l>And love, that dreams and hopes abundantly,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Sings the lone song whose echoes shall not
          cease;</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">The new springs ever, with rejoicing breath,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">To claim the victory o'er decay and death."</l></lg>

<lg><l>O poet! singing to thy happy heart,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Pleased with the bubble that thy breath has
          blown,</l>
<l>Glad to renew this dear old dream of art</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And think it a creation of thy own,</l>

  <l rend="ti-2">The day is waking, fraud and hate and wrong,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">With morn's first blush will drown thy feeble
                    song!</l></lg>

         <lg><l>But words of doubt were lost on him. He knew</l>
           <l rend="ti-1">Of force and murder and the rabble's cry,</l>
         <l>And many false gods worshipped, and the true</l>
           <l rend="ti-1">Messiah still led forth to bleed and die:</l>
           <l rend="ti-2">"Yet these things ripen," so he said, "the
                    grain</l>
           <l rend="ti-1">Of love's rich harvest for eternal gain.</l></lg>
          
         <lg><l>"The fields are greener when the storms are past,</l>
           <l rend="ti-1">The woods are lovelier when the winter flies,</l>
         <l>The gloomy day, by shadows overcast,</l>
           <l rend="ti-1">Presages purer air and sunnier skies,</l>
             <l>And every new year brings increase of good</l>
             <l>To weld the links of human brotherhood."</l></lg>

         <lg><l>Ah, well! He was a poet, and his dream</l>
           <l rend="ti-1">Ran on in poet fashion, more and more</l>
         <l>Inspired, and instinct with the happy theme,--</l>
           <l rend="ti-1">The endless joy the future holds in store.</l>
             <l>He was a poet, and the dawning light</l>
             <l>Ripened to noon and faded into night;</l></lg>

         <lg><l>Ripened and faded as the bud and leaf,</l>
           <l rend="ti-1">And many men go on their cruel ways,</l>
         <l>The earth is dark with violence and grief,--</l>
           <l rend="ti-1">Yet hope increases with increasing days,</l>
             <l>And each glad poet from his heart of June</l>
             <l>Sings every year a more exultant tune.</l></lg></div3>

<lg><l>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> hills are all shrouded in mantles of snow--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A silence of white, cold and pulseless as death;</l>
<l>Yet, somehow, I hear but the summer winds blow,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And scent the faint musk of the roses' sweet
         breath.</l></lg>

<lg><l>I wander afar, where his wind-cradled nest</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The oriole swingeth aloft to the spray,</l>
<l>When the blossom-crowned June with the wheat
        in her crest</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Bids the robin sing love at the dawning of day;</l></lg>

<lg><l>Where the plowmen go out, when the morning is
        young,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To stir the fresh earth at the roots of the corn,</l>
<l>And the country lass trills homely airs with a
        tongue</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Unskilled in the language of flattery or scorn;</l></lg>

<lg><l>And the hours move like music the soul loveth

  <l rend="ti-1">Makes the fair river blush from her source to
        the sea.</l></lg>

<lg><l>O! the world is so fair and the days are so sweet,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That heaven lies yonder a bliss all unsought,</l>
<l>And time moves along on swift, rose-sandaled feet</l>

<lg><l>The wings of night birds fan the restful air,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The insect choirs are musically glad;</l>
<l>Come from thy want of leisure, bent with care,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Poor drudging worm, and be no longer sad!</l>
<l>The day was long, but morning's gladness soon</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Became a memory, and the fiery heat</l>
<l>Flamed all about thee in the blazing noon,--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Toil in the fields and turmoil in the street;</l></lg>

<lg><l>Toil for thy hands and conflict for thy thought,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">With hopes deferred and aspirations dead,</l>
<l>For thou hast sown for other reapers, wrought</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That others might enjoy, and thou hast shed</l>
<l>Thy sweat and blood and tears for those who
         shine</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In jewels and fine raiment, gath'ring gain</l>
<l>And bleaching their soft hands at cost of thine,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">So hard and seamed with unrequited pain.</l></lg>

<lg><l>They sport their riches, sing their idle songs,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And dance like moths about th' unhallowed
         fires</l>
<l>That they are feeding with thy crying wrongs,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Nor note the gloom in which thy life expires;</l>
<l>No matter now! the stars are in the sky,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The day's last purple fades with night's increase;</l>
<l>Lift up thy soul in thanks, for God is nigh,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And in His presence there is joy and peace!</l></lg>

<lg><l>Soon the globed dew shall settle on thy cheek,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And spiders spin their webs across thy breast,</l>
<l>And night hawks call to thee, who will not
        speak,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">So deep, so perfect then shall be thy rest;</l>
<l>And men shall note the still, unmeasured calm,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The silent wonder in thy pallid face,</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">And here, in this sad neighborhood,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">We scarcely dream of earthly good;</l>
<l>Our joyful times are times of prayer,</l>
<l>When we ascend the heavenly stair</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">With feet that used to idly stray</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Where youth and pleasure led the way--</l>
<l>Ah! youth and pleasure! did we know</l>
<l>Such worldly raptures long ago?</l></lg>

<lg><l>I did not think that, evermore,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The memories of my youth would rise,</l>
<l>Except as follies to deplore,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Sweet pictures that deceive our eyes:</l>
<l>And so I nursed my fifty years,</l>

<l>I could not other than rejoice</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In his old ways of pleasantness,</l>
<l>Till backward flew the circling years,</l>
<l>Forgotten were our cares and tears;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">My heart beat faster, and my blood</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Ran on, a warmer, swifter flood;</l>
<l>No more I thought of deep distress,</l>
<l>Endured for primal wickedness,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Nor struggled with the doubt and thrall</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of Eve's deep sin and Adam's fall;</l>

<l>But all my soul did overflow</l>
   <l>With blessed joys of long ago.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And James, who seldom smiles, as thou</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Remembrest, doubtless, laughed and said</l>
<l>That "really--he knew not how--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">But Joe could surely raise the dead</l>
<l>With that old heartsome way of his,</l>
<l>So robust in its manlinesss,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And yet so tender, sweet and true,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">So tinged with life's exultant hue."</l>
<l>And when his wife and girls chimed in--</l>
<l>Perhaps it may have been a sin--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Our hearts grew light, our souls grew young</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And all sweet measures said or sung,</l>
<l>Fell on my senses, soft and low,</l>
<l>Just as they did so long ago.</l></lg>

<lg><l>So long ago, when Joe and I</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Were nearer by a shade than friends,</l>
<l>When softly beamed the morning sky,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And life seemed made for blissful ends;</l>
<l>Again we chatted down the path,</l>
<l>With jest and song, and merry laugh;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">We mingled in the sport and play</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That ends the rustic holiday;</l>
<l>We won our airy conquests o'er,</l>
<l>Recounted all the frugal store</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of joys our humble youth had given,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And spoke of some dear friends in heaven,</l>
<l>And Joe's glad voice, it thrilled me so,</l>
<l>I smelled the pinks of long ago.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And Joe, he seems so young and fair,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Is so compassionate and kind,</l>
<l>And wishes every one to share</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The largess of his own free mind--</l>

<l>So bound with every suffering soul,</l>
<l>So glad to make the wounded whole--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That fasts, renunciations, prayers,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">He scarcely counts among his cares;</l>
<l>But smiles and says, "Perhaps your creed</l>
<l>Is all you claim; but kindly deed,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And loving heart and open hand,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Control me with a sure command,</l>
<l>That o'er my life began to grow</l>
<l>When we were children long ago."</l></lg>

<lg><l>And though I pity his poor doubt,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Or fancy so, I watch his face,</l>
<l>And try to make the secret out</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of all its manly strength and grace,</l>
<l>And how, beneath his fifty years,</l>
<l>He still a boy at heart appears.</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">He has known sorrows, such as break</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The wills of braver men, and make</l>
<l>Life's pathway blossomless and bare,</l>
<l>Or lit by passion's baleful glare;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Or one that leads to some sad cell</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Where earth-denying hermits dwell;</l>
<l>But Joe, each year, is more like Joe,</l>
<l>The glad heart of the long ago.</l></lg>

<lg><l>I cannot analyze his thought,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Nor answer why his presence brings</l>
<l>My petty cares and griefs to naught,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And makes me think of happy things;</l>
<l>Nor why--O, friend! am I to blame?--</l>
<l>His dark eyes thrill my mental frame,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Till I, who love my James so well,</l>

  <lg><l>Till now he comes, the flower of spring</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">And fruit of summer all in one,</l>
 <l>And finds me old, a withered thing,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">A stalk long blanched by storm and sun;</l>
  <l>With much self-introspection worn,</l>
  <l>Taught that 'tis woman's lot to mourn</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Eve's primal sin, and work and wait</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">In sadness, for the heavenly gate,</l>
 <l>On golden hinges swinging wide,</l>
 <l>To give her room to creep inside</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Behind the crowds of saints, and raise,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Half guiltily, her song of praise.</l>
 <l>He comes!--this old broad-shouldered Joe--</l>
 <l>And warms me with the long ago.</l></lg>
               
 <lg><l>He laughs, and sings an idle song,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">And jests--such jests would try me so</l>
 <l>From any of the common throng;--</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">But, somehow, seem all right from Joe--</l>

   <l rend="ti-1">Reaped precious fruits of heavenly gain."</l>
 <l>O, this rare heretic, this Joe,</l>
 <l>My heart he's filled with long ago!</l></lg>

    waves</l>
         <l rend="ti-1">With noises of earthquakes and yawning of

<l>Slew once in that valley of dread.</l></lg>

  <l rend="ti-1">That subtlest influence of the poet's art</l>
<l>That tells the poet's love in melody</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Which, like a flood, o'erflows the yearning heart,</l>

<l>The gentle raptures of the rhythm's flow.</l></lg>

<l>Cry: "Here, dear friend! I heed your pleading
      rhymes,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Give me your hand. I'll squeeze it somewhat
      sore,</l>
<l>And make you shout: Hold on, sir, not so hard!</l>
<l>If that means love, pray give me less regard."</l></lg>

<lg><l>That fickle goddess, Fortune, did you dream</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That she is but an idle, lazy sprite,</l>
<l>Who never dares to cross a swollen stream,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Nor brave the perils of a starless night,</l>

<l>Than I can mention of our singing brood,</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">That his form lieth low in the clay;</l>
<l>That his vision prophetic has fled</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">From the light and the gladness of day.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But they who speak thus must be wrong,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">For just now I was with him in Spain,</l>
<l>And heard the improviso's song,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And the muleteer's mountain refrain.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Then we wandered through Europe once more,</l>

<lg><l>At Nuremburg's haunted old town</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">We revelled with Dürer in art,</l>
  <l>And quaffed at the beverage so brown,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That warmed Sach's musical heart.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And the Rhine that we wandered beside</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Is a stream that no mortals have known</l>
  <l>Except those rare spirits that bide</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In poesy's magical zone.</l></lg>
                
  <lg><l>There Goethe and Schiller sang loud,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Philosophy, Germany, art,</l>
<l>And Muller's melodious crowd</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Sang low to the love-burdened heart.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Then, dropping each hindrance of time,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And pluming the Spirit's wide wings,</l>
<l>We neared the great summit sublime,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Where Sandalphon, the prayer-angel, sings.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Now turned with The Angels to bless</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The homes and the hearthstones of men,</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">The Psalm of Life over again.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Love, beautiful, deathless, divine,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">By the dark waves of Minas we met,</l>
<l>Where the winds taught the hemlock and pine</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Songs of longing and sighs of regret.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But Evangeline faded too soon,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Like a star on the brink of the morn,</l>
<l>Like a rose in the fullness of June,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Like a solo far wound from the horn.</l></lg>
                
<lg><l>Then how sweet were The Voices of Night,</l>

 <l>We heard the wild chant to its close,</l>

<l>On the glad hills, and turn to walk the vale</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">My soul away from all the festal halls,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The flickering lights, the rows of painted walls,</l>
<l>To the sweet country and its sweeter homes.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The little graves I know are by the wood,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The children's school is very near at hand,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And nearer still the little church doth stand;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A mile away dear father owned some land,</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">And hours of love grew into lovely days,</l>
<l>And so they lived and grew in joyous ease.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But when there neared a time of wild despair,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">When death was curdling all the sister's blood,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">She bade me take her gently as I could,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Into the shadows of that pleasant wood,</l>
<l>Once more, once more, to breathe its balmy air.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Her thankful eyes, her failing, thankful voice,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">I see, I hear; I never shall forget</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The sad-eyed brother with his cheeks so wet;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Through all the years I see the children yet;</l>
<l>I see them yet, nor have I any choice,</l></lg>

<lg><l>But pour my soul in a melodious rain,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Half tears and half a melancholy rune,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A roundelay for those who died so soon,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A slender thread of song in saddest tune,</l>
<l>A rill of music from a fount of pain.</l></lg>

  <l rend="ti-1">The sister died, the brother smiling still</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Passed on, his little mission to fulfill,</l>
<l>A few short days, then rested at her side.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Where are the children? in what pleasant dawns</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Do they arise to hear the morning bird,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To see the glittering dew drops lightly stirred</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">On pendant sprays, to call the bleating herd</l>
<l>From their green breakfast on the emerald lawns?</l></lg>

<lg><l>Or, when the sun goes down at shut of day,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To watch the wonder of the painted mist,--</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">Now bowers of rest where angels might keep

<lg><l>Perhaps all seasons where the children roam</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">And they, forgetful of our little days,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Move on and on in ever widening ways</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">Their forms are dust, their little lusters fled.</l>
<l>They are but ashes, ashes! what are we?</l></lg>

<lg><l>What! they but ashes! Do we vainly trust,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That these poor bodies which so soon decay</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Are but the caskets, wrought of finest clay,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In which we hide each through his little day,</l>
<l>Then soar away and let them go to dust?</l></lg>

<lg><l>I cannot think of death as aught but change;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The eggs must break to let young eagles out,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The acorns burst before the oaks can sprout</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And the worn body sink in gloom and doubt,</l>
<l>To give the spirit free to widest range.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The years we live are but a passing breath,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">But one poor quaver in an endless song,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A ripple, where a million oceans throng;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And he who tarries longest stays not long</l>
<l>From the unknown results that follow death.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Whatever those results may be, we trust</l>

<lg><l>T<hi rend="sc">HERE</hi> is no comfort in an idle word</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">When sorrow touches all the strings of life,</l>
<l>And voiceless sadness, with a step unheard,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Glides through the halls and stills the noise of
      strife.</l></lg>

<lg><l>There is no music in the flow of song</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To ears that covet silence, or that ache</l>
<l>For words whose echoes have been memories long,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Renewed forever for a dear one's sake.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And yet a friend may come, without offense,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And offer tribute to a mother's worth;</l>
<l>For well he knows the sorrow, the intense</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Deep anguish of a child when the cold earth</l></lg>

<lg><l>Falls on a mother's coffin, and he feels</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That light and love and joy are gone away;</l>
<l>And no fond dream of future bliss reveals</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To his sad eyes so sweet, so glad a day</l></lg>

<lg><l>As any single day of all the past</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Wherein she cradled him upon her knee,</l>
<l>Or watched his toddling steps increasing fast</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In strength and purpose, and benignantly</l></lg>

<lg><l>Gave of her life and toils increasing store</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of blessings on his head, as years went by,</l>
<l>Until the heart that gave could give no more,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The soul that blessed sought blessedness on high.</l></lg>
                    
<lg><l>Ah me! the sorrow for a mother's death</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">No pen can paint, no tender strain reveal;</l>
<l>Words are but clamor, song an idle breath,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And filial grief stabs like the dull, cold steel.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But yet, to him who looks beyond the tomb</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">For life's best outcome, there is solace, hope,</l>
<l>For, as a flower of never-fading bloom,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A mother's face lights up the future's scope.</l></lg>

<lg><l>More musical than music's soul the voice,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The mother voice that fills our sunniest dreams,</l>
<l>Of that fair land where we shall yet rejoice</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">As guileless children by the happy streams.</l></lg>

<lg><l>O mothers, mothers! we shall come to you,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And as you gladdened when the anguish past</l>
<l>And we were born, so shall your joys renew</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">When we are with you safely housed at last.</l></lg>

<lg><l>A mother's love outreacheth time and change,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">It is compassion more compassionate;</l>
<l>Intense, yet broad as life's divergent range,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">It follows, follows, like a haunting fate.</l></lg>
                    
<lg><l>No heaven so high it cannot bless us there,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">No hell so deep it dare not tempt to save;</l>
<l>It will not falter even when despair</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Were happiness, and a delight the grave.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The child who knows such love can never know</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Forgetfulness of her who gave it him;</l>
<l>He may be wrecked on darkest shores of woe,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Or pain may rack and rend him limb by limb,</l></lg>

<lg><l>Or sin may blight, or passion burn him dry,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">But through all depths the mother love shall
       hold</l>
<l>Its stellar glory in his spirit's sky,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In his soul's rubbish be the coin of gold.</l></lg>

<lg><l>O mother love, call home, call home to thee</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Thy wandering children, when the day is done,</l>
<l>And when the lights go out for us, and we</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Lie down to rest, our little courses run,</l></lg>

<lg><l>Be it in hope that on some future morn,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Sooner or later, in the sinless lands,</l>
<l>The souls whose joy was great when we were
      born</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Shall lead us with their dear maternal hands,--</l></lg>

<lg><l>Their dear maternal hands, where love endures,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And is requited, where the poet's dream</l>
<l>Of heaven and happiness no more allures</l>
  <l rend="ti-1"> And vanishes like shadows on a stream,</l></lg>

<lg><l>But is the substance of most real things,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The primal joy of joys that shall increase,</l>
<l>Sweet as the murmurous stir of angel wings,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That smooth war's front with messages of peace.</l></lg></div3>

<div3 type="poem"><head rend="center">THE WHITE WATER BAR</head>


  <l>[Read at the annual Bar Picnic, Saturday, June 30th, 1883]</l>
<lg><l>I R<hi rend="sc">ECOGNIZE</hi> your able plea</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And make my answer true;</l>
<l>Though every old authority</l>
<l>Declare all law and equity</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And precedent with you.</l></lg>

<lg><l>I fain would join you on the green,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Where youthful Summer stands</l>
<l>In woods that rise, the fields between,</l>
<l>Which Ceres rules--a peaceful queen,--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And sows with bounteous hands:</l></lg>

<lg><l>Where wigless lawyer, lawyer meets,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And ungowned judges walk;</l>
<l>Where Friendship scatters myriad sweets</l>
<l>More precious than the bard's conceits</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Or any learned talk.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But distance, which "enchantment lends"</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Restrains the eager thought</l>
<l>Of long-loved scenes and absent friends,</l>
<l>And so my homeward vision ends,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A blossom fruiting nought</l></lg>

<lg><l>But memories fair of other days</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And love that waiting stands</l>
<l>To pipe your joy in hopeful lays,</l>
<l>Or fly across the weary ways</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To shake your friendly hands.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Since Blackstone bade his lyre farewell</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And turned him with a sigh,</l>

<l>To garner up the law and tell</l>
<l>To ages, that should love him well,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Its truth and majesty,</l></lg>
  
<lg><l>I doubt if any land has shown</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A bar with higher aims</l>
<l>Than this White Water vale has known,</l>
<l>Or one whose history has been strown</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">With more deserving names.</l></lg>
  
<lg><l>Deserving names! a noble throng!</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Yet memory holds but few</l>
<l>Of all, to shrine in slender song:</l>
<l>No matter! Each shall linger long</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In loyal souls and true.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Here, O. H. Smith, Websterian, strong,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And sprightly Rariden,</l>
<l>Quick witted, brilliant, led the throng</l>
<l>Of younger men, who moved along</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The legal foot-paths then.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Here, Blackstone of the early bar,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Safe Newman built his fame,</l>
<l>And Parker shone a splendid star,</l>
<l>And Cale. Smith's silvery tongue afar</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Wafted the Hoosier name.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Here, too, the mind of Perkins grew</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Judicial, earnest, broad;</l>
<l>And Elliott, patient, honest, true,</l>
<l>Lived out his life, and rose from view,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A just Judge to his God.</l></lg>
  
<lg><l>And Nimrod Johnson, poet soul,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Whose life was like a lute,</l>
<l>Attuned to tender thought's control,</l>
<l>Here early won his aureole,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And here grew cold and mute.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And here McCarty, Borden, Reed,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Farquhar and Holland rose;</l>
<l>Each measured knowledge by his deed,</l>
<l>And won the earnest lawyer's meed,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And gained the sure repose.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Here Leonard grew of hero mold,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To die in Freedom's Cause;</l>
<l>And Johnson's stately years were told;</l>
<l>And Polk knew honor's touch of gold;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And Woodward won applause.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Be kindly thought a moment staid</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Where safe our neighbor's keep</l>
<l>The spots where Hackleman is laid,</l>
<l>Where Robinson's low bed is made,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And Sleeth and Sexton sleep.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And Walter March, above whose clay</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The clods are broken yet,</l>
<l>Learned, gifted, open as the day,</l>
<l>And simple as a child at play!</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Who shall his fame forget?</l></lg>

<lg><l>'Twas here that patriot giant grew,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Who in the stormy days</l>
<l>Held firm the ship while tempests blew,</l>
<l>Till all the watchful nations knew</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Triumphant Morton's praise.</l></lg>

<lg><l>We knew his steps that others see</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Through fame's empurpled view;</l>
<l>The brave, strong man, who dared to be</l>
<l>A leader then; his memory</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To us is ever new!</l></lg>

<lg><l>But think not all the wise are dead</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">This lovely vale can claim;</l>

  <l>For yet full many a stately head</l>
  <l>Survives where honor's light is shed,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To share a generous fame.</l></lg>
    
  <lg><l>Round gray-haired Perry, Yaryan, Test,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">What crowding memories throng!</l>
  <l>They knew White Water as "The West,"</l>
  <l>When lawyers were in buckskin dressed</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">And circuit rides were long.</l></lg>
    
  <lg><l>They knew when all the country round</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Came up through storm and cold,</l>
  <l>To hear the Judge's charge profound,</l>
 <l> And listen to the eloquent sound</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">The pleader made of old.</l></lg>
    
  <lg><l>They knew when from Ohio's side</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">To swampy Kankakee,</l>
  <l>The lawyer would on horseback ride,</l>
  <l>And never dream of wounded pride--</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">In quest of cause and fee.</l></lg>
    
  <lg><l>But reminiscence often tires</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">When hope is full and strong;</l>
  <l>The young man struggles and aspires,</l>
  <l>And thus are kept alive the fires</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Of Law as well as song.</l></lg>
    
  <lg><l>White Water bears an honored name,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">No time nor change can mar;</l>
  <l>Be yours to magnify its fame,</l>
  <l>Increase its glory, add no shame,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">But many a growing star.</l></lg>
    
  <lg><l>And now, lest you should file <hi rend="i">complaint</hi>,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1"><hi rend="i">Demur</hi>, or pray <hi rend="i">divorce</hi>,</l>
  <l>I think this echo, far and faint,</l>
  <l>Had best withdraw its pleadings quaint,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">And let law have its course.</l></lg>

  <l rend="ti-1">Above all minor melodies;</l>
<l>Nor his the lurid fame that glows</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">O'er war's red field of agonies.</l></lg>

  <l rend="ti-1">The wealth that passeth every praise,</l>

<l>The light that fadeth not away.</l></lg>

  <l rend="ti-1"> A blind, sweet goddess living still</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Untrammeled by the venal will</l>
<l>That ever works a sure decline.</l></lg>

  <l rend="ti-1">In calm pursuance of an end,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In truth to client, love to friend,</l>
<l>Such life is never lived for naught.</l></lg>

<l>Dost pant for wild Selachian pleasures</l>

  <lg><l>D<hi rend="sc">EAR</hi> Penina, I've been thinking,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">While the sun was sinking low,</l>
  <l>Of the past, and deeply drinking</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">From the springs of long ago;</l>
  <l>And, somehow, through mists of sadness,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">One fair form arises still,</l>
  <l>Filling all my soul with gladness,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Charming me from every ill.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>Looking westward, sat I dreaming</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">In the fading light of day,</l>
  <l>Till again I saw the gleaming</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Of a church spire far away,</l>
  <l>And the people, happy-hearted,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Going through the open door:--</l>
  <l>You, a bride, that day departed</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">And my heart was bruised and sore.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>Youth is strong to turn from sorrow,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">"Hope springs ever in the breast,"</l>
  <l>And there came a brighter morrow</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Where my soul found peace and rest,</l>
  <l>While my hands toiled for another,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Fairer than the blush of morn,</l>

   <l>Urge me not some trite objection;</l>
     <l rend="ti-1">Hasten to me; be my bride.</l></lg>

            <head rend="subtitle">(Two Weeks Old)</head>

<lg><l>G<hi rend="sc">OOD</hi> morning to Nellie!</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">You're welcome, young lady!</l>
<l>This country is large</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And there's lots of room in it;</l>
<l>But life is not long:</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Though when babies begin it</l>
<l>It seems like an age</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Ere they learn to go walking,</l>
<l>Leave crying and puling</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">For laughing and talking;</l>
<l>And here, darling Nellie,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Let uncle remind you,</l>
<l>There's many a rude blast</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And ill wind that will find you;</l>
<l>And many a hard ache,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Both for heart and for cranium,</l>
<l>Nor is half the world grows</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Either rose or geranium.</l></lg>

<lg><l>There are shadows for young folks,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And sorrows for old ones;</l>

<l>There are fires, for the hot folks,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And frosts for the cold ones,</l>
 <l>But, somehow, I think,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Though I can't just explain it,</l>
 <l>That life bears a blessing</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">For each, could he gain it;</l>
 <l>But few win the guerdon</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Or some never know it</l>
 <l>Till it slips from their hands</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Like success from a poet;</l>
<l>But still, Nellie dear,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">There are valleys where roses</l>
<l>Bloom sweet as the west</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">When a summer day closes.</l>
<l>God grant, little niece,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That your path may lead through them,</l>
<l>And that all things you do</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">May be blest as you do them.</l></lg>

<lg><l>So here's a warm welcome</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To earth and her mysteries,</l>
<l>Her mountains and rivers,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Her rock-written histories,</l>
<l>Her woods and her fields,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Cities, gardens and meadows,</l>
<l>Her bountiful sunshine,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Her sweet, pensive shadows.</l></lg>

<lg><l>You'll find, little lassie,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Some leisure for dollies,</l>
<l>And things that delight</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Baby girls, ere the follies</l>
<l>Of fashion come in</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To destroy that illusion</l>
<l>Of child-world that blesses</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In boundless profusion.</l></lg>

  <lg><l>You'll find much to learn,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">And will learn much that better</l>
  <l>No doubt, be unknown,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">For this life, like a letter,</l>
  <l>Will bring you some tidings</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">To set your eyes streaming,</l>
  <l>And some that will put them</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">To dancing and beaming.</l>
  <l>So Nellie, sweet Nellie,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">Here's a welcome unflagging!</l>
  <l>You're in the world with us,</l>
    <l rend="ti-1">And the world is a-wagging.</l></lg></div3>

<lg><l>B<hi rend="sc">Y</hi> the border of a woodland,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In a cabin, rude and low,</l>
<l>Dwelt a young lad with his mother,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In the days of long ago:</l>
<l>And that mother was a widow</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And her daily joy did flow</l>
<l>From the cheerful, earnest labors</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of the lad called "Whistling Joe;"</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">As he whistled in the morning</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">Many a snatch of gleesome tune,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Or at evening hummed a ditty</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">To the old man in the moon,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Mocking all the merry song birds</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">That he heard from bush or tree,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">From the gusty joy of blackbirds</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">To the chirp of chickadee.</l></lg>
      
<lg><l>"Mother, dear, I am so happy</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That I've strength to toil for you,</l>
<l>That my spirits will run over,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And I can't be sad nor blue,"</l>


<pb

<l>Said the merry little fellow,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And no doubt his words were true,</l>
<l>For next moment rose his whistle</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In the tune of "Bonnets Blue;"</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Then he echoed back the barking</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">Of the squirrel on the tree,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Mocked the rollic of the robin</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">And the thrushes' happy glee,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Set the comic cat-bird laughing</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">At his own mosaic lay,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">At the whistle of the grosbeak</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">And the cackle of the jay.</l></lg>

<lg><l>"Oh, dear widow!" cried the deacon,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">With his face so sad and long,</l>
<l>"That wild boy of yours, I'm certain,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Will be up to something wrong;</l>
<l>So much levity, good woman,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Shows old Satan's influence strong:"</l>
<l>But just then the lad came homeward,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And his mouth was full of song,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">And he sang "The day is over,</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">And its memory I bless,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">For I've earned a silver dollar</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">And I've bought my ma a dress,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Which will make her look so comely,</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">As she walks to church, I guess,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">That she'll feel once more the sunshine</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">Of her girlish happiness."</l></lg>

<lg><l>Then the widow smiled and answered,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Very pleasantly and low,</l>
<l>"Josy loves me, labors for me,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Soothes my every pain and woe,</l>
<l>And I've not the heart, good Deacon--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">He enjoys his racket so--</l>
<l>To forbid the noise and gladness</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">Of my dear, big-hearted Joe,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">As he chirrups with the crickets</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">At his labor all the day,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">And comes happy homeward singing</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">When the dusk is growing gray;</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">And the music of his whistle</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">And his voice's merry play,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Are the sounds that most delight me</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">As my evening fades away."</l></lg>

<lg><l>Growling surlily, the deacon</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Pulled his hat upon his head,</l>
<l>And rejoined,"O, wicked woman,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Be his sins upon thy head!"</l>
<l>Then he strode away so solemn,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Looking wise as any owl</l>
<l>While Joe, toiling in the garden,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Mocked that melancholy fowl,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">With "tu whit, tu whit, tu whoo!</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">I'm the pride of all the wood,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">'Tis but little that I do,</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">But I'm goody, goody, good.</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Pretty song birds I devour,</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">Little chicks I murder, too,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">I can't bear the cheerful light,</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">But I'm wise and good, tu whoo!"</l></lg>

<lg><l>So the days and years ran by them</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And the widow's skies were fair,</l>
<l>For the sunshine of Joe's nature</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Banished darkness and despair.</l>
<l>Yet, for all his noise and gladness,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Not a thoughtless lad was he,</l>
<l>But he loved his books and papers</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And he labored joyfully:</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Singing where the flowers were blooming,</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">Whistling loud behind the plow.</l>

  <l rend="ti-2">Chattering, as the fragrant clover</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">He prepared for stack or mow;</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Never pining, nor regretting</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">At his poverty, this boy</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Deftly wrought life's earnest purpose</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">To the melody of joy.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Now that mother knows the silence</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That befalleth all below,</l>
<l>And her son, no longer answering</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To the name of "Whistling Joe,"</l>
<l>Gathers sons and daughters round him</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And proclaims the rule of joy,</l>
<l>Saying to each smiling daughter</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And broad-shouldered, lusty boy,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">"Love and happiness will flourish</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">And fair virtue bud and bloom,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Better in the air of gladness</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">Than in atmospheres of gloom:</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Hatred, selfishness and passion</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">Die when song begins to flow,</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">And the joy that lightens burdens</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">In the thankful heart will grow.</l></lg>


<lg><l>"Better whistle at your labor</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Than to nourish sordid schemes;</l>
<l>Better wed your thoughts to music</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Than to mope through gloomy dreams;</l>
<l>Better worship God in gladness</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">As you ply your humble toil,</l>
<l>Than split hairs with theologians</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Or dig pitfalls in the soil</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">For a thoughtless brother's downfall;</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">Better sinless fancy's play</l>
  <l rend="ti-2">Than the grim ascetic's dogmas;</l>
  <l rend="ti-3">Better act than merely pray."</l>

  <l rend="ti-2">Then the old man whistles lightly</l>

  <l rend="ti-3">Singing "Long live Whistling Joe."</l></lg></div3>
        

             <div3 type="poem"><head rend="center">THE VACATION</head>
             
<lg><l>H<hi rend="sc">E</hi> went on a summer vacation,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The first one he ever had known;</l>
<l>He was sixty, had worked like the nation,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Owned merchandise, cattle and corn.</l>
<l>His farms were as broad as a prairie,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">His bank account long as a string;</l>
<l>His fortune, that never did vary,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Was always the right sort of thing.</l></lg>

<lg><l>He could grub, he could plow, he could "figger,"</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">He could "boss" in a bank or a shop;</l>
<l>In short he "could work like a nigger"</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">At "bizness" or "maken a crop;"'</l>
<l>But this bus'ness of taking vacation</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">It puzzled and worried him so,</l>
<l>It quickened each pulse's vibration</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And set his old face in a glow.</l></lg>

<lg><l>He went for four weeks to Lake Gumbo,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Where fisherman's candor was born,</l>
<l>Where black bass are bigger than Jumbo,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And wild deer are thick in the corn;</l>
<l>Where the turkeys are tame as mosquitoes,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And woodcock are plentier than snipe</l>
<l>And easier to gather than vetoes</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">When blind widows' pensions are ripe.</l></lg>

<lg><l>He bought him a brand-new breech-loader,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">He purchased a rod and a reel,</l>
<l>A boat and provisions to load her,</l>


<pb
                    id="VAA9488-206"
                    n="214"/>



  <l rend="ti-1">A bait box, a game bag, a creel;</l>
<l>And then he went fishing and gunning,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And waddling and spluttering around,</l>
<l>And sweating and fuming and running,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And wondering where rest would be found.</l></lg>

<lg><l>He shot a tom-tit on a willow,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">He caught a small bream by the tail;</l>
<l>At night as he tossed on his pillow,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">He dreamed that some debtor would fail,</l>
<l>And he, far away 'neath the larches,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A-fighting mosquito and gnat,</l>
<l>Would never know what stealthy marches</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The "other bank fellers" were at.</l></lg>

<lg><l>He rose with the tints of Aurora,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Was ready for work by the dawn;</l>
<l>He was off to the lake in his dory</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Before all the starlight was gone;</l>
<l>He fretted and worried his spirit</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">At lazy men seeking the shade,</l>
<l>Such fellows, he thought, could not merit</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The joys that prosperity made.</l></lg>

<lg><l>"They sleep until six in the morning;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">They skulk from the ardors of noon;</l>
<l>At every small cloud they take warning,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And go from their fishing too soon.</l>
<l>How can such folks enjoy a vacation?</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">So idle and listless are they.</l>
<l>As for me, I'll vacate like the nation;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">I'm set in my mind it shall pay."</l></lg>

<lg><l>He raced and he chased and he fretted,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And dreamed of dire losses by night,</l>
<l>For three sultry days, each regretted</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">As so much clean cash gone from sight;</l>
<l>On the fourth morning, peevish and sighing,</l>


<pb

  <l rend="ti-1">He lay with an ague in bed,</l>
 <l>When the heat came he thought he was dying;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The quinine it roared in his head.</l></lg>
   
 <lg><l>They laid him down soft on a litter,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">They bore him away to the train,</l>
 <l>The train whirled him home, but the glitter</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Of a month of vacation in vain</l>
 <l>Winked, twinkled and dazzled before him</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Thereafter, it tempted no more;</l>
 <l>But never he ceased to deplore him</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">The cost of his outfit and store.</l></lg>
   
<lg><l>He added it several times over</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To the sum of each mortgage he took;</l>
<l>More faithful to it than a lover,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">He figured it down in a book;</l>
<l>His lifetime's one loss, its one sorrow</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That burned his poor soul to the core,</l>
<l>He'd regain it to-day, but to-morrow</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">He'd sigh to regain it once more.</l></lg>
  
<lg><l>Thus fifty times over and over</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">He won back his time and his "tin,"</l>
<l>And still studied hard to discover</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">New tricks to absorb it again.</l>
<l>The thought of that fearful vacation,--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">It haunted and worried him so</l>
<l>That he perished, at last, of vexation,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And died in the wormwood of woe.</l></lg>
  
<lg><l>His heirs reared above his last slumber</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A ten-dollar stone with one lie,--</l>
<l>They could only afford that small number,--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">"Of character noble and high,"</l>
<l>Then turned themselves loose on the booty</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And quarreled and squabbled like fun</l>
<l>Till the lawyers took all--'twas their duty--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And then the vacation was done.</l></lg></div3>

<lg><l>But Christmas is Christmas, you know,</l>

<l>Though constables stand in a row</l>
<l>Down the streets and the roads where I go,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Each armed with subpœna and dun.</l></lg>

<lg><l>I'm eager to see how it goes--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The ball at the Eagle, you guess--</l>
<l>That's it, and the dance at Will Crow's</l>
<l>And the sleighride to Hill's, if it snows,</l>

<lg><l>Last year,--you remember it all,--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">I drove to a banquet at Clyde:</l>
 <l>What happened I cannot recall,</l>
 <l>But think that I grew very tall,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Then wilted and shriveled and died.</l></lg>

 <lg><l>When I woke, with an ache in the head;</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Myself and a pig or two more</l>
 <l>Were playing "dead beat" in a shed,</l>
 <l>Beneath the remains of a sled,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Which sled was my sleigh day before.</l></lg>

 <lg><l>Well, Johnny, I owe for that sleigh,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">And the constable's taken my watch,</l>
<l>But it's not worth five dollars to-day,</l>
<l>'Though forty, I think, is to pay</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">And the note with the squire,--just my notch!</l></lg>

<lg><l>You see I've been bumming around,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And having a great deal of fun:</l>
<l>Have you seen my imported fox hound?</l>
<l>He's the swiftest, so cheap,--why, confound</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">It all! here in my vest is the dun.</l></lg>

<lg><l>"Only thirty-five dollars," Jim writes,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">For such a most marvelous dog;"</l>
<l>And then all his troubles recites,</l>
<l>And gives me the neatest "invites "</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To settle for him and my grog.</l></lg>

<lg><l>You see Jimmy keeps a saloon</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In Jacktown, on Michigan road,</l>
<l>Sells whisky, breeds puppies, buys coon</l>
<l>And all kinds of fur;--well, in June</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">'Twas him sixty dollars I owed.</l></lg>

<lg><l>That included the drams and the pup,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And the fiddle Tom played at the fair;</l>

<l>Now, I think; there's my tailor bill up,</l>
<l>But I'll give the goose-driver a sup</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And get him to wait on that 'ere.</l></lg>
      
<lg><l>It's only a trifle, you see;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And tailors their money don't need;</l>
<l>Two broadcloths at sixty--his fee</l>
<l>Three tweeds, forty each, priced by me,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And then I owe Smith for my feed.</l></lg>
      
<lg><l>If people would only be still</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And remember fun's fun at the worst,</l>
<l>And, no matter who pays the bill,</l>
<l>Each thirsty dog wishes his fill,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">So many fine chaps wouldn't burst.</l></lg>
      
<lg><l>For, argue whatever you may,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">When a fellow is running down stairs,</l>
<l>Every gamin's got something to say</l>
<l>While he kicks you his own proper way,</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">Are not always kind nor polite:</l>
<l>Friends indeed are these jolly fine larks</l>
<l>While your money goes upward like sparks</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">From the chimney a cold winter night.</l></lg>
      
<lg><l>But when empty pockets are left,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">They fly away croaking like crows:</l>
<l>While they curse you, you feel quite bereft</l>
<l>And learn that your fun's had a heft</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">You had never been led to suppose.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Great Caesar! I'd never a thought,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">When I sat down to write, Johnny dear!</l>

<p>Who, I trust, after years of separation, are reunited in the better life,

  <lg><l><hi rend="i">You asked me, dear friends, in the fair month of roses,</hi></l>
   <l><hi rend="i">To write you some verses in elegant rhyme,</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">All radiant with summer and cheerful with posies,</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">And delightfully sweet in their musical chime;</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">And I made for answer, if you will remember,</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">That, though summer glorified all with its blushes,</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">Still deep in my soul was the grief of November,</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">And my sorrowful notes would not chord with
      the thrushes;</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">But said, I would gather the old songs together,--</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">The rude rhymes I chattered in other sad days,</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">The notes that went tripping in all sorts of weather,</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">And sought only your never critical praise.</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">So here I present them, unpruned, the old ditties</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">Of sorrow and love, and the lyrical notions</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">Of freedom and labor; not fit for the cities,</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">But just the rude offspring of country emotions;</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">So take them, dear friends; if they give any pleasure,</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">Or charm you one moment away from your pain,</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">My toil is repaid in that bountiful measure</hi></l>
    <l><hi rend="i">That comes when we know that we've toiled not in
      vain.</hi></l></lg></div3>

 <lg><l>A T<hi rend="i">INY</hi> rill and a little child,</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">In a fair and lovely land,</l>
 <l>And the child has heaped in the water's edge</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">A pile of the yellow sand;</l>
 <l>Then tries to hold the current back</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">With a little dimpled hand.</l></lg>

 <lg><l>But sunken like a rose leaf wet</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">With nectar sweet as dew,</l>
 <l>The little hand beneath the tide</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Transparent meets the view,</l>
<l>And, with the mien of a thoughtful man</l>
   <l rend="ti-1">Who sees a wonder new,</l></lg>

<lg><l>He queries "why they will not stop--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">These drops that laugh and sigh--</l>
<l>I cannot hold them in my grasp;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">They still go rushing by;</l>
<l>They will not pause, they cannot rest;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Do the waters never die?</l></lg>

<lg><l>"They murmur, murmur, as they go;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">I know not what they say;</l>
<l>But yet I think they sing to me</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of a region far away,</l>
<l>Of cities, and domes, and palaces,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A river and a bay.</l></lg>

<lg><l>"Sometimes I hear my robin's voice,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And then my sparrow's song;</l>
<l>And now the blue-jay's rollic call,</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">As the water skips along;</l>
<l>And now my drowned hand is numb,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And the current swift and strong.</l></lg>

<lg><l>"I wonder if the waters think,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And know the things they say,</l>
<l>And why they ripple, and run, and rush,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And journey night and day;</l>
<l>And if they know I watch them here,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">As they tinkle on their way?</l></lg>

<lg><l>"They whisper, whisper the prettiest things!</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">I wish I knew their talk:</l>
<l>It's like the wind when the maple leaves</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Come pattering on the walk;</l>
<l>It's like the rain when it strikes the pads</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">On my tiger-lily stalk.</l></lg>

<lg><l>"It's like--I know not what it's like--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">But it seems to speak to me</l>
<l>Of gliding keels, and sailing ships,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And things that are to be</l>
<l>When I am grown a man, and dwell</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Beside the restless sea.</l></lg>

<lg><l>"And then it sings, 'I grow, I grow;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">I'm here but a little rill;</l>
<l>In the orchard I'm fully a yard across;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In the meadow wider still;</l>
<l>And the children float their little boats</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">On my breast at William's mill.'</l></lg>

<lg><l>"I hear no more the robin's song,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Nor the sparrow's treble call;</l>

<lg><l>A little rill and a wrinkled man,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In a fair and lovely land,</l>
<l>And he has heaped in the water's edge</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A pile of the yellow sand;</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">With a weak and trembling hand.</l></lg>

  <l rend="ti-1">In life's meridian glow,</l>
<l>In the strength of my fifty stalwart years</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To smile on the brooklet's flow.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And then I thought of a little child</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Who, forty years before,</l>
<l>Beheld a vision of wealth and strength,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And wisdom, and love and more--</l>

<lg><l>It seemed to me but yesterday--</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">It seems just so this noon--</l>
<l>That, full of childish hope, I heard</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">This brooklet's lightsome rune,</l>
<l>And, from the slender music, learned</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Life's most exultant tune.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But I was only fifty then;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">My thoughts were hot and wild</l>
<l>With finance, politics, and trade;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">For love was long exiled</l>
<l>From active thought to silent life;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">I soon forgot the child.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But all the toil is over now;</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">My visions long withdrawn;</l>
<l>And so I sit beside the rill,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And think upon the gone,</l>
<l>And feel myself a little child,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">That, in the happy dawn,</l></lg>

<lg><l>Has wakened to the robin's song,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And to the sparrow's call,</l>
<l>And sought the brooklet's yielding verge</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">To hear the measures fall</l>
<l>The tinkling, whispering waters make</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Above the pebbles small.</l></lg>

<lg><l>A child again! yet not a child,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And the brooklet seems to sigh</l>
<l>For the lad it knew, when his years were few,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And his heart was beating high,</l>
<l>For time flows on, as the brook flows on,</l>

<l>To find the heartless world shut out beyond the
    deacon's door,</l>
<l>And there, amidst the warmth and glow, to lay
    her trembling heart,</l>
<l>All bruised and broken, open to the good man's
    healing art.</l>

<l>For he had ears to hear the cry of souls that suffer 
  pain,</l>
<l>And yearning sorrow never sought his sympathy
    in vain:</l>
<l>His words were few, his counsels wise, his faith
    and hope sincere,</l>
<l>And so the mourning woman spake while stifling
    many a tear:</l></lg>



<lg><l>"They tell me a Christian woman, like I profess
     to be,</l>
<l>Must drown the voice of her sorrow and make
    her heart be still,</l>
<l>And if her children will leave the Lord for
    naughty ways, then she</l>
<l>Must cut them off forever, as heirs to endless ill.</l>
<l>And the elder came and scolded me because, as
    you must know,</l>
<l>I went to see my daughter Jane, in a den of vice
    and woe,</l>
<l>And said it was unseemly in a Christian woman
    like me,</l>
<l>To enter in at the threshold of a den of infamy;</l>
<l>That natural love should all give way before the
    love of the Lord,</l>
<l>And if our children are vile and mean that they
    are more abhorred</l>
<l>By the dear God above us, and by us should also
    be,</l>
<l>Than heathen in their filth and crime, in lands beyond 
  the sea;</l>
<l>And then he talked of Jane, and said that I had
    trained her well,</l>
<l>But often the good Lord tries our faith with the
    very imps from hell,</l>

<l>Put into the forms of our children; and if we love
    them still,</l>
<l>As they go in sinful ways, it shows that our carnal
    will</l>
<l>Is not subdued as it should be, and brought in
    sweet accord</l>
<l>With the will of the church that worketh the
    perfect will of the Lord;</l>
<l>And so I sat and listened, till my heart was like
    to burst,</l>
<l>And my soul within me was yearning with a fiery,
    burning thirst</l>
<l>That would not be abated nor satisfied at all,</l>
<l>Till I held Jane up in the arms of prayer once
    more, to the Lord of all;</l>
<l>And when I had finished praying, I cannot tell
    you why,</l>
<l>It seemed like a peace was round me, from the
    very courts on high;</l>
<l>And then I sat and wondered what James would
    say and do,</l>
<l>If he could come back in health again, as he left
    me in sixty-two;</l>
<l>For you know he fell at Richmond, a fortnight
    after he left.</l>
<l>There, on the cupboard, you see his cap, that a
    rebel saber cleft,--</l>
<l>What would he say, should I tell him that Henry
    and Jo were dead?</l>
<l>(Henry died in the Libby, and Josy was shot
    through the head</l>
<l>When our boys met Hood at Franklin,--you well
    remember the time;)</l>
<l>And how Jane, our only daughter, was led to a
    life of crime,</l>
<l>By a high born wretch, who won her, destroyed
    her and went his way</l>

<l>To meet the smiles of the ladies and bask in the
     cheerful day</l>
 <l>Of many a social circle of wealth and high degree,</l>
 <l>That would close its doors in horror against my
     girl and me;</l>
 <l>What would he say, should I tell him how the
     elders, wise and nice,</l>
 <l>Bade me drive Jane from under my roof, for I
     must not sanction vice,</l>
<l>Nor evil in any shape at all, if I would a Christian
     be;</l>
<l>And so my injured and weeping girl was driven
     away from me;</l>
<l>Away from me, dear Lord, away, where could
     the poor girl go,</l>
<l>To find a heart in sympathy with all her wrongs
     and woe?</l>
<l>Would the pious take her in? Ah no! for even
     her slightest touch</l>
<l>Would soil the holy garments of the righteous
    over much.</l>
<l>Society, so nice without, so rotten and base within,</l>
<l>Held up its hands in horror at such a child of sin;</l>
<l>And the only place in all the world that was open
    to her, you see,</l>
<l>With a welcome that did not question, was a den
    of infamy,</l>
<l>Where fallen women gather to ply their evil
    trade,</l>
<l>And receive the smiles of lofty men, where none
    do make afraid,</l>
<l>Who would not dare with honest hands in the
    light of open day,</l>
<l>To meet their soiling touch or point their lives to
    a better way.</l>
<l>Well, thus I questioned myself alone, for an hour
    or so and then</l>

      and stand,</l>
 <l>A candidate elected for a home in Canaan's land,</l>
 <l>Would ever turn away, and smile, and say with a
      friendly sigh,</l>
 <l>'My dear, you'll find that the better road lies
      another way, by and by,</l>
<l>For they theorize and maunder, to make their own
      heaven sure,</l>
 <l>But they'd shut the doors of paradise in the face
       of the struggling poor;</l>
 <l>And the weary, heavy laden with burdens of care
      and sin,</l>
 <l>Can find in their priestly language no call to enter
     in.</l>
 <l>The touch of their jeweled fingers and sweep of
     their silken skirts,</l>
 <l>Are not to be soiled by mechanics, nor the women
      who make their shirts;</l>
 <l>They talked of the Lord in the manger, and
       preach of him on the cross,</l>
  <l>But they'd melt down that calf of Aaron's, and
     quarrel over the dross;</l>
 <l>And that woman of Samaria would arouse their
      saintly spleen,</l>
 <l>And they'd turn up their perfect noses at Mary
      Magdalene,'"--</l>
  <l>"Now hold!" responded the good man, "remember
    'tis Christmas day,</l>
 <l>And we should lay all our bitter thoughts and
     memories away.</l>
 <l>The saints, you tell of, widow, are the leaders,

<l>By thy talk and by thy song,</l>

<l>Not a thousand happy hours</l>

<l>Fading from the path of night;</l>
<l>Sweet emotions, soft desires,</l>

 <l>For thy shadow, that no more</l>

<lg><l>O! robin in the cherry tree,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">With heart so brave, yet tender,</l>
<l>Why singest thou so merrily,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">In the morning's ruddy splendor?</l></lg>

<lg><l>Thou wakest thoughts of other years,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">When being's sunny fountain</l>
<l>Seemed flowing onward through the spheres,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">From some celestial mountain.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Old strains of music, wild and sweet,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Are in thy notes returning;</l>
<l>Old greetings, such as children meet,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Set all my spirit yearning,</l></lg>

<lg><l>And dreaming of the pleasant wood,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Where maple boughs were swinging,</l>
<l>And, children of the neighborhood,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">We mocked the robin's singing.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The curly heads are by my side,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">I hear the children's laughter,</l>
<l>And see the dreams that hope denied,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">But cherished ever after.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And now, as in the swooning waves</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of half-unconscious sadness,</l>
<l>I hear, above the little graves,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The robin's song of gladness.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The little feet have silent grown,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Or seek the wood no longer,</l>
<l>But memory still retains her own,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And love than death is stronger;</l></lg>

<l>Where cries a voice forever, "Come and live!"</l></lg>

<lg><l>The dying grapple with the illusive waves</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">They faint and sink and grapple never more,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">But still the mirage rises just before,</l>
  <l>And ever flitting, cheats us to our graves.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Is human effort thus in vain? Are all</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">Our glorious conquests, our inflated creeds,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The grappling, striving of our boundless greeds,</l>

<lg><l>N<hi rend="sc">OVEMBER'S</hi> cheerless skies of rain</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Are ushering in the winter's gloom,</l>
<l>And orchard, forest, field and plain,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Are shorn of greenness, song and bloom.</l></lg>

<lg><l>No more the sparrow in the bush,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Nor robin on the maple tree,</l>
<l>Awakes with song the summer hush</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Of nature's odorous melody.</l></lg>

<lg><l>All tuneless are the solemn groves,</l>

  <l rend="ti-1">As though love's seasons were not gone.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The year that once, so free and bold,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">Leaped down the glowing hills of life,</l>
<l>Dwarfs his bent form beneath the cold,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And shivers in the wild wind's strife.</l></lg>

<lg><l>On beating wings the raven flits,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">A ghost of darkness and despair;</l>
<l>Far in the wood the great owl sits</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">And pours his horror on the air.</l></lg>

<lg><l>A mist obscures the dreary town,</l>
  <l rend="ti-1">The streets are silent lines of gloom,</l>

   <l rend="ti-1">Hope rides in battle's sulphurous car;</l>

<l>The rabble followed, jeering as they went,</l>

<l>Sang of the infant Christ in manger laid,</l>
<l>And of the star that glorified the East</l>
<l>Upon the morn of His nativity;</l>
<l>Sang of the good St. Nicholas and his gifts</l>
<l>To all the happy children in the world.</l>
<l>But still they jeered and pelted, so he turned</l>

         <div3 type="poem"><head rend="center">THE TOILER'S DREAM</head>

<lg><l>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> toiler slept a long, uneasy sleep,</l>
<l>And in the midst thereof, a vision rose--</l>
<l>A dream about a dream that filled his brain:</l>
<l>He thought he woke, and on his wife and boys</l>
<l>Gazed with a tender yearning at his heart,</l>
<l>Then quickly turning to the uncurtained pane</l>
<l>Saw Venus glowing with a tremulous light</l>
<l>Half sunken in the rosy sea of dawn;</l>
<l>Then rose, and putting on his raiment, passed,</l>
<l>Beneath his humble door-tree, sped across</l>
<l>Great plains of red-top, shining in the dew</l>
<l>Like roses steeped in nectar, fields of wheat,</l>
<l>Whose slender lances in the crispy air</l>
<l>Tossed like the streamers which we see on ships</l>
<l>Sailing in favoring breezes from their ports;</l>
<l>Beneath the elm-trees, where the robins sang</l>
<l>Their joyous praises to the advancing sun;</l>
<l>Across the orchards, where the cat-bird's mirth,</l>
<l>In garrulous quavers, shook the infant fruit;</l>
<l>And over rocky hill and flowery dale;</l>
<l>And on, and on, and still the wonder grew--</l>
<l>A sea of glory in the shining East--</l>
<l>Till all his soul, enamored of the scene,</l>
<l>Shouted, in unison with brooks and birds;</l>
<l>And all the growing dawn beheld a race</l>
<l>Of happy men where justice held aloft</l>

<l>Her polished scale, that wavered with a breath;</l>
<l>And none were found to cheat the balance, none</l>
<l>To wring the sweat of blood from weary brows,</l>
<l>And none were beggars, none were lords, but all</l>
<l>Bore burdens for each other, and the wealth</l>
<l>They made, outmeasuring individual needs,</l>
<l>Wrought works of art and towers for learning's
    use,</l>
<l>And builded airy halls in pleasant parks</l>
<l>Wherein the people at their leisure came</l>
<l>To read the masters of philosophy,</l>
<l>To search the lettered scrolls of history through,</l>
<l>Or mark the unlettered legends of the rocks,</l>
<l>With all their marvelous stories of the past,</l>
<l>That, antedating continents and man,</l>
<l>Recall the life of the primordial seas;</l>
<l>Turn amateurs in science and produce</l>
<l>The wonders of the retort; analyze</l>
<l>All forms of use or beauty into gas</l>
<l>As thin as rhymes for formal holidays;</l>
<l>Turn the great telescopes to heaven and count</l>
<l>The worlds on worlds and weigh them one by one;</l>
<l>Look through the microscopes and there behold</l>
<l>The infusorial myriads of the air</l>
<l>And earth and water, and all things therein;</l>
<l>And chasing science thus to suit the will,</l>
<l>Each following that which yielded most delight,</l>
<l>The range of knowledge grew from more to
    more:</l>
<l>Some viewed the wonders on the chiseled stone,</l>
<l>Wrought by the Angelos of every town;</l>
<l>Or on the canvas saw the raptures grown</l>
<l>Beneath the touch of Raphaels numbered not,</l>
<l>Except by needs of the communities</l>
<l>Of cultured souls that filled the teeming world;</l>
<l>Or on a million pages traced the flow</l>
<l>Of poesy, that tempts the heights sublime.</l>

<l>And echoes faintly to the ear of clay</l>
<l>The infinite murmurs of diviner thought;</l>
<l>Or, when of learning weary, they would chase</l>
<l>The flying ball across the park, or swim</l>
<l>In the luxurious mazes of the dance,</l>
<l>Or, in gymnasiums well appointed, train</l>
<l>Each nerve and muscle to the highest use;</l>
<l>Pitch the huge quoit, or toil upon the bars,</l>
<l>Or ply the oars upon the river's breast,</l>
<l>Or linger where the heavenly strains outpour</l>
<l>From instruments of perfect form and tone;</l>
<l>Or wander singing through the pleasant woods</l>
<l>Where myriad feathered warblers congregate.</l>
<l>And when returning from a day of rest</l>
<l>To quiet homes that nestled in the groves,</l>
<l>They met the household with a love that made</l>
<l>The very roof-trees blossom into joys,</l>
<l>And all the world a paradise of peace.</l>
<l>How happily their thanks went forth to God;</l>
<l>How sweet they rested, and with morning rose</l>
<l>To toil, and know that best results are sure</l>
<l>From every stroke of hammer on the steel,</l>
<l>Or furrow cut across the pleasant fields,</l>
<l>Or rush of throbbing'engines, spread of sails</l>
<l>That catch the breezes on a thousand seas;</l>
<l>The whir of spindles and the clank of looms,</l>
<l>The nervous strokes of telegraphs that bear</l>
<l>The thought of continent to continent,</l>
<l>The labors of the builders, and of all</l>
<l>Who build up cities, make the country smile,</l>
<l>Train nature up to uses best for man.</l>
<l>The sun awoke him, shining through the panes</l>
<l>On the bare walls and meagre couch of straw;</l>
<l>And so, the vision past, his toil began</l>
<l>Upon a stately pile of stone that grew</l>
<l>On labor poorly paid, in bounty wrung</l>
<l>From other toilers by the sharper's art.</l>
