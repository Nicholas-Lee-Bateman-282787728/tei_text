                    Land" (government surveyed land), the title of which was indisputable. There were likely no
                    people in America so cursed with land litigation as the pioneer Kentuckians, because of the lack of
                    adequate land regulations pertaining to priority of ownership.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Such

                    </placeName> land deeds and grants, interesting conclusions may be drawn. The father of the
                    President, from the year 1803 to 1816, purchased three farms. The first was sold with a loss of
                    thirty-eight acres, which represented a loss of eighteen English pounds. The second farm he bought

                    sister of Thomas Lincoln, and he is said to have hauled the family and household goods to the

                    migration route was followed. As a result of this supposed visit to the Grume farm, a considerable
                    number of affidavits are on file erroneously stating that Abraham Lincoln traveled through the

                    journeys there before his marriage to Nancy Hanks, then the migration trip with his wife and family
                    in the autumn of 1816, then after her death, he is said to have returned to <placeName>

                    journey. The next trip to Indiana was with his second wife, Mrs. Sarah Bush Johnston, in 1819, and
                    it is further related that a few years later Thomas and Sarah Bush returned to Elizabethtown for a
                    visit, which likewise resulted in a return journey to the Indiana Lincoln home. Regardless of the

                    important item for an exhaustive study. One historian has established the time of the migration as
                    June, 1816, which is about five months too early, while another suggests the exodus date as November

            <p>The birthplace farm, in which Thomas Lincoln still held an interest, was sold by a commissioner named

                    may place the migration date shortly after that date. However, it is unlikely that he remained for

                    bad traveling conditions which would probably result from the usually bad winters of pioneer <placeName>

            <p>The type of conveyance used to transport Thomas Lincoln and his family, is not known. In all
                    likelihood, the conveyance was drawn by horses, with a few head of cattle driven along on foot.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> In the year 1816, the father of the President listed for taxes four head of
                    horses, and it is not reasonable to believe that he would dispose of them because of the
                        migration.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Several biographers have vividly drawn upon their imaginations
                    and stated that the Lincolns packed their belongings upon three horses, while another says, two
                    horses were borrowed to carry their household effects. One biographer describes a spring-wagon drawn
                    by two horses, in which was seated upon a bed of straw Nancy Hanks Lincoln and her daughter,
                        Sarah.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Numerous affidavits are on file, stating that Thomas Lincoln had a
                    cart (two-wheeled wagon) drawn by oxen, a cow and a saddle horse that constituted the mode of
                    conveyance. However, there is no documentary evidence which would lead one to believe that Thomas

                    passed through several well established towns, it is believed that the entire route was famiilar to
                    Thomas Lincoln. Travelers in this community were not an unusual sight as there were many families
                    loaded in covered wagons with all their worldly goods, moving from sections of Green, Hart, Hardin
                    (and that part of Hardin that is now LaRue) Counties towards the West or Northwest.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The family, undoubtedly, expected to enjoy the journey, as they were to visit their old
                    friends in Elizabeth town and then move on to William Brumfield's home on Mill Creek, where
                    they intended to spend a few days.</p>
            <p>It is logical to believe that Thomas Lincoln, on his departure from Knob Creek, would select the road
                    to Elizabeth-town that ran near his home as well as because it was the most direct route of travel.
                    Such a road was located about three miles northeast from his farm, having been established in the
                    year 1793 and kept in repair up to and after the year of the migration.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
                    Traditional evidence, concerning this road, relates that Thomas Sparks, an early settler in this
                    community, was one of the first residents of the county to blaze a trail from Knob Creek to
                    Elizabeth town, which eventually became a wagon road and was used by the pioneers in their travels

            <p>The journey of 1816, no doubt, was very slow, even unusually slow, as they passed by the homes of
                    their neighbors and friends, who must have stopped them to bid them farewell. Tradition states, that
                    after proceeding on their way a short distance, the Lincolns stopped at the farm of Rollie Thomas,
                    now known as the Mack Thomas place, and fed their team under a large elm tree.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

                    departure through the Knob Creek community without doubt occasioned many brief moments of sadness,
                    but with firm determination the Lincolns continued their journey westward.</p>

                    of the old Salt Lick Trail is today called the Shepherdsville road. The wagon road followed by the
                    Lincolns, in the Mill Creek community ran parallel to an improved county seat trail, leading out of
                    Elizabeth-town which was located west of the Mill Creek Lincoln farm, and it was for the upkeep and
                    maintenance of this road that Thomas Lincoln was a petitioner in 1804. The first place of interest
                    as they traveled this way was the farm which Thomas Lincoln had purchased in the year 1803 and had
                    sold to Charles Melton in 1814. After passing their first farm, they continued northward to the
                    Douglas spring where tradition relates they stopped and ate their lunch.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

                    the statement is made that the Lincolns traveled the Shepherdsville road to E. A. Vier's
                    place, and then turned west from there to the old Dowdell Ferry road in the direction of the William
                    Brumfield farm.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> The junction of the Dowdell Ferry road with the Shepherdsville

                    then turned from the Dowdell Ferry road to a pioneer trail which was established in the year 1802
                    that ran by the Brumfield farm. William Brumfield's home was located about six or seven
                    miles from the farm that Thomas Lincoln once owned. Thomas Lincoln traveled in this direction to
                    visit his mother, Bersheba, the widow of Abraham Lincoln, the pioneer Revolutionary War Captain, and

                    in addition to the Lincoln party, constituted the waiting group, while others says that fifteen
                    families were waiting to cross the river. Sixty-one souls are said to have constituted the caravan,

                    operators and the fare to be charged for persons, animals and vehicles. The ferry-keeper was also

                    ordered to keep two able-bodied ferrymen to operate the boat. It is believed that the Thompson Ferry
                    was a legally operated, licensed enterprise and that its requirements and fares were similar to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hardin County</region>
                    </placeName> regulations. Such were the conditions of ferryboat transportation in the year 1816 when
                    the Lincolns moved to Indiana.</p>
            <p>It must have been a dramatic scene when Thomas Lincoln's frightened horses pulled their
                    pioneer wagon upon the Thompson ferryboat. Before moving away from the bank, the horses were likely
                    uncoupled from the wagon to prevent an accident in case they might become unmanageable in midstream.
                    If several head of cattle were driven along, two trips may have been required to remove the Lincoln
                    family's worldly possessions to the opposite bank. It is to be supposed that Nancy Hanks
                    was apprehensive of the impending danger of this water passage, while Thomas Lincoln was busy
                    quieting his horses and promoting all necessary safety measures in effecting a safe crossing. Sarah
                    and Abraham must have enjoyed most of the trip to the fullest extent. It was with a sigh of relief
                    that the Indiana shore was reached, for then the most hazardous portion of the journey was
                        completed.<hi rend="sup">83</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon arriving within the boundaries of Indiana, the Lincolns must have looked forward with fervent
                    interest to the culmination of their trip. Here all men were free, here land titles were secure,
                    here rapid development was to increase property values and here Thomas Lincoln had surely resolved
                    to build up a landed estate, approaching in size the large acreage of his father's former
                    holdings in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Certainly, the family must have wondered how rich their Indiana land would be, how its

                    </placeName> farms and where they would erect their future cabin home. This new country'
                    must have brought forth from every member of the family excited ejaculations as they drove over the
                    wagon trail which meant the last sixteen miles of their long journey.<hi rend="sup">84</hi>

                    could have been completed in seven days over the pioneer trails, nevertheless, stops are believed to
                    have been made at numerous points along the route, and it is to be supposed that they visited
                    several days with relatives in the course of their western travel. There is no indication of any
                    attempt on the part of Thomas Lincoln to reach Indiana within a limited number of days. It is
                    believed that the family proceeded leisurely along the way at a moderate rate of travel. That the
                    migration required approximately ten days to two weeks time with at least one week spent in actual
                    travel is a fair conclusion.</p>
            <p>As many western caravans penetrated into more remote sections of the old Northwest, it has been
                    confusing to some as to the reasons for the comparatively short migration made by the Lincolns in

                    slave state was of little consequence. It has been suggested that Thomas Lincoln was influenced in

                    military expeditions he crossed the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> at the Brandenburg Ferry. Some
                    historians maintain that Thomas Lincoln, after being influenced by Dorsey to move to Indiana,
                    secured from him information as to the route which he had followed. While it may be true that
                    Lincoln was interested in the accounts of Indiana as related by Dorsey, there is no good reason why
                    he should go so far as to follow the same route of travel as his destination was in a different
                    direction.</p>
            <p>Thomas Lincoln's older brother, Josiah, migrated from <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName>, and it is believed that his residence there undoubtedly influenced Thomas Lincoln to
                    migrate also. It is not believed, however, that Thomas Lincoln traveled through <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName>, on his removal, to visit his brother whose home was located northwest of Corydon.<hi rend="sup">90</hi> An interesting but erroneous tradition relates that when Thomas Lincoln was
                    moving to his new home in Indiana, one of his horses, due to the strenuous trip, "broke
                    down" and apparently was not able to continue farther on the journey. The horse became lame
                    while the Lincolns were at the home of Josiah, and it is stated that Thomas Lincoln traded his
                    fatigued horse to his brother for one in good condition. The tradition further relates that the
                    horse for which Josiah had swapped, turned out to be one of the best animals he had ever owned.91 By
                    referring to a map of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana, one must immediately conclude that Thomas Lincoln would not have traveled
                    so far out of his way in winter weather to visit his brother and family, as his destination was in a
                    northwesterly direction. Such a circuitous route to their <placeName>

            <p>A story concerning the events and route of travel of an obscure journey made by humble participants
                    one hundred and twenty-one years ago must necessarily be based on fact and tradition. Exhaustive
                    studies concerning the Lincoln family have developed a few essential facts upon which a story, of
                    the Lincoln migration of 1816 can be based. Local traditions have been relied upon for additional
                    information. It has been said that tradition is subject to all the infirmities of memory and
                    misunderstanding, and no doubt many of the hundreds of, affidavits that are on file, and the
                    numerous oral accounts that are today current concerning the westward movement of the Lincoln family
                    are erroneous and unreliable. Nevertheless, in a community which abounds in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> lore and tradition, as does the <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Lincoln country</region>
                    </placeName>, such legendary recitals must be recognized and accepted in part. In preparing this
                    article the author has studied hundreds of original stories and affidavits that have been collected
                    in regard to the route of travel of the Lincoln family to Indiana. In regard to some roads and some
                    localities, the events of the journey are historically correct and authentic, while on other
                    sections of the route the accounts of the travelers are vague and fragmentary. It would be an
                    impossible task to define the complete route traveled by the Lincoln family from Knob Creek to
                    Little Pigeon Creek, however, from available facts, the principal points of their itinerary, and the
                    important events of their journey are now recorded and are a part of accepted Lincolniana.</p>

            <p>Indiana's historical sources for the Civil War period have been richly augmented by the
                    discovery of some long lost records found during the recent Survey of Federal Archives.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> As these documents make possible a new approach to the role played by Indiana
                    in the Civil War, so too, the now available records of the Food Administration can be used as the
                    basis of new studies of the part taken by the state in the World War. These papers have been stored
                    in various places in <placeName>

                    </placeName> since the close of the war, and have been largely inaccessible to researchers. Since
                    the transfer of these papers to the National Archives, it is now possible for historians and other
                    accredited researchers to avail themselves of this rich World War source collection. It is the
                    purpose of this paper to describe so much of the records as pertain to Indiana.</p>

            <p>The importance of saving the documents of the World War was realized by historians even while the war
                    was still raging. Many states had special commissions for the preservation of such material.
                    Professor John W, Oliver, Director of the War History Records of the Indiana Historical Commission,
                    made every effort toward the preservation and compilation of World War records, and an appropriation
                    of $20,000 was obtained to prepare a war history of the state.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

                    Control Act of August 10, 1917. To make this act effective an Enforcement Division was organized in
                    the <placeName>

                    </placeName> office as needed. Violators of the Food Administration rules—and the number
                    was surprisingly small—were at first admonished either by the Federal Food Administrator
                    or the County Administrator. Hearings were given the alleged violators, and, when found guilty, the
                    offenders were punished by administrative action. The penalties for continued infractions generally
                    were: contributions to a war charity, suspension of business, or complete revocation of the
                    offender's license. Through these quasi-judicial hearings were settled practically all the
                    cases without recourse to the regularly constituted courts of law, for as will be shown, the
                    enforcement of the rules was largely left to the court of public opinion.</p>
            <p>One group of infractions had to do with the insufficient use of wheat substitutes. The war created an
                    overwhelming demand for wheat. Since a great portion of the French and Belgian crops had been

                    production and in saving the precious wheat. This grain was the most easily shipped; hence
                    substitutes such as corn, oats, and rice were used on a 5–0 basis with wheat flour.
                    Bakers were rigorously held to this rule, and those who refused to obey or attempted evasion were at
                    once admonished or punished according to the facts brought out in the hearings.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> From the papers one can not only obtain a picture of how the Food Administration was
                    regarded, but one can also see an interesting example of the work of a quasi-judicial establishment
                    in enforcing its rules.</p>
            <p>A fertile field for the economic and statistical investigator will be found in the records of the
                    baking division. The material largely consists of reports made by the bakers. These reports give
                    facts and figures as to the amount of flour and other ingredients used; the kind and amount of goods
                    baked; and other data that are of considerable interest to the intensive investigator.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A threatend sugar famine made necessary a system of control which really amounted to rationing. Sugar
                    certificates good for stated amounts of the commodity were issued to manufacturers, public eating
                    places, bakers, and retailers on the basis of statements made by them as to their requirements.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> In the records pertaining to these transactions the investigator will find a
                    wealth of economic and statistical information. For example, it is possible to ascertain the amount
                    of sugar used in any town or county in Indiana for certain quarters of the years 191–8.
                    Perhaps such research may seem trifling, but it must be remembered that only on such minute
                    investigations can any sort of a sane generalization be made.</p>
            <p>In all the work of the Food Administration the task was accomplished by the coöperative
                    efforts of all citizens who came to believe the slogan, "Food Will Win the War."

                    of the states; and Indiana was fortunate in having Don Herold to assume charge of this work. His
                    career as author and artist had already begun, and since the close of the war he has firmly
                    established himself as a leading American humorist and playwright. Seemingly his stock of new ideas
                    to advance the popularity of the Food Administration was inexhaustible. A student of the power of
                    publicity and propaganda during wartime will find much in the records of the Indiana Food
                        Administration.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Practically every known source of publicity was exploited. Street-car card campaigns, motion
                    pictures, billboard campaigns, newspapers, pamphlets, rallies, and speeches were employed to spread
                    the message of conservation. Pledge cards were distributed by the tens of thousands and stickers by
                    the tens of millions—these stickers being sold by Indiana to the administrations of other
                    states. The organization of Food Clubs provided an outlet for the message of conservation in every
                    community. The careful explanation of the aims of the Food Administration brought constant response
                    from the American people. The Indiana papers indicate that the people willingly followed the
                    "meatless" and "wheatless" days, and strove valiantly to win the
                    war through the saving of food.</p>
            <p>This brief summary of the records of the Food Administration now deposited in the National Archives
                    indicates that a rich field is offered for study and research. It is impossible to write a complete
                    account of Indiana's part in the World War without taking cognizance of the work of the
                    Food Administration, for, with the mobilization of entire populations for war, all citizens were
                    aware—and the farming sections doubly so—that the battlefield of war was as
                    far away as the wheat or the corn field.</p>

                    </placeName> Register, which his father, Charles W. Slater, founded in 1867. Father or son printed
                    the paper each week for sixty-five years. Some time after the demise of the Register, Mr. Slater
                    delivered the office key to Miss Mary E. Fauntleroy, who owns the building in which the paper was so
                    long published, the only stipulation, or rather request, being that the press remain in the room
                    just as it had been standing for many years. It was made known that, before he retired, the editor
                    had been visited by an agent of Henry Ford. The agent told him that the manufacturer of cars would
                    probably buy the plant, but with the understanding that Slater should go to <placeName>

                    they were not accepted.</p>
            <p>Upon investigation, one finds that this office stands in an unusual position as it is not only intact
                    and where it was in constant use for over three score years, but it is the last office in Indiana,

            <p>Charles W. Slater was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1826, the year the <hi rend="i">Philanthropist</hi> ("Boat Load of

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. When only a small boy he shipped as cabin-boy with a vessel on which his brother was
                    mate. He made several voyages to the West Indian Islands and to South <pb n="429" id="VAA4025-033-4-047"/> America, but in his late ‘teens he gave up the sea, landed
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Galveston</settlement>
                    </placeName> and settled at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Victoria</settlement>
                    </placeName>, an inland town about a hundred miles west of Galveston. At that time, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> was an independent country and was offering free land to settlers who would agree to
                    certain conditions. Young Slater took up a section and joined with neighbors to fight Indians from
                    time to time. On account of illness, he soon gave up his ranch, went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and then to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Here he obtained employment in a bakery and also joined a theatrical troupe. The
                    players went on the road and his tours finally brought him to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Slater became so much in love with the place that he remained. In 1848, he obtained
                    employment in the printing office of James Bennett. He learned to set type under that veteran
                    printer, who, as a boy, had learned the printing trade in the school set up by the Owens and William
                    Maclure.</p>
            <p>Slater later engaged in other activities, but the newspaper work appealed to him and he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> to work on, the <hi rend="i">Commercial</hi>. He crossed the River to
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, where he worked on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">News</hi> for a while. Then he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to work on the <hi rend="i">Variety</hi>. He returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1851 and married Mary A. Beal. Returning to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> with his bride, Slater was employed in the bindery department of Hull's Job
                    Printing Office. From <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to work at job printing, then to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to work on the <hi rend="i">Enquirer</hi> until it was discontinued. He next returned
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and established again his newspaper, the <hi rend="i">Advertiser</hi>.</p>
            <p>The office was opened (assembled might be a more appropriate word) on the second floor of Rappite
                    Dormitory No. 2. Here the <hi rend="i">Register</hi>, successor to the <hi rend="i">Advertiser</hi>,
                    was also published from 1867 to 1875, when the press was moved to a larger and more convenient room
                    on the third floor where it is today. The old Dormitory is worthy of a short description as the
                    printing office fits into it so perfectly. It was built in 1822, and is not only the largest and
                    most pretentious community building constructed by the Rappites but is the best preserved in
                    original plan and condition.</p>
            <p>The building, which was used principally as a dormitory for men, is seventy by ninety feet with three
                    stories and a very large attic. It is built of brick that were made on the grounds. The massive
                    stones of the foundation were quarried <pb n="430" id="VAA4025-033-4-048"/> in the nearby hills and
                    the fine timbers used in the framework and to support the heavy roof were cut from the virgin
                    forests in and near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Three large chimneys were built, one at the north end, one at the south end, and the
                    other near the center of the building. These permitted the location of large fireplaces on each
                    floor. An old barbecue pit, on the first floor at the east side of the central chimney, is just as
                    it was in the day of Father Rapp. This building is one of those selected by the federal Government
                    as worthy to be preserved, and architects sent for that purpose reconstructed the plans of the
                    building to the smallest detail.</p>
            <p>Since the Rappites sold the town to Robert Owen, Old No. 2 has served the community in many
                    capacities, and has seen a varied and sometimes tempestuous life. It has served as a hotel, as an
                    apartment house, with several prominent families making it their home at various times, and as a
                    post. office. Fraternal organizations have used it, and offices of lawyers and doctors have been
                    located in it. Merchandizing enterprises both retail and wholesale have occupied it. During the Owen
                    regime, it was in this building that Joseph Neff established his Pestalozzian school. It served as
                    laboratory or workshop for some of the scientists who made their homes in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and also as a place for their meetings and their schools. In this building, meetings
                    were held by the light of artificial gas, manufactured in the building, whereas, not many miles away
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName>, Abraham Lincoln was reading by the light from a fireplace.</p>
            <p>Of particular interest was the School of Printing which was established in 1826. In this School, one
                    of the most apt pupils was James Bennett who remained in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and, in 1848, taught young Charles W. Slater to set type. He later taught the business
                    to his son Harry T. Slater, and then, in the turn of fate, James Bennett set his own last stick of
                    type in Slater's office. With this succession went many of the old instruments and
                    equipment with which the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> office was set up. Here it is appropriate to
                    tell that, when the <hi rend="i">Industrial Arts Magazine</hi>, a few years ago, investigated the
                    history of printing as a school subject and began to search for the earliest use of printing as part
                    of the course of instruction they quite naturally looked to the older cities and especially to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the home of Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They were surprised to discover that in none of those places, <pb n="431" id="VAA4025-033-4-049"/> but in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a small town in Southern Indiana, was the first school for printing and that tuition
                    in that school was free. The teacher was Cornelius Tiebout, a practical printer and engraver, who
                    was among those active in the work of printing. The <hi rend="i">Entomology</hi> and <hi rend="i">Conchology</hi> of Thomas Say, the eminent scientist, were printed and bound in the school
                    printing office and the illustrations as well were all made there.</p>
            <p>After the deaths of Tiebout and Say, the work of printing was carried on as a school subject and one
                    of the teachers wrote to William Maclure, who was in <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>, that the boys learned "to set type very quickly…. The plates to
                    Sylvia are to be colored by our scholars…. " The boys in the school printed the
                        <hi rend="i">Disseminator</hi>, one of the earliest and best known papers published in southern
                    Indiana. Another man who was connected with printing in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> from the first was Josiah Warren who invented the first rotary printing press. The
                    tradition is that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> presented his invention to a convention of printers, and since they were strongly
                    opposed to the idea, he destroyed his first model on his return to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. However, it is claimed that a man, who heard <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>'s description, made a similar press and had it patented.</p>
            <p>In the Old Printing Office in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the central figure is a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Press. It is a six-column, two-page press and is said to have been assembled in the
                    office where it now stands, having been made of two smaller presses which had been used for a number
                    of years and on which the <hi rend="i">Western Atlas</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Gleaner</hi> had been
                    printed. These papers, which preceded the <hi rend="i">Advertiser</hi>, were published by James
                    Bennett. Among other articles of almost equal age and interest are an editor's desk and
                    chair which are over eighty-five years old. The desk is hand-made and pigeonholed. It was made for
                    Bennett. There is a card press more than fifty-five years old and three wrought-iron cases made by
                    John Echolls, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> blacksmith, in 1858. There are two type-cases made by Josiah Warren after his own
                    design, the type receptacles being round instead of square as are those of the present day. There is
                    a beautiful hand-carved, hand-wrought metal clamp used to hold papers. This clamp represents a shock
                    of wheat the heads clearly showing the plump grains outlined in the brass. Harry T. Slater recalls
                        <pb n="432" id="VAA4025-033-4-050"/> that as a boy he used to shine this clamp frequently with
                    metal polish just for the enjoyment of bringing out its unusual beauty. Still standing intact is an
                    old wood-stove formerly used in heating the printing office. Besides the oval firebox it carries a
                    cylindrical box-like arrangement set in the pipe a few feet above the stove in such manner as to
                    afford additional heat.</p>
            <p>There is a six-font wood-type and a one-font wood-type all made by hand some time prior to 1850,
                    probably nearly all made by Josiah Warren. The two imposing stones, each three feet and three inches
                    by six feet and six inches, were made and used as grave stones—having been laid flat to
                    cover the graves. These stones became available when the bodies were re-interred and suitable
                    markers placed over their graves some time in the early ‘forties. These stones having
                    been used with the smooth side up, the inscriptions on them were forgotten. Recently, when preparing
                    the Old Printing Office for public inspection, readers can imagine the astonishment when it was
                    discovered that one of these stones had covered the grave of Thomas Say while the other had been
                    placed over the adjacent graves of two sisters of William Maclure.</p>
            <p>There is newspaper body-type in the Office which was in constant use for seventy-three years; one
                    case of agate and non-pareil; one case of brevier with italics; a case of long primer and italics.
                    The case-stands were all made in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In the office there are about fifty kinds of display and fancy types, all kinds of
                    letter faces and sizes, an accumulation of more than seventy-five years. There are many old
                    electrotypes and various other pieces of equipment used in printing in the early days.</p>
            <p>Besides the items mentioned, there are complete files of the <hi rend="i">Advertiser</hi> and <hi rend="i">Register</hi> since 1858. Twenty six of these volumes are bound. They afford a
                    continuous record of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> for more than three-score years. Within the pigeonholes of the old Bennett desk were
                    found many old and interesting pamphlets, papers, and books. One of these is a copy of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Pocket Manual</hi> printed in 1845; another a copy of the <hi rend="i">Shipmaster's Assistant</hi> printed in 1801, which was once the property of Gad Peck,
                    captain of a privateer. This was brought to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> by the widow of Captain Peck and found its way in some manner to the newspaper <pb n="433" id="VAA4025-033-4-051"/> office. Upon retiring five years ago, Mr. Slater reserved this
                    book and took it to his home. Among some equipment acquired more recently, were plates for printing
                    music composed by the late Peter Lichtenburger of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In the early days of the <hi rend="i">Register</hi>, as well as that of its predecessors, it was
                    necessary to fill the entire paper by hand as there were no "patent" insides nor
                    plates of advertising as there is today. Incidents are related of almost an entire edition of some
                    of the old papers being reprinted the following week either because the "help" was
                    indisposed or because there just wasn't enough to fill a new issue. It is said that some of
                    the old time type-setters were unbelievably fast workmen and that a surprisingly large number of
                    "sticks" could be set up by one person in a given time.</p>
            <p>At the time Albert Norcross enlisted in the Union army the following item appeared in the <hi rend="i">Advertiser</hi>: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Our assistant having suddenly determined to enlist in the army and due to events now
                            transpiring which may lead to the enlistment of many others, we are compelled to suspend
                            publication of the ADVERTISER. The suspension is only temporary and we are determined to
                            commence its publication as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made. The few who have
                            paid their subscriptions in advance for the fourth volume, can, if they desire it, have
                            their money returned to them, and for this purpose we call upon all those indebted to us to
                            make immediate payment. If this call is not attended to the accounts will be placed in the
                            proper hands for settlement.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Charles W. Slater soon followed his assistant into the service, enlisting in Col. Richard
                    Owen's regiment, the Sixtieth Indiana Volunteers. He served until mustered out in 1865.
                    Taking up his work as publisher of a weekly newspaper, he continued until 1894, when he laid down
                    his last stick of type and wrote <hi rend="i">finis</hi> to a romantic life. His son, Harry T.
                    Slater, took up the work and carried on with few changes either in equipment or methods until
                    advancing age admonished him that he could not put out the Register much longer without assistance.
                    Nevertheless, when the second Slater decided to retire he did not "unlock the last form and
                    throw in the last type" but, with an unusual sense of the value of his plant, he left the
                    last form just as it was used in printing the last number of the paper so that future generations
                    may see the plant just as it was when in operation. Two years later, the retired printer returned to
                    the Old Printing Office, set-up in type, and ran off several copies of a poem <pb n="434" id="VAA4025-033-4-052"/> which his life long friend, Ann Ford had requested. This he also left
                    set-up just as it was when he printed the poem in 1934.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Edward Eggleston still lives and having survived the test of time, needs no eulogy in this, his
                    centenial year.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> As minister, editor, and author he climbed to fame over
                    vicissitudes which would have appalled a less alert and determined man. From the earliest pioneer
                    days, poets and story tellers of Indiana have woven their experiences into homespun tales, but
                    Edward Eggleston was the first to catch the spirit of the spoken dialect of the people and
                    crystalize it on the printed page. He did not then recognize that his works would become classics in
                    literature.</p>
            <p>He was a true writer of prefaces, for there he portrayed to his reader the urge of his creative idea
                    in brief sentences, although he may have spent years in collecting the information.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The chronicles of Eggleston's early activities, which are rather obscure and widely
                    scattered, and those of his family, particularly those connected with his boyhood, are still
                    interesting to students of literature. He was born on December 10, 1837, in a Main Street house of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, His father, Joseph C. Eggleston, bought this house the year before his
                    son's birth of Edward Patton while it was under construction and finished it himself. The
                    house was then located in a square plot of ground planted to fruit trees and grape vines. The
                    building, which still stands, is of colonial style, a two-story brick house with shutters and a
                    little portico at the side. The Eggleston law office was a small brick building on the grounds a
                    little way from the home.</p>
            <p>Edward was a delicate child, afflicted from infancy with asthma, or a similar disease, which
                    compelled him to give up active sports. He was a boy of the fireside who helped his mother with her
                    household duties, knitted and embroidered book-marks, and later devoted most of his time to study
                    under her instruction.</p>

                            was open for business. I selected Clark's Commentary, Wesley's Sermons,
                            Watson's Institute, Fletcher's Appeal, Life of Cearvosso,
                            Watson's Life of Wesley, and enough other books of this type, all bound in the good
                            old "Methodist sheep" after the style of that period to fill the bill. Mr.
                            Eggleston read the books with interest. When ten or fifteen years later I heard that Edward
                            Eggleston had become a preacher I though he would be of the solid variety from the solid
                            food I had spread before him. How he became such a story teller I can not imagine. He never
                            learned it from Clark, Watson, or Wesley.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    He made her his sole executrix without bond or security and left her his entire estate as long as
                    she should remain a widow, "except my silver watch which I will to my son, Edward
                    Egglestonquot;. The will further declared: "In case of the marriage of Mary Jane Eggleston
                    after my demise (which I do not expect) then all of my legacy should be divided among my four
                    children, and she should take in lieu thereof lots 11–11 in the town of <placeName>

            <p>Edward worked during summers for some of the neighboring farmers. He spent one summer with

                    He was old enough to appreciate the backwoods dialect and his photographic mind registered the

                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1863, where Edward was able to attend school. He won a literary contest
                    with an essay entitled, "Beautiful," and received a book as a prize which was the
                    beginning of his library that grew to 4000 volumes.</p>
            <p>On July 31, 1853, the <hi rend="i">Indiana Reveille</hi> of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> carried this rather startling news item: "In July Dr. Henry B. Smalley, M.D.,
                    a member of the M. E. Church, a Son of Temperance and an Exemplary man, with a student Harrison and
                    20 others were arrested with a gang of robbers at Greens-burg." The shock of this news is
                    said to have made Edward so ill that he was forced to go to bed, when he realized the deception of
                    those friends in whom he had placed confidence. Dr. Smalley was the original of "Dr
                    Small," a character in <hi rend="i">The Hoosier Schoolmaster</hi>.</p>
            <p>The next year the Rev. Terrell was appointed agent for the American Bible Society by the Conference,
                    and as he had to travel continuously, the family returned to the Eggleston Main Street home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The boys had their father's redbrick law office fitted up as their
                    domain—bedroom, library and reception hall, all in one—and there, at sixteen,
                    Edward organized a boys' debating society. Many of the books used were from
                    Eggleston's library, the richest in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and delivered a lecture to the club. He was a great favorite with his young cousins and
                    understood boy life. A local paper reported that Mrs. Dumont had established a Lyceum in connection
                    with her school and held the sessions in her school room, every Friday night, at her residence. The
                    programs consisted of debates, compositions and readings. An evening was often given to the study of
                    Shakespeare in which she showed her best work in the characterization <pb n="443" id="VAA4025-033-4-061"/> of those world famous men and women of the bard's creation.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Eggleston boys also attended the academy in the Presbyterian Church, conducted by the Rev. Hiram
                    Wason, which is so accurately described in Roxy. The minister taught the usual subjects in the
                    curriculum of the time with the addition of astronomy. He held night sessions to observe the
                    constellations of the sky. The class-book used was the <hi rend="i">Geography of the Heavens</hi>,
                    accompanied by a <hi rend="i">Celesta Atlas</hi> prepared by Elijah H. Burrett, A.M., in 1833.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> The Rev. Wason had a genial personality that was much admired by his pupils.
                    He became a character in three of Eggleston's stories: "Reverend
                    Whitecar" in <hi rend="i">Roxy</hi>, "Hiram Mason" in <hi rend="i">The
                        Graysons</hi>, and "Reverend Brown" in "The Bound Boy" of

                    </placeName>, who lived at the family seat at Egglestetton. It had been the home of Major Joseph
                    Eggleston, who had received his command from Light Horse Harry Lee during the Revolutionary War. The
                    youth experienced here a new life, an easy going, restful southern type of existence, with the
                    constant attendance of slaves and contact with self-poised aristocratic gentlemen who were conscious
                    of their superiority. All this ease and opulence could have been Edward Eggleston's as his
                    uncle wished to adopt him and send him to be educated in the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                    knowledge, but the youth believed in a life of endeavor and action and was opposed to slavery. It is
                    held that he declined his uncle's offer because it would make him a sharer in the profits
                    of slavery. He had lived all his life on the border of a free state where runaway slaves were
                    sometimes captured and returned to slavery. Possibly he had observed this phase of slavery at first

            <p>There was a sand bar in the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, near the Old Orchard Farm, where it was

                    treated. Once a master <list type="footnotes">

                    Eggleston knew, by experience, the effects of slavery, both for black and white. George Cary
                    Eggleston dressed slavery with good words and convered its ugly side. Edward said very little about
                    it, but, after thirteen months of entertainment in his wealthy uncle's home, he refused an
                    education from the profits of slavery and returned to sickness, to poverty and to work.</p>

            <p>Edward now spent a delightful summer at home. He coached his brother, George Cary, in Latin, George
                    having decided to attend Asbury (now DePauw) by using a scholarship that his father had bought. The
                    brothers tramped the hills around <geogName>Clifty Falls</geogName> and studied geology, but they
                    met a stormy opposition from the Methodist preachers and presiding elders who made every effort to
                    stop the study of that "agnostic" science. The boys "hiked" to
                    Mammouth Cave and back—quite a journey then.</p>
            <p>In May, 1856, Edward became ill. Threatened with tuberculosis, he and his mother took a boat trip to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> for his health. They met others, afflicted as he was, going to <placeName>

                    only furnish sufficient money for his boat passage up the river, but he went, sick, alone, and

            <p>He soon found work as a chain carrier for a surveying party. Then he drove three yoke of oxen hitched

                    do, in order to live. Then he became homesick. He wrote home for thirty dollars from his share of
                    the estate, but did not wait for it to arrive. Starting to walk to <placeName>

            <p>He had always had a deeply religious nature and hardships intensified his sense of obligation to his
                    God and to his fellowmen. Now he determined to preach the Gospel and obtained a license to preach as
                    a Methodist circuit rider. He probably received his exhortor's license from one of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> churches but no record of it has been found. In the fall of 1856, he was appointed by
                    the Southeastern Indiana Conference as a junior preacher to Bellview Circuit, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn County</region>
                    </placeName>, with the Rev. Rozin Monroe Barns, Senior preacher, in charge. The two men had ten
                    appointments in a rough hill country, with many creeks to ford, and it was a big job to fill their
                    pulpits and do their pastoral work. Eggleston found that he had no place or time to study at his
                    lodgings, so he bought a slow horse and read as he rode on horseback from charge to charge. He
                    continued until April, 1857, when he fell ill and resigned.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    to their custom of not listing student preachers or exhortors. At this time he began writing for
                    denominational papers, and his articles were well received.</p>
            <p>Edward's mother, Mrs. Mary Jane Eggleston, sickened and died on June 15, 1857, at the age of
                    only thirty-eight, leaving too small Terrell children. Loving his mother dearly, this was a heavy
                    grief to Edward and the calamity broke up the home and scattered the family. George Cary, Jane, and
                    Joseph William, went to their relatives in <placeName>

                    home, and bereft of a sympathetic mother. Mails were slow and letter postage expensive, so in this
                    far country, he could not expect to hear from his brothers and sister very often.</p>

                            "I can and I will before you come again," father replied. Father went to
                            work and from the trunk of a tree he hewed out a round pulpit. The young preacher exhorted
                            with so much fervor from his new pulpit that I was the first convert of the man who
                            afterwards became famous.</p>

                            </placeName> and Mr. Eggleston prepared to go. My father asked him if he were going to the
                            Conference: "Yes, I am going," was the reply. Father knew money was scarce
                            and that Mr. Eggleston's preaching and soap making, which occupation he engaged in
                            through the week, yielded him little revenue, so he went to one of the brethern, a certain
                            Mr. Arter, who had recently come from the east, bringing gold coin, and told him of Mr.
                            Eggleston's desire to go to <placeName>

                            </placeName>. Mr. Arter was interested and offered Mr. Eggleston five dollars to help defray
                            the expense of his trip, but was met with a polite but firm refusal. "I shall not
                            need money," said Mr. Eggleston. "I can walk part of the way, some one
                            will give me a lift now and then and the brethren will give me food and lodging when I
                            require it." However, Mr. Arter insisted that he should take the gold, and he
                            finally prevailed, but Mr. Eggleston started on foot for the Conference, a distance of a
                            hundred miles. Upon his return he gave the gold to its original owner, for with sturdy
                            pioneer independence, he had traveled the entire distance to <placeName>

                    became very ill. Only through expert nursing was his life saved. He married the young woman who

            <p>In this period, the Methodist Church severely criticised members who indulged in reading fiction, so
                    a preacher who wrote and published novels could not expect to escape criticism. One clergyman
                    advised Mr. Eggleston to "Throw away ambition, for a literary life is tempting you to

            <p>It is very probable that the Methodist minister who engaged in literary efforts on the side was
                    influenced somewhat to turn to a literary career because of the criticism that he received from
                    churchmen. It seems probable, too, that his sincere attachment to religious activities made him feel
                    the criticism so keenly that he turned from historical romance to historical research and the
                    writing of history. In the field of history, the competition of trained and experienced writers was
                    severe, which made it necessary for Eggleston to spend years in preparation. In the field of the
                    realistic novel he was alone when he wrote his frontier romances. Had it not been for the harsh
                    criticism that was meted out to him as a novel-writing clergyman, his fame as a writer of fiction
                    might be greater than it is. Even so, it is as a writer of novels, not as a writer of history, that
                    he is remembered today and will continue to be remembered.</p>
            <p>Edward Eggleston remains the first and one of the few great American writers who have succeeded in
                    giving to their work the genuine savor of the soil, homespun and native.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> In
                    1873, in his "Preface" to <hi rend="i">The Mystery of Metropolisville</hi>, this
                    early exponent of realistic fiction made a noble defense of his departure from orthodox writing:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>A novel should be the truest of books. It partakes in a certain sense of the nature of both
                            history and art. It needs to be true to human nature in its permanent and essential
                            qualities, and it should truthfuly represent some specific and temporary manifestation of
                            human nature. It has been objected that I have copied life too closely, but it seems to me
                            that the work to be done just now, is to represent the forms and spirit of our own life, and
                            thus free ourselves from habitual imitation of that which is foreign. I have wished to make
                            my stories valuable as a contribution to the history of civilization in America. If it be
                            urged that this is not the highest function, I reply that it is just now the most necessary
                            function of this kind of literature. Of the value of these stories as works of art, others
                            must judge; but I shall have at least rendered one substantial though humble service to our
                            literature, if I have portrayed correctly certain forms of American life and manners.</p>

            <p>The assertion has often been made in recent years that the development of political ideas as a basis
                    for meeting economic and social needs has not kept pace with economic advancement. There is some
                    truth in the assertion, but there is more that should be added. Students of history, government, and
                    society should, of course, try to keep up with a changing world. This does not mean that all
                    students in these fields should be expected to understand the fundamental problems of man's
                    progress. It can only mean that among such students, there should appear, from time to time, seers
                    who can point out the methods that should be employed and the needed modifications in political and
                    social machinery. Such thinkers do appear, but their contributions go largely unheeded in a world
                    where success means the accumulation of capital.</p>
            <p>A guiding idea in modem economic affairs is that any one may try any newly invented method, process
                    or machine. If the use of the method, process or machine increases the income of the individuals,
                    firms, or corporations concerned, it is pronounced good, the assumption being that it must therefore
                    be beneficial to all society. Social and political agencies must then adapt themselves to whatever
                    follows the changes that take place in the economic world or be regarded as barriers to progress.</p>
            <p>The real question relates to the soundness of the assumption that all newly invented methods,
                    processes, or machines that make for greater income to the capitalists, large or small, who use
                    them, are blessings to the people as a whole. As long as this assumption goes unchallenged, there is
                    little that students of history, government, and society can do save trail along. If whatever is, is
                    right, then progress or decadence comes whether we will or no, and anything that happens must
                    contribute to the natural trends of the period.</p>
            <p>On the whole, students and teachers in the field of social studies have done remarkably well. They
                    have searched for the truth, they have faced the facts and have tried to draw honest and sound
                    conclusions. Those who have dealt with mature students have sent many of them into the world with
                    inquiring, open minds, only to see most of them quickly succumb <pb n="457" id="VAA4025-033-4-075"/>
                    to the powerful currents of accepted belief in the realms of economic activity. Even so, it must be
                    true that inquiring, open minds are, or will some day become, the highest assets to struggling
                    humanity. Those who seek for truths, the application of which will enable the peoples of this modern
                    era to rise to higher levels, must never become discouraged. It seems as certain as anything can be
                    that some time they will come into their own—that the peoples of the earth will heed
                    their teachings and not permit blind forces to control.</p>

                        years old. I have lived in the Hoosier state ever since—a period of seventy-three
                            years.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> My father's name was Alfred Wheeler, and my
                        grandfather's name was John Wheeler. My mother's maiden name was Lydia Macy.
                        She lived to be more than ninety-nine years of age. To her death, she took an active interest in
                        life, retaining her faculties to a remarkable degree. I was the seventh of ten children. I have
                        a sister living, who is five years older than myself. Two other sisters, older than I, died in
                        1935. Before they died, there were four of us living whose ages averaged more than eighty.</p>
                    <p>Going back to my earliest recollections, I remember that my parents lived on what was called the
                        Lindsey place. I remember that we had some chestnut trees, and that a fellow by the name of
                        Thornberry came to our chestnut trees and was getting our chestnuts. They told me in later years
                        that I approached him and called out: "You Zeek, get out of our pasture." I
                        don't remember whether he obeyed the order or not.</p>
                    <p>The Lindsey place that I have spoken of was up near Sandy Ridge, in <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Guilford County</region>
                        </placeName>. There was a church by this name and the community or section was known as Sandy
                        Ridge. It was appropriately named for the soil, what there was of it, was very sandy. To the
                        best of my recollection, my father moved directly from the Lindsey place to the farm that we
                        left when coming to Indiana. This, we called the Starbuck place. My father purchased it from
                        Charles Starbuck about the year 1857.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> It was probably the first winter that
                        we lived on this place that there came the heaviest snow that that section of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName> has any account of. The snow was very deep and drifted in places to the tops of the
                        fences so that people could pass over them. Folks were snow bound for days.</p>
                    <p>A cousin of ours by the name of Emeline Wheeler was detained at our home for some days. She
                        finally went home and my sisters accompanied her for a distance. I was a small boy about four
                        years of age. After they had left the house, I followed them unobserved. In my efforts to walk
                        through the snow I fell down frequently. I would catch with my hands then hold my hands out and
                        the snow would melt for a time. Finally when I was found, icicles were frozen on the ends of my
                        fingers. I was taken into the house and snow rubbed on my hands then put into cold water and
                        given a good application of Mexican Mustang Liniment. No serious consequences followed this
                        experience.</p>

                    <p>It must have been only a few years following this experience that I had the misfortune of falling
                        into a branch, head first. Father usually butchered a good many hogs and even in those days, we
                        would save everything but the squeal. After taking most of the fat off the intestines, they
                        would empty and wash them, later using them to make soap. A good place to wash the intestines
                        was in a nearby stream. This work was being done by older members of the family, and I was an
                        interested onlooker. Crouched on my elbows and knees on the abrupt bank, I, becoming
                        over-balanced, fell head first into the water among the intestines. I came out a pitiable sight,
                        and not any the cleaner by having been in the branch. I have sometimes thought that, were it not
                        for the fact that a kind <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                        </placeName> watches over children, few of them would live to become grown-ups.</p>
                    <p>At another time, as a boy some ten years of age, I and some other boys were bathing in
                        Wheeler's Mill Pond. I had seen some of the others, who were older than myself, wade
                        across the pond, and I thought I could do the same. I had not yet learned to swim. I started
                        across and finally got where the water was a little too deep. There I strangled and floundered
                        around trying to get out. A young man by the name of Henry Johnson come to my aid and led me out
                        safely. Had it not been for assistance, I probably would have drowned.</p>
                    <p>I sometimes rode to the pasture to get the cows. One time, the mule on which I was riding took a
                        notion to run, and those who have ridden bareback on a mule know what a difficult job I had.
                        This mule put his nose to the ground, and I slid forward onto his neck. Finally I went off over
                        his head to the ground, and the mule, jumping clear of me, went galloping across the pasture
                        toward the barn. He left me, in my anger, to make my way on foot which luckily I was able to do.</p>
                    <p>My sister Lou and I went to the mill in a two-wheeled dump-cart that father had constructed to
                        haul the dirt that came from digging a cellar under the house. We had a number of bags in the
                        cart and the bed was pretty evenly balanced on the axle. To hold the bed down there was a
                        leather loop on the running gears, and a pin was put through this loop and through a hole in the
                        front of the cart bed. We were going up a long hill leading away from the mill. I was sitting on
                        the grist that we had gotten at the mill. Boy-like, I put my toe against the pin and pushed it
                        out. Then, when reaching a little more of an incline, up went the front end of the cart bed and,
                        as there was no rear-gate, out went the grist, and the horse went trotting up the hill to the
                        top where he stopped and waited for us to overtake him.</p>
                    <p>Another milling experience that happened to my sister Emily and myself is worth telling. We then
                        lived at the Jesse Wheeler place, and the distance to Wheeler's Mill was seven miles.
                        We started with some sacks of grain in what we called a Yankee wagon—a light
                        one-horse wagon with a low box-bed. We had proceeded some distance and the road must have been
                        pretty bad for on going up a hill, a wheel ran into a deep rut or wash, turning the wagon over.
                        The bed dropped off the running gears, but luckily the horse was gentle. I was only a small boy
                        but sister was a good sized girl. I remember that she, with what little help I could give,
                        tugged the wagon-bed up the side of the hill and <pb n="460" id="VAA4025-033-4-078"/> got it on
                        the running gears. We then put our sacks back into the wagon and went on our way.</p>
                    <p>The railroad ran through the farm and there was a crossing to go from one part of the farm to
                        another. A neighbor woman by the name of Armfield was visiting at our house and mother, wanting
                        to borrow something from the woman, had me accompany her to her home to get the article. The
                        most direct way to the neighbor's house was to go to the railroad crossing, then walk
                        the track the rest of the way. We started, and, on nearing the railroad, we stopped to watch a
                        freight train go by. We stood near the track until the last car had passed, then I jumped on the
                        track and threw my hat against the end of the last car. The hat dropped on the drawbar and away
                        it went. I ran as fad as I could, hoping to retrieve the hat, but I could not run quite fast
                        enough. In those days, the caboose was coupled next to the ene and not at the rear end of the
                        train as now.</p>
                    <p>I went to Hickory Grove to church with my parents. It was warm weather and the services were held
                        under a canopy, that is, a roof with supports and no siding. I was sitting with my father and it
                        seemed to me that the meeting would never close. Finally, while most of the people in the
                        congregation, including my father, were kneeling in prayer, I slipped out and went out into the
                        grove where a lot of horses were hitched, most of them to small trees. I got too close to an old
                        grey horse's head, and he grabbed at me with his teeth, pulled my hair and tore the
                        brim partly off my new hat. This was sufficient punishment, one would think—not that
                        I cared for having my hair pulled, but the damage to the new hat was terrible—but, in
                        addition to all this, my mother gave me a whipping. I knew perfectly well that I was not allowed
                        to leave church during services, and, as well as I remember, this was the only time I ever did
                        such a thing until I was nearly grown.</p>
                    <p>While on the subject of hats, I must tell of the hat I wore to Indiana. I caught rabbits in
                        box-traps during the winter of 186–864. Saving the pelts from twenty rabbits, I took
                        them to a hatter by the name of Edwards. He made me a fur hat the natural color of the fur. My
                        father gave him fifty pounds of flour, when flour was selling at a high price, for making this
                        hat for me. A day laborer received ten dollars for a day's work at that time. This was
                        in Confederate money and ten dollars were equal to fifty cents in specie.</p>
                    <p>Another circumstance that I call to mind, I will relate here. As I shall explain later, my
                        parents were suspected of feeding and helping those who were trying to keep out of the
                        Confederate Army. As a blind and to ward off suspicion of feeding and helping these men, my
                        parents took into the home to board, the wife of a Confederate officer. Her name was Mrs.
                        Conrad. Her husband had been in the Ambulance Corps, and, one day when getting out of an
                        ambulance, with his hand holding the muzzle of his gun, the gun struck the double-tree and was
                        discharged, blowing off his front finger and one nostril of his nose. The charge passed up his
                        forehead, but it did not cut quite deep enough to kill him. However, it disfigured him pretty
                        badly. I remember that I asked him if he was blowing his nose when he was wounded. After
                        recovering from this injury, he did clerical work in <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Greensboro</settlement>
                        </placeName>, the <pb n="461" id="VAA4025-033-4-079"/> county seat. He would come to my
                        father's home for the week-end. Both his father and his wife's father owned
                        slaves and were reputed to be well off. While Mr. Conrad was staying with us, we had a young man
                        by the name of Bodenhamer in the house. He was disguised as a girl in order to avoid military
                        service. One day, Mrs. Conrad came in rather unexpectedly while my mother and sisters were
                        talking with a Yankee, E. J. Johnson, who also stayed at our house for some time, in hiding.
                        Being in a close place, Johnson scooted under the bed at her approach. The bed was an old
                        fashioned high poster with foot curtains. Mrs. Conrad sat down on the side of the bed talking
                        and swinging her feet. During the conversation, one of my sisters made the remark: "I
                        wish the Yankees would come." Mrs. Conrad spoke up, declaring: "Well, God
                        knows that I am as near the Yankees as I want to be!" The Yankee under the bed could
                        have caught her ankle had he so desired.</p>
                    <p>On my recent visit to <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName>, I was thrilled by visiting the old house and the old mill that was built by my
                        grandfather, as nearly as I can tell, well over one hundred fifty years ago. The house, with old
                        hip-roof, large fire-place and mantel nearly six feet high, still stands. The old
                        weather-boarding, worn away until not much more than half of the original thickness remains,
                        still covers the sides. The house was put together with hand-forged nails made by an old slave
                        whose name was Seth (Seth Starbuck). This old slave would do work for the public after he had
                        done a day's work for his master, and the master let him do this that he might buy his
                        freedom. After he had purchased his own freedom, he worked and purchased his wife's
                        freedom. My father was accustomed to run his mill at night, and he told me that he heard Black
                        Seth's anvil ringing many a time at twelve o'clock midnight.</p>
                    <p>Wheeler'g Mill was a place of interest and activity in pioneer days. During the
                        Revolutionary War, the Mill was grinding some flour for the American Army when the British
                        soldiers came. My great-grandfather<hi rend="sup">3</hi> expected that they would take the
                        flour, and in order to mislead them, he put his hand on a barrel of flour that belonged to him
                        and said: ‘This is my flour. You certainly will not take private property."
                        They went away and did not take anything.</p>
                    <p>Grandfather died soon after my father and mother were married and they lived a few years with
                        father's mother. This old homestead stands about one-fourth mile west of the Wheeler
                        Mill. Father and mother, moving to themselves, occupied a house up the hill, about one-fourth of
                        a mile east of the Mill.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>As father was associated with the mill as part owner and miller for a number of years, he told me
                        of several incidents that happened within his memory. He had an uncle by the name of Welch. This
                        Uncle Bill had a lot of home made tow-bags that would hold from three to five bushels and father
                        did not like to handle them. One day when the negroes came to the mill, father selected one big
                        bag with as much in it as he could handle. He put this bag into the wagon, then carried and
                        filled it full. Uncle Bill took the hint and afterwards put less grain in <list type="footnotes">

                        one hundred yards from the ford. The river had no bridge, but there was a footlog for
                        pedestrians.</p>
                    <p>At one time there had been quite a rain which turned to sleet. The river had risen rapidly. When
                        it was early morning, father attempted to go from the mill to the house. He started to walk the
                        foot-log, but, when he got out a way, he slipped off and went in head foremost. He got out and
                        hurried to the house as fast as he could. His clothes were frozen stiff, but he suffered no bad
                        effects from the ducking.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after I was born, a book was written by Hinton Rowan Helper of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName> entitled, <hi rend="i">The Impending Crisis of the South</hi>. This book which
                        dealt with slavery was widely read by opponents of slavery in the North. The law makers of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName> enacted a law making it a felony for one to have the volume in his possession, or
                        to circulate the book. I remember that my father had one of these books, but he always kept it
                        hidden. Father had a cousin by the name of Jesse Wheeler who, not being in favor of slavery,
                        circulated the book. The authorities found out about it and got the evidence against him. He was
                        apprehended and given the alternative of leaving the state or taking the consequences designated
                        by the law. He chose the former, left the state hurriedly with his family and located in <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Hendricks County</region>
                        </placeName>, Indiana, about 1860. Father, being in sympathy with Jesse, in order to help him in
                        his time of difficulty, put a tenant on his own farm which was seven miles from the farm of his
                        cousin. He then moved to the farm of this relative, Jesse Wheeler.</p>
                    <p>As time progressed, the situation became more acute and finally on one April day in 1861 a
                        neighbor, whom we called Uncle Joe Arm-field, came over. I remember that father was, plowing the
                        garden. Uncle Joe had received his county paper, the <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Greensboro</settlement>
                        </placeName> Patriot, which revealed the startling news that Fort Sumpter had been fired on.
                        Father and Uncle Joe were very much wrought up and the situation was a grave one. From this,
                        other things developed, the South actively organizing as large an army as could be raised.</p>
                    <p>My parents belonged to the Methodist Church, and when attending the services near the opening of
                        the War, the Minister prayed God to direct the bullets of the southern soldiers to the hearts of
                        their enemies. This was too much for my parents and they attended no more services, but joined
                        the Church of the Quakers or Friends, as father was opposed to war.</p>
                    <p>We were living on a public highway, and many soldiers and cavalrymen rode by on horseback. The <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>

                        train load of soldiers passed over that line. There was quite a steep grade and the trains ran
                        slowly through the farm. Whenever we heard a train coming, most of us would go to the railroad
                        to see the soldiers pass. We children would throw them apples, and take branches that had a
                        number of small limbs, and break the ends off and stick apples on firmly, and then hold the
                        branches up so the soldiers could catch hold of the <list type="footnotes">

                        the branches. These poor fellows did not realize what was before them. They were a jolly, gay
                        bunch. The windows were full of heads and bodies and the platforms were crowded.</p>
                    <p>There was an elderly English miner by the name of Hart and his three sons boarding at my
                        father's. They had come south to work in a copper mine that was in operation less than
                        a mile from my father's place. Of course, they were in sympathy with the North. The
                        name of the old gentleman was Richard, the eldest son was Richard, Jr., then Mose and Thomas.</p>
                    <p>One day we heard a train load of soldiers coming, and all ran to the railroad to see them pass.
                        The soldiers were looking out of the windows and crowded down the car steps waving their caps
                        and hollowing, when Mose Hart ran up close to the track and yelled: "You better go back
                        home, you'll be killed. every son of a nipper of you." Mose also went to
                        Grensboro, the County Seat, one Saturday, where he talked in favor of the North, and the
                        officers were about to lock him up. Things had gotten into such a turmoil that Richard Hart and
                        his sons decided to go back to <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                        </placeName> where they had formerly lived.</p>
                    <p>There was a local man by the name of Zimri Coffin who was radically in favor of the Southern
                        Confederacy. He was what we termed a "fire eater." He organized a company of
                        volunteers, and, in one of his speeches to stir up enthusiasm, he said that the War was only a
                        breakfast spell that would be over soon adding that the Yankees were cowards and would not
                        fight. He boasted that he could whip a half dozen Yankees with a barlow knife. "They
                        will just run." Someone took issue with him and said: "The Yankees are
                        ‘ bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh' and will fight the same as
                        Southern men." Among Zimri Coffin's volunteers was a man by the name of Harmon
                        Wade. He was poor and ignorant, and had the reputation wherever he was known of being the
                        biggest liar in the country. When he volunteered, some wag said: "If Harmon Wade woes
                        to the War, he will get shot in the mouth." Sure enough, it came out just as this
                        fellow predicted. However, his wound was not fatal. Some of the boys made up a song about Zimri
                        Coffins' Company, and I remember it started out like this: "Zimri Coffin, his
                        Brigade. He called for volunteers and got Harmon Wade. To the War, to the War, to the War we are
                        bound."</p>
                    <p>As the war progressed, the authorities finally confiscated the farm of my father's
                        cousin, Jesse Wheeler, and put it up and sold it to the highest bidder. A man by the name of
                        Weatherby, a slave owner from the eastern part of the state bought it. He wanted to get farther
                        away from the Yankees with his slaves, and thus as he thought, be more secure with them. My
                        father had to give possession of the farm to Weatherby, consequently he moved back to his own
                            farm.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> At the close of the War, the cousin returned to <placeName>

                    <p>About the time that my father moved back to his own farm, the southen authorities began drafting
                        men into the service. The section in which we lived, having a large citizenship of Friends, the
                        prevailing sentiment was with the North, and many of the young men were determined that they
                        would not go and fight the Yankees, as we southerners designated all northern people. When they
                        were not able to avoid service any longer, they would "take to the bushes."
                        They would hide out in the woods and caves, in old houses and barns and in the homes of their
                        friends. They had to depend on those in sympathy with them for food. My father gave them what he
                        made for two years or more. I have carried many baskets of food to the woods and to the barn for
                        the boys who were hiding out and hungry. Occasionally we would let them eat at the table, but as
                        a rule it was otherwise. I remember having stood out in the yard after dark, watching for the
                        approach of any one who might come and find the conscripts eating supper.</p>
                    <p>Such secrecy as we practiced in those days is unbelievable now. One illustration may be given. My
                        mother had a nephew, who, rather than go to the army, decided to try and make his way to the
                        North by going west through the mountains into <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                        </placeName> as a way to get to the Yankees. However, before deciding to do this, he came to my
                        father and mother and asked them if they would conceal him about the premises some place and
                        give him food. Father told him that they could not do it, inasmuch as they were suspected of
                        feeding those that were hiding out and that they were being watched closely. If detected in
                        giving aid, father knew that he would either be shot or imprisoned. Then Oliver, as that was his
                        name, decided to try and go North. He left home with this thought, but after he had traveled two
                        or three nights alone, as it was not safe to travel by day in the thickly settled part of the
                        state, the weather turned cold and rainy. Then he decided to turn back and try some other plan.</p>
                    <p>It was a cold and rainy night and my Mother, as she has told me, was out in the kitchen alone
                        when someone tapped gently at the door. Mother, going to the door, found it to be Oliver and he
                        said in a whisper: "Aunt Liddy, let me in." She did take him in and put him in
                        what was called our wash-house, a neat log house detached from the other buildings with a narrow
                        passage between. This wash-house had a fireplace and an attic with a steep starway leading up.
                        She took Oliver to the attic of the wash-house, gave him dry clothing and food, and made a bed
                        on the floor for him. She did not say a word to father about what she had done, nor did he find
                        it out for six months.</p>
                    <p>Soon after Oliver left his home, his mother, Aunt Irena, as we called her, became ill. Mother,
                        thinking that she was worrying about Oliver, of whose whereabouts she was ignorant, decided to
                        go and see her. This she did, telling her that Oliver was safe in her wash-house attic. This
                        served as a good tonic, for Aunt Irena soon became well.</p>
                    <p>Another incident in the same connection occurred one day when Grandmother Macy was visiting at
                        our house. She, with my mother, <pb n="465" id="VAA4025-033-4-083"/> was sitting in front of the
                        fireplace in the wash-house, as they frequently worked out there. Grandmother turned her head
                        and looked up at the ceiling and said: "Lydia, I believe that thee has Oliver up in the
                        loft." Mother replied: "Well, if thee believe it, just go up and
                        see." Thus she turned the matter off, not even letting his grandmother know that he was
                        really concealed up there. In spite of my mother's precaution, various members of the
                        family found it out, one at a time. None of us would say anything to any other member of the
                        family about the matter. I remember how I found it out. One day, having as I thought some
                        business in the attic, I went up the steep stairway and sticking my head up, gazed toward the
                        west gable where there was a window, and Oliver, on a bed on the floor raised up on his elbow
                        and shook his head at me, so much as to say, "Don't tell anyone." His
                        hair was long and came down to his shoulders. The fact that he was concealed in the house was
                        kept from father for the sake of his peace of mind. Had he known that he was there, he would
                        have been uneasy all the time. Subsequently, the authorities made a ruling that Friends could be
                        relieved of serving in the army by the payment of $500.00. Uncle Jonathan Gordon paid
                        the $500 and Oliver was allowed his freedom.</p>

                        </placeName>, was of especial interest and I will tell of some of his exploits later on. There
                        was one or possibly more from <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                        </placeName>. One in particular that I remember was a large young German about eighteen years
                        old who spoke quite broken English. His name was George Verhalon. There were two or more from
                        Indiana. Most of these were intent on getting back North, and the most feasible way was to go
                        through western <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName> into <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                        </placeName> and from there eventually get to the Yankees.</p>
                    <p>There were a number of men who were loyal to the Union and they were well organized. My father,
                        as one of the conductors on the so-called underground railroad would, after taking them in and
                        feeding and cleaning them up and clothing them, conduct them to the next station located a
                        proper distance so that he could start after night and get back home before dawn. They were
                        passed from one person to the next, traveling after night until they got out of the thickly
                        settled part of the state. After reaching the mountains they would travel by day, going through
                        the mountains in the general direction they desired to go. One specific charge that their guides
                        tried to impress on them was, never to approach a white man for directions or help, unless they
                        had reason to believe that he was their friend. If they wanted aid they were to try to get in
                        contact with a negro. Colored men, as a rule, were ignorant, but they knew enough not to betray
                        those who appealed to them. Those who followed instructions usually reached the North safely.</p>

                    <p>My father was known to be a northern sympathizer, but he was guarded in his talk and said nothing
                        to create suspicion. However, the Raleigh Guard, as they were called, composed mostly of young
                        men or boys came and searched my father's premises for any who might be hiding to avoid
                        going into the southern army.</p>
                    <p>One afternoon, probably in September, when I was assisting my father to grind sorghum cane, I was
                        surprised as well as my father by some soldiers coming to the gate. The officer was on horseback
                        and the others on foot, six of them in all. On seeing them, I probably turned pale, but father
                        said: "Don't be uneasy, Alonzo, everything is alright at the house."
                        I knew that he meant by that no one was concealed there. This gave me great relief. The soldiers
                        came in the yard, surrounded the house and two of them went to the barn that was a hundred yards
                        or more away. The Captain came to the door where my mother met him. He said: "We came
                        to search your house." Mother replied: "Come in and search it." Two
                        of them came in and searched the house and two remained outside. After searching the downstairs,
                        they wanted to search above, and my mother asked: "Can I go with you?" They
                        answered: "Yes. We don't want to steal anything, though." Mother
                        said: "I didn't think you did, but maybe you won't see every nook and
                        corner." They really did not see every nook and corner" for there was an
                        attic, or loft, over the south porch that extended the length of the house, and we could have
                        had twenty persons concealed there and the searchers would not have found them had they kept
                        quiet.</p>
                    <p>The porch was ceiled overhead, thus making a loft, and a low door from a bedroom upstairs opened
                        into this porch attic. A bureau was placed against this low door, thus hiding it altogether. It
                        was a good thing that they did not find this attic, for there were some beds made on the floor
                        that had not been taken up. Soon after the men went to the barn, hey called to those at the
                        house for one of them to come to the barn.</p>
                    <p>After they had completed their search, and were ready to leave, my mother said to them:
                        ‘Why didn't you send us word that you were coming and we would have had a
                        good dinner for you. We'll get it yet, if you'll wait."
                        "Just as the Captain says," rejoined one man. "Why, yes,"
                        said the Captain, "this is the best place we've found yet." Mother
                        invited them into the house while she and my sisters got busy preparing a good meal, such as
                        fried chicken and gravy, hot biscuits, butter and honey, coffee and milk, and altogether a
                        splendid feast, which they enjoyed very much, as you can well imagine, after having had nothing
                        but the plain government rations recently.</p>
                    <p>When they were pretty well fed up, they became quite sociable and told the joke on themselves.
                        One of the men that went to the barn to search thought he had found someone. There was a shed
                        that had a how at the end of the barn. This shed was filled with wheat straw. Another boy and I
                        had dug a tunnel into this straw, starting near one end and coming out at the other. The men had
                        separated on searching the barn, and when one of them found this hole in the straw, he crawled
                        in to investigate. The second man, finding the entrance and not knowing that the first man was
                        crawling through the tunnel, but <pb n="467" id="VAA4025-033-4-085"/> hearing someone, called to
                        the house for additional help, as he thought he had found a suspect. The joke was on him, and he
                        told it when his appetite was being satisfied with good food. They remained and talked a bit
                        after they had eaten their meal. Then those on foot ran a race with the Captain on horseback. A
                        jolly, jovial bunch, their manner very different from what it was when they came, as then, they
                        were stern and unfriendly.</p>
                    <p>We heard later that they said they didn't find anyone at Old Wheeler's but they
                        believed they would keep them. It was a good thing for us that they did not come two or three
                        days sooner or they would have found E. J. Johnson in the house had he been where he usually
                        stayed during the day. My father had had a premonition that our house was going to be searched
                        and said to my mother: "Mother, I want Ed (that was what we called Mr. Johnson) to get
                        out of the house, for I feel as if our house is going to be searched." Consequently
                        that night Ed left and went to a settlement called Sandy Ridge about four miles away. The day
                        after he left, a neighbor living one and one-half miles away came over, and as an excuse,
                        brought a tin cup to have soldered, as my father was a tinner, one of his many occupations. This
                        neighbor told us that the Raleigh Guard was in a section not far from us, and that they might
                        come and search our house.</p>
                    <p>The blessed old lady had our welfare at heart, but everything had been made ready before her
                        warning. She was the wife of Nathan Gos-set, and I believe her name was Rachel. The man Johnson
                        was a shrewd, fearless, dare-devil sort of a fellow. Our house was near the middle of the farm
                        with a public road running east and west on the north side and another on the south side. In
                        fact both roads ran through my father's farm. We had driveways leading to both. There
                        was a man living south of us whose mother lived north of us and he would pass two or three times
                        each week within a few feet of our house, going to and from his mother's. This man was
                        a Rebel and held a commission as a kind of a militia officer. Johnson could see him from an
                        attic window when he would pass the house and became familiar with his looks.</p>
                    <p>Stuart was his name, and he had a fine revolver that Johnson decided he would like to have. So
                        going over to Stuart's one day, he inquired for the Captain, and his wife told him that
                        he was not at home but she was expecting him soon. Johnson told her that he was one of the
                        Raleigh Guard and that he wanted the Captain to go with him to Sandy Ridge to hunt conscripts.
                        He had not gone far on his way before Captain Stuart overtook him eager to accompany him to
                        Sandy Ridge to hunt for boys who might be hiding to evade going into the Confederate Army. As
                        they proceeded on their way and talked in an agreeable manner, Johnson commented on the
                        appearance of Stuart's nice looking revolver. Making other comments, Stuart,
                        unsuspectingly handed it to Johnson so that he might inspect it more closely. This he did,
                        keeping it for some minutes. When Stuart reached out his hand to receive it again, Johnson drew
                        back. When Stuart asked for the revolver, Johnson said: "This is just the kind of a gun
                        I've been wanting, and I guess I'll just keep it." Ohen Stuart
                        realized that he had been tricked, and began begging and pleading for his revolver, but Johnson
                        held it in his hand ready for action and said: "Now you go back home, or I'll
                        drop you in <pb n="468" id="VAA4025-033-4-086"/> your tracks. Don't you tell anybody
                        about this, for if you do, I'll kill you if I ever get a chance." So Stuart
                        was glad to go back home and let Johnson go on his way with his fine six-shooter.</p>
                    <p>Johnson came to my father's and recounted all of the experience and had the revolver to
                        show as proof. We listened for the story from Stuart but never heard of him telling it. Johnson
                        used to, when Stuart would pass by our house on going to his mother's, point the
                        revolver at him from the inside of an upstairs window. Of course, Stuart never saw him nor did
                        Johnson intend for him to. He aimed at the Captain just for the fun that he got out of the
                        thing.</p>
                    <p>My father made a public sale in the fall of 1864 preparatory to leaving the state. Such a thing
                        was almost unheard of, as conditions were such that nobody was leaving with his families.
                        Father's sale attracted much attention, and a large number came. Of course many of them
                        were strangers to us and to each other. Along in the morning when the house and yard were full
                        of people, Johnson came down the stairs in an unconcerned manner; moving around through the
                        crowd, he then walked off and nobody questioned his right to liberty. He told us that he would
                        be in Indiana by the time we got there.</p>
                    <p>In this, he was only partially correct. He did get to Indiana, but not until after we reached the
                        state. He started on his way North soon after my father's sale. When he reached the
                            <geogName>Yadkin River</geogName> early one morning, there was no way of getting across
                        other than to swim or find a skiff at the bank. On searching, he found a boat chained to the
                        bank which he loosened and got in. When well nigh across, there came up on the opposite bank
                        some home guards under the leadership of Captain Ogburn. Spying him they called to him to stop.
                        When he failed to do so, they shot at him. Fortunately, they missed him. As soon as Johnson
                        reached the opposite bank, he turned and fired at the Captain, whom he felled, but the shot was
                        not fatal and Captain Ogburn recovered.</p>
                    <p>Johnson made his way into the mountains which were not far away, and after a while he stopped at
                        a cabin and asked to stay over night. They took him in, and in due time sent him to bed in the
                        loft. Evidentally, they betrayed him, for in the night, some soldiers came and entered the house
                        and called: "You man up stairs, come down," and of course he could do nothing
                        else. When he came down they questioned him as to what he was doing. He said he was out scouting
                        and that he belonged to Wheeler's Division. They told him that he was a liar, for they
                        belonged to Wheeler's Division, and that he could go with them. They were cavalrymen
                        and he on foot. In the course of time they stopped at a country store and bought some whisky.
                        After drinking they offered the bottle to him, which he took and pretended to drink more than he
                        did. He became pretty sociable and as they rode on they drank more, which they shared with
                        Johnson. He pretended to become quite unsteady on his legs. They finally came to a mountani
                        stream and stopped to give their hoses water. While the horses were drinking, Johnshon shambled
                        up the stream and they called to him, asking where he was going. "Goin' uh up
                        heah to g-git ad-drink," he replied. He proceeded until they called him to halt. Then
                        he made a dive into the <pb n="469" id="VAA4025-033-4-087"/> shrubbery and ran for all his Life
                        was worth. He said if his legs ever did him good service, it was then. After running for some
                        distance, he fell over a forked tree that was on the ground, and the fall knocked the breath out
                        of him. He said that he could go no further, so he just rolled over into the crotch of the tree
                        and lay as flat as he could. He heard the men passing, but they were were unsuccessful in
                        finding him. He remained hidden until night then started on his journey. He would watch his
                        opportunity, and approach a negro, who would render help or a lone white man in case of
                        emergency.</p>
                    <p>Johnson finally made his way back North and visited my father's family in <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Hendricks County</region>
                        </placeName>. After his return to <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                        </placeName>, his native state, he was employed by Governor Foster as his private detective. He
                        had served for a time in Libby Prison, <placeName>
                     <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>,
                                <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                  </placeName>, before coming to my
                        father's place in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName>.</p>
                    <p>The prisoners that were moved through <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName> were, as a rule, loaded into box cars. They filled the cars and put a guard with a
                        gun at each door and of course, the guards could not see what was going on in the back ends of
                        the cars. The prisoners would make holes in the cars and when the train stopped a number would
                        crawl out. This is the way that some of them made their escape that came to my father's
                        house. They escaped at Jamestown, four miles from where he lived.</p>
                    <p>We had a number of experiences that were far from pleasant. At one time, two officers came and
                        took a team of young black mules that we prized very highly. The Government paid Confederate
                        money for them, but we did not want to part with them. One of my older sisters claimed the mules
                        and as the men were leading them away, this sister came out of the house and told them that she
                        wished that the rope they were leading them by was tied around each of their necks and thrown
                        over the top of a large oak tree that stood in the yard. Her anger only amused them, and they
                        just laughed at her. At another time, a man came and ordered my father to appear at a given
                        place at a time he mentioned with his team and feed and rations for ten days. After the man
                        served the notice, my father said: "I shall not come!" The man replied:
                        "You had better be there for if you are not, they will come and get your team and maybe
                        you will never get it again." Father said: "If they do, I can't help
                        it, but I shall not go." The man went on his way, and we never heard anything more
                        about it. The authorities evidently wanted to move some supplies and were short of
                        transportation facilities.</p>
                    <p>My father was planning to move to Indiana, or at least make an effort to get there. He was too
                        old to be a subject for conscription. I think the South finally made the age limit from fifteen
                        to forty-five or possibly fifty years. While our friends knew that we were planning to come to
                        Indiana the authorities did not. My father got two men of influence to assist him in getting a
                        passport from the Governor of the state to go to <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                        </placeName>. After making all preliminary arrangements, except exchanging all Confederate money
                        for specie, as we called it in those days (either gold or silver coin), father went to <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Greensboro</settlement>
                        </placeName>, the county seat, to the bank and gave twenty dollars of Confederate money for one
                        dollar of <hi rend="i">gold or silver, but mostly gold</hi>.</p>
                    <pb n="470" id="VAA4025-033-4-088"/>
                    <p>The next thing was to plan some way so this money would be secure. My mother took new factory
                        cloth and cut strips and folded several thicknesses. Then she placed the coins on the cloth and
                        folded over, then ran stitches around each coin so it would remain in place. Thus she formed a
                        kind of a band or belt. Mother wore on of these belts of money, securely sewed around her body,
                        next to the skin, as did each of my sisters. Father carried only sufficient funds to pay
                        traveling expenses. Everything in readiness, about the first of October, 1864, a brother-in-law
                        to my father, came to our home in a large wagon and we were all loaded in. My father's
                        family numbered eight. There was also a widowed sister with four children, whose husband had
                        been drafted and killed in battle, and besides another woman whose husband was in the North,
                        fourteen in all.</p>
                    <p>I remember as a boy, I thought to myself as the wagon drove out of the gate, "Good-bye
                        old home." My uncle took us to <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Greensboro</settlement>
                        </placeName>, where we were to take the train for the eastern part of the state. We had to wait
                        quite a time. While we were there, they were moving some Yankee prisoners through the town. They
                        were a pitiful looking lot of humanity. It was after night and they seemed to be moving the
                        prisoners out to the Commons, preparatory to encampment for the night. I remember how tragic the
                        picture appeared by the lights such as they carried. The prisoners, ragged and dirty, were
                        driven and herded like dumb animals.</p>
                    <p>We got on the cars and traveled towards the northeastern part of the state going via Raleigh and
                        Weldon. We struck the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia state</region>
                        </placeName> line at or near Murphy's. This, as I remember, was as far as the train
                        ran. Anyway, the Confederate picket or outpost was located here, and when my father presented
                        his passport which gave permission to enter the state of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                        </placeName>, or rather to leave <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName>, the Captain at first said: "I can't let you pass."
                        However, one of the men (Jonathan Harris by name) who had used his influence with Governor Vance
                        to get the passport for my father took the Captain to one side and talked with him privately.
                        Then the Captain turned and said: "You may go." My mother slipped a five
                        dollar gold piece into his hand, not as a bribe, for he had already told us that we could go,
                        but to express our appreciation. I suspect this was a surprise to him, for probably from our
                        appearance, he would not have expected us to have that much gold.</p>
                    <p>At the end of public transportation, we had to make our way the best we could. Father started out
                        to find some one to haul us to the place he wanted to reach. The country in this section of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                        </placeName> had been pretty well devastated by the armies as it had been fought over. The
                        railroad had been torn up and the rails piled on log heaps and heated red hot then bent so they
                        could not be used again without being worked over. My father had informed himself before
                        starting as to just where he intended going.</p>
                    <p>In this territory or neutral ground between the Confederate and Union lines, was living a man by
                        the name of William Hare. He was a Friend or <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                        </placeName>. Father, instead of going to the place that he had designated, which was within the
                        Confederate lines, headed toward Suf-folks which was inside the Union lines at this time. He
                        hired a farmer, <pb n="471" id="VAA4025-033-4-089"/> who had not abandoned his home, to take us
                        on our way, and we were conveyed in a wagon and a two-wheeled cart, with some of us walking.</p>
                    <p>After going not so very far, probably four or five miles, we came to a river that they called
                        Blackwater. This stream had low banks and a deep channel and flowed slowly. We crossed on a
                        ferry that was operated by stretching a rope from one side to the opposite side, running the
                        rope through uprights on the boat, then pulling on the rope and drawing the boast across the
                        river. The ferryman told us that the river where we crossed was forty feet deep. To look at the
                        water, it seemed almost black, but, when one dipped up a cupful of it, it was practically clear.</p>
                    <p>This section was the first place where I had ever seen wells having sweeps with poles and buckets
                        to elevate the water. Most of the conveyances were two-wheeled carts each drawn by a mule with a
                        wooden saddle or buckets on his back and a chain attached to the shafts of the cart and over the
                        mule's back.</p>
                    <p>We finally reached the home of William Hare, and on inquiry were told that the train would not
                        come out to the Yankee pickets for a week, as it only came out from <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Portsmouth</settlement>
                        </placeName> once each week, so we had to wait until the next week.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately Hare had formerly had a neighbor living close by, by the name of Cox. This man, on
                        account of so much fighting and the unsettled conditions, had moved away and abandoned his farm
                        for the time being, although he had a good house and good improvements. Hare told us that we
                        could sleep in Cox's house and that he could let us have something to eat. We had
                        sufficient bedding to get along with, and we got food from the Hare family. All that were old
                        enough to do any work took hold and did what they could. Father worked in the blacksmith shop
                        and my mother and sisters did the washings, while we children picked peas and did any other work
                        as we could. All tried to do something to help along. While spending the week here, we could
                        hear the roar of the cannon towards Petersburg and <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                        </placeName>. Grant and Lee were having a hot time there. One morning while stopping at the Cox
                        house, I remember we had a white frost.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>The day finally came when Hare loaded us into his wagons and started for the Yankee pickets. In
                        the course of time, we reached the picket line which was, if I had the directions right, a short
                        distance west of Suffolk.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> When we reached the pickets, a number of soldiers
                        gathered around and my mother told them how happy we were to see them and that we had been
                        wanting to see the Yankees for a long time, and now we had reached them. The soldiers stood
                        around with their eyes and ears open, somewhat amused no doubt, as my mother made them a short
                        speech, telling them who we were and where we were from. They put us in charge of a soldier who
                        put us on the train, took us to <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Portsmouth</settlement>
                        </placeName> and there put us in charge of the Sanitary Commission, where we remained over
                        night.</p>
                    <p>The next morning we went across to Norfolk,<hi rend="sup">10</hi> where our baggage was searched

                        </placeName>, Indiana. My father had a brother-in-law by the name of Dix Coffin, who came to
                        this state several years before the War, living southeast from <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Greenfield</settlement>
                        </placeName>. We got off the cars at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Charlottesville</settlement>
                        </placeName>, Indiana.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Of course, Uncle Dix had no intimation that we were
                        coming, as there was practically no communication between the North and the South in those
                        times. So when father, who had walked to Uncle Dix's to get a wagon to convey the
                        balance of us, made his appearance and told who he was, they could not have been much more
                        surprised had someone come from another plannet. Those of us who were left at the railroad
                        station finally got tired of waiting for the wagon, so some who were the most able to walk
                        started walking towards Uncle Dix's. When we had gone some distance, we met the wagon
                        coming for use, but we proceeded and reached Uncle's house before the wagon.</p>
                    <p>Such hospitality as was extended us! There was a pretty good sized family of the Coffins and when
                        fourteen more were added that made a lot of mouths to be fed, but we were all made to feel
                        welcome and we had plenty of the very best of food. I then became acquainted with the boy,
                        ‘who afterwards was known as Dr. Coffin, and I was always fond of him.</p>
                    <p>We remained with Uncle Dix a week or more as I remember. In the meantime, my father took his gold
                        and silver to <geogName>Bettle Hills</geogName> Bank at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Carthage</settlement>

                        </placeName>, and exchanged it for greenbacks, getting $2.75 for one dollar in
                        specie. The North had not yet won the War and there was still some doubt in the minds of some as
                        to what the ultimate result would be.</p>
                    <p>My father went out to Amo<hi rend="sup">12</hi> in <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Hendricks County</region>
                        </placeName> and bought an eighty acre farm adjoining his cousin, Jesse Wheeler, who, as I have
                        told you, left <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName> just before the War. I remember that we reached Am on the evening of the November
                        election, the day that Abraham Lincoln was re-elected for the second term. Those were stormy
                        days politically.</p>
                    <p>It looks strange now that only seventy years ago there was such a large number of persons who
                        justified slavery and the system of slavery. Looking at it from our standpoint, we
                        don't see how they could. Speaking from my observations as a boy, you could say
                        something for both sides.</p>
                    <p>In the section from which I came, there were not many persons owning a large number of slaves,
                        but mostly from half a dozen to a dozen, sometimes more and sometimes fewer. As a rule, these
                        slaves were treated with consideration and care, had plenty of suitable food, and if sick, were
                        given medical aid, and frequently there was quite an attachment formed. It was the large

                        was practiced.</p>
                    <p>My father, as I remember, had two negroes on different occasions, hired from their masters. The
                        first one was owned by a Methodist preacher. The slave's name was Alec Clinard. I
                        became strongly attached to him. He had a separate room close to the house where he slept and
                        spent his evenings.</p>
                    <p>There were some free negroes living near our home. One was a widow named Patsy Ellis. She had
                        three sons, named Tom, Dick and Pomp. They were all good banjo pickers. Occasionally one and
                        sometimes two of the would come over and spend the evening with Alec, and they would sing and
                        pick the banjo. I enjoyed going to Alec's quarters to hear them. When Ale&amp; year
                        was up and he left my father's employment, I hated so badly to see him go.</p>
                    <p>A year or two later father employed a colored man by the name of Preston Mendenhall. This slave
                        belonged to Delphina Mendenhall, a cultured <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                        </placeName> woman. The Mendenhalls had planned to free all of their slaves, but laws were
                        enacted so they could not liberated within the slave state of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName>, and the War came on before they could take them to a free state to set them free.
                        Preston was also a nice moral negro, and I liked him very much. His quarters were in a house
                        across the road from our dwelling. I used to go over and spend the evenings with him and teach
                        him to spell and read, but I later head that it was against the law to teach a negro how to do
                        these things.</p>
                    <p>On one Saturday afternoon, Preston had been to the Mill and it was late when he returned home.
                        After taking care of the horses, he came over to the house hurriedly and all excited, saying
                        that someone had stolen all of his clothes. On investigation, we found that someone had been in
                        his quarters and had taken all of his Sunday clothes from the chest where he kept them. They had
                        raised the lid and gathered everything in their arms and gone out the back door, leaving it
                        open. We found a necktie on the ground that had been dropped. Suspicion at once fell on a
                        colored man who had spent Saturday night with Preston only a week or two before this.</p>
                    <p>This fellow was a laborer on the railroad, one of a section crew. The section house or quarters
                        was down the railroad a couple of miles, so on Sunday morning, father started out with Preston
                        to find his clothes. They went to the section house and, on inquiry, learned that the negro in
                        question had gone to <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Greensboro</settlement>
                        </placeName>. They waited until nearly time for his return, then started down the track towards <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Greensboro</settlement>
                        </placeName>. They had not gone far when they saw the Negro coming. One of them climbed out of
                        the deep cut, got back from the bank and proceeded towards the negro. After he had passed him,
                        he then climbed down the bank to the track, thus one was behind and one in front of the Negro.
                        When they came up to him, sure enough, he was wearing Preston's Sunday cloths. Preston
                        was so angry that he took hold of him and gave him a good shaking and wanted to give him a
                        beating, but this job was left for the section foreman.</p>
                    <p>When a negro went any place for pleasure, to be gone any distance or length of time, he would
                        have to carry a pass from his owner or employer, otherwise, he was liable to be taken up by the
                        patrol (usually <pb n="474" id="VAA4025-033-4-092"/> called patterroll), and, if'
                        unable to give a satisfactory account of himself, was flogged and turned loose.</p>
                    <p>I made allusion further back in this sketch to the attachment that often existed between slaves
                        and their owners or children of their owners, and also of the care the slaves received. As an
                        illustration, though this probably was an exception, my father had a cousin who owned some
                        slaves, less than a dozen, I think. Old Aunt Mary was the "mammy" and the
                        cook. The cooking was done in the negro quarters, separate from the dwelling of the whites.
                        These Negroes always got the same quality of food that the whites ate. Aunt Mary would keep back
                        a part for her own people, just as good as the white folks had. The owners of these Negroes were
                        radical Southerners, and, at the outbreak of the War, owing to political disagreement, this
                        family and my father's family broke friendly relations. It was told us after the close
                        of the War that Union soldiers came to the home, and compelled the mistress and her daughters to
                        prepare food for them; then required them to eat of the food before the soldiers partook as a
                        guarantee that it was not poison. It was reported that this woman had said that she would rather
                        have her throat cut than be taken by the Yankees.</p>
                    <p>Soon after the close of the War, my mother made a visit back to the South and on interviewing an
                        old colored woman she asked her how she enjoyed her freedom, and she received the following
                        reply: "Oh honey, I neveh had a care while I was with mastah and missus. Always plety
                        to eat and wear and if any of us got sick, we had a doctah. But now it's diffrunt. But
                        you knows, honey, dat de birds of de air lak freedom." So we see the sentiment was not
                        all on one side.</p>
                    <p>I have written these sketches from memory after a lapse of over seventy years. In the fall of
                        1935, not having seen my old state for over thirty years, I decided to go back and view may
                        native land, as it were. I had heard much said of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName>, of developments and improvements that had been made, but to make this more
                        impressive, I had to see it with my own eyes. The roads, to start with, are simply marvelous,
                        especially the improved roads and roads adjacent to towns, and many modern homes have been
                        built. What formerly consisted of one farm is now cut up into various tracts or homesteads, and,
                        while their soil in the main will not produce like Indiana soil, even the farmers seem to be
                        getting along fairly well. The southern people have an element of thrift that we of the North
                        seem to lack in a measure, I fear.</p>
                    <p>In recording this story of what transpired when I was a boy, I have endeavored to deal with facts
                        and have not overdrawn the picture. I have written a record of these incidents at the
                        solicitation of my sons. Never having gone into the details of my early life with them, for the
                        reason, I suppose, that I was always too busy, I have now tried to respond to their request.
                        Knowing that I shall not be here many years longer at most, I want to leave to all who may be
                        interested, some account of my early years, especially of the trying years of the Civil War in <placeName>

                    Historical Society, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1937. Pp. ix, 283.</head>
            <p>This volume, Indiana Historical Society <hi rend="i">Publications</hi>, XII, as the
                    "Foreword" tells us, was written as a memorial to the author's wife,
                    Julia Conner Thompson, of most pleasant memory to the members of the Society of Indiana Pioneers.
                    Mrs. Thompson was a great-granddaughter of John Conner and a great-grandniece of William Conner. She
                    felt that the efforts and influence of her pioneer ancestors should be better understood, and their
                    characters, deeds and public service entitle them to the recognition which this volume accords. Mrs.
                    Thompson, before her lamented death in 1928, had collected some materials on the Conners, and she
                    became the inspiration for the worthy achievement of her husband in the production of this volume.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson's interest in the early life of Indiana was promoted by his activities in the
                    Society of Indiana Pioneers, of which Society he was the honored President for many years. He is a
                    graduate of DePauw University, a member of the American Historical Association, of the
                        <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> Historical Association, and of the Indiana Historical
                    Society. He has been an intelligent reader of history. He is a lawyer, who approaches the writing of
                    history like a trained historical student. As he knows the principles of evidence in a court of law,
                    so he understands the difference between tradition and historical evidence. He knows the difference
                    between "hearsay" and the documentary evidence upon which all true history is
                    based—a distinction frequently illustrated in the pages of his book. Any conclusion which
                    he draws from tradition is given only on the law of probability, and herein lies the historical
                    value of this volume.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson's work gives us more than the personal, pioneer life of the Conners. It records
                    more than a hundred years of the history of the frontier as influenced by European policies and
                    Indian affairs. From birth to mature manhood, the Conners lived among the Indians. They came to know
                    their customs, manners, and several of their languages, and they came to be trusted interpreters of
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in making Indian treaties. They married <hi rend="i">among</hi> the Indians and raised

                    and affiliated with their own race and became potent factors in the growth of early Indiana, as
                    legislators, road-makers, town-builders, merchants, farmers, and men of affairs. <placeName>

            <p>To lead to an understanding of these frontier lives, the author found it necessary to examine the
                    historical background of the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> for more than a century. He makes
                    known the distribution of Indian tribes in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana, and describes the work of the early Moravian Missions among the Indians.
                    He strikes the high points in Northwestern history from 1750 to the battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794
                    and the Treaty of Greenville of the following year. The father of these pioneers, Richard Conner,
                    "was in the heart of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Ohio country</region>
                    </placeName> from 1767 to 1782; their mother, Margaret Boyer, was from childhood a captive of the
                    Shawnee Indians. These parents of John and William were preserved to become two of the earliest
                    settlers of central Indiana. Thus they figured in the great struggle between Indian civilization and
                    the oncoming tide of the white race.</p>
            <p>Richard Conner and Margaret Boyer, the long lost captive girl of Lehigh Gap, were married in a small
                    Indian village in a trackless wilderness. David Zeisberger, the devoted Moravian missionary, appears
                    upon the scene. He founds the town of Schoenbrunn ("Beautiful Spring"). Here was
                    established the first Protestant church in America west of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> (1772), and here was the first school house in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> north and west of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The story is told of how the Moravians, who formed a Christian settlement of pious men, were
                    dispossessed of their settlement and holdings and carried to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> for trial for anti-British activities, a charge on which they were acquitted. We read
                    how ninety Christian Indians were foully murdered by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>

                    massacres.</p>
            <p>In 1803, John Conner visited <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he met President Jefferson. He saw better ways of living, and from this time it
                    was his intention to ally himself with the forces of organized society. He acquired land in a region
                    where the Indian title had been extinguished. His store in the <geogName>Whitewater
                    valley</geogName> became a landmark for Indians and settlers. He <pb n="477" id="VAA4025-033-4-095"/> became one of the principal fur traders in all the region round about. He knew the prices of
                    skins and how they were dressed—the beaver, otter, raccoon, mink, muskrat, skunk,
                    wildcat, martin, panther, deer, and bear—and from these sources he acquired a measurable
                    affluence in wordly goods.</p>
            <p>The Conners knew the secrets of the forests. The tracks of beasts, the flight of birds, the changing
                    colors of woods and waters, all had meaning for them. The boys left the settled life of agriculture
                    for the more open life of the Indian trapper and trader. They preferred the western wilderness to
                    the "sodden centres", or forts, like Pittsburg and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The results of their lives vindicated their choice. The volume tells us of the
                    splendid Indiana woods—made up of walnut, poplar, maple, oak, linden, cherry, sycamore,
                    and other specimens. The soil had been fertilized for centuries by the decomposing of
                    vegetation—nature had been enriching the earth.</p>
            <p>General Harrison, the Territorial Governor, in his treaty-making with the Indians for land cessions,
                    realized that he must have for scouts and interpreters men of integrity an judgment. The Conners
                    were at hand. The services they rendered were noteworthy. Their influence over the Delawares in
                    keeping them loyal to the government relieved General Harrison of much trouble.</p>
            <p>A chapter is given to the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> in the war of 1812. After that war, a tide
                    of immigration began pouring into Indiana Territory. In 1812, there were not 35,000 people there. By
                    the end of 1815 there were over 63,000, and the territory was ready for statehood. This immigration
                    came from <placeName>

                    libraries and seminaries, which indicated how his mind was broadening. He came to know such
                    political leaders as James Noble, William Hendricks, and Jonathan Jennings,</p>
            <p>The career of William Connor is also told in detail. These men <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>were courageous in the midst of danger, they were impervious to physical
                            discomforts… they knew when to be silent and when to speak. The wisdom of their
                            counsel had been proved more than once. they had been a significant economic factor in the
                            lives of the Delawares, for with other traders they had provided a market for furs and in
                            return had supplied articles necessary to the personal comfort and satisfaction of the
                            Indians. They had influenced this peaceful tribe against participation in war….
                            It is probably true that they charged the Indians high prices for their merchandise, and
                            undoubtedly they exchanged whisky for their furs. That was the custom of all Indian traders.
                            Currency was little used as a medium of exchange. Goods, trinkets, and liquor met this need.

                    their domestic animals. The transition from village life to forest life came hard. They suffered
                    from ague and fever. Travel was hard. What was thought to be a road turned out to be a furrow of
                    mud, then a trace for foot travelers. Taverns were infrequent. The night silence was pierced by the
                    hooting of owls and the howling of wolves. Such was life as experienced by the early pioneer.</p>
            <p>In William Conner's cabin, the Commissioners met. They were charged with the task of

                    re-visited <pb n="479" id="VAA4025-033-4-097"/> Indiana and gave testimony to the fair dealing and
                    high character of the Conners. Similar testimony was given by men of prominence among Indiana
                    pioneers.</p>
            <p>William Conner now married Elizabeth Chapman, a white girl thirty years younger than he, though he
                    was yet more Indian than white from experience. He was turning a new page in his life, coming back
                    to his own race. Long years of his life were ending, a new life was beginning. There was no
                    honeymoon nor wedding trip. The bride and groom ferried across <geogName>White River</geogName>, or
                    forded it, and rode horseback to Conner's cabin.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson describes William Conner's new house, the fine brick mansion of 1823. After
                    this house had fallen into some decay, it was bought and restored in 1935 by Dr. Eli Lilly,
                    President of the Indiana Historical Society. There is a fireplace in each room, upstairs and down,
                    and cupboards with dishes and glassware of the Conner era. The house is now a landmark in central
                    Indiana, for which thanks are due to Mr. and Mrs. Lilly and Mr. Thompson.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson mentions, though he does not credit, the tradition that James Fenimore Cooper visited
                    Conner in his Indiana home in a search for Indian lore. Governor Cass of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> felt that Cooper was "gilding" the Indian character, and he wrote an
                    article for the <hi rend="i">North American Review</hi> "bent on destroying this romantic
                    conception of savage lifequot;. Cass directed Charles C. Trowbridge of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, to visit Conner, whom Trowbridge found to be "an intelligent gentleman and an
                    excellent interpreter." At that time, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> had a population of 300. Trowbridge found wheat selling at twenty-five cents a bushel
                    and corn at from six to ten cents. "The Indians", said Trowbridge,
                    "supplied us all winter with turkeys at six cents eachquot;. Such were other aspects of the
                    frontier.</p>
            <p>Professor Baynard R. Hall was a guest of William Conner in his mansion home. The writer of this
                    review edited the <placeName>

                    </placeName> edition of Hall's <hi rend="i">New Purchase</hi> more than twenty years ago.
                    If he had known then as much about the Conners as this book reveals, he would have corrected the
                    "Key" by identifying "Redwhite" with William Conner instead of
                    John; and he might have added a note of caution to the reader to beware of Hall's
                    extravagance in his description of the feast which he enjoyed in Conner's home.</p>
            <p>William Conner was a part of the early movement for <pb n="480" id="VAA4025-033-4-098"/> the
                    improvement of common schools in Indiana. In 1831 there was a convention in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> of the "friends of educationquot;. Conner was associated in this cause with
                    well known men of the time—David Wallace, Stephen C. Stevens, Ratliff Boon, Samuel
                    Merrill, Calvin Fletcher, John Law, William W. Wick, Oliver H. Smith, John Wishard, Isaac Coe, John
                    Tipton, and Jesse H. Holman. In 1833 the "Association for the Improvement of Common
                    Schools" met at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with Senator William Hendricks presiding. President Andrew Wylie of Indiana College
                    was there, along with Miles Eggleston and Benjamin Parke. A committee appointed to nominate new
                    members recommended that eleven be chosen from different parts of the state; among these were
                    Governor Noble and James M. Ray of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, James Whitcomb of Blooming-ton, afterwards Governor and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator, and William Conner of <placeName>

            <p>In politics, William Conner was first a National Republican and then a Whig. He was a delegate from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName> to a state convention of <placeName>

                    </placeName> "National Republicans", in November, 1831. The author notices the
                    "national convention of Anti-masons in 1831", followed some months later
                    "by a convention of the National Republicans supporting <placeName>

                    nominated Van Burenquot;. To the unknowing reader this may be misleading. The author means that Van
                    Buren was nominated for <hi rend="i">Vice President</hi> in 1832. No convention nomination was
                    necessary for Jackson; he was accepted by the party and the country as the presidential nominee
                    before the convention met.</p>
            <p>In 1837, William Conner began closing his career as legislator and fur trader. He sold his large
                    collection of fur to the American Fur Company. He helped in the project of a railroad from <placeName>

                    and a half. William Conner owned 3,000 acres of good land, including tracts in several counties. He
                    died on August 28, 1855.</p>
            <p>John Conner had died in 1826. His funeral sermon was preached by the Rev. George Bush of <placeName>

            <p>Of William Conner, we are told that he was "a large man, straight as an arrow, with a homely
                    sense of humor and justice; wholly self-educated; of kindly disposition; generous to his friends and
                    to strangers; implacable to his few enemies—an Indian characteristic; held in popular
                    esteem; modest, seldom spoke of his life's adventures, committed nothing to
                    paper." He lived forty-seven years with the Indians, and was not detached from that life
                    until 1820.</p>
            <p>The volume contains a map of early <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with a "Key", indicating public and private buildings. There is a
                    good index and a bibliography that is extensive, if not exhaustive. The author, like a careful
                    student, cites the authorities for his statements, and many of them are authorities that are
                    original and rare. These citations and notes are not in footnotes but are in the
                    "appendix," and, in many cases, they contain very interesting
                    reading—as interesting as that in the body of the text itself. This is saying a good
                    deal, as the volume is written in clear, concise, readable English, with a narrative of continuous
                    interest. The whole book with its inviting topics will prove especially attractive to all who have
                    any interest in the frontier life of early Indiana. The volume is a credit not only to its author
                    but to the Indiana Historical Society which has many valuable publications on its list. For this,
                    its latest production, and one of its best, we owe Mr. Thompson a debt of gratitude.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Oliver Pollock: The Life and Times of an Unknown Patriot.</hi> By James Alton James.
                    D. Appleton-Century Company, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

            <p>Though the life of <hi rend="i">Oliver Pollock</hi> has come from the press not long after the
                    retirement of Dean James from active teaching in Northwestern University, it can hardly be called a
                    fruit of his retirement. He has been collecting material and writing about Pollock for many years.
                    It dovetails into his <hi rend="i">Life of George Rogers Clark</hi> and his two volumes of <hi rend="i">George Rogers Clark Papers</hi>. It stands side by side with these other books as a
                    notable contribution to our understanding of the American Revolution in the West.</p>
            <p>Oliver Pollock, while not entirely an unknown patriot, has not hitherto received the recognition to
                    which the importance of his work entitles him; he has neither been the <pb n="482" id="VAA4025-033-4-100"/> subject of adequate historical writing nor has he been commemorated in
                    public memorials. This explains, and I think justifies, Professor James' tendency
                    throughout the book to cap accounts of Pollock's activities with reiterations of his
                    patriotism, importance, and high character.</p>
            <p>The story of Pollock's services in the American cause did in fact need telling, and
                    Professor James has told it with scrupulous exactness, as well as with appreciation. Much of
                    Pollock's work in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> was crowned with success. He sent supplies, including valuable military material, not
                    only to George Rogers Clark and other soldiers in the West, but to the American armies in eastern
                    centers of operation. He financed the Revolution to such an extent that he ought to be ranked with
                    Robert Morris, his partner in trade, as an essential factor in keeping the Revolution going. He was
                    also one of the key men in securing the cooperation of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> in the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> and on the Gulf of Mexico. His relations
                    with the Spanish authorities at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, General Alejandro O'Reilly of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and, after him, Governor Bernardo de Galvez, Governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>, counted for a great deal in maintaining the American cause. At the same time, his
                    relations with the Spanish, far from misleading him into giving them advantages in the
                        <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> which would have been disastrous to the Americans, were
                    exploited with an eye single to the interests of the American nation.</p>
            <p>It was the tragedy of Pollock's career, as of the career of George Rogers Clark and many
                    other patriots, that he neither had resources nor received support sufficient to carry his work and
                    his plans through to the complete success which seemed to be almost within his reach. After he had
                    been drawn upon for supplies and money till his credit was exhausted, after he had appealed time and
                    time again in vain for means to sustain and rehabilitate his credit, he was faced with fresh demands
                    which he could not meet. Thus the cause which he promoted broke him and at the same time failed of
                    complete success. The Americans in the West failed to reach <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the north, or <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> at the south. In the latter part of the war it was left for <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>, to seize Mobile and Pensacola, and, in the treaty of peace, to get possession for a
                    generation of East and West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Professor James has included in his life of <hi rend="i">Oliver Pollock</hi> most of the story of
                    George Rogers Clark in the War of the <pb n="483" id="VAA4025-033-4-101"/> American Revolution. Like
                    his life of Clark, this volume is almost a history of the Revolutionary War in the West. His
                    conclusion upon the question "The Northwest: Conquest or Gift?" which was raised
                    years ago by Clarence W. Alvord's thesis that the Earl of Shelburne virtually gave the
                    Northwest to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the negotiations for peace, is answered in a chapter by that title which emphasizes
                    above all other elements "the accomplishments of Clark, impossible without the
                    contributions of Pollock." Apropos the French and Spanish expeditions of 1780 and 1781
                    against Miamitown (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>) and Saint Joseph (near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Niles</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
               </placeName>) there is an interesting question as to
                    the site at which the raiders from Cahokia, who pillaged Saint Joseph in 1780, were cut down.
                    Professor James follows Edward G. Mason and Alvord in saying "near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>." An official contemporary English version was that it was beyond (southwest
                    of) the RiviGre du Chemin, at la Petite Fort. Some early nineteenth century maps call Trail Creek
                    which flows into <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, RiviBre du Chemin, and local tradition puts la Petite Fort in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Porter County</region>
                    </placeName> near the present entrance to Dunes State Park. Professor James attaches some weight,
                    though not over much, to the evidence that these expeditions looked toward Spanish claims to land
                    east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. Professor James has given us a much needed and the only authoritative account of
                    Oliver Pollock. Much new material has been brought to light. The preface states that he plans to
                    publish in separate volumes (as was done in the study of George Rogers Clark) contemporary material
                    relating to Pollock and Clark, throwing new light upon the significance of the events of the
                    Revolution that occurred west of the <geogName>Allegheny Mountains</geogName>.</p>

            <p>As in Volumes II and III of the series, containing the papers relating to the "Territory
                    Northwest of the <geogName>River Ohio</geogName>", emphasis has been placed on questions of
                    administration and land claims, surveys, and settlement. Students of Indiana history will find many
                    of the problems of administration comparable to those which arose contemporaneously in Indiana
                    Territory. Among these, were the effective adaptation of laws enacted for specific states to the
                    needs of a new territory; the provision of adequate courts; the development of a mail service; the
                    extended absences from the territory of governors and judges; the interruptions in government caused
                    by the death or resignation of officers and the long intervals necessarily devoted to carrying the
                    news of such vacancies to the seat of government, securing the appointment of new officers, and
                    transporting them to their posts.</p>
            <p>A letter from Secretary of State Pickering to Andrew Ellicott, commissioner to fix the boundary
                    between the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>, indicates the painful need for the establishment of roads and post routes and makes
                    entirely clear why the inhabitants of the territory sometimes felt themselves forgotten by the
                    Federal government. Pickering wrote on August 30, 1798: "Your want of tents, as announced
                    in your letter of April 1st (<hi rend="i">recd</hi> June 11th) had escaped my attention, until your
                    letter of June 19th (<hi rend="i">recd</hi> 24th August) reminded me of it: I will give immediate
                    orders for making and forwarding them."</p>
            <p>Among the papers are a number of hitherto unpublished letters of Thomas Jefferson, and letters of the
                    different secretaries. There are printed the acts relating to the formation of the territory and its
                    land system, petitions from the citizens and legislature to Congress (It seemed to be the fate of
                    these prayerful documents to reach <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> after the adjournment of Congress, lie over until the next session, and result in the
                    enactment of laws which were already outmoded by the time they reached the territory, thus
                    necessitating new <pb n="485" id="VAA4025-033-4-103"/> petitions which followed the same melancholy
                    schedule), letters from the governors and secretaries, from the judges, occasional letters relating
                    to Indian and military affairs, and petitions from merchants who had difficulty in getting their
                    goods into the country without double payment of duties. Opposing political factions are well
                    illustrated.</p>
            <p>Many papers deal with the complicated French, Spanish, and British claims that had to be settled
                    before the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> could begin disposing of lands, the group of claims under <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>'s act of cession, the differences in interpretation of the general laws in
                    different districts of the territory, and the problem of opening unclaimed lands under a system
                    liberal enough to prevent inhabitants from moving into Spanish territory. Writing of the solictitude
                    of the people on these matters, Secretary Thomas H. Williams said, in 1805, that it was "a
                    Subject on which hang if not all their affections, at least all their anxieties." Judge
                    Thomas Rodney wrote about the same time: "The Land business here has certainly been much
                    more Troublesome and Difficult than Congress apprehended—The Testimony required to
                    establish different Claims has put the people to great Trouble difficulty and Exyence—and
                    has produced great delay beyond what Congress seems to have contemplated."</p>

               </placeName>. Pp. ix, 195.</head>
            <p>This little volume is made up of a series of poems relating to the pioneer life of a period extending
                    from 1780 to 1875. As a teacher of history in the Academy of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Berea</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, Mrs. Peck conceived the idea of visiting the homes and schools of the students
                    who had been in her classes. These visits, made on foot or on muleback, furnished the opportunity to
                    learn many of the facts on which she has based her poems. <pb n="486" id="VAA4025-033-4-104"/> While
                    traveling in the southern mountains, many areas of which are truly retarded frontiers, she gathered
                    up old wills, deeds, letters, journals, and newspapers. Though a reader and lover of poetry, the
                    author first tried to tell her story in prose, but the attempt was abandoned. The subjects suggested
                    by the accumulated material on pioneer life called for portrayal in verse, and the result is a book
                    of poems.</p>
            <p>Of the volume, Mrs. Peck says in her "Foreword": "It was not written for

                    for anybody who enjoys rich, full-flavored life, even though he knows little about the history of
                    American pioneeringquot;. Of the success of Mrs. Peck's effort to express her conception of
                    the frontier in poetry, Stephen Benet says: "She's dug up some beautiful material
                    and told it with a very effective readable directness."</p>
            <p>Only a few of the selections in the volume can be noticed in, this brief review. In the first poem,
                    "White Man", the Indian, Black Hoof, ponders deeply the coming of settlers to his
                    forests. Comparing the new type of man with his own race, he concludes that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The Spirit never meant him to live in our forest. If he possessed it, he could not live in
                            it. He is too weak and full of fear, Too lazy and woman-bound. If he possessed it, he would
                            straightway hack it down. The Spirit never meant him to live in our forests.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The poem "Walthena" reveals the longing of a pioneer woman for some touch of denied
                    beauty in her home, a longing satisfied by giving her daughters symbolic names: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>But I chose names for loveliness alone. Fair-Anna is a spoon of silver bright, Lizelle a

                    </placeName> has had a long history. It has been a history marked by the development of a high
                    civilization, by bitter conflicts and by stirring events. Reaching from the Cumber-lands to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, the state is made up of sections with diverse interests. The commonwealth has always
                    been both western and southern, while, at the same time bound to the North by strong ties. Much has
                    been written on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, but the time was ripe for a single-volume history of the state that would bring the
                    story down to the present, and furnish a balanced account of the middle and earlier periods. The new
                    volume is, therefore, timely.</p>
            <p>The first chapter is devoted to geography and the economic factor is stressed throughout the volume.
                    The state's history to 1865 is given over four hundred fifty pages, leaving about one
                    hundred twenty-five to the period since the Civil <pb n="488" id="VAA4025-033-4-106"/> War. In both
                    the ante-bellum and the later periods, the author deals not only with political and economic
                    developments but also with education and culture. One of the chapters on the middle period is
                    devoted to slavery in <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>There are no footnotes but there is an extensive bibliography for each chapter. These classified
                    lists of original and secondary matter occupy forty pages near the end of the volume. There is a
                    comprehensive index and three maps—a political map of the state, an topographical map,
                    and a Civil War map. There are fourteen well-chosen illustrations that add to the attractiveness of
                    the volume.</p>
            <p>It has not been an easy matter, even for a man reared and educated outside of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, to write the history of a state so often torn by conflicts. Doctor Clark has attempted
                    to write "a straightforward narrative setting forth the salient points of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>'s social, economic and political growth," and has measured up to the
                    standard set for himself. From beginning to end the story is interesting and varied. It is informing
                    and readable. It will furnish the general reader with a generous knowledge of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>'s history. The special student will find in the volume the basis for a more
                    extended study, which the bibliography will greatly aid him in making.</p>

            <p>I entered Indiana University in September, 1901,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> with ninety term-hours to my
                    credit for college work previously done.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> I was given junior standing, but I
                    could have attained the same status eleven years earlier had circumstances permitted me to begin a
                    college course in the fall immediately after graduation from high school. It was still true in the
                    early years of the new century that a large number of teachers obtained degrees several years late,
                    and I did not worry much. Indeed I was too happy over the chance that had at last come to me to
                    waste any time regretting my lot. I do not think that the eleven years were lost. They were years of
                    slow advancement, it is true, but, wherever I worked, I gave about as good service as was possible
                    with the resources at my command. I am only sorry that I had to work so long without a better
                    equipment.</p>
            <p>The long first stage of the University ended about 1885. There had been several great men on the
                    faculty between 182–885, who will always be remembered, but the modern period did not
                    begin tin the coming of David Starr Jordan. Prior to his presidency, the University was a struggling
                    college, with a student body that had never exceeded 200. The number of graduates in 1884 was only
                    twenty-one. During the year 190–902, the total number of different students enrolled was
                    1,469, and the number of bachelor's degrees granted in June, 1902, was one hundred six,
                    including fifteen who received law degrees.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                            but, contracting a deep chest-cold, I was obliged to withdraw at about the middle of the
                            six-weeks. While I was in school I was privileged to become well acquainted with Dr. John A.

                            three-year course for a high school graduate. It was practically impossible to meet the
                            major requirements and obtain the necessary credits in prescribed fields and obtain the A.B.
                            degree by earning ninety term-hours. I found it necessary to earn one hundred three hours of

                    repaired and an extra story added in 1900, and the Observatory was finished in that year. Assembly
                    Hall, now called the "Woodshed", was erected in 1896. It is referred to in the
                    official publications of my student years as the "Men's Gymnasium", with
                    no apologies.</p>
            <p>One of the humorous sallies of the <hi rend="i">Student</hi>, which appeared in one of the early
                    issues of the twentieth century, was: "When coming to or leaving <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, always travel by the Monon." I came that way even before getting the benefit
                    of this helpful suggestion. Being a married man, I sought for a place where it would be possible to
                    do light-housekeeping. When my wife appeared a few days later, she found me wrestling with the small
                    batch of household furniture that we had shipped from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName>. I was having a hard time to place our effects in the two rooms that I had engaged in a
                    house located in the two-hundred block on East Seventh Street. We were settled snugly enough before
                    the opening of the University year. In a short time, we discovered twenty or more married couples,
                    some with children, who had also found living quarters in homes about the city. Two or three of
                    these families occupied entire houses.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> boasted a population of 6,460. The improved streets were well rounded-up and covered
                    with finely crushed limestone. The non-improved streets, of which Indiana Avenue was one, were
                    surfaced with red clay. In wet weather, one picked his way across this thoroughfare by stepping
                    carefully on flat stones that were placed a foot or so apart at intersections. When I left the
                    University with my diploma in June, 1903, the City Council was engaged in a debate, as it had been
                    for some weeks, on a proposal to begin the construction of a sewer system. The <placeName>

            <p>I had taken about a year each of American and European history while a student in the Normal School.
                    On the basis of this and such work as I had done in grades and high school, I served one year as a
                    teacher of history in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>

                    was during that one year, while teaching history exclusively, that I mastered enough history to
                    serve as a groundwork for some specialization in that field. The courses that I carried with
                    Professors James A. Woodburn, Samuel B. Harding, Amos S. Hershey, and Ulysses G. Weatherly, in
                    history, political science, and economics were deeply appreciated. An opportunity, beyond anything
                    that had ever come to me earlier, to read in these fields, was enjoyed to the limit.</p>
            <p>Since I was endeavoring to complete the requirements for an A.B. degree, it was necessary to take
                    certain prescribed work besides social studies courses. Dropping out to teach during the spring
                    quarter of 1902, I spent the summer at <geogName>Winona Lake</geogName>, where I met the requirement
                    in science. It was necessary to take some courses in mathematics, which afforded me the privilege of
                    working with Professors Ulysses S. Hanna and Robert J. Aley. While under the instruction of Dr.
                    Aley, I thoroughly enjoyed the struggle provided by the problems in Charles Smith's <hi rend="i">College Algebra</hi>. I carried one year of German and one of French during my two
                    years at the University, which I did not mind at all, though I regretted that I had not been
                    permitted to do much more with each of these languages earlier in life.</p>

                    the thirty-four years that have passed do not really indicate the distance between the conditions
                    then and now. Books cost far less and food prices and rents were low. Every quarter, each student
                    paid a library fee of one dollar, and, except in laboratory courses, there was no additional fee. In
                    the fall quarter of 1902, the total expense for fees, books, and other school supplies for Mrs.
                    Lynch and myself was $18.45. This included a Waterman pen, at $2.50, a
                    subscription to the <hi rend="i">Student</hi> for a quarter, at seventy-five cents, and a share in
                    the "Co-op", costing $2.00 We bought seven text books at a total cost
                    of $8.90. In the same fall quarter, I went alone to the first football
                    game—admission twenty-five cents. The most important game played at <placeName>

                        each.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> I do not recall that there were any seats at a higher price.</p>
            <p>We went home during the Christmas holidays each year but at no other time. This was a fairly
                    expensive vacation as the round-trip carefare to Delphi was $10.54 for two, at the
                    holiday rate of one and one-third fare. I must mention that when people traveled in those days,
                    whether they went very far or not, they usually took a trunk along. Trunks were carried free by the
                    railroads, but one always had to look after drayage and checking the baggage. The popular suitcase
                    of the time was the "telescopequot;. There were more expensive traveling bags in use, but
                    the "telescope" was the universal companion of common folk for several years when
                    making trips. The inventor of this contraption should have been shot before he carried out his idea.
                    Should he still be living, I would at least vote for a short prison term, were he on trial and I a
                    juryman. The "telescope" had two unforgetably bad features. In the first place, it
                    was broader from side to side than vertically when suspended from the hand. This made it necessary
                    for one carrying a packed "telescope" in his right hand to lean far over to the
                    left as he walked along. In the second place, whatever the size (and there were all sizes, ranging
                    from tiny ones to those as big as trunks) of the "telescope", when empty and
                    closed, it could be filled to twice that size and <list type="footnotes">

            <p>It was during my senior year that the History Club was formed. My recollection is that Frank C. Gray,
                    a major in history from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the originator of the idea and the chief promoter of the Club. His principal
                    abettor at first was Walter Grey ("Pat") Murphy from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Murphy was also a major in history and a good student. He was a large young
                    man with much native humor, who scorned conventions and anything like polish. He lived his life in
                    his own way.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> The members of the history faculty approved the plan to form a
                    Club and most of the history majors were soon enlisted in its support. It was launched in the middle
                    of the fall quarter of 1902, and still lives. The first annual banquet was held in March of 1903 in
                    one of the churches. It was quite an affair with toasts by professors and students. The price per
                    plate was seventy-five cents, which meant a rather expensive dinner in that era.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Science Hall was completed in 1902 and was ready for use at some time during my senior year. A move
                    towards the erection of a student building was started in the summer of 1902. Subscriptions were
                    taken then and during the following year. A daring idea was conjured up by some one to the effect
                    that every senior on the campus ought to give ten dollars. I had subscribed five dollars during the
                    summer when Charles M. Lawrence visited Delphi, and now pledged another five to come up to the
                    standard set. That seems a very small total as I look back to it, but, in that day, it meant giving
                    till it hurt for most of the students who contributed. The building was planned to cost
                    $80,000, half of which was a gift from John D. Rockefeller. Construction costs were
                    comparatively low then, it is very evident.</p>
            <p>There has been much said and written about the search for jobs in recent years. I can testify that
                    the problem was present in that earlier period. In the summer of 1902, I was offered a place as a
                    high school teacher at ninety dollars a month. I turned it down, because, poor as I was, I was in

                    Indiana, but I rejected this offer too. Though I was only to receive an A.B. degree at the end of
                    the year, I was encouraged to try for a position in a Normal School. I narrowly escaped being chosen

                    letters and investigated me carefully. In the end he informed me, after the appointment had been
                    made, that I was one of three out of forty selected for final consideration. The place went to a
                    candidate who had just completed the work for a doctor's degree, as was entirely proper. I
                    know that many college professors of my age have passed through similar experiences, and often met
                    with what seemed overwhelming disappointments. It is interesting, in retrospect, to think how happy
                    one can be that he did not succeed in certain efforts, since success would have made it impossible
                    for later and more desirable opportunities to present themselves.</p>

                    </placeName> Public Schools, and I went to see the School Board. When I held out for a certain
                    modest salary ($900 per year), the Board decided to retain the man who had just resigned
                    to go elsewhere for a trifle more than that. I was called to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, just after Commencement, to confer with Professor Henry Thurston and President Arnold

                    when I discussed the matter with Dr. Thurston, I discovered that he wanted a man who would be
                    willing to give a course in anthropology, in addition to history courses. I could only state frankly
                    that I had no special or even general preparation in the line of anthropology, though I believe that
                    I could have defined the term. The weeks went by and I had no place. Friends and relatives began to
                    worry, but, like Mr. Micawber, I had a feeling that something would turn up.</p>
            <p>It was about August 1, that I received a telegram from <placeName>

                    consider another candidate. No further explanation was ever made in regard to the matter. I
                    journeyed back to my job, which, except for the salary, was about as fine as any high school
                    instructorship in history in the state, and, with that job, I staid for some time.</p>
            <p>I cannot say that student life at Indiana University was better at the opening of the century than in
                    later years. Being several years older than those who spent four years at the University immediately
                    after leaving high school, I did not, of course, have a normal or regular student experience. I
                    believe that the moral tone of fraternities, and perhaps of sororities, was not as high then as in
                    later years. I am certain that, in spite of the more expensive chapter houses of the present day,
                    there was less of the democratic spirit a generation ago. I am not at all convinced that the general
                    run of students worked harder in that period than now. There was no doubt a larger element of both
                    brilliant and mediocre students who worked incessantly, paying little attention to anything save
                    school work. This was partly due to greater poverty and partly because there were fewer activities
                    to distract. It was also true that education, being harder to get and open to fewer people, was more
                    deeply appreciated. To be a University student was still by no means an ordinary condition, which

            <p>It is impossible to comment separately on the many worthwhile students whom it was my privilege to
                    know and count as friends while at the University. I was closely associated with a number who
                    obtained degrees in 1902 and in the years immediately after 1903, as well as in that year. The
                    number of students who received the A.B. degree in 1903 was 112<hi rend="sup">15</hi> I believe that
                    the class of 1903 compares favorably with any body of graduates of any year, as to the relative
                    number of able members.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The impression of Indiana University which I carried away in 1903, and it has grown on me since, was
                    that it was an institution manned by an earnest, able, hardworking faculty. I was sure that money
                    was only one of the things needed to make a strong University, but it was obvious that the state,
                    though awakening to its obligations, was not permitting the building up of a great library nor
                    creating other facilities for extensive research. There has been a strong tendency for legislators,
                    professional men and leaders in business to boast of their support of education in our state, while
                    remaining largely blind to the absolute necessity of promoting advanced study. To provide for
                    undergraduate work which serves the many, and economize on the more expensive phase of education,
                    which seems to serve the few, has been too much the prevailing idea in Indiana—an idea
                    that men have held with pride. It is nevertheless an unsound idea, as no stream can rise higher than
                    its source. To change the figure, no faculty can remain above the water-line unless many a member
                    has the passion and the chance to work on the fringe of his field in an effort to add something in
                    the way of new knowledge.</p>
            <p>I was not closely associated with members of the faculty other than those in the field of history and
                    closely related subjects. Dr. Woodburn, I found to be an enthusiastic, expert class-room teacher, a
                    kindly, persistent friend, a gentleman of culture, and a man with wide contacts and an open mind.
                    Dr. Harding was an exacting teacher and a man of force and vitality. He was thoroughly absorbed in

                    and show substantial results. Dr. Hershey was a more easy-going teacher in the class-room. He left a
                    great deal of leeway to his students. When assigned a course in which he was not interested, he
                    seemed to care little about it. In whatever he was genuinely interested he lost himself completely,
                    worked at it patiently, thought about it long and deeply, and his understanding of it grew steadily.
                    To get what Dr. Hershey had to give, the student must also be interested, work for himself, and grow
                    by catching the simple, unaffected approach of his teacher. Dr. Weatherly was a seeker after truth.
                    He read, weighed the evidence, considered the views of others without prejudice, and presented his
                    own views with candor and modesty. He was calm and dignified but stimulating. I sat at the feet of
                    these four teachers when all were approaching their best. Their spirit, their knowledge, their
                    guidance, I needed.</p>
            <p>While at the University, I came in contact with Registrar John W. Cravens and Dean Horace A. Hoffman
                    frequently, both on and off the campus. From the first each seemed like an old friend. Neither of
                    them ever failed me when I needed advice or aid. During my first year in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Dr. Joseph Swain was President. I saw him occasionally, but never learned to know him.
                    I was a senior during Dr. William L. Bryan's first year as President. It was never my
                    privilege to know him as a class-room teacher, but I did become acquainted with him before the end
                    of the year. I think he became interested in me through the good offices of Mr. Cravens and Dr.
                    Wood-burn. As I look back to the year 190–903, I recall that an unusually fine spirit
                    pervaded the campus. I talked with no student who did not believe that the right man had been chosen
                    to the presidency. The prevailing notion among students was that Indiana University was certain to
                    hold a high place among the institutions of the country. Strange to say, there was little or nothing
                    said about buildings or the size of the student body. So far as I know, we generally felt that there
                    were enough buildings and a sufficient number of students. The greatness of the University was to
                    lie in its intrinsic worth. This was before the age of "bally-hoo" when anything
                    to be better must be bigger. There may have been some "go-getters" and
                    "super-salesmen" then, but, if so, most of the students at <pb n="499" id="VAA4025-033-4-117"/> Indiana University were ignorant of their existence in that remote
                    time—about thirty-five years ago.</p>
            <p>One of the things for which President William L. Bryan should always be highly honored is the fact
                    that he could not become a President of the "go-getter" type. The University,
                    under his wise guidance, developed steadily and sanely. In so far as adequate support was not
                    forthcoming, it was because the elements that controlled the state were unable to appreciate his
                    idealism and did not permit Indiana to rise to her real opportunities in the realm of higher
                    education.</p>

            <p>The record of this family has been carried through several generations. The <placeName>

                    Jacob and Salome (Ammen) Harshbarger, married Mary Myers, and was probably the best known member of
                    this large Harshbarger family in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery County</region>
                    </placeName>. He was born in <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1828, and came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ladoga</settlement>
                    </placeName> with his parents when three years old. He was a successful farmer, president of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ladoga</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bank, and, unlike most of his family, was a member of the Christian Church. His father
                    assisted in establishing the Dunkard Church on Cornstalk Creek, later located a short distance north
                    of <placeName>

                    seems quite as prosperous as any other denomination. Many descendants of this Harshbarger family,
                    still members, and one or two of the older women, are said to appear at Sunday services in their
                    Dunkard bonnets.</p>
            <p>The old Harshbarger Cemetery, on Cornstalk Creek, is across the road from one of the old Harshbarger
                    farms, is still used, and fairly well kept. It is hoped that our D.A.R. Chapter will copy the
                    records in this cemetery, for it seems certain that we shall find the graves of many pioneers of
                    this district. Samuel Harshbarger the son of the emigrant, who died in 1849, is buried there.</p>

                  <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>, <region type="county">Lawrence County</region>
               </placeName>, Indiana, on Indian Creek, there is an natural bridge
                    at the Dry Ford where the creek, one hundred feet wide, runs under the bluff four hundred feet high,
                    and forms a natural bridge, eight hundred feet wide and a half mile long.</p>
            <p>As one goes south towards the Dry Ford, he will see on the right a high, almost perpendicular bluff,
                    which is the north face of the Natural Bridge. At the old Dry Ford Crossing, to the left he will see
                    no water (except after a freshet) in the channel. When one crosses, at the right, he will see the
                    approach to the Natural Bridge.</p>
            <p>The Pioneers built a fairly good road over the top of the bridge to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName>-Mayfield settlement on the West side. This, road is not now in use. The south side of
                    the Natural Bridge is not as precipitous as the north side.</p>
            <p>A half mile farther south at the Mayfield Crossing, where the author was born, there is very little
                    water in the creek. This water comes from Big Blue Spring, and when there is high water for a few
                    days, pedestrians have trouble in crossing until the water "runs down" when they
                    can easily cross. At the present time, there are three bridge across Indian Creek within a distance
                    of three quarters of a mile—one at the old bridge, one at the Dry Ford, and one at the
                    Mayfield Crossing.</p>

            <p>The compilation of a Roster of the Revolutionary Soldiers who are buried in Indiana, has been a state
                    project of the Indiana Daughters of the American Revolution since November, 1934. The publication of
                    such a Roster will be 2 tribute to the pioneers of this state and at the same time it will be of
                    material assistance to the many persons endeavoring to trace ancestry.</p>
            <p>Other patriots as well as soldiers are included in the Roster for there were many men and women who
                    gave service to their county in other ways than on the "firing line", and these
                    persons are being listed along with the soldiers. The data required on each are: date and place of
                    birth and death; service record with proof; location of grave and how marked; name of wife (or
                    wives) and children. Family tradition is not regarded as sufficient proof for service. Blanks have
                    been printed and may be had upon request by notifying the chairman.</p>
            <p>D.A.R. Chapters have been asked and are expected to do the necessary research for the soldiers in the
                    counties in which the chapters are located, but assistance is sought from others having information.
                    Members of the Indiana Historical Society, Indiana Pioneers, and Indiana S.A.R. have given
                    invaluable assistance, as have also Miss Anna Poucher and her corps of workers of the Genealogy
                    Section of the State Library.</p>
            <p>Every available source of information is being sought in order that complete records of the soldiers
                    and patriots may be published. Early wills and deed records, Probate Court Records, early marriage
                    records, newspapers and county histories are all being read. Pension records of all the pensioners
                    listed for Indiana are being secured from the Bureau in <placeName>
