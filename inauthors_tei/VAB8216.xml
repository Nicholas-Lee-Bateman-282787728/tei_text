				<head rend="center b">PREFACE</head>

				<p>This volume is the second part of an outline history of Europe from the earliest times to
					our own day. The general survey, the first portion of which will appear shortly, is
					prepared in the belief that the regular historical course in the high schools may be
					wisely reduced from four to three years in order that more attention may be given to
					economics, civics, and kindred subjects.</p>

				<p>The present volume is, in the main, a condensation and revision of the authors' larger
					work, <hi rend="i">The Development of Modern Europe,</hi> which has been brought down to
					date by a review of the last decade of European politics.</p>

				<p>The purpose of the manual is to narrate the history of the past in such a fashion as to
					help make plain the events and problems of our world. As stated in the preface to the
					older work, it has been the authors' ever-conscious aim to enable the reader to catch up
					with his own times; to read intelligently the morning paper; to know about the workings of
					the English cabinet even if he has forgotten about the composition of the Model
					Parliament.</p>

				<p>Fortunately the tendency to emphasize modern history has now so far advanced that it is
					not necessary to explain why we have devoted nearly one half the space at our disposal to
					the momentous eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries.</p>

				<p>We are indebted to Professor C. H. Hayes for reading a portion of the proofs dealing with
					the most recent events.</p>

						<head rend="center b">THE OLD RÃ‰GIME IN EUROPE</head>

						<p>This volume deals with the last two hundred years of European history. Compared with
							the long period of more than five thousand years which lies between Menes I-- the
							first ruler whose name we know-- and Louis XIV of France, this seems a very short
							time. In many ways, however, it has seen far more astonishing changes than those which
							took place in all the preceding centuries.</p>

						<p>Could Louis XIV now see the France he once ruled, how startling the revolution in
							politics and industry would seem to him! The railroads, the steel steamships, the
							great towns with well-lighted, smoothly paved, and carefully drained streets; the
							innumerable newspapers and the beautifully illustrated periodicals, the government
							schools, the popular elections, and his deserted palaces; the vast factories full of
							machinery, working with a precision and rapidity far surpassing those of an army of
							skilled workmen; and most astonishing of all, the mysterious and manifold applications
							of electricity which he knew only in the form of lightning playing among the storm
							clouds,-- all these marvels would combine to convince him that he died on the eve of
							the greatest revolution in industry, government, and science that the world has ever
							seen. It is the purpose of this volume, after describing the conditions in Europe
							before the French Revolution, to show as clearly as possible the changes which have
							made the world what we find it to-day.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">I.</hi> If a peasant who had lived on a manor in the time of the
							Crusades had been permitted to return to earth and travel about Europe at the opening
							of the eighteenth century, he would have found much to remind him of the conditions
							under which, seven centuries earlier, he had extracted a scanty living from the soil.
							It is true that the gradual extinction of serfdom in western Europe appears to have
							begun as early as the twelfth century, but it proceeded at very different rates in
							different countries. In France the old type of serf had largely disappeared by the
							fourteenth century, and in England a hundred years later. In Prussia, Austria, Poland,
							Russia, Italy, and Spain, on the contrary, the great mass of the country people were
							still bound to the soil in the eighteenth century.</p>

						<note rend="right">Survivals of manorial system in France in the eighteenth
							century</note>

						<p>Even in France there were still many aggravating traces of the old system.<ref
								id="ref_001" rend="super" target="note_001">1</ref> The peasant was, it is true, no
							longer bound to a particular manor; he could buy or sell his land at will, could marry
							without consulting the lord, and could go and come as he pleased. Many bought their
							land outright, while others disposed of their holdings and settled in town. But the
							lord might still require all those on his manor to grind their grain at his mill, bake
							their bread in his oven, and press their grapes in his wine press. The peasant might
							have to pay a toll to cross a bridge or ferry which was under the lord's control, or a
							certain sum for driving his flock past the lord's mansion. Many of the old
							arrangements still forced the peasant occupying a particular plot of land to turn over
							to the lord a certain portion of his crops, and, if he sold his land, to pay the lord
							a part of the money he received for it.</p>

						<note rend="right">Survivals in England of the manorial system</note>

						<p>In England in the eighteenth century the prominent features of serfdom had
							disappeared more completely than in France. The services in labor due to the lord had
							long been commuted into money payments, and the peasant was thus transformed into a
							renter or owner of his holding. He still took off his hat <note id="note_001"><hi
									rend="center"><ref target="ref_001" rend="super">1</ref> For a list of feudal
									dues, see <hi rend="i">Readings,</hi> Vol. I, p. 139.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-013" n="3"/> to the squire of his village, and was liable to be
							severely punished by his lord, who was commonly a justice of the peace, if he was
							caught shooting a hare on the game preserves.</p>

						<note rend="right">Condition of the serfs in a great part of Europe in the eighteenth
							century</note>

						<p>In central, southern, and eastern Europe the medieval system still prevailed; the
							peasant lived and died upon the same manor, and worked for his lord in the same way
							that his ancestors had worked a thousand years before. Everywhere the same crude
							agricultural instruments were still used, and most of the implements and tools were
							roughly made in the village itself. The wooden plows commonly found even on English
							farms were constructed on the model of the old Roman plow; wheat was cut with a
							sickle, grass with an unwieldy scythe, and the rickety cart wheels were supplied only
							with wooden rims.</p>

						<note rend="right">Wretched houses of the peasants</note>

						<p>The houses occupied by the country people differed greatly from Sicily to Pomerania,
							and from Ireland to Poland; but, in general, they were small, with little light or
							ventilation, and often they were nothing but wretched hovels with dirt floors and
							neglected thatch roofs. The pigs and the cows were frequently better housed than the
							people, with whom they associated upon very familiar terms, since the barn and the
							house were commonly in the same building. The drinking water was bad, and there was no
							attempt to secure proper drainage. Fortunately every one was out of doors a great deal
							of the time, for the women as well as the men usually worked in the fields,
							cultivating the soil and helping to gather in the crops.</p>

						<note rend="right">Unattractive character of country life</note>

						<p>Country life in the eighteenth century was obviously very arduous and unattractive
							for the most part. The peasant had no newspapers to tell him of the world outside his
							manor, nor could he have read them if he had them. Even in England not one farmer in
							five thousand, it is said, could read at all; and in France the local tax collectors
							were too uneducated to make out their own reports. Farther east conditions must have
							been still more cheerless, for a Hungarian peasant complains that he owed four days of
							his labor to his lord, spent the fifth and sixth hunting and fishing for him, while
							the seventh belonged to God.</p>

						<note rend="right">Towns still medieval in the eighteenth century</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">2.</hi> Even in the towns there was much to remind one of the Middle
							Ages. The narrow, crooked streets, darkened by the over-hanging buildings and scarcely
							lighted at all by night, the rough cobblestones, the disgusting odors even in the best
							quarters,-- all offered a marked contrast to the European cities of to-day, which have
							grown tremendously in the last hundred years in size, beauty, and comfort.</p>

						<note rend="right">London</note>

						<p>In 1760 London had half a million inhabitants, or about a tenth of its present
							population. There were of course no street cars or omnibuses, to say nothing of the
							thousands of automobiles which now thread their way in and out through the press of
							traffic. A few hundred hackney coaches and sedan chairs served to carry those who had
							not private conveyances and could not, or would not, walk. The ill-lighted streets
							were guarded at night by watchmen who went about with lanterns, but afforded so little
							protection against the roughs and robbers that gentlemen were compelled to carry arms
							when passing through the streets after nightfall.</p>

						<note rend="right">Paris</note>

						<p>Paris was somewhat larger than London and had outgrown its medieval walls.<ref
								id="ref_002" rend="super" target="note_002">1</ref> The police were more efficient
							there, and the highway robberies which disgraced London and its suburbs were almost
							unknown. The great park, the "Elysian fields," and many boulevards which now form so
							distinguished a feature of Paris were already laid out; but, in general, the streets
							were still narrow, and there were none of the fine broad avenues which now radiate
							from a hundred centers. There were few sewers to carry off the water which, when it
							rained, flowed through the middle of the streets. The filth and the bad smells of
							former times still remained, and the people relied upon easily polluted wells or the
							dirty River Seine for their water supply.</p>

						<note rend="right">German towns</note>

						<p>In Germany very few of the towns had spread beyond their medieval walls. They had,
							for the most part, lost their former <note id="note_002"><hi rend="center"><ref

							of the merchants and of the once flourishing guilds. Berlin had a population of about
							two hundred thousand, and Vienna was slightly larger. The latter city, now one of the
							most beautiful in the world, then employed from thirty to a hundred street cleaners
							and boasted that the street lamps were lighted every night, while many towns contented
							themselves with dirty streets and with light during the winter months, and then only
							when the moon was not scheduled to shine.</p>

						<note rend="right">Italian cities</note>

						<p>Even the famous cities of Italy,-- Milan, Genoa, Florence, Rome,-- notwithstanding
							their beautiful palaces and public buildings, were, with the exception of water-bound
							Venice, crowded into the narrow compass of the town wall, and their streets were
							narrow and crooked.</p>

						<note rend="right">Trade and industry conducted on a small scale</note>

						<p>Another contrast between the towns of the eighteenth century and those of to-day lay
							in the absence of the great wholesale warehouses, the vast factories with their tall
							chimneys, and the attractive department stores which may now be found in every city
							from Dublin to Budapest. Commerce and industry were in general conducted upon a very
							small scale, except at the great ports like London, Antwerp, or Amsterdam, where goods
							coming from and going to the colonies were brought together.</p>


						<p>The growth of industry under the influence of the various machines which were being
							invented during the latter part of the eighteenth century will form the subject of a
							later chapter. It is clear, however, that before the introduction of railroads,
							steamships, and machine-equipped factories, all business operations must have been
							carried on in what would seem to us a slow and primitive fashion.</p>

						<note rend="right">The trades organized into guilds</note>

						<p>A great part of the manufacturing still took place in little shops where the articles
							when completed were offered for sale. Generally all those who owned the several shops
							carrying on a particular trade, such as tailoring, shoemaking, baking, tanning,
							bookbinding, hair cutting, or the making of candles, knives, <pb id="VAB8216-018"
								n="6"/> hats, artificial flowers, swords, or wigs, were organized into a guild-- a
							union-- the main object of which was to prevent all other citizens from making or
							selling the articles in which the members of the guild dealt. The number of master
							workmen who might open a shop of their own was often limited by the guild, as well as
							the number of apprentices each master could train. The period of apprenticeship was
							long, sometimes seven or even nine years, on the ground that it took years to learn
							the trade properly, but really because the guild wished to maintain its monopoly by
							keeping down the number who could become masters. When the apprenticeship was over,
							the workman became a "journeyman" and might never perhaps become a master workman and
							open a shop of his own.</p>

						<note rend="right">Guilds in England</note>

						<p>This guild system had originated in the Middle Ages and was consequently hundreds of
							years old. In England the term of seven years was required for apprenticeship in all
							the staple trades, although the rule was by no means universally enforced. In
							Sheffield no master cutler could have more than one apprentice at a time; the master
							weavers of Norfolk and Norwich were limited to two apprentices each, and no master
							hatter in England could have more than two.<ref id="ref_003" rend="super"
								target="note_003">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Guilds in France and Germany</note>

						<p>In France the guilds were more powerful than in England, since they had been
							supported and encouraged by Colbert, who believed that they kept up the standard of
							French products. In Germany the organization was much stricter and more widespread
							than either in England or in France. Old regulations concerning apprenticeship and the
							conduct of the various trades were still enforced. As a general rule, no master could
							have more than one apprentice, manage more than one workshop, or sell goods that he
							had not himself produced.</p>

						<note rend="right">Strife among the guilds</note>

						<p>Everywhere a workman had to stick to his trade; if a cobbler should venture to make a
							pair of new boots, or a baker should roast a piece of meat in his oven, he might be
							expelled <note id="note_003"><ref target="ref_003" rend="super">1</ref> Adam Smith's
								account of the guilds of his day is printed in the <hi rend="i">Readings,</hi> Vol.
								I, p. 142.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-019" n="7"/> from the guild unless he made amends. In Paris a hatter,
							who had greatly increased his trade by making hats of wool mixed with silk, had his
							stock destroyed by the guild authorities on the ground that the rules permitted hats
							to be made only of wool and said nothing of silk. The trimming makers had an edict
							passed forbidding any one to make buttons that were cast or turned or made of
							horn.</p>

						<p>The guilds not only protected themselves against workmen who opened shops without
							their permission, but each particular trade was in more or less constant disagreement
							with the other trades as to what each might make. The goldsmiths were the natural
							enemies of all who used gold in their respective operations, such as the clock and
							watch makers, the money changers, and those who set precious stones. Those who dealt
							in natural flowers were not allowed to encroach upon those who made artificial ones.
							One who baked bread must not make pies or cakes. The tailor who mended clothes must
							not permit himself to make new garments.</p>

						<note rend="right">Three important differences between the guilds and the modern trade
							unions</note>

						<p>The guilds differed from the modern trade unions in several important respects. In
							the first place, it was only the master workmen, who owned the shops, tools, or
							machines, who belonged to them. The apprentices and journeymen, that is, the ordinary
							workmen, were excluded and had no influence whatever upon the policy of the
							organization. In the second place, the government enforced the decisions of the
							guilds. For example, in Paris, if it was learned that a journeyman goldbeater was
							working for himself, a representative of the guild betook himself to the offender's
							house, accompanied by a town officer, and seized his tools and materials, after which
							the unfortunate man might be sent to the galleys for three years or perhaps get off
							with a heavy fine, imprisonment, and the loss of every chance of ever becoming a
							master. Lastly, the guilds were confined to the old-established industries which were
							still carried on, as they had been during the Middle Ages, on a small scale in the
							master's house.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-020" n="8"/>

						<note rend="right">Decline of the guilds</note>

						<p>In spite, however, of the seeming strength of the guilds, they were really giving way
							before the entirely new conditions which had arisen. Thoughtful persons disapproved of
							them on the ground that they hampered industry and prevented progress by their outworn
							restrictions. In many towns the regulations were evaded or had broken down altogether,
							so that enterprising workmen and dealers carried on their business as they pleased.
							Then, as we have said, it was only the old industries that were included in the guild
							system. The newer manufactures, of silk and cotton goods, porcelain, fine glassware,
							etc., which had been introduced into Europe, were under the control of individuals or
							companies who were independent of the old guilds and relied upon monopolies and
							privileges granted by the rulers, who, in France at least, were glad to foster new
							industries.</p>

						<p>It is impossible to recount here how the English, French, and Spanish kings gradually
							subjugated the turbulent barons and brought the great fiefs directly under royal
							control. Suffice it to say that the monarchs met with such success that in the
							eighteenth century the nobles no longer held aloof but eagerly sought the king's
							court. Those whose predecessors had once been veritable sovereigns within their own
							domains, had declared war even against the king, coined money, made <pb
								id="VAB8216-021" n="9"/> laws for their subjects, and meted out justice in their
							castle halls, had, by the eighteenth century, deserted their war horses and laid aside
							their long swords; in their velvet coats and high-heeled shoes they were contented
							with the privilege of helping the king to dress in the morning and attending him at
							dinner. The battlemented castle, once the stronghold of independent chieftains, was
							transformed into a tasteful country residence where, if the king honored the owner
							with a visit, the host was no longer tempted, as his ancestors had been, to shower
							arrows and stones upon the royal intruder.</p>

						<note rend="right">The French nobility</note>

						<p>The French noble, unlike the English, was not fond of the country but lived with the
							court at Versailles whenever he could afford to do so, and often when he could not. He
							liked the excitement of the court, and it was there that he could best advance his own
							and his friends' interests by obtaining lucrative offices in the army or Church or in
							the king's palace. By their prolonged absence from their estates the nobles lost the
							esteem of their tenants, while their stewards roused the hatred of the peasants by
							strictly collecting all the ancient manorial dues in order that the lord might enjoy
							the gayeties at Versailles.</p>

						<note rend="right">The French nobility a privileged class</note>

						<p>The unpopularity of the French nobility was further increased by their exemptions
							from some of the heavy taxes, on the ground that they were still supposed to shed
							their blood in fighting for their king instead of paying him money like the
							unsoldierly burghers and peasants. They enjoyed, moreover, the preference when the
							king had desirable positions to grant. They also claimed a certain social superiority,
							since they were excluded by their traditions of birth from engaging in any ordinary
							trade or industry, although they might enter some professions, such as medicine, law,
							the Church, or the army, or even participate in maritime trade without derogating from
							their rank. In short, the French nobility, including some one hundred and thirty
							thousand or one hundred and forty thousand persons, constituted a privileged class,
							although they no <pb id="VAB8216-022" n="10"/> longer performed any of the high
							functions which had been exercised by their predecessors.</p>

						<note rend="right">The ennobled</note>

						<p>To make matters worse, very few of the nobles really belonged to old feudal families.
							For the most part they had been ennobled by the king for some supposed service, or had
							bought an office, or a judgeship in the higher courts, to which noble rank was
							attached. Naturally this circumstance served to rob them of much of the respect that
							their hereditary dignity and titles might otherwise have gained for them.</p>

						<note rend="right">Peculiar position of the English peerage</note>

						<p>In England the feudal castles had disappeared earlier even than in France, and the
							English law did not grant to any one, however long and distinguished his lineage,
							special rights or privileges not enjoyed by every freeman. Nevertheless there was a
							distinct noble class in England.<ref id="ref_004" rend="super" target="note_004"
								>1</ref> The monarch had formerly been accustomed to summon his earls and some of
							his barons to take council with him, and in this way the peerage developed; this
							included those whose title permitted them to sit in the House of Lords and to transmit
							this honorable prerogative to their eldest sons. But the peers paid the same taxes as
							every other subject and were punished in the same manner if they were convicted of an
							offense. Moreover only the eldest surviving son of a noble father inherited his rank,
							while on the Continent all the children became nobles. In this way the number of the
							English nobility was greatly restricted, and their social distinction roused little
							antagonism.</p>

						<note rend="right">The German knights still resembled medieval lords</note>

						<p>In Germany, however, the nobles continued to occupy very much the same position which
							their ancestors held in the Middle Ages. There had been no king to do for all Germany
							what the French kings had done for France; no mighty man had risen strong enough to
							batter down castle walls and bend all barons, great and small, to his will. The result
							was that there were in Germany in the eighteenth century hundreds of nobles dwelling
							in strong old castles and ruling with a high hand domains which were sometimes no
							larger than a <note id="note_004"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_004" rend="super"

							<pb id="VAB8216-023" n="11"/> big American farm. They levied taxes, held courts,
							coined money, and maintained standing armies of perhaps only a handful of
							soldiers.</p>

						<note rend="right">The chief noble was the king</note>
						<note rend="right">His arbitrary powers</note>

						<p>In all the countries of Europe the chief noble was of course the monarch himself, to
							whose favor almost all the lesser nobles owed their titles and rank. He was, except in
							a few cases, always despotic, permitting the people no share in the management of the
							government and often rendering them miserable by needless wars and ill-advised and
							oppressive taxes. He commonly maintained a very expensive court and gave away to
							unworthy courtiers much of the money which he had wrung from his people. He was
							permitted to imprison his subjects upon the slightest grounds and in the most unjust
							manner; nevertheless he usually enjoyed their loyalty and respect, since they were
							generally ready to attribute his bad acts to evil councilors.</p>

						<note rend="right">The services performed by even despotic kings</note>

						<p>On the whole, the king merited the respect paid him. He it was who had destroyed the
							power of innumerable lesser despots and created something like a nation. He had put a
							stop to the private warfare and feudal brigandage which had disgraced the Middle Ages.
							His officers maintained order throughout the country so that merchants and travelers
							could go to and fro with little danger. He opened highroads for them and established a
							general system of coinage, which greatly facilitated business operations. He
							interested himself more and more in commerce and industry and often encouraged
							learning. Finally, by consolidating his realms and establishing a regular system of
							government, he prepared the way for the European State of to-day in which the people
							are either accorded an effective control over lawmaking and the disposition of the
							public revenue, or, as in the case of France, the monarch has been discarded
							altogether as no longer needful. Democracy and political equality would, in fact, have
							been impossible if monarchs had not leveled down the proud and mighty nobles who
							aspired to be petty kings in their domains.</p>

						<note rend="right">Importance of the mediÃ¦val Church in modern problems</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">4.</hi> The eighteenth century had inherited from the Middle Ages not
							only the nobility but the clergy, who, especially in explaining Catholic countries,
							were set off from the nation at large by their peculiar privileges. They were far more
							powerful and better organized than the nobility and exercised a potent influence in
							the State. The clergy owed their authority to the Church, which for many centuries had
							been the great central institution of Europe. The medieval Church serves to explain
							more of the problems' which have faced reformers in modern times than even the feudal
							and manorial systems.</p>

						<p>It must be remembered that every one in the Middle Ages had been required to belong
							to the Church, somewhat in the same way that we to-day all belong as a matter of
							course to the State. Before the Protestant Revolt all the states of western Europe had
							formed a single religious association from which it was a crime to revolt. To refuse
							allegiance to the Church or to question its authority or teachings was reputed treason
							against God, the most terrible of all crimes.</p>

						<p>The Church did not rely for its support, as churches must to-day, upon the voluntary
							contributions of its members, but enjoyed the revenue from vast domains which kings,
							nobles, and other landholders had from time to time given to the churches and
							monasteries. In addition to the income from its lands, the Church had the right, like
							the State, to impose a regular tax which was called the tithe. All who were subject to
							this were forced to pay it, whether they cared anything about religion or not, just as
							we are all compelled to pay taxes imposed by the government under which we live.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Church a monarchy with the Pope at its head</note>

						<p>Like the State, the Church had its own law courts in which many cases were decided.
							The Church not only performed the functions of a state, making laws for its members,
							taxing them, and trying and punishing them if they broke its laws; it had also the
							organization of a state. Unlike the Protestant ministers <pb id="VAB8216-025" n="13"/>
							of to-day, all churchmen and all religious associations of mediaeval Europe were under
							one supreme head, the Roman pontiff, who made laws for all and controlled every Church
							officer, bishop, or priest, wherever he might be, whether in Italy, Spain, Germany, or
							Ireland. The Pope's control was facilitated by the circumstance that the Church had
							one official language-- Latin-- in which all communications were written and its
							services everywhere conducted.</p>

						<note rend="right">Great powers still retained by the Catholic Church in the eighteenth
							century</note>

						<p>In spite of the changes which had overtaken the Church since the Middle Ages, it
							still retained its ancient external appearance in the eighteenth century-- its
							gorgeous ceremonial, its wealth, its influence over the lives of men, its intolerance
							of those who ventured to differ. from the conceptions of Christianity which it
							believed to be its duty to impose upon every one. The ecclesiastical courts still
							tried many cases, in spite of the widening jurisdiction of the royal judges. The
							Church could fine and imprison those whom it convicted of blasphemy, contempt of
							religion, or heresy. The clergy managed the schools and saw to it that the children
							were brought up in the orthodox faith. Hospitals and other charitable institutions
							were under their control. They registered all births and deaths, and only the
							marriages which they sanctified were regarded by the State as legal. The monasteries
							still existed in great numbers and owned vast tracts of land. A map of Paris made in
							1789 shows no less than sixty-eight monasteries and seventy-three nunneries within the
							walls. The clergy still forced the laity to pay the tithe, as in the Middle Ages, and
							still enjoyed exemption from the direct taxes.</p>

						<note rend="right">Intolerance of both Catholics and Protestants</note>

						<p>Both the Catholic and the Protestant churches were very intolerant, and in this were
							usually supported by the government, which was ready to punish or persecute those who
							refused to conform to the State religion, whatever it might be, or ventured to speak
							or write against its doctrines. There was none of that freedom which is so general
							now, and which permits a man to worship or not as he pleases, and even to denounce <pb
								id="VAB8216-026" n="14"/> religion in any or all its forms without danger of
							imprisonment, loss of citizenship, or death.</p>

						<note rend="right">Position of the Protestants in France</note>

						<p>In France, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Protestants had lost
							all civil rights. According to a decree of 1724, those who assembled for any form of
							worship other than the Roman Catholic were condemned to lose their property; the men
							were to be sent to the galleys and the women imprisoned for life. The preachers who
							convoked such assemblies or performed Protestant ceremonies were punishable with
							death; but only a few executions took place, for happily the old enthusiasm for
							persecution was abating. None the less, all who did not accept the Catholic teachings
							were practically outlawed, for the priests would neither recognize the marriages nor
							register the births and deaths over which they were not called to preside. This made
							it impossible for Protestants to marry legally and have legitimate children, or to
							inherit or devise property. A royal proclamation in 1712 forbade physicians to visit
							such sick people as refused to call in a Catholic confessor, and the kings still
							pledged themselves in their coronation oaths to extirpate heretics.</p>

						<note rend="right">Censorship of the press</note>

						<p>Books and pamphlets were carefully examined in order to see whether they contained
							any attacks upon the orthodox Catholic beliefs or might in any way serve to undermine
							the authority of the Church or of the king. The Pope had long maintained a commission
							(which still exists) to examine new books, and to publish from time to time a list,
							called the "Index," of all those which the Church condemned and forbade the faithful
							to read. The king of France, as late as 1757, issued a declaration establishing the
							death penalty for those who wrote, printed, or distributed any work which appeared to
							be an attack upon religion. The teachings of the professors in the university were
							watched. A clergyman who ventured to compare the healing of the sick by Christ to the
							cures ascribed to Ã†sculapius was arrested (about 1750) by order of the king's judges
							at Paris and forced to leave the country. A considerable number of <pb
								id="VAB8216-027" n="15"/> the most enlightened books issued in France in the
							eighteenth century were condemned either by the clergy or the king's courts, and were
							burned by the common hangman or suppressed. Not infrequently the authors, if they
							could be discovered, were imprisoned.</p>

						<note rend="right">Censorship ineffective</note>

						<p>This did not check speculation, however, and books attacking the old ideas and
							suggesting reforms in Church and State constantly appeared and were freely
								circulated.<ref id="ref_005" rend="super" target="note_005">1</ref> The writers took
							care not to place their names or those of the publishers upon the title-pages, and
							many such books were printed at Geneva or in Holland, where great freedom
							prevailed.</p>

						<note rend="right">Strength of the Church in Spain, Austria, and Italy</note>

						<p>In Spain, Austria, and Italy, however, and especially in the Papal States, the
							clergy, particularly the Jesuits, were more powerful and enjoyed more privileges than
							in France. In Spain the censorship of the press and the Inquisition constituted a
							double bulwark against change until the latter half of the eighteenth century.</p>

						<note rend="right">Peculiar situation of the great German prelates</note>

						<p>In Germany the position of the Church varied greatly. The southern states were
							Catholic, while Prussia and the northern rulers had embraced Protestantism. Many of
							the archbishops, bishops, and abbots ruled as princes over their own lands and made
							the best arrangements they could with the Pope.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">5.</hi> In England Henry VIII had thrown off his allegiance to the Pope
							and declared himself the head of the English Church. Under his daughter, Queen
							Elizabeth (1558-1603), Parliament had established the Church of England. It abolished
							the mass and sanctioned the Book of Common Prayer, which has since remained the

							<pb id="VAB8216-028" n="16"/> together in the Thirty-Nine Articles, from which no one
							was to vary or depart in the least degree. The system of government of the Roman
							Catholic Church, with its archbishops, bishops, and priests, was retained, but the
							general charge of religious matters and the appointment of bishops were put in the
							hands of the monarch or his ministers. All clergymen were required to subscribe
							solemnly to the Thirty-Nine Articles. All public religious services were to be
							conducted according to the Prayer Book, and those who failed to attend services on
							Sunday and holydays were to be fined.</p>

						<note rend="right">Persecution of the Catholics in England</note>

						<p>Those who persisted in adhering to the Roman Catholic faith fared badly, although
							happily there were no such general massacres as overwhelmed the Protestants in France.
							Under the influence of the Jesuits some of the English Catholics became involved in
							plots against the heretical queen, Elizabeth, who had been deposed by the Pope. These
							alleged "traitors" were in some instances executed for treason. Indeed, any one who
							brought a papal bull to England, who embraced Catholicism, or converted a Protestant
							was declared a traitor. Fines and imprisonment were inflicted upon those who dared to
							say or to hear mass.<ref id="ref_006" rend="super" target="note_006">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">The Puritans</note>

						<p>But there were many Protestants who did not approve of the Anglican Church as
							established by law. These "Dissenters" developed gradually into several sects with
							differing views. By far the most numerous of the Dissenters were the Baptists. They
							spread to America, and were the first Protestant sect to undertake foreign missions on
							a large scale, having founded a society for that purpose as early as 1792.<ref
								id="ref_007" rend="super" target="note_007">2</ref></p>

						<note id="note_006"><ref target="ref_006" rend="super">1</ref> It may be noted here that
							the Catholics found a refuge in America from their Protestant persecutors, as did the
							Huguenots who fled from the oppression of the Catholic government in France. The
							colony of Maryland was founded by Lord Baltimore in 1634 and named after the French
							wife of Charles I. In the nineteenth century the number of Catholics in the United
							States was vastly increased by immigration from Ireland, Italy, and other countries,
							so that there are over thirteen millions to-day who have been baptized into the Roman
							Catholic Church.</note>

						<pb id="VAB8216-029" n="17"/>

						<note rend="right">The Friends, or Quakers</note>

						<p>Another English sect which was destined also to be conspicuous in America was the
							Society of Friends, or Quakers, as they are commonly called. This group owes its
							origin to George Fox, who began his preaching in 1647. The Friends were distinguished
							by their simplicity of life and dress, their abhorrence of war, and their rejection of
							all ceremonial, including even the Lord's Supper. While there were fanatics among them
							whose practices brought discredit upon them both in Old England and New, no adherents
							to the Christian Church have ever shown their religion more consistently or
							beautifully in their lives than the Friends. Their chief stronghold in America has
							always been Pennsylvania, more particularly Philadelphia and its neighborhood, where
							they settled under the leadership of William Penn.</p>

						<note rend="right">John Wesley and the Methodists</note>
						<note rend="right">John Wesley's conversion, 17387</note>

						<p>The last of the great Protestant sects to appear was that of the Methodists. Their
							founder, John Wesley, when at Oxford had established a religious society among his
							fellow-students. Their piety and the regularity of their habits gained for them the
							nickname of "Methodists." After leaving Oxford, Wesley spent some time in the colony
							of Georgia. On his return to England in i738 he came to believe in the sudden and
							complete forgiveness of sins known as " conversion," which he later made the basis of
							his teaching. As he entered a meeting in London in 1738 he found the preacher reading
							Luther's preface to The Epistle to the Romans, and thus relates his own experience:
							"About a quarter before nine, while he [the preacher] was describing the change which
							God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I
							felt I did trust in Christ and in Christ alone for salvation, and an assurance was
							given me that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin
							and death."<ref id="ref_008" rend="super" target="note_008">1</ref></p>

						<p>This memorable evening marked a turning point in the life of Wesley. He soon began a
							series of great revival meetings in London and other large towns. He journeyed up and
							down the land, aided in his preaching by his brother Charles and by the <note
								id="note_008"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_008" rend="super">1</ref> For

							<pb id="VAB8216-030" n="18"/> impassioned Whitefield. Only gradually did the
							Methodists separate themselves from the Church of England, of which they at first
							considered themselves members. In 1784 the numerous American Methodists were formally
							organized into the Methodist Episcopal Church, and early in the nineteenth century the
							English Methodists became an independent organization. At the time of Wesley's death
							his followers numbered over fifty thousand, and there are now in the United States
							over six millions, including the various branches of the Church.</p>

						<note rend="right">Persecution of the Dissenters under Charles II</note>
						<note rend="right">Test Act</note>

						<p>Parliament under Charles II showed itself very intolerant toward all Dissenters
							alike,-- Presbyterians, Independents, Baptists, Quakers, Unitarians. Any clergyman who
							refused to accept everything in the Book of Common Prayer was to lose his benefice,
							and two thousand clergymen resigned for conscience' sake. In 1664 the Conventicle Act
							declared that any one attending any religious meeting not held in accordance with the
							practices of the English Church was liable, for repeated offenses, to be transported
							to some distant colony, and some of the more obstinate Dissenters were actually
							exiled. Finally, by the Test Act, every one was excluded from office who did not take
							the sacrament according to the usages of the Church of England.</p>

						<note rend="right">Legal intolerance in England</note>
						<note rend="right">The privileges of the Anglican clergy</note>

						<p>Upon the accession of William and Mary an Act of Toleration was passed in 1689, which
							permitted Dissenters to hold meetings; but " Papists and such as deny the Trinity "
							were explicitly excluded, so England still continued to maintain an intolerant system
							in the eighteenth century. It had a State Church with a particular form of belief and
							of services which was established by the government in Elizabeth's time. Even if the
							Dissenters were permitted to hold services in their own way, they were excluded from
							government offices unless they violated their own faith, nor could they obtain a
							degree at the universities. Only the members of the Anglican Church could hold a
							benefice. Its bishops had seats in the House of Lords and its priests enjoyed a social
							preeminence denied to the dissenting ministers.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-031" n="19"/>

						<note rend="right">Existence of Catholics not recognized in England</note>

						<p>Those who clung to the Roman Catholic faith, to the Pope and the mass, were forbidden
							to enter England. The celebration of the mass was strictly prohibited. All public
							offices were closed to Catholics and of course they could not sit in Parliament.
							Indeed, legally, they had no right whatever to be in England at all. In the middle of
							the eighteenth century an English court decided that the law did not recognize the
							existence of Roman Catholics within the realm and that their presence was only made
							possible by the lax enforcement of the law.</p>

						<note rend="right">Freedom of the press in England</note>

						<p>The Church courts still existed in England and could punish laymen for not attending
							church, for heresy, and for certain immoral acts. As late as 1812 a young woman was
							imprisoned for two years by a Church court because she failed to perform the penance
							it had imposed and had no money to pay the fees involved in the trial. The
							ecclesiastical tribunals still tried matrimonial cases and those concerned with wills.
							But one who published a book or pamphlet did not have to obtain the permission of the
							government as in France, and nowhere was there such unrestrained discussion of
							scientific and religious matters at this period as in England. As we shall see in the
							following chapter, England, in the early eighteenth century, was the center of
							progressive thought from which the French philosophers and reformers drew their
							inspiration.</p>

						<p>In fact, the old spirit of persecution for mere diversity of opinion had almost
							disappeared in England. Blackstone, writing at the opening of the reign of George III,
							summed up the legal view in the following manner: "Certainly our ancestors were
							mistaken in their plans of compulsion and intolerance. The sin of schism, as such, is
							by no means the object of temporal coercion and punishment. If through weakness of
							intellect, through misdirected piety, through perverseness and acerbity of temper, or
							(which is often the case) through a prospect of secular advantage in herding with a
							party, men quarrel with the ecclesiastical establishment, the civil magistrate has
							nothing to do with it, unless their tenets and practice are such as threaten <pb
								id="VAB8216-032" n="20"/> ruin or disturbance to the State. He is bound indeed to
							protect the Established Church, and if this can be better effected by admitting none
							but its genuine members to offices of trust and emolument, he is certainly at liberty
							to do so, the disposal of offices being matter of favor and discretion. But, this
							point being once secured, all persecution for diversity of opinions, however
							ridiculous or absurd they may be, is contrary to every principle of sound policy and
							civil freedom."</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">6.</hi> A thoughtful observer in the eighteenth century would, as we
							have seen, have discovered many medieval institutions which had persisted in spite of
							the considerable changes which had taken place in conditions and ideas during the
							previous five hundred years. Serfdom, the guilds, the feudal dues, the nobility and
							clergy with their peculiar privileges, the declining monastic orders, the confused and
							cruel laws,-- these were a part of the heritage which Europe had received from what
							was coming to be regarded as a dark and barbarous period. People began to be keenly
							alive to the deficiencies of the past, and to look to the future for better things,
							even to dream of progress beyond the happiest times of which they had any record. They
							came to feel that the chief obstacles to progress were the outworn institutions, the
							ignorance and prejudices of their forefathers, and that if they could only be freed
							from this incubus, they would find it easy to create new and enlightened laws and
							institutions to suit their needs.</p>

						<note rend="right">Veneration for the past: "the good old days"</note>

						<p>This attitude of mind seems natural enough in our progressive age, but two centuries
							ago it was distinctly new. Mankind has in general shown an unreasoning respect and
							veneration for the past. Until the opening of the eighteenth century the former times
							were commonly held to have been better than the present; for the evils of the past
							were little known, while those of the present were, as always, only too apparent. Men
							looked backward rather than forward. They aspired to fight as well, or be as saintly,
							or write as good books, or paint as beautiful <pb id="VAB8216-034" n="22"/> pictures,
							as the great men of old. That they might excel the achievements of their predecessors
							did not occur to them. Knowledge was sought not by studying the world about them but
							in some ancient authority. In Aristotle's vast range of works on various branches of
							science, the Middle Ages felt that they had a mass of authentic information which it
							should be the main business of the universities to explain and impart rather than to
							increase or correct by new investigations. Men's ideals centered in the past, and
							improvement seemed to them to consist in reviving, so far as possible, the "good old
							days."</p>

						<note rend="right">How the scientists have created the spirit of progress and
							reform</note>

						<p>It was mainly to the patient men of science that the western world owed its first
							hopes of future improvement. It is they who have shown that the ancient writers were
							mistaken about many serious matters and that they had at best a very crude and
							imperfect notion of the world. They have gradually robbed men of their old blind
							respect for the past, and by their discoveries have pointed the way to indefinite
							advance, so that now we expect constant change and improvement and are scarcely
							astonished at the most marvelous inventions.</p>

						<p>In the Middle Ages the scholars and learned men had been but little interested in the
							world about them. They devoted far more attention to philosophy and theology than to
							what we should call the natural sciences. They were satisfied in the main to get their
							knowledge of nature from reading the works of the ancients,-- above all, those of
							Aristotle.</p>

						<note rend="right">Three modern scientific methods of discovering truth</note>
						<note rend="right">1. Exact observation of the phenomena themselves</note>
						<note rend="right">2. Experimentation</note>
						<note rend="right">3. Scientific apparatus</note>

						<p>As early as the thirteenth century, however, a very extraordinary Franciscan friar,
							Roger Bacon, showed his insight by protesting against the exaggerated veneration for
							books. Bacon advocated three methods of reaching truth which are now followed by all
							scientific men. In the first place, he proposed that natural objects and changes
							should be examined with great care, in order that the observer might determine exactly
							what happened in any given case. This has led in modern times to incredibly refined
							measurement and analysis. The chemist, for <pb id="VAB8216-035" n="23"/> example, can
							now determine the exact nature and amount of every substance in a cup of impure water,
							which may appear perfectly limpid to the casual observer. Then, secondly, Bacon
							advocated experimentation. He was not contented with mere observation of what actually
							happened, but tried new and artificial combinations and processes. Nowadays
							experimentation is, of course, constantly used by scientific investigators, and by
							means of it they ascertain many things which the most careful observation would never
							reveal. Thirdly, in order to carry on investigation and make careful measurements and
							experiments, apparatus designed for this special purpose was found to be necessary. As
							early as the thirteenth century it was discovered, for example, that a convex crystal
							or bit of glass would magnify objects, although several centuries elapsed before the
							microscope and telescope were devised.</p>

						<note rend="right">Francis Bacon (1561-1626)</note>

						<p>The first scholar to draw up a great scheme of all the known sciences and work out a
							method of research which, if conscientiously followed, promised wonderful discoveries,
							was Francis Bacon, a versatile English statesman and author who wrote in the time of
							James I.<ref id="ref_009" rend="super" target="note_009">1</ref> It seemed to him (as
							it had seemed to his namesake, Roger Bacon, three centuries earlier) that the
							discoveries which had hitherto been made were as nothing compared with what could be
							done if men would but study and experiment with things themselves, abandon their
							confidence in vague words like "moist" and "dry," "matter" and "form," and repudiate
							altogether "the thorny philosophy" of Aristotle which was taught in the universities.
							"No one," he declares, "has yet been found so firm of mind and purpose as resolutely
							to compel himself to sweep away all theories and common notions, and to apply the
							understanding, thus made fair and even, to a fresh examination of details. Thus it
							comes about that human knowledge is as yet a mere medley and ill-digested mass, made
							up of much credulity and much accident, and also of childish notions which we early
							have imbibed."</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-036" n="24"/>

						<note rend="right">Discovery of natural laws</note>

						<p>The observation and experimentation of which we have been speaking were carried on by
							many earnest workers and soon began to influence deeply men's conceptions of the earth
							and of the universe at large. Of the many scientific discoveries, by far the most
							fundamental was the conviction that all things about us follow certain natural and
							immutable laws; and it is the determination of these laws and the seeking out of their
							applications to which the modern scientific investigator devotes his efforts, whether
							he be calculating the distance of a nebula or noting the effect of a drop of acid upon
							a frog's foot. He has given up all hope of reading man's fate in the stars, or of
							producing any results by magical processes. He is convinced that the natural laws have
							been found to work regularly in every instance where they have been carefully
							observed. Unlike the medieval scholars, therefore, he hesitates to accept as true the
							reports which reach him of alleged miracles, that is, of exceptions to the general
							laws in which he has come to have such confidence. Moreover his study of the regular
							processes of nature has enabled him, as Roger Bacon foresaw, to work wonders far more
							marvelous than any attributed to the medieval magician.</p>

						<note rend="right">Opposition to scientific discoveries</note>

						<p>The path of the scientific investigator has not always been without its thorns.
							Mankind has changed its notions with reluctance. The churchmen and the professors in
							the universities were wedded to the conceptions of the world which the medieval
							theologians and philosophers had worked out, mainly from the Bible and Aristotle. They
							clung to the text-books which they and their predecessors had long used in teaching,
							and had no desire to begin a protracted and painful examination of the innumerable
							substances and organisms from a study of which the newer scientists were gathering
							information that refuted the venerated theories of the past.</p>

						<note rend="right">Hostile attitude of the theologians</note>

						<p>The theologians were especially prone to denounce scientific discoveries, on the
							ground that they did not harmonize with the teachings of the Bible as commonly
							accepted. It was naturally a great shock to them, and also to the public at large, to
							have <pb id="VAB8216-037" n="25"/> it suggested that man's dwelling place, instead of
							being God's greatest work, to which he had subordinated everything and around which
							the whole starry firmament revolved, was after all but a tiny speck in comparison with
							the whole universe, and its sun but one of an innumerable host of similar glowing
							bodies of stupendous size, each of which might have its particular family of planets
							revolving about it.</p>

						<note rend="right">Galileo punished for advocating new ideas</note>

						<p>The bolder thinkers were consequently sometimes made to suffer for their ideas, and
							their books prohibited or burned. Galileo was forced to say that he did not really
							believe that earth revolved about the sun; and he was kept in partial confinement for
							a time and ordered to recite certain psalms every day for three years for having
							ventured to question the received views in a book which he wrote in Italian, instead
							of Latin, so that the public at large might read it.<ref id="ref_010" rend="super"

							(except through God's special grace) of good thoughts or deeds, certain <note

								themselves did not always readily accept new discoveries. Francis Bacon, who lived
								some seventy years after Copernicus, still clung to the old idea of the revolution
								of the sun about the earth and still believed in many quite preposterous illusions,
								as, for example, that "it hath been observed by the ancients that where a rainbow
								seemeth to hang over or to touch, there breatheth forth a sweet smell"; and that
								"since the ape is a merry and a bold beast, its heart worn near the heart of a man
								comforteth the heart and increaseth audacity." In the latter half of the eighteenth
								century Lavoisier was burned in effigy in Berlin because his discovery of oxygen
								threatened the accepted explanation of combustion.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-038" n="26"/> thinkers began to urge that man was by nature good; that
							he should freely use his own God-given reason ; that he was capable of becoming
							increasingly wise by a study of nature's laws, and that he could indefinitely better
							his own condition and that of his fellows if he would but free himself from the
							shackles of error and superstition. Those who had broadened their views of mankind and
							of the universe refused longer to believe that God had revealed himself only to the
							Jewish people, but maintained that he must be equally solicitous for all his creatures
							in all ages and in all parts of a boundless universe where everything was controlled
							by his immutable laws. This tendency to "enlarge God" is illustrated in the famous
							"Universal Prayer" of Alexander Pope, written about 1737: <q type="blockquote"
								rend="center">
								<lg>
									<l>Father of all! in ev'ry age, </l>

						<note rend="right">The deists</note>

						<p>Pope was suspected of "infidelity" to the Christian religion and of rejecting the
							Bible as God's revelation to man, although nowadays the most devout Christian could
							read without offense his long poem called "An Essay on Man." But there were in his day
							a considerable number of "freethinkers" in England who attacked the Christian religion
							in no doubtful terms, and whose books were eagerly read and discussed. These "deists"
							maintained that their conception of God was far worthier than that of the Christian
							believer, who, they declared, accused the deity of violating his own laws by miracles
							and of condemning a great part of his children to eternal torment.</p>

						<note rend="right">How Voltaire came to England, 1726</note>

						<p>In the year 1726 there landed in England a young and gifted Frenchman, who was to
							become the great prophet of <pb id="VAB8216-039" n="27"/> deism in all lands.
							Voltaire, who was then thirty-two years old, had already deserted the older religious
							beliefs and was consequently ready to follow enthusiastically the more radical of the
							English thinkers, who discussed matters with an openness which filled him with
							astonishment. He became an ardent admirer of the teachings of Newton, whose stately
							funeral he attended shortly after his arrival. He regarded the discoverer of universal
							gravitation as greater than an Alexander or a Caesar, and did all he could to
							popularize Newton's work in France. "It is to him who masters our minds by the force
							of truth, not to those who enslave men by violence; it is to him who understands the
							universe, not to those who disfigure it, that we owe our reverence."</p>

						<note rend="right">Voltaire charmed by the English freedom of speech</note>

						<p>Voltaire was deeply impressed by the Quakers,-- their simple life and their hatred of
							war. He was delighted with the English philosophers, especially with John Locke<ref
								id="ref_011" rend="super" target="note_011">1</ref> (died in 1704); he thought
							Pope's "An Essay on Man" the finest moral poem ever composed; he admired the English
							liberty of speech and writing; he respected the general esteem for the merchant class.
							In France, he said, "the merchant so constantly hears his business spoken of with
							disdain that he is fool enough to blush for it; yet I am not sure that the merchant
							who enriches his country, gives orders from his countinghouse at Surat or Cairo, and
							contributes to the happiness of the globe is not more useful to a state than the
							thickly bepowdered lord who knows exactly what <note id="note_011"><ref
									target="ref_011" rend="super">1</ref> Locke rejected the notion that man was born
								with certain divinely implanted ideas, and maintained that we owe all that we know
								to the sensations and impressions which come to us from without. Locke was a man of
								extraordinary modesty, good sense, and caution, and he and his gifted successor,
								Bishop Berkeley, did much to found modern psychology by helping to rid the world of
								certain meaningless abstractions and encouraging the careful study of our own mental
								processes to which so much attention is now being given. Berkeley's <hi rend="i">New
									Theory of Vision</hi> is a clear account of the gradual way in which we learn to
								see. He shows that a blind man, if suddenly restored to sight, would make little or
								nothing of the confused colors and shapes which would first strike his eye. He would
								learn only from prolonged experience that one set of colors and contours meant a man
								and another a horse or a table, no matter how readily he might recognize the several
								objects by touch.</note>

						<note rend="right">Voltaire's <hi rend="i">Letter on the English</hi></note>
						<note rend="right">Voltaire's wide influence and popularity</note>

						<p>Voltaire proceeded to enlighten his countrymen by a volume of essays in which he set
							forth his impressions of England; but the high court of justice (the <hi rend="i"
								>parlement</hi>) of Paris condemned these <hi rend="i">Letters on the English</hi>
							to be publicly burned, as scandalous and contrary alike to good manners and to the
							respect due to the principalities and powers. In this way they furnished one more
							illustration of the need of such men as Voltaire, who was to become, during the
							remainder of a long life, the chief advocate throughout Europe of unremitting reliance
							upon reason and of confidence in enlightenment and progress. And since a great part of
							the institutions of his day were not based upon reason but upon mere tradition, and
							were often quite opposed to common sense, "the touch of reason was fatal to the whole
							structure, which instantly began to crumble." His keen eye was continually discovering
							some new absurdity in the existing order, which, with incomparable wit and literary
							skill, he would expose to his eager readers. He was interested in almost everything;
							he wrote histories, dramas, philosophic treatises, romances, epics, and innumerable
							letters to his innumerable admirers. The vast range of his writings enabled him to
							bring his bold questionings to the attention of all sorts and conditions of men,-- not
							only to the general reader, but even to the careless playgoer.<ref id="ref_012"
								rend="super" target="note_012">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Voltaire's attack upon the church</note>

						<p>While Voltaire was successfully inculcating free criticism in general, he led a
							relentless attack upon the most venerable, probably the most powerful, institution in
							Europe, the Roman Catholic Church. The absolute power of the king did not trouble him,
							but the Church, with what appeared to him to be its deep-seated opposition to a free
							exercise of reason and its hostility to reform, seemed fatally to block all human
							progress. He was wont to close his letters with the exhortation, "Crush the infamous
							thing." The Church, as it fully realized, had never encountered <note id="note_012"
									><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_012" rend="super">1</ref> For extracts from
									Voltaire's writings, see <hi rend="i">Readings,</hi> Vol. I, pp. 179
								ff.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-041" n="29"/> a more deadly enemy. Not only was Voltaire supremely
							skillful in his varied methods of attack, but there were thousands of both the
							thoughtful and the thoughtless ready to applaud him; for not only was he always
							brilliant and entertaining in his diatribes, but many of his readers had reached the
							same conclusions, although they might not be able to express their thoughts so
							persuasively as he.<ref id="ref_013" rend="super" target="note_013">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Voltaire maintains that the Church should not encroach upon the
							functions of the State</note>

						<p>Voltaire was not only irritated by what he regarded as the gloomy superstition of the
							Church, its cruel intolerance, and the hateful conflicts over seemingly unimportant
							matters of belief, but he held that it exercised a pernicious control over the
							government. In his famous <hi rend="i">Handy Philosophic Dictionary,</hi> a little
							volume of witty essays on a variety of themes which he published anonymously in 1764,
							he maintains that no law of the Church should have the least force unless expressly
							sanctioned by the government; that all ecclesiastics should be subject to the
							government, should pay taxes like every one else, and should have no power to deprive
							a citizen of the least of his rights on the ground that he is a sinner, "since the
							priest-- himself a sinner-- should pray for other sinners, not judge them." Marriage
							should be entirely under the control of the civil government, and the shameful custom,
							as he calls it, of paying a part of the clergy's revenue to a "foreign priest," namely
							the Pope, should no longer be maintained. But the <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> of Paris
							condemned the book to be burned, on the ground that it defended license and
							incredulity; that it attacked all that was sacred in religious teachings, mysteries,
							and authority; and that the writer gloried in sinking to the level of the brutes and
							dragging others down into his own degradation.</p>

						<note rend="right">Weaknesses of Voltaire</note>

						<p>Were there space at command, a great many good things, as well as plenty of bad ones,
							might be told of this extraordinary <note id="note_013"><ref target="ref_013"
									rend="super">1</ref> Voltaire repudiated the beliefs of the Protestant churches as
								well as of the Roman Church. He was, however, no atheist, as his enemies-- and they
								have been many and bitter -have so often asserted. He believed in God, and at his
								country home, near Geneva, he dedicated a temple to him. Like many of his con-
								temporaries, he was a deist, and held that God had revealed himself in nature and in
								our own hearts, not in Bible or Church.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-042" n="30"/> man. He was often superficial in his judgments, and
							sometimes jumped to unwarranted conclusions. He saw only evil in the Church and seemed
							incapable of understanding all that it had done for mankind during the bygone ages. He
							maliciously attributed to evil motives teachings which were accepted by the best and
							loftiest of men. He bitterly ridiculed even the holiest and purest aspirations, along
							with the alleged deceptions of the Jesuits and the quarrels of the theologians.</p>

						<note rend="right">Real greatness of Voltaire</note>

						<p>He could, and did, however, fight bravely against wrong and oppression. The abuses
							which he attacked were in large part abolished by the Revolution. It is unfair to
							notice only Voltaire's mistakes and exaggerations, as many writers, both Catholic and
							Protestant, have done; for he certainly did more than any one else to prepare the way
							for the great and permanent reform of the Church, as a political and social
							institution, in 1789-1790. "When the right sense of historical proportion is more
							fully developed in men's minds," John Morley writes, "the name of Voltaire will stand
							out like the names of the great decisive movements in the European advance, like the
							Revival of Learning or the Reformation. The existence, character, and career of this
							extraordinary person constituted in themselves a new and prodigious era."</p>

						<note rend="right">Diderot's <hi rend="i">EncyclopÃ¦dia</hi></note>

						<p>Voltaire had many admirers and powerful allies. Among these none were more important
							than Denis Diderot and the scholars whom Diderot induced to cooperate with him in
							preparing articles for a new <hi rend="i">EncyclopÃ¦dia,</hi> which was designed to
							spread among a wide range of intelligent readers a knowledge of scientific advance and
							rouse enthusiasm for reform and progress.<ref id="ref_014" rend="super"
								target="note_014">1</ref> An encyclopÃ¦dia was by no means a new thing. Diderot's
							plan had been suggested by a proposal to publish a French translation of Chambers's
								<hi rend="i">CyclopÃ¦dia.</hi> Before his first volume appeared, a vast <hi rend="i"
								>Universal Dictionary</hi>
							<note id="note_014"><ref target="ref_014" rend="super">1</ref> See <hi rend="i"
									>Readings,</hi> Vol. I, p. 185, for an extract from Diderot's preface to the last
								installment of the <hi rend="i">EncyclopÃ¦dia.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-043" n="31"/> had been completed in Germany in sixty-four volumes. But
							few people outside of that country could read German in those days, whereas the
							well-written and popular articles of Diderot and his helpers, ranging from "abacus,"
							"abbey," and "abdication" to "Zoroaster," "Zurich," and "zimology," were in a language
							that many people all over Europe could understand.</p>

						<note rend="right">The <hi rend="i">EncyclopÃ¦dia</hi> rouses the hostility of the
							theologians</note>

						<p>Diderot and his fellow-editors endeavored to rouse as little opposition as possible.
							They respected current prejudices and gave space to ideas and opinions with which they
							were not personally in sympathy. They furnished material, however, for refuting what
							they believed to be mistaken notions, and Diderot declared that "time will enable
							people to distinguish what we have thought from what we have said." But no sooner did
							the first two volumes appear in 1752 than the king's ministers, to please the Church,
							suppressed them, as containing principles hostile to royal authority and religion,
							although they did not forbid the continuation of the work. The attitude of the clergy
							led Diderot to exclaim angrily: "I know nothing so indecent as these vague
							declamations of the theologians against reason. To hear them, one would suppose that
							men could only enter into the bosom of Christianity as a herd of cattle enters a
							stable; and that we must renounce our common sense if we are either to embrace our
							religion or to remain in it."</p>

						<note rend="right">Diderot nevertheless completes the <hi rend="i"
							>EncyclopÃ¦dia</hi></note>

						<p>As volume after volume appeared, the subscribers increased; but so did the
							opposition. The EncyclopÃ¦dists were declared to be a band bent upon the destruction of
							religion and the undermining of society; the government again interfered, withdrew the
							license to publish the work, and prohibited the sale of the seven volumes that were
							already out. Nevertheless seven years later Diderot was able to deliver the remaining
							ten volumes to the subscribers in spite of the government's prohibition.</p>

						<note rend="right">Value of the <hi rend="i">EncyclopÃ¦dia</hi></note>

						<p>The <hi rend="i">EncyclopcÃ¦dia</hi> attacked temperately, but effectively, religious
							intolerance, the bad taxes, the slave trade, and the atrocities of the criminal law;
							it encouraged men to turn their <pb id="VAB8216-044" n="32"/> minds to natural science
							with all its beneficent possibilities, and this helped to discourage the old interest
							in theology and barren metaphysics. The article, "Legislator," written by Diderot,
							says: "All the men of all lands have become necessary to one another for the exchange
							of the fruits of industry and the products of the soil. Commerce is a new bond among
							men. In these days every nation has an interest in the preservation by every other
							nation of its wealth, its industry, its banks, its luxury, its agriculture. The ruin
							of Leipzig, of Lisbon, of Lima, has led to bankruptcies on all the exchanges of Europe
							and has affected the fortunes of many millions of persons." The English statesman,
							John Morley, is doubtless right when he says, in his enthusiastic account of Diderot
							and his companions, that "it was this band of writers, organized by a harassed man of
							letters, and not the nobles swarming around Louis XV, nor the churchmen singing
							masses, who first grasped the great principle of modern society, the honour that is
							owed to productive industry. They were vehement for the glories of peace and
							passionate against the brazen glories of war."</p>

						<note rend="right">Montesquieu (1689-1755) and his <hi rend="i"> Spirit of
							Laws</hi></note>

						<p>Neither Voltaire nor Diderot had attacked the kings and their despotic system of
							government. Montesquieu, however, while expressing great loyalty to French
							institutions, opened the eyes of his fellow-citizens to the disadvantages and abuses
							of their government by his enthusiastic eulogy of the limited monarchy of England. In
							his celebrated work, <hi rend="i">The Spirit of Laws, or the Relation which Laws
								should bear to the Constitution of Each Country, its Customs, Climate, Religion,
								Commerce, etc.,</hi> he proves from history that governments are not arbitrary
							arrangements, but that they are the natural products of special conditions and should
							meet the needs of a particular people at a particular period. England, he thought, had
							developed an especially happy system.</p>

						<note rend="right">Rousseau (1712-1778) attacks civilization</note>

						<p>Next to Voltaire, the writer who did most to cultivate discontent with existing
							conditions was Jean Jacques Rousseau<ref id="ref_015" rend="super" target="note_015"
								>1</ref>
							<note id="note_015"><ref target="ref_015" rend="super">1</ref> Extracts from his

								ff.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-045" n="33"/> (1712-1778). Unlike Voltaire and Diderot, Rousseau
							believed that people thought too much, not too little; that we should trust to our
							hearts rather than to our heads, and may safely rely upon our natural feelings and
							sentiments to guide us. He declared that Europe was overcivilized, and summoned men to
							return to nature and simplicity. His first work was a prize essay written in 1750, in
							which he sought to prove that the development of the arts and sciences had demoralized
							mankind, inasmuch as they had produced luxury, insincerity, and arrogance. He extolled
							the rude vigor of Sparta and denounced the refined and degenerate life of the
							Athenians.</p>

						<note rend="right">Rousseau's <hi rend="i">Ã‰mile</hi> deals with education</note>

						<p>Later Rousseau wrote a book on education, called <hi rend="i">Ã‰mile,</hi> which is
							still famous. In this he protests against the efforts made by teachers to improve upon
							nature, for, he maintains, "All things are good as their Author made them, but
							everything degenerates in the hands of man. <milestone unit="typography" n=". . ."/>
							To form this rare creature, man, what have we to do ? Much doubtless, but chiefly to
							prevent anything from being done. <milestone unit="typography" n=". . ."/> All our
							wisdom consists in servile prejudices; all our customs are but anxiety and restraint.
							Civilized man is born, lives, dies in a state of slavery. At his birth he is sewed in
							swaddling clothes; at his death he is nailed in a coffin; as long as he preserves the
							human form he is fettered by our institutions."</p>

						<note rend="right i">The Social Contract</note>
						<note rend="right">Popular sovereignty</note>

						<p>Rousseau's plea for the simple life went to the heart of many a person who was weary
							of complications and artificiality. Others were attracted by his firm belief in the
							natural equality of mankind and the right of every man to have a voice in the
							government. In his celebrated little treatise, <hi rend="i">The Social Contract,</hi>
							he takes up the question, By what right does one man rule over others? The book opens
							with the words: "Man is born free and yet is now everywhere in chains. One man
							believes himself the master of others and yet is after all more of a slave than they.
							How did this change come about? I do not know. What can render it legitimate? I
							believe that I can answer that question." It is, Rousseau declares, the will of the
							people that <pb id="VAB8216-046" n="34"/> renders government legitimate. The real
							sovereign is the people. Although they may appoint a single person, such as a king, to
							manage the government for them, they should make the laws, since it is they who must
							obey them. We shall find that the first French constitution accepted Rousseau's

						<note rend="right">Unfairness of criminal trials</note>
						<note rend="right">Cruelty of the punishments</note>

						<p>Among all the books advocating urgent reforms which appeared in the eighteenth
							century none accomplished more than a little volume by the Italian economist and
							jurist, Beccaria, which exposed with great clearness and vigor the atrocities of the
							criminal law. The trials (even in England) were scandalously unfair and the
							punishments incredibly cruel. The accused was not ordinarily allowed any counsel and
							was required to give evidence against himself. Indeed, it was common enough to use
							torture to force a confession from him. Witnesses were examined secretly and
							separately and their evidence recorded before they faced the accused. Informers were
							rewarded, and the flimsiest evidence was considered sufficient in the case of
							atrocious crimes. After a criminal had been convicted he might be tortured by the
							rack, thumbscrews, applying fire to different parts of his body, or in other ways, to
							induce him to reveal the names of his accomplices. The death penalty was established
							for a great variety of offenses besides murder,-- for example, heresy, counterfeiting,
							highway robbery, even sacrilege. In England there were, according to the great jurist
							Blackstone, a hundred and sixty offenses punishable with death, including cutting down
							trees in an orchard, and stealing a sum over five shillings in a shop, or more than
							twelve pence from a person's pocket. Yet in spite of the long list of capital
							offenses, the trials in England were far more reasonable than on the Continent, for
							they were public and conducted before a jury, and torture was not used.</p>

						<note rend="right">Beccaria advocates public trials and milder but certain
							punishments</note>

						<p>Beccaria advocated public trials in which the accused should be confronted by those
							who gave evidence against him. Secret accusations should no longer be considered. Like
							Voltaire, <pb id="VAB8216-047" n="35"/> Montesquieu, and many others, he denounced the
							practice of torturing a suspected person with a view of compelling him by bodily
							anguish to confess himself guilty of crimes of which he might be quite innocent. As
							for punishments, he advocated the entire abolition of the death penalty, on the ground
							that it did not deter the evil doer as life imprisonment at hard labor would, and that
							in its various hideous forms-- beheading, hanging, mutilation, breaking on the wheel--
							it was a source of demoralization to the spectators. Punishments should be less harsh
							but more certain and more carefully proportioned to the danger of the offense to
							society. Nobles and magistrates convicted of crime should be treated exactly like
							offenders of the lowest class. Confiscation of property should be abolished, since it
							brought suffering to the innocent members of the criminal's family. It was better, he
							urged, to prevent crimes than to punish them, and this could be done by making the
							laws very clear and the punishments for their violation very certain, but, above all,
							by spreading enlightenment through better education.</p>

						<note rend="right">The science of political economy develops in the eighteenth
							century</note>

						<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century a new social science was born, namely,
							political economy. Scholars began to investigate the sources of a nation's wealth, the
							manner in which commodities were produced and distributed, the laws determining demand
							and supply, the function of money and credit, and their influence upon industry and
							commerce. Previous to the eighteenth century these matters had seemed unworthy of
							scientific discussion. Few suspected that there were any great laws underlying the
							varying amount of wheat that could be bought for a shilling, or the rate of interest
							that a bank could charge. The ancient philosophers of Greece and Rome had despised the
							tiller of the soil, the shopkeeper, and the artisan, for these indispensable members
							of society at that period were commonly slaves. The contempt for manual labor had
							decreased in the Middle Ages, but the learned men who studied theology, or pondered
							over Aristotle's teachings in regard to "form" and "essence," never thought of
							considering the effect <pb id="VAB8216-048" n="36"/> of the growth of population upon
							serfdom, or of an export duty upon commerce, any more than they tried to determine why
							the housewife's milk soured more readily in warm weather than in cold, or why a field
							left fallow regained its fertility.<ref id="ref_016" rend="super" target="note_016"
								>1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Tendency ofthe governments to regulate commerce and industry</note>

						<p>Although ignorant of economic laws, the governments had come gradually to regulate
							more and more both commerce and industry. We have seen how each country tried to keep
							all the trade for its own merchants by issuing elaborate regulations and restrictions,
							and how the king's officers enforced the monopoly of the guilds. Indeed, the French
							government, under Colbert's influence, fell into the habit of regulating well-nigh
							everything. In order that the goods which were produced in France might find a ready
							sale abroad, the government fixed the quality and width of the cloth which might be
							manufactured and the character of the dyes which should be used. The king's ministers
							kept a constant eye upon the dealers in grain and bread-stuffs, forbidding the storing
							up of these products or their sale outside a market. In this way they had hoped to
							prevent speculators from accumulating grain in order to sell it at a high rate in
							times of scarcity.</p>

						<note rend="right">Doctrines of the "mercantilists"</note>

						<p>In short, at the opening of the eighteenth century statesmen, merchants, and such
							scholars as gave any attention to the subject believed that the wealth of a country
							could be greatly increased by government regulation and encouragement, just as in the
							United States to-day it is held by the majority of citizens that the government can
							increase prosperity and improve the conditions of the wage-earners by imposing high
							duties upon imported articles. It was also commonly believed that a country, to be
							really prosperous, must export more than it imported, so that foreign nations would
							each year owe it a cash balance, which would have to be paid in gold or silver and in
							this way <note id="note_016"><ref target="ref_016" rend="super">1</ref> The medieval
								philosophers and theologians discussed, it is true, the question whether it was
								right or not to charge interest for money loaned, and what might be a "just price."
								But both matters were considered as ethical or theological problems rather than in
								their economic aspects. See Ashley, <hi rend="i">English Economic History,</hi> Vol.

							advocated using the powers of government to encourage and protect shipping, to develop
							colonies, and to regulate manufactures are known as "mercantilists."</p>

						<note rend="right">Origin of the "free-trade" school of economists</note>

						<p>About the year 1700, however, certain writers in France and England reached the
							conclusion that the government did no good by interfering with natural economic laws
							which it did not understand and whose workings it did not reckon with. They argued
							that the government restrictions often produced the worst possible results; that
							industry would advance far more rapidly if manufacturers were free to adopt new
							inventions instead of being confined by the government's restrictions to old and
							discredited methods; that, in France, the government's frantic efforts to prevent
							famines by making all sorts of rules in regard to selling grain only increased the
							distress, since even the most powerful king could not violate with impunity an
							economic law. So the new economists rejected the formerly popular mercantile policy.
							They accused the mercantilists of identifying gold and silver with wealth, and
							maintained that a country might be prosperous without a favorable cash balance. In
							short, the new school advocated "free trade." A French economist urged his king to
							adopt the motto, <hi rend="i">Laissez faire</hi> (Let things alone), if he would see
							his realms prosper.</p>

						<note rend="right">Doctrines of Turgot</note>

						<p>The leading economist of France in the eighteenth century was Turgot, who, as head of
							the government for a brief period, made, as we shall see, an unsuccessful effort to
							remedy the existing abuses.<ref id="ref_017" rend="super" target="note_017">1</ref> He
							argued that it would be quite sufficient if "the government should always protect the
							natural liberty of the buyer to buy and of the seller to sell. For the buyer being
							always the master to buy or not to buy, it is certain that he will select among the
							sellers the man who will give him at the best bargain the goods that suit him best. It
							is not less certain that every seller, it being his chief interest to merit preference
							over his competitors, will sell in general the best goods and at the <note

							attract customers. The merchant or manufacturer who cheats will be quickly discredited
							and lose his custom without the interference of government."</p>

						<note rend="right">Adam Smith's <hi rend="i">Wealth of Nations</hi> (1776)</note>

						<p>The first great systematic work upon political economy was published by a Scotch
							philosopher, Adam Smith, in 1776. His <hi rend="i">Inquiry into the Nature and Causes
								of the Wealth of Nations</hi> became the basis of all further progress in the
							science. He attacked the doctrines of the mercantilists and the various expedients
							which they had favored,-- import duties, bounties, restrictions upon exporting grain,
							etc.,-- all of which he believed "retard instead of accelerating the progress of
							society toward real wealth and greatness; and diminish instead of increasing the real
							value of the annual produce of its labor and land." In general he agreed with Turgot
							that the State should content itself with protecting traders and business men and
							seeing that justice was done; but he sympathized with the English navigation laws,
							although they obviously hampered commerce, and was not as thoroughgoing a free trader
							as many of the later English economists.</p>

						<note rend="right">The economists attack existing abuses</note>

						<p>While the economists in France and England by no means agreed in details, they were
							at one in believing that it was useless and harmful to interfere with what they held
							to be the economic laws. They brought the light of reason to bear, for example, upon
							the various bungling and iniquitous old methods of taxation then in vogue, and many of
							them advocated a single tax which should fall directly upon the landowner. They wrote
							treatises on practical questions, scattered pamphlets broadcast, and even conducted a
							magazine or two in the hope of bringing home to the people at large the existing
							economic evils.</p>

						<note rend="right">The eighteenth century a period of rapidly increasing
							enlightenment</note>

						<p>It is clear from what has been said that the eighteenth century was a period of
							unexampled advance in general enlightenment. New knowledge spread abroad by the
							Encyclopaedists, the economists, and writers on government-- Turgot, Adam Smith,
							Montesquieu, Rousseau, Beccaria, and many others of <pb id="VAB8216-051" n="39"/>
							lesser fame-- led people to see the vices of the existing system and gave them at the
							same time new hope of bettering themselves by abandoning the mistaken beliefs and
							imperfect methods of their predecessors. The spirit of reform penetrated even into
							kings' palaces, and we must now turn to the actual attempts to better affairs made by
							the more enlightened rulers of Europe.</p>

						<note rend="right">The "enlightened despots"</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">8.</hi> It happened in the eighteenth century that there were several
							remarkably intelligent monarchs,-- Frederick II of Prussia, Catharine the Great of
							Russia, Emperor Joseph II, and Charles III of Spain. These rulers read the works of
							the reformers, and planned all sorts of ways in which they might better the conditions
							in their realms by removing old restrictions which hampered the farmer and merchant,
							by making new and clearer laws, by depriving the clergy of wealth and power which
							seemed to them excessive, and by encouraging manufactures and promoting commerce.</p>

						<p>These monarchs are commonly known as the "enlightened" or "benevolent" despots. They
							were no doubt more "enlightened" than the older kings; at least they all read books
							and associated with learned men. But they were not more "benevolent" than Charlemagne,
							or Canute, or St. Louis, or Henry IV, all of whom, as well as many other European
							monarchs of earlier centuries, had believed it their duty to do all they could for the
							welfare of their people. On the other hand, the monarchs of the eighteenth century
							were certainly despots in the full sense of the word. They held that all the powers of
							the State were vested in them, and had no idea of permitting their subjects any share
							in the government. Moreover they were as much interested in fighting one another as
							their predecessors had been, and were constantly trying to add to their own
							territories by robbing their neighbors, as we shall see in a later chapter.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-052" n="40"/>

						<note rend="right">Frederick the Great of Prussia (1740-1786)</note>

						<p>One of the most striking and practical of the reforming rulers was Frederick the
							Great of Prussia. As a youth he had grieved and disgusted his father by his fondness
							for books and his passion for writing verses and playing the flute. A French tutor had
							instilled in him a love for the polished language of France and an enthusiasm for her
							literature and for her philosophers who were busy attacking the traditional religious
							ideas to which Frederick's father stoutly clung. When eighteen years old Frederick had
							tried to run away in order to escape the harsh military discipline to which he was
							subjected. He was captured and brought before the king, who was in such a rage that he
							seemed upon the point of killing his renegade son with his sword. He contented
							himself, however, with imprisoning Frederick in the citadel of KÃ¼strin, with no books
							except a Bible, and forced him to witness the execution of one of his companions, who
							had aided his flight.</p>

						<p>After this Frederick consented to give some contemptuous attention to public affairs.
							He inspected the royal domains near KÃ¼strin and began, for the first time, to study
							the peasants, their farms, and their cattle. He even agreed to marry a princess whom
							his father had selected for him, and settled down to a scholarly life, studying
							literature, philosophy, history, and mathematics, and carrying on a correspondence
							with learned men of all nations, especially with Voltaire,<ref id="ref_018"
								rend="super" target="note_018">1</ref> whom he greatly admired. He was very fond
							indeed of writing and seized every spare moment of a busy life to push forward his
							works upon history, politics, and military matters. No less than twenty-four volumes
							of his writings, all in French, were published shortly after his death, and these did
							not include everything that he had managed to write.<ref id="ref_019" rend="super"
								target="note_019">2</ref></p>

						<p>He said that the ruler owed the State an account of the uses to which he put the
							taxes raised for its support and defense. He allowed the people no part in the
							government, it is true, <note id="note_018"><ref target="ref_018" rend="super">1</ref>

							<pb id="VAB8216-053" n="41"/> but he worked very hard himself. He rose early and was
							busy all day. He was his own prime minister and the real head of all branches of the
							government, watching over the army and leading it in battle, attending to foreign
							affairs, guarding the finances, overseeing the courts, journeying up and down the land
							investigating the conduct of his officials and examining into the condition of his
							people.</p>

						<note rend="right">Religious toleration in Prussia</note>

						<p>In religious matters Frederick was extremely tolerant; he held that his subjects
							should be allowed to worship God freely in any way they pleased. His kingdom had long
							been Protestant, but there were many Catholics in parts of his scattered dominions. He
							welcomed Huguenots and Jesuits with equal cordiality and admitted Catholics as well as
							Protestants to his service. "I stand neutral between Rome and Geneva," he once said;
							"he who wrongs his brother of a different faith shall be punished; were I to declare
							for one or the other creed I should excite party spirit and persecution; my aim, on
							the contrary, is to show the adherents of the different churches that they are all

						<note rend="right">Catharine II empress of Russia 11762-1796)</note>

						<p>The most interesting of all the "benevolent despots" was Catharine of Russia. Since
							she was to play a conspicuous rÃ´1e in all the affairs of Europe for thirty-five years,
							a word must be said of the manner in which this German woman became the ruler of all
							the Russias. She was the daughter of one of Frederick the Great's officers and had
							been selected by him in 1743, at the request of the Tsarina Elizabeth, as a suitable
							wife for Peter, the heir to the throne. At the age of fourteen this inexperienced girl

							fellow, who early began to neglect and maltreat her. Catharine won over the imperial
							guard and had herself proclaimed empress. Peter was forced to abdicate and was carried
							off by some of Catharine's supporters, who put him to death, probably with her tacit
							consent.</p>

						<note rend="right">Catharine's character</note>

						<p>In the spirit of Peter the Great, Catharine determined to carry on the Europeanizing

							choice and management of her ministers and was herself a hard worker. She rose at six
							o'clock in the morning, hurried through her toilet, prepared her own light breakfast,
							and turned to the exacting and dull business of government, carefully considering the
							reports laid before her relating to the army, the navy, finances, and foreign
							affairs.</p>

						<note rend="right">Catherine II of Russia</note>

						<p>Catharine II showed herself almost as interested in the philosophers and reformers as
							did Frederick.<ref id="ref_022" rend="super" target="note_022">2</ref> She invited
							Diderot to spend a month with her and was disappointed that d'Alembert would not
							consent to become the tutor of the grand duke Paul, the heir to the throne. She
							subscribed for the <hi rend="i">EncyclopÃ¦dia,</hi> and bought Diderot's library when
							he got into trouble, permitting him to continue to use the books as long as he wished.
							In her frequent letters to Voltaire she explained to him her various plans for

						<note rend="right">Catharine maintains serfdom but secularizes the Church lands</note>

							were all to use the German language in official communications. The old irregular

							were done away with and replaced by a uniform system of government in which his own

						<note rend="right">Joseph II reforms the Church</note>

						<p>Joseph visited France and was personally acquainted with Rousseau and Turgot. He was
							heartily opposed to the monks. "The principles of monasticism," he declared, "are in

							that a country can possess." He particularly objected to those orders whose members
							devoted themselves to religious contemplation, which he regarded as worse than a waste
							of time; he consequently abolished some six hundred of their monasteries and used
							their property for charitable purposes and to establish schools. He appointed the
							bishops without consulting the Pope and forbade money to be sent to Rome. Marriage was
							declared to be merely a civil contract and so was taken out of the control of the
							priests. Lutherans, Calvinists, and other heretics were allowed to worship in their
							own way.</p>

							to the lord. He taxed nobles and clergy without regard to their claims to exemption,
							and supplanted the confused and uncertain laws by a uniform system which is the basis
							of Austrian law to-day. He introduced a protective tariff and caused a large number of
							factories to be built. He illustrated his preference for home industries by giving
							away to the hospitals all the foreign wines in his cellars, and his spirit of economy,
							by forbidding the use of gold and silver for candlesticks, and prohibiting the burial
							of the dead in coffins for the reason that this was a waste of wood which might be
							better employed.</p>

							despotic conduct on the part of their kings by expelling from the country, in i688,
							James II, and calling to the throne William and Mary.</p>

						<note rend="right">English constitutional principles</note>

						<p>To make doubly sure of their safeguards against arbitrary power, Parliament required
							William and Mary to agree to certain principles of government, practically as a
							condition to their receiving the crown. These principles were embodied in the Bill of
							Rights (December, 1689), which forbade the king to suspend or dispense with the laws
							of the realm, lay taxes without parliamentary grant, keep a standing army without the
							consent of Parliament, interfere with freedom of speech and debate in Parliament,
							impose excessive fines or cruel and unusual punishments, or prevent the subjects of
							the realm from respectfully petitioning the throne. By this great act "the fundamental
							rights of British subjects" were firmly established in the law and placed beyond the
							arbitrary power of kings.</p>

						<p>Frederick the Great and Louis XV, however, could fix the amount of the taxes and
							decide who should pay them without asking the consent, or even the advice, of any of
							their subjects. They could borrow all the money that the bankers would lend them and
							spend it as they pleased, without giving any account of it. The English king, on the
							contrary, could impose no taxes and borrow no money on the national credit without the
							sanction of Parliament; and a definite sum was assigned to him as an allowance with
							which to keep up his royal establishment, defray his personal expenses, and pay the
							salaries of important government officials.</p>

							simple edict. In England the king could neither issue a new law nor suspend an old one
							without the consent of Parliament. Even the right which he had formerly enjoyed to
							veto the bills passed by Parliament fell into disuse and was exercised for the last
							time by Queen Anne in 1707.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-059" n="47"/>

						<note rend="right">The king of England did not control the courts of law</note>

						<p>On the Continent the monarch could remove judges who made decisions which did not
							please him. In England, since 1701, the judges have held their positions during good
							behavior, unless removed on request of both houses of Parliament. The English king
							could not arbitrarily arrest his subjects or call before his own council, to be
							decided by himself personally, cases which were being tried in the regular courts. The
							Habeas Corpus Act of 1679 provided that any one who was arrested should be informed of
							the reason and should be speedily tried by a regular tribunal and dealt with according
							to the law of the land. In France there were none of these restrictions placed upon
							the king, who could arrest his subjects on <hi rend="i">lettres de cachet,</hi>
							imprison them indefinitely without assigning a reason, and could interfere in any suit
							and decide it as he chose.</p>

						<note rend="right">Contrast between the English Parliament and similar bodies on the
							Continent</note>

						<p>The English Parliament, which had originated in the thirteenth century, was by no
							means unique in the Middle Ages. For example, we find the ruler of Aragon summoning an
							assembly of nobles, clergy, and "rich men" as early as 1162. In 1255 the
							representatives of the cities appeared in the diet of the Holy Roman Empire along with
							the various princes and prelates. In France, about 1300, the Estates General had come
							to be made up of representatives of the three classes of the realm,-- nobles, clergy,
							and the "third estate," or townspeople.</p>

						<note rend="right">The two houses of Parliament</note>

						<p>But all these bodies, and others of the same kind, gradually lost all their
							importance, with the sole exception of the English Parliament. This had from the
							middle of the fourteenth century consisted of two houses. The higher nobility-- dukes,
							marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons-- sat, together with the prelates,-
							archbishops, bishops, and abbots,<ref id="ref_025" rend="super" target="note_025"
								>1</ref>-- in the House of Lords. Accordingly the representatives of the nobles and
							the clergy were not separated, as they often were on the Continent. In the second
							chamber, the House of Commons, there were not only representatives of the towns but
							those chosen by <note id="note_025"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_025"
										rend="super">1</ref> The abbots disappeared when Henry VIII dissolved the
									monasteries.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-060" n="48"/> the landed proprietors of the counties,-- thus giving
							the lesser landholders a voice in the nation's councils.<ref id="ref_026" rend="super"
								target="note_026">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">The House of Commons represented only a small part of the
							nation</note>

						<p>Remarkable as was the English Parliament in the eighteenth century, in its
							organization and its power to control the king, it nevertheless represented only a
							small part of the nation. In the Middle Ages, when the towns were small and the
							country population tolerably evenly scattered, the House of Commons fairly represented
							the property owners throughout England. But as time went on no effort was made to
							readjust the apportionment to meet the changes which gradually took place. Many towns
							dwindled away, some disappeared altogether, and the lords upon whose lands they had
							been situated came to control the choice of those members of the House of Commons who
							represented these so-called "rotten boroughs." On the other hand, great towns like
							Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds grew up, which had no representatives. As a result
							the great majority of the English people had no more share in the government than the
							subjects of Louis XV. In 1768 there were only one hundred and sixty thousand voters,
							although the whole population of Great Britain amounted to some eight millions; that
							is to say, about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the government. Moreover,
							no poor man could sit in Parliament, since all members were required to hold
							considerable land.<ref id="ref_027" rend="super" target="note_027">2</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Origin of the Tories and Whigs</note>

						<p>Despite the small number who could actually participate in the choice of
							representatives, political questions were hotly discussed among the upper classes, who
							were divided into two well-defined parties, Tories and Whigs. These owed their origin
							to the excitement of the Civil War, when those who supported Charles I were called
							Cavaliers and those who opposed him, Roundheads. During the latter years of Charles
							II, <note id="note_026"><ref target="ref_026" rend="super">1</ref> The lower clergy
								was not represented in Parliament as it was in the Estates General. For a time its
								representatives met and voted the taxes that they were to pay, but after 1664 the
								assembly confined itself exclusively to religious matters.</note>
							<note id="note_027"><ref target="ref_027" rend="super">2</ref> For a fuller
								description of the parliamentary system and its reform, see below, chap. xix.<ptr

							<pb id="VAB8216-061" n="49"/> the former party, which upheld the divine right of kings
							and the supremacy of the Anglican Church, received the name of "Tory." Their
							opponents, who advocated the supremacy of Parliament and championed toleration for the
							Dissenters, came to be called Whigs.<ref id="ref_028" rend="super" target="note_028"
								>1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Whig supremacy in the early eighteenth century</note>
						<note rend="right">Robert Walpole, prime minister (1721-1742)</note>

						<p>After the death of Anne many of the Tories favored calling to the throne the son of
							James II (popularly called "the old Pretender"), whereupon the Whigs succeeded in
							discrediting their rivals by denouncing them as Jacobites<ref id="ref_029"
								rend="super" target="note_029">2</ref> and traitors. They made the new Hanoverian
							king, George I, believe that he owed everything to the Whigs, and for a period of
							nearly fifty years, under George I and George II, they were able to control
							Parliament. George I himself spoke no English, was ignorant of English politics, and
							was much more interested in Hanover than in his new kingdom. He did not attend the
							meetings of his ministers, as his predecessors had done, and turned over the
							management of affairs to the Whig leaders. They found a skillful " boss " and a
							judicious statesman in Sir Robert Walpole, who maintained his own power and that of
							his party by avoiding war and preventing religious dissensions at home. He used the
							king's funds to buy the votes necessary to maintain the Whig majority in the House of
							Commons and to get his measures through that body. He was England's first "prime
							minister."</p>

						<note rend="right">Origin of the cabinet</note>

						<p>The existence of two well-defined political parties standing for widely different
							policies forced the king to choose all his ministers from either one or the other. The
							more prominent among his advisers came gradually to form a little group who resigned
							together if Parliament refused to accept the measures they advocated. So the English
							rulers from the time of William III were generally compelled to select their ministers
							from the party which had a majority in Parliament; otherwise their plans would be
							pretty sure to be frustrated. In this way "cabinet <note id="note_028"><ref
									target="ref_028" rend="super">1</ref> Not until after the reform of 1832 did the
								Tories become "Conservatives" and the Whigs assume the name of "Liberals."</note>
							<note id="note_029"><ref target="ref_029" rend="super">2</ref> This name applied to
								the supporters of James is derived from the Latin form of his name, <hi rend="i"
									>Jacobus.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-062" n="50"/> government" originated, that is, government by a small
							group of the heads of departments (like the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the First
							Lord of the Admiralty, etc.), who belong to the party which has a majority in
							Parliament, or at least in the House of Commons, and who resign together when the
							House votes down any important measure which they propose.</p>

						<note rend="right">King George III bribes the commons when necessary</note>

						<p>Nevertheless after Walpole's fall in 1742 cabinet government did not flourish for a
							generation or so, especially under George III, who came to the throne in 1760, for he
							proposed to follow his mother's advice, "George, be king." Indeed, many thoughtful men
							felt that Walpole had been what we should call nowadays a corrupt boss, and
							accordingly they encouraged the king to keep the government in his own hands. During
							the war with the American colonies George III was practically his own prime minister
							and freely resorted to rather high-handed methods.</p>

						<note rend="right">Growing demand for reform</note>
						<note rend="right">The younger Pitt</note>

						<p>However, the day when the king could rule as he pleased was passed; and there was no
							little discontent with the monopoly which the landed gentry and the rich enjoyed in
							Parliament. There was an increasing number of writers to point out to the people the
							defects in the English system. They urged that every man should have the right to
							participate in the government by casting his vote, and that the constitution should be
							written and so made clear and unmistakable. Political clubs were founded, which
							entered into correspondence with political societies in France; newspapers and
							pamphlets poured from the press in enormous quantities, and political reform found
							champions in the House of Commons. Even so influential a politician as the younger
							Pitt, who was prime minister from 1783 to 1801, introduced bills into the House of
							Commons for remedying some inequalities in representation. But the violence and
							disorder which accompanied the French Revolution involved England in a long and
							tedious war and discredited reform with Englishmen who had formerly favored change, to
							say nothing of the Tories, who regarded with horror any proposal to modify the
							venerated English constitution.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-063" n="51"/>

						<note rend="right">England had already the elements of a modern free government, but the
							political system was not democratic</note>

						<p>It is clear that England possessed the elements of a modern free government, for her
							king was master neither of the persons nor the purses of his subjects, nor could he
							issue arbitrary laws. Political affairs were discussed in newspapers and petitions, so
							that weighty matters of government could not be decided secretly in the king's closet
							without the knowledge of his subjects. Nevertheless it would be far from correct to
							regard the English system as democratic. The mass of the people had no political
							rights whatever; an hereditary House of Lords could block any measure introduced in
							the House of Commons; and the House of Commons itself represented not the nation but a
							small minority of landowners and traders. Government offices were monopolized by
							members of the Established Church, and the poor were oppressed by cruel criminal laws
							administered by officials chosen by the king. Workingmen were prohibited from forming
							associations to promote their interests. It was more than a century after the
							accession of George III before the English peasant could go to the ballot box and vote
							for members of Parliament.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">10.</hi> Among the most conspicuous of the benevolent despots of whom we
							have spoken were Frederick the Great of Prussia and Catharine the Great of Russia.
							While much was said in the previous volume of France, England, Spain, the Netherlands,
							the Holy Roman Empire, and the Italian states, it was not necessary hitherto to speak
							of Russia and Prussia. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries these states,
							however, played a great part in European affairs, and in order to understand how they
							grew up, we must turn from the Rhine and the Pyrenees to the shores of the Baltic and
							the vast plains of eastern Europe. While the long War of the Spanish Succession had
							been in progress, due to Louis XIV's anxiety to add Spain to the possessions of his
							family, another conflict was raging in the north, and changes were taking place there
							comparable in importance to those which were ratified by the Peace of Utrecht. Russia,
							which had hitherto faced eastward, was turning toward the west, upon which she was
							destined to exert an ever-increasing influence. The newly founded kingdom of Prussia
							was gathering its forces for a series of brilliant military exploits under the
							leadership of Frederick the Great.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Slavic peoples of Europe and the extent of Russia</note>

						<p>There has been no occasion in dealing with the situation in western Europe to speak
							heretofore of the Slavic peoples to which the Russians, as well as the Poles,
							Bohemians, Bulgarians, and other nations of eastern Europe belong, although together
							they constitute the most numerous race in Europe. Not until <pb id="VAB8216-066"
								n="54"/> the opening of the eighteenth century did Russia begin to take an active
							part in western affairs. Now she is one of the most important factors in the politics
							of the world. Of the realms of the Tsar, that portion which lies in Europe exceeds in
							extent the territories of all the other rulers of the Continent put together, and yet
							European Russia comprises scarcely a quarter of the Tsar's whole dominion, which
							embraces northern and central Asia, extends to the Pacific Ocean, and forms all
							together an empire covering about three times the area of the United States.</p>

						<note rend="right">Beginnings of Russia</note>

						<p>The beginnings of the Russian state fall in the ninth century; some of the Northmen
							invaded the districts to the east of the Baltic, while their relatives were causing
							grievous trouble in France and England. It is generally supposed that one of their
							leaders, Rurik, was the first to consolidate the Slavic tribes about Novgorod into a
							sort of state in 862. Rurik's successor extended the bounds of the new empire so as to
							include the important town of Kiev on the Dnieper. The word "Russia" is probably
							derived from <hi rend="i">Rous</hi>, the name given by the neighboring Finns to the
							Norman adventurers. Before the end of the tenth century the Greek form of Christianity
							was introduced and the Russian ruler was baptized. The frequent intercourse with
							Constantinople might have led to rapid advance in civilization had it not been for a
							great disaster which put Russia back for centuries.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Tartar invasion in the thirteenth century</note>

						<p>Russia is geographically nothing more than an extension of the vast plain of northern
							Asia, which the Russians were destined finally to conquer. It was therefore exposed to
							the great invasion of the Tartars, or Mongols, who swept in from the East in the
							thirteenth century. The powerful Tartar ruler, Genghis Khan (1162-1227), conquered
							northern China and central Asia, and the mounted hordes of his successors crossed into
							Europe and overran Russia, which had fallen' apart into numerous principalities. The
							Russian princes became the dependents of the great Khan, and had frequently to seek
							his far-distant court, some three thousand miles away, where he freely disposed of
							both their crowns and their heads. The <pb id="VAB8216-067" n="55"/> Tartars exacted
							tribute of the Russians, but left them undisturbed in their laws and religion.</p>

						<note rend="right">Influence of the Tartar occupation on manners and customs</note>
						<note rend="right">Ivan the Terrible assumes the title of Tsar</note>

						<p>Of the Russian princes who went to prostrate themselves at the foot of the Great
							Khan's throne, none made a more favorable impression upon him than did the prince of
							Moscow, in whose favor the Khan was wont to decide all cases of dispute between the
							prince and his rivals. When the Mongol power had begun to decline in strength and the
							princes of Moscow had grown stronger, they ventured, in 1480, to kill the Mongol
							ambassadors sent to demand tribute, and thus freed themselves from the Mongol yoke.
							But the Tartar occupation had left its mark, for the princes of Moscow imitated the
							Khans rather than the western rulers, of whom, in fact, they knew nothing. In 1547
							Ivan the Terrible assumed the Asiatic title of Tsar,<ref id="ref_030" rend="super"
								target="note_030">1</ref> which appeared to him more worthy than that of king or
							emperor The costumes and etiquette of the court were also Asiatic. The Russian armor
							suggested that of the Chinese, and their headdress was a turban. It was the task of
							Peter the Great to Europeanize Russia.</p>

						<note rend="right">Peter the Great (1672-1725)</note>

						<p>At the time of Peter's accession, Russia, which had grown greatly under Ivan the
							Terrible and other enterprising rulers, still had no outlet to the sea. In manners and
							customs the kingdom was Asiatic, and its government was that of a Tartar prince. Peter
							had no quarrel with the despotic power which fell to him and which the Russian
							monarchs still exercise. But he knew that Russia was very much behind the rest of
							Europe, and that his crudely equipped soldiers could never make head against the
							well-armed and disciplined troops of the West. He had no seaport and no ships, without
							which Russia could never hope to take part in the world's affairs. His two great tasks
							were, therefore, to introduce western habits and to "make a window," as he expressed
							it, through which Russia might look abroad.<ref id="ref_031" rend="super"
								target="note_031">2</ref></p>

						<note id="note_030"><ref target="ref_030" rend="super">1</ref> The title Tsar, or Czar,

						<pb id="VAB8216-068" n="56"/>

						<note rend="right">Peter's travels in Europe</note>

						<p>In 1697-1698, when the western powers were enjoying the peace concluded at Ryswick,
							Peter himself visited Germany, Holland, and England, with a view to investigating
							every art and science of the West, as well as the most approved methods of
							manufacture, from the making of a man-of-war to the etching of an engraving. Nothing
							escaped the keen eyes of this rude, half-savage northern giant. For a week he put on
							the wide breeches of a Dutch laborer and worked in the shipyard at Saardam near
							Amsterdam. In England, Holland, and Germany he engaged artisans, scientific men,
							architects, ship captains, and those versed in artillery and the training of troops,
							all of whom he took back with him to aid in the reform and development of Russia.</p>

						<note rend="right">Suppression of revolt against foreign ideas</note>

						<p>He was called home by the revolt of the royal guard, who had allied themselves with
							the very large party of nobles and churchmen who were horrified at Peter's desertion
							of the habits and customs of his forefathers. They hated what they called "German
							ideas," such as short coats, tobacco smoking, and beardless faces. The clergy even
							suggested that Peter was perhaps Antichrist. Peter took a fearful revenge upon the
							rebels, and is said to have himself cut off the heads of many of them.</p>

						<note rend="right">Peter's reform measures</note>

						<p>Peter's reforms extended through his whole reign. He made his people give up their
							cherished oriental beards and long flowing garments. He forced the women of the better
							class, who had been kept in a sort of oriental harem, to come out and meet the men in
							social assemblies, such as were common in the West. He invited foreigners to settle in
							Russia, and insured them protection, privileges, and the free exercise of their
							religion. He sent young Russians abroad to study. He reorganized the government
							officials on the model of a western kingdom, and made over his army in the same
								way.<ref id="ref_032" rend="super" target="note_032">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Founding of a new capital, St. Petersburg</note>

							marshy, it is true,-- where he hoped to construct Russia's first real port. Here he
							built St. Petersburg at enormous expense and colonized it with Russians and
							foreigners.</p>

						<note rend="right">The military prowess of Charles XII of Sweden</note>

						<p>In his ambition to get to the sea, Peter naturally collided with Sweden, to which the
							provinces between Russia and the Baltic belonged. Never had Sweden, or any other
							country, had a more warlike king than the one with whom Peter had to contend,-- the
							youthful prodigy, Charles XII. When Charles came to the throne in 1697 he was only
							fifteen years old, and it seemed to the natural enemies of Sweden an auspicious time
							to profit by the supposed weakness of the boy ruler. So a union was formed between
							Denmark, Poland, and Russia, with the object of increasing their territories at
							Sweden's expense. But Charles turned out to be a second Alexander the Great in
							military prowess. He astonished Europe by promptly besieging Copenhagen and forcing
							the king of Denmark to sign a treaty of peace. He then turned like lightning against
							Peter, who was industriously besieging Narva, and with eight thousand Swedes wiped out
							an army of fifty thousand Russians (1700). Lastly he defeated the king of Poland.</p>

						<note rend="right">Defeat ad death of Charles XII</note>

						<p>Though Charles was a remarkable military leader, he was a foolish ruler. He undertook
							to wrest Poland from its king, to whom he attributed the formation of the league
							against him. He had a new king crowned at Warsaw, whom he at last succeeded in getting
							recognized. He then turned his attention to Peter, who had meanwhile been conquering
							the Baltic provinces. This time fortune turned against the Swedes. The long march to
							Moscow proved as fatal to them as to Napoleon a century later, Charles XII being
							totally defeated in the battle of Pultowa (1709). He fled to Turkey, where he spent
							some years in vainly urging the Sultan to attack Peter. Returning at last to his own
							kingdom, which he had utterly neglected for years, he was killed in i718 while
							besieging a town.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-072" n="58"/>

						<note rend="right">Russia acquires the Baltic provinces and attempts to get a footing on
							the Black Sea</note>

						<p>Soon after Charles's death a treaty was concluded between Sweden and Russia by which
							Russia gained Livonia, Esthonia, and the other Swedish provinces at the eastern end of
							the Baltic. Peter had made less successful attempts to get a footing on the Black Sea.
							He had first taken Azof, which he soon lost during the war with Sweden, and then
							several towns on the Caspian. It had become evident that if the Turks should be driven
							out of Europe, Russia would be a mighty rival of the western powers in the division of
							the spoils.</p>

						<p>For a generation after the death of Peter the Great, Russia fell into the hands of
							incompetent rulers. It appears again as a European state when the great Catharine II,
							of whose reforms we have already spoken above, came to the throne in 1762. From that
							time on, the western powers had always to consider the vast Slavic empire in all their
							great struggles. They had also to consider a new kingdom in northern Germany, Prussia,
							which was just growing into a great power as Peter began his work.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">11.</hi> The electorate of Brandenburg had figured on the map of Europe
							for centuries, and there was no particular reason to suppose that it was one day to
							become the dominant state in Germany. Early in the fifteenth century the old line of
							electors had died out, and the impecunious Emperor Sigismund had sold the electorate
							to a hitherto inconspicuous house, the Hohenzollerns, who are known to us now through
							such names as those of Frederick the Great, William I, the first German emperor, and
							his grandson, the present emperor. While it has always been the pride of the
							Hohenzollern family that practically every one of its reigning members has added
							something to what his ancestors handed down to him, nothing need be said of the
							earlier little annexations; no great extension took place until 1614, when the elector
							of Brandenburg inherited Cleves and Mark, and thus got his first hold on the Rhine
							district.</p>

						<note rend="right">Prussia acquired by the elector of Brandenburg</note>

						<p>What was quite as important, he won, four years later, far to the east, the duchy of
							Prussia, which was separated from Brandenburg by Polish territory. Prussia was
							originally the name of a region on the Baltic inhabited by heathen Slavs. These had
							been conquered in the thirteenth century by one of the orders of crusading knights,
							who, when the conquest of the Holy Land was abandoned, looked about for other
							occupations. The region filled up with German colonists, but it came under the
							sovereignty of the neighboring kingdom of Poland, whose ruler annexed the western half
							of the territory of the Teutonic Order, as the German knights were called. In Luther's
							day (1525) the knights accepted Protestantism and dissolved their order. They then
							formed their lands into the duchy of Prussia and made their Grand Master, who was a
							relative of the elector of Brandenburg, their first duke, under the suzerainty of the
							king of Poland. About a hundred years later (1618) this branch of the Hohenzollerns
							died out, and the duchy then fell to the elector of Brandenburg.</p>

						<note rend="right">The territories of the Great Elector (1640-1688)</note>

						<p>Notwithstanding this substantial territorial gain, there was little promise that the
							hitherto obscure electorate would ever become a formidable power when, in 1640,
							Frederick William, known as the Great Elector, came to his inheritance. His
							territories were scattered from the Rhine to the Vistula, his army was of small
							account, and his authority disputed by powerful nobles and local assemblies. The
							center of his domain was Brandenburg. Far to the west was Mark, bordering on the Rhine
							valley, and Cleves, lying on both banks of that river. Far to the East, beyond the
							Vistula, was the duchy of Prussia, outside the borders of the Empire and subject to
							the overlordship of the king of Poland.</p>

						<note rend="right">Character of the Great Elector</note>

						<p>Frederick William was, however, well fitted for the task of welding these domains
							into a powerful state. He was coarse by nature, heartless in destroying opponents,
							treacherous in diplomatic negotiations, and entirely devoid of the culture which
							distinguished Louis XIV and his court. He set resolutely <pb id="VAB8216-074" n="60"/>
							to work to build up a great army, destroy the local assemblies in his provinces, place
							all government in the hands of his officials, and add new territories to his
							patrimony.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Great Elector makes important gains in territory</note>

						<p>In all of these undertakings he was largely successful. By shrewd tactics during the
							closing days of the Thirty Years' in War he managed to secure, by the Treaty of
							Westphalia, the bishoprics of Minden and Halberstadt and the duchy of Farther <figure>
								<p rend="center">Territories of the Great Elector of Brandenburg</p>
							</figure> Pomerania, which gave him a good shore line on the Baltic. He also forced
							Poland to surrender her overlordship of the duchy of Prussia and thus made himself a
							duke independent of the Empire.</p>

						<note rend="right">Reforms of the Great Elector</note>

						<p>Knowing that the interests of his house depended on military strength, he organized,
							in spite of the protests of the taxpayers, an army out of all proportion to the size
							and wealth of his dominions. He reformed the system of administration and succeeded in
							creating an absolute monarchy on the model furnished by his contemporary, Louis XIV.
							He joined England and Holland in their alliances against Louis, and the army of
							Brandenburg began to be known and feared.</p>

						<note rend="right">Huguenots received in Brandenburg</note>

						<p>Though a good Protestant, the Great Elector permitted religious freedom to a
							remarkable degree. He made Catholics eligible to office and, on the other hand, gave
							asylum to the <pb id="VAB8216-075" n="61"/> persecuted Huguenots of France, even
							offering them special inducements to settle in his realms. In short, as his
							illustrious descendant, Frederick the Great, wrote: "He was the restorer and defender
							of Brandenburg, and an arbiter among his equals. With slight means he did great
							things; he was his own prime minister and commander in chief and rendered flourishing
							a state which he found buried beneath its own ruins."</p>

						<note rend="right">Brandenburg becomes the kingdom of Prussia, 1701</note>

						<p>It was accordingly a splendid legacy which the Great Elector left in 1688 to his son,
							Frederick III, and although the career of the latter was by no means as brilliant as
							that of his father, he was able by a bold stroke to transform his electorate into a
							kingdom. The opportunity for this achievement was offered by the need of the powers
							for his assistance against the designs of Louis XIV. When the Emperor called upon
							Frederick III in 1700 to assist him in securing a division of the Spanish dominions,
							the elector exacted as the price of his help the recognition of his right to take the
							title of king.</p>

						<note rend="right">Frederick III elector of Brandenburg, becomes King Frederick I of
							Prussia</note>

						<p>The title King of Prussia was deemed preferable to the more natural King of
							Brandenburg because Prussia lay wholly without the bounds of the Empire and
							consequently its ruler was not in any sense subject to the Emperor but was entirely
							independent. Since West Prussia still belonged to Poland in 1701, the new king
							satisfied himself at first with the title King in Prussia.</p>

						<note rend="right">Government of Frederick William I (1713-1740)</note>

						<p>The second ruler of the new kingdom, Frederick William I, the father of Frederick the
							Great, is known to history as the rough and boorish barrack king who devoted himself
							entirely to governing his realm, collecting tall soldiers, drilling his battalions,
							hunting wild game, and smoking strong tobacco. He ruled his family and his country
							with an iron hand, declaring to those who remonstrated, "Salvation belongs to the
							Lord; everything else is my business."<ref id="ref_033" rend="super" target="note_033"
								>1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Frederick William and his soldiers</note>

						<p>Frederick William was passionately fond of military life from his childhood. He took
							special pride in stalwart soldiers <note id="note_033"><ref target="ref_033"
									rend="super">1</ref> For Frederick William's instructions for the education of his
								son, see <hi rend="i">Readings,</hi> Vol. I, p. 65.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-076" n="62"/>' and collected them at great expense from all parts of
							Europe. He raised the army, which numbered twenty-seven thousand in the days of the
							Great Elector, to eighty-four thousand, making it almost equal to that maintained by
							France or Austria. He reserved to himself the right to appoint subordinates as well as
							high officials in the service, and based promotion on excellence in discipline rather
							than on family connections. He was constantly drilling and reviewing his men, whom he
							addressed affectionately as "my blue children."</p>

						<note rend="right">Miserly economy in finances</note>

						<p>Moreover, by wise management, miserly thrift, and entire indifference to the
							amenities of life, Frederick William treasured up a huge sum of money. He discharged a
							large number of court servants, sold at auction many of the royal jewels, and had a
							great portion of the family plate coined into money. Consequently he was able to leave
							to his son, Frederick II, not only an admirable army but an ample supply of gold.
							Indeed, it was his toil and economy that made possible the achievements of his far
							more distinguished son.</p>

						<note rend="right">The accession of Frederick and Maria Theresa</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">12.</hi> Frederick II came to the throne in the spring of 1740. In the
							autumn the Emperor Charles VI died and left his Austrian domains to his eldest
							daughter, Maria Theresa, then only twenty-three years old, five years younger than her
							future rival, the king of Prussia. Her father had no near male relatives to whom the
							vast Hapsburg possessions would descend after his death; he was very anxious that his
							daughter should inherit all the Austrian lands, and spent much of his life inducing
							the more important powers of Europe-- Russia, Prussia, Holland, Spain, England, and
							France-- to agree to his plan.</p>

						<note rend="right">Queenly traits of Maria Theresa</note>

						<p>For a time it seemed as if no one was going to take advantage of Maria Theresa's
							inexperience to rob her of any of her outlying possessions. She began immediately to
							display astonishing energy and aptitude for the business of governing. She <pb

							read long documents and reports, conscientiously consulted her ministers, and
							conferred with the ambassadors of foreign courts. Her clear judgment, her
							distinguished bearing, her love of pomp and ceremony,-- all helped her to sustain her
							dignity in the trying circumstances in which she soon found herself. She had none of
							Frederick's appreciation of culture, and, unlike her son Joseph II, whose reforms have
							already been described, she exhibited a contempt for science and philosophy. Nor had
							she any sympathy with religious toleration; on the contrary, she abhorred the
							sceptical notions of the Prussian king and his admiration for Voltaire.</p>

						<note rend="right">Polyglot Austrian dominions</note>

						<p>The problems which confronted her would have been difficult enough if her realms had
							been compact and inhabited by people of a single race. The Austrian possessions were,
							however, as has already been pointed out, a most miscellaneous and scattered
							collection of territories, great and small, inhabited by a large variety of widely
							differing races,-- Germans in Austria. proper, Czechs mixed with Germans in Bohemia
							and Moravia, Magyars in Hungary, Croatians and Slovenes to the south, Italians in
							Milan and Tuscany, French and Walloons in the Netherlands. The chief cities of the
							young queen included such scattered and varied places as Vienna, Pesth, Prague, Milan,
							Brussels, and Antwerp.</p>

						<note rend="right">Frederick's attack upon Silesia (1740)</note>

						<p>Maria Theresa's dominions soon began to attract the ambitious Frederick, and he
							determined to rob her of Silesia, a strip of territory lying to the southeast of
							Brandenburg. He accordingly marched his army into the coveted district, and occupied
							the important city of Breslau without declaring war or offering any excuse except a
							vague claim to a portion of the land.<ref id="ref_034" rend="super" target="note_034"

							realm would be vain, but the loyalty of all the various peoples under her scepter was
							roused by her extraordinary courage and energy. The French were driven back, but Maria
							Theresa was forced to grant Silesia to Frederick in order to induce him to retire from
							the war. Finally, England and Holland joined in an alliance for maintaining the
							balance of power, for they had no desire to see France annex the Austrian Netherlands.
							On the death of the Emperor Charles VII (1745), Maria Theresa's husband, Francis, duke
							of Lorraine, was chosen emperor. A few years later (1748) all the powers, tired of the
							war, laid down their arms and agreed to what is called in diplomacy the <hi rend="i"
								>status quo ante bellum,</hi> which simply means that things were to be restored to
							the condition in which they had been before the opening of hostilities.</p>

						<note rend="right">Frederick promotes the material development of Prussia</note>
						<note rend="right">Frederick and Voltaire</note>

						<p>Frederick was, however, permitted to keep Silesia, which increased his dominions by
							about one third of their former extent. He now turned his attention to making his
							subjects happier and more prosperous, by draining the swamps, promoting industry, and
							drawing up a new code of laws. He found time, also, to gratify his interest in men of
							letters, and invited Voltaire<ref id="ref_035" rend="super" target="note_035">1</ref>
							to make his home at Berlin. It will not seem strange to any one who knows anything of
							the character of these two men, that they quarreled after two or three years, and that
							Voltaire left the Prussian king with very bitter feelings.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Seven Years' War</note>

						<p>Maria Theresa was by no means reconciled to the loss of Silesia, and she began to lay
							her plans for expelling the perfidious Frederick and regaining her lost territory.
							This led to one of the most important wars in modern history, in which not only almost
							every European power joined, but which involved the whole world, from the Indian
							rajahs of Hindustan to the colonists of Virginia and New England. This Seven Years'
							War (1756-1763) will be considered in its broader aspects in the next chapter. We note
							here only the part played in it by the king of Prussia.</p>

						<note rend="right">The alliance against Prussia</note>

						<p>Maria Theresa's ambassador at Paris was so skillful in his negotiations with the
							French court that in 1756 he induced it, in spite of its two hundred years of
							hostility to the House of Hapsburg, to enter into an alliance with Austria against
							Prussia. Russia, Sweden, and Saxony also agreed to join in a concerted attack on
							Prussia. Their armies, coming as they did from every point of the compass, threatened
							the complete annihilation of Austria's rival. It seemed as if the new kingdom of
							Prussia might disappear altogether from the map of Europe.</p>

						<note rend="right">Frederick's victorious defense</note>

						<p>However, it was in this war that Frederick earned his title of "the Great" and showed
							himself the equal of the ablest generals the world has seen, from Alexander to
							Napoleon. Learning the object of the allies, he did not wait for them to declare war
							against him, but occupied Saxony at once and then moved on into Bohemia, where he
							nearly succeeded in taking the capital, Prague. Here he was forced to retire, but in
							1757 he defeated the French and his German enemies in the most famous, perhaps, of his
							battles, at Rossbach. A month later he routed the Austrians at Leuthen,<ref
								id="ref_036" rend="super" target="note_036">1</ref> not far from Breslau. Thereupon
							the Swedes and the Russians retired from the field and left Frederick for the moment
							master of the situation.</p>

						<note rend="right">Frederick finally triumphs over Austria</note>

						<p>England now engaged the French and left Frederick at liberty to deal with his other
							enemies. While he exhibited marvelous military skill, he was by no means able to gain
							all the battles in which he engaged. For a time, indeed, it looked as if he might,
							after all, be vanquished. But the accession of a new Tsar, who was an ardent admirer
							of Frederick, led Russia to conclude peace with Prussia, whereupon Maria Theresa
							reluctantly agreed to give up once more her struggle with her inveterate enemy.
							Shortly afterwards England and France came to terms, and a general settlement was made
							at Paris in 1763.<ref id="ref_037" rend="super" target="note_037">2</ref></p>

						<p><hi rend="b">13.</hi> Frederick's success in seizing and holding one of Austria's
							finest provinces did not satisfy him. The central portions of his kingdom--
							Brandenburg, Silesia, and Pomerania-- were completely cut off from East Prussia by a
							considerable tract known as West Prussia, which belonged to the kingdom of Poland. The
							map will show how great must have been Frederick's temptation to fill this gap,
							especially as Poland was in no condition to defend its possessions.</p>

						<note rend="right">Mixed population and discordant religions in Poland</note>

						<p>With the exception of Russia, Poland was the largest kingdom in Europe. It covered an
							immense plain with no natural boundaries, and the population, which was very thinly
							scattered, belonged to several races. Besides the Poles themselves, there were Germans
							in the cities of West Prussia, and the Lithuanians and Russians in Lithuania. The Jews
							were very numerous everywhere, forming half of the population in some of the towns.
							The Poles were usually Catholics, while the Germans were Protestants, and the Russians
							adhered to the Greek Church. These differences in religion, added to those of race,
							created endless difficulties and dissensions.</p>

						<note rend="right">The defective system of government</note>
						<note rend="right">The <hi rend="i">liberum veto</hi></note>

						<p>The government of Poland was the worst imaginable. Instead of having developed a
							strong monarchy, as her neighbors-- Prussia, Russia, and Austria-- had done, she
							remained in a state of feudal anarchy which the nobles had taken the greatest pains to
							perpetuate by binding their kings in such a way that they had no power either to
							maintain order or to defend the country from attack. The king could not declare war,
							make peace, impose taxes, or pass any law without the consent of the diet. As the diet
							was composed of representatives of the nobility, any one of whom could freely veto any
							measure,-- for no measure could pass that had even one vote against it,-- most of the
							diets broke up without accomplishing anything.</p>

						<note rend="right">The elective kingship</note>

						<p>The kingship was not hereditary in Poland, but whenever the ruler died, the nobles
							assembled and chose a new one, commonly <pb id="VAB8216-083" n="67"/> a foreigner.
							These elections were tumultuous, and the various European powers regularly interfered,
							by force or bribery, to secure the election of a candidate whom they believed would
							favor their interests.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Polish obels and peasants</note>

						<p>The nobles in Poland were numerous. There were perhaps a million and a half of them,
							mostly very poor, owning only a trifling bit of land. There was a saying that the poor
							noble's dog, even if he sat in the middle of the estate, was sure to have his tail
							upon a neighbor's land. It was the few rich and powerful families that really
							controlled such government as might be said to have existed in Poland. There was no
							middle class except in the few German towns. In the Polish and Lithuanian towns such
							industry and commerce as existed were in the hands of the Jews, who were not
							recognized as citizens and who both oppressed and were oppressed. The peasants were
							miserable indeed. They had sunk from serfs to slaves over whom their lords had the
							right of life and death.</p>

						<note rend="right">Catherine II and Frederick II agree on Polish matters, 1764</note>

						<p>It required no great insight to foresee that Poland was in danger of falling a prey
							to her greedy and powerful neighbors, Russia, Prussia, and Austria, who clamped in the
							unfortunate kingdom on all sides. They had long shamelessly interfered in its affairs
							and had actually taken active measures to oppose all reforms of the constitution in
							order that they might profit by the existing anarchy. When Augustus III died in 1763,
							just as the Seven Years' War had been brought to a close, Frederick immediately
							arranged with the new Russian ruler, the famous Catharine II, to put upon the vacant
							throne her favorite, Poniatowski, who took the title of Stanislas II.</p>

						<note rend="right">Russia and Prussia agree to prevent reforms in Poland</note>

						<p>Catharine was soon disappointed in Stanislas Poniatowski, who showed himself
							favorable to reform. He even proposed to do away with the <hi rend="i">liberum
								veto,</hi>-- the sacred right of any member of the diet to block a measure no matter
							how salutary. Russia, however, supported by Prussia, intervened to demand that the
							liberum veto, which insured continued anarchy, should be maintained. Then came several
							years of civil war <pb id="VAB8216-084" n="68"/> between the several factions, a war
							in which the Russians freely intervened.</p>

						<note rend="right">Austria agrees to the partition of Poland</note>

						<p>Austria was a neighbor of Poland and deeply interested in her affairs. She
							consequently approached her old enemy, Frederick, and between them they decided that
							Russia should be allowed to take a portion of Poland if Catharine would consent to
							give up most of the conquests her armies had just made in Turkey; then Austria, in
							order to maintain the balance of power, should be given a slice of Poland, and
							Frederick should take the longed-for West Prussia.</p>

						<note rend="right">First partition of Poland, 1772</note>

						<p>Accordingly in 1772 Poland's three neighbors arranged to take each a portion of the
							distracted kingdom. Austria was assigned a strip inhabited by almost three million
							Poles and Russians, and thus added two new kinds of people and two new languages to
							her already varied collection of races and tongues. Prussia was given a smaller piece,
							but it was the coveted West Prussia which she needed to fill out her boundaries, and
							its inhabitants were to a considerable extent Germans and Protestants. Russia's strip
							on the east was inhabited entirely by Russians. The Polish diet was forced, by the
							advance of Russian troops to Warsaw, to approve the partition.<ref id="ref_038"
								rend="super" target="note_038">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Revival of Poland, 1772-1791</note>

						<p>Poland seemed at first, however, to have learned a great lesson from the disaster.
							During the twenty years following its first dismemberment there was an extraordinary
							revival in education, art, and literature; the old universities at Vilna and Cracow
							were reorganized and many new schools established. King Stanislas Poniatowski summoned
							French and Italian artists and entered into correspondence with the French
							philosophers and reformers. Historians and poets sprang up to give distinction to the
							last days of Polish independence. The old intolerance and bigotry decreased, and,
							above all, the constitution which had made Poland the laughingstock and the victim of
							its neighbors was abolished and an entirely new one worked out.</p>

						<note rend="right">The new Polish constitution of 1791</note>

						<p>The new Polish constitution, approved on May 3, 1791, did away with the liberum veto,
							made the crown hereditary, established a parliament something like that of England,--

							and yet made him and his ministers dependent upon the representatives of the

						<note rend="right">Catherine frustrates the reform</note>

						<p>There was a party, however, which regretted the changes and feared that they might

							always of her own interests, denounced all changes in a government "under which the

						<p>Not satisfied with plunging Poland into her former anarchy, Russia and Prussia
							determined to rob her of still more territory. Frederick the Great's successor,
							Frederick William II, ordered his forces across his eastern boundary on the ground
							that Danzig was sending grain to the French Revolutionists, that Poland was infested

						<p><hi rend="b">14.</hi> The long and disastrous wars of the eighteenth century which we
							have been reviewing seem, from the standpoint of the changes they produced in Europe,
							to have been scarcely worth our attention. It was not a vital question in the world's
							history whether a member of the House of Bourbon or of the House of Hapsburg sat on
							the throne of Spain, whether Silesia belonged to Frederick or Maria Theresa, or even
							whether Poland continued to exist or not. But in addition to these contentions among
							the various dynasties and these shiftings of territory were other interests far beyond
							the confines of Europe, and to these we must now turn.<ref id="ref_041" rend="super"
								target="note_041">41</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">The history of Europe only to be explained by the history of Europe's
							colonies</note>

						<p>The history Constant wars have been waged during the past two centuries by the
							European nations in their efforts to extend and defend their distant possessions. The
							War of the Spanish Succession concerned the trade as well as the throne of Spain. The
							internal affairs of each country have been constantly influenced by the demands of its
							merchants and the achievements of its sailors and soldiers, fighting rival nations or
							alien peoples thousands of miles from London, Paris, or Vienna. The great
							manufacturing towns of England-- Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham-- owe their
							prosperity to India, China, and Australia. Liverpool, Amsterdam, and Hamburg, with
							their long <note id="note_041"><ref target="ref_041" rend="super">1</ref> For a more

								Vol. I, chaps. vi and vii.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-089" n="73"/> lines of docks and warehouses and their fleets of
							merchant vessels, would dwindle away if their trade were confined to the demands of
							their European neighbors.</p>

						<note rend="right">Vast extent of the European colonial dominion</note>

						<p>Europe includes scarcely a twelfth of the land upon the globe, and yet over three
							fifths of the world is to-day either occupied by peoples of European origin or ruled
							by European states. The possessions of France in Asia and Africa exceed the entire
							area of Europe; even the little kingdom of the Netherlands administers a colonial
							dominion three times the size of the German Empire. The British Empire, of which the
							island of Great Britain constitutes but a hundredth part, includes one fifth of the
							world's dry land. Moreover European peoples have populated the United States, which is
							nearly as large as all of Europe, and rule all of Mexico and South America.</p>

						<p>In this chapter the origin of European colonization will be briefly explained, as
							well as the manner in which England succeeded in extending her sway over the teeming
							millions of India. We shall also review England's victory over France in the western
							hemisphere. In this way the real meaning of the Seven Years' War will become
							clear.</p>

						<note rend="right">Narrow limits of the ancient and medieval world</note>

						<p>The widening of the field of European history is one of the most striking features of
							modern times. Though the Greeks and Romans carried on a large trade in silks, spices,
							and precious stones with India and China, they really knew little of the world beyond
							southern Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia, and much that they knew was
							forgotten during the Middle Ages. Slowly, however, the interest in the East revived
							and travelers began to add to the scanty knowledge handed down from antiquity.</p>

						<note rend="right">Colonial policy of Portugal, Spain, and Holland in the sixteenth and
							seventeenth centuries</note>

						<p>The voyages which had brought America and India within the ken of Europe during the
							fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries were, as we know, mainly undertaken by the
							Portuguese and Spaniards. Portugal was the first to realize the advantage of extending
							her commerce by establishing stations in India after Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of
							Good Hope in <pb id="VAB8216-090" n="74"/> 1498;<ref id="ref_042" rend="super"
								target="note_042">1</ref> and later by founding posts on the Brazilian coast of
							South America; then Spain laid claim to Mexico, the West Indies, and a great part of
							South America. These two powers found formidable rivals in the Dutch; for when Philip
							II was able to add Portugal to the realms of the Spanish monarchs for a few decades
							(i58o-1640), he immediately closed the port of Lisbon to the Dutch ships. Thereupon
							the United Provinces, whose merchants could no longer procure the spices which the
							Portuguese brought from the East, resolved to take possession of the source of
							supplies. They accordingly expelled the Portuguese from a number of their settlements
							in India and the Spice Islands, and brought Java, Sumatra, and other tropical regions
							under Dutch control.</p>

						<note rend="right">Settlements of the French and English in North America</note>

						<p>In North America the chief rivals were England and France, both of which succeeded in
							establishing colonies in the early part of the seventeenth century. Englishmen
							successively settled at Jamestown in Virginia (1607), then in New England, Maryland,
							Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. The colonies owed their growth in part to the influx of
							refugees,-- Puritans, Catholics, and Quakers,-- who exiled themselves in the hope of
							gaining the right freely to enjoy their particular forms of religion.<ref id="ref_043"
								rend="super" target="note_043">2</ref> On the other hand, many came to better their
							fortunes in the New World, and thousands of bond servants and slaves were brought over
							as laborers.</p>

							chain of forts between it and Montreal.</p>

						<p>England was able, however, by the Treaty of Utrecht, to establish herself in the
							northern regions, for France thereby ceded to her Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and the
							borders of Hudson Bay. While the number of English in North America at the beginning
							of the Seven Years' War is reckoned to have been over a million, the French did not
							reach a hundred thousand. Yet careful observers at the time were by no means sure that
							France was not destined to dominate the new country rather than England.</p>

						<note rend="right">Extent of India</note>

						<p>The rivalry of England and France was not confined to the wildernesses of North
							America, occupied by half a million of savage red men. At the opening of the
							eighteenth century both countries had gained a firm foothold on the borders of the
							vast Indian empire, inhabited by two hundred millions of people and the seat of an
							ancient and highly developed civilization. One may gain some idea of the extent of
							India by laying the map of Hindustan upon that of the United States. If the
							southern-most point, Cape Comorin, be placed over New Orleans, Calcutta will lie
							nearly over New York City, and Bombay in the neighborhood of Des Moines, Iowa.</p>

						<p>A generation after Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape, a Mongolian conqueror, Baber,<ref

								1405. The so-called Mongol (or Mogul) emperors were really Turkish rather than

							Arangzebe in 1707, their empire began to fall apart in much the same way as that of
							Charlemagne had done. Like the counts and dukes of the Carolingian period, the
							emperor's officials, the subahdars and nawabs (nabobs), and the rajahs-- i.e. Hindu
							princes temporarily subjugated by the Mongols-- had gradually got the power in their
							respective districts into their own hands. Although the emperor, or Great Mogul, as
							the English called him, continued to maintain himself in his capital of Delhi, he
							could no longer be said to rule the country at the opening of the eighteenth century
							when the French and English were beginning to turn their attention seriously to his
								coasts.<ref id="ref_046" rend="super" target="note_046">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">English and French settlements in India</note>

						<p>In the time of Charles I (1639), a village had been purchased by the English East
							India Company on the southeastern coast of Hindustan, which grew into the important
							English station of Madras. About the same time posts were established in the district
							of Bengal, and later Calcutta was fortified. Bombay was already an English station.
							The Mongolian emperor of India at first scarcely deigned to notice the presence of a
							few foreigners on the fringe of his vast realms. But before the end of the seventeenth
							century hostilities began between the English East India Company and the native
							rulers, which made it plain that the foreigners would be forced to defend
							themselves.</p>

						<p>The English had not only to face the opposition of the natives, but of a European
							power as well. France also had an East India Company, and Pondicherry, at the opening
							of the eighteenth century, was its chief center, with a population of sixty thousand,
							of which two hundred only were Europeans. It soon became apparent that there was
							little danger from the Great Mogul; moreover the Portuguese and Dutch were out of the
							race, so the native princes and the French and English were left to fight among
							themselves for the supremacy.</p>

						<note rend="right">England victorious in the struggle for supremacy in America</note>

						<p>Just before the clash of European rulers, known as the Seven Years' War, came in

							<pb id="VAB8216-095" n="77"/> their struggle for control in both America and India. In
							America the so-called French and Indian War began in 1754 between the English and
							French colonists. General Braddock was sent from England to capture Fort Duquesne,
							which the French had established to keep their rivals out of the Ohio valley. Braddock
							knew nothing of border warfare, and he was killed and his troops routed.<ref
								id="ref_047" rend="super" target="note_047">1</ref> Fortunately for England, France,
							as the ally of Austria, was soon engaged in a war with Prussia that prevented her from
							giving proper attention to her American possessions. A famous statesman, the elder
							Pitt, was now at the head of the English ministry. He was able not only to succor the
							hard-pressed king of Prussia with money and men, but also to support the militia of
							the thirteen American colonies. The French forts at Ticonderoga and Niagara were taken
							in 1758-1759. Quebec was won in Wolfe's heroic attack, and the next year all Canada
							submitted to the English.<ref id="ref_048" rend="super" target="note_048">2</ref>
							England's supremacy on the sea was demonstrated by three admirals, each of whom
							destroyed a French fleet in the same year that Quebec was lost to France.</p>

						<note rend="right">Dupleix and Clive in India</note>

						<p>In India conflicts between the French and the English had occurred during the War of
							the Austrian Succession. The governor of the French station of Pondicherry was
							Dupleix, a soldier of great energy, who proposed to drive out the English and firmly
							establish the power of France over Hindustan. His chances of success were greatly
							increased by the quarrels among the native rulers, some of whom belonged to the
							earlier Hindu inhabitants and some to the Mohammedan Mongolians who had conquered
							India in 1526. Dupleix had very few French soldiers, but he began the enlistment of
							the natives, a custom eagerly adopted by the English. These native soldiers, whom the
							English called Sepoys, were taught to fight in the manner of Europeans.<ref

							Robert Clive, who was but twenty-five years old at this time, organized a large force
							of Sepoys and gained a remarkable ascendancy over them by his astonishing bravery.
							Dupleix paid no attention to the fact that peace had been declared in Europe at
							Aix-la-Chapelle, but continued to carry on his operations against the English. But
							Clive proved more than his equal, and in two years had very nearly established English
							supremacy in the southeastern part of India.</p>

						<note rend="right">Clive renders English influence supreme in India</note>

						<p>At the moment that the Seven Years' War was beginning, bad news reached Clive from
							the English settlement of Calcutta, in India about a thousand miles to the northeast
							of Madras. The nawab of Bengal had seized the property of some English merchants and
							imprisoned one hundred and forty-five Englishmen in a little room, where most of them
							died of suffocation before morning.<ref id="ref_050" rend="super" target="note_050"
								>1</ref> Clive hastened to Bengal, and with a little army of nine hundred Europeans
							and fifteen hundred Sepoys he gained a great victory at Plassey in 1757 over the
							nawab's army of fifty thousand men. Clive then replaced the nawab of Bengal by a man
							whom he believed to be friendly to the English. Before the Seven Years' War was over
							the English had won Pondicherry and deprived the French of all their former influence
							in the region of Madras.</p>

						<note rend="right">England's gains in the Seven Year's War</note>

						<p>When the Seven Years' War was brought to an end in 1763 by the Treaty of Paris, it
							was clear that England had gained far more than any other power. She was to retain her
							two forts commanding the Mediterranean, Gibraltar, and Port Mahon on the island of
							Minorca; in America, France ceded to her the vast region of Canada and Nova Scotia, as
							well as several of the islands in the West Indies. The region beyond the Mississippi
							was ceded to Spain by France, who thus gave up all her claims to North America. In
							India, France, it is true, received back the towns which the English had taken from
							her, but she had permanently lost her influence over the native rulers, for Clive had
							made the English name greatly feared among them.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">16.</hi> England had, however, no sooner added Canada to her possessions
							and driven the French from the broad region which lay between her dominions and the
							Mississippi than she lost the better part of her American empire by the revolt of the
							irritated colonists, who refused to submit to her interference in their government and
							commerce.</p>

						<note rend="right">For a long period England left her colonies very free</note>

						<p>The English settlers had been left alone, for the most part, by the home government
							and had enjoyed far greater freedom in the management of their affairs than had the
							French and Spanish colonies. Virginia established its own assembly in 1619 and
							Massachusetts became almost an independent commonwealth. Regular constitutions
							developed which were later used as the basis for those of the several states when the
							colonies gained their independence. England had been busied during the seventeenth
							century with a great struggle at home and with the wars stirred up by Louis XIV. After
							the Peace of Utrecht Walpole for twenty years prudently refused to interfere with the
							colonies. The result was that by the end of the Seven Years' War the colonists
							numbered over two millions. Their rapidly increasing wealth and strength, their free
							life in a new land, and the confidence they had gained in their successful conflict
							with the French,-- all combined to render the renewed interference of the home
							government intolerable to them.</p>

						<note rend="right">England taxes the colonies</note>
						<note rend="right">Stamp Act of 1765</note>

						<p>During the war with the French England began to realize for the first time that the
							colonies had money, and so Parliament decided that they should be required to pay part
							of the expenses of the recent conflict and support a small standing army of English
							soldiers. The Stamp Act was therefore passed, which taxed the colonists by requiring
							them to pay the English government for stamps which had to be used upon leases, deeds,
							and other legal documents in order to make them binding. But the indignant colonists
							declared that they had already borne the brunt of the war and that in any case
							Parliament, in which they <pb id="VAB8216-098" n="80"/> were not represented, had no
							right to tax them. Representatives of the colonies met in New York in 1765 and
							denounced the Stamp Act as indicating "a manifest tendency to subvert the rights and
							liberties of the colonists."</p>

						<note rend="right">Navigation laws</note>

						<p>More irritating than the attempts of Great Britain to tax the colonists were the
							vexatious navigation and trade laws by which she tried to keep all the benefits of
							colonial trade and industry to herself. The early navigation laws passed under
							Cromwell and Charles II were specially directed against the enterprising Dutch
							traders. They provided that all products grown or manufactured in Asia, Africa, or
							America should be imported into England or her colonies only in English ships. Thus if
							a Dutch merchant vessel laden with cloves, cinnamon, teas, and silks from the Far East
							anchored in the harbor of New York, the inhabitants could not lawfully buy of the
							ship's master, no matter how much lower his prices were than those offered by English
							shippers. Furthermore, another act provided that no commodity of European production
							or manufacture should be imported into any of the colonies without being shipped
							through England and carried in ships built in England or the colonies. So if a
							colonial merchant wished to buy French wines or Dutch watches, he would have to order
							through English merchants. Again, if a colonist desired to sell to a European merchant
							such products as the law permitted him to sell to foreigners, he had to export them in
							English ships and even send them by way of England.</p>

						<note rend="right">Trade laws</note>

						<p>What was still worse for the colonists, certain articles in which they were most
							interested, such as sugar, tobacco, cotton, and indigo, could be sold only in England.
							Other things they were forbidden to export at all, or even to produce. For instance,
							though they possessed the finest furs in abundance, they could not export any caps or
							hats to England or to any foreign country. They had iron ore in inexhaustible
							quantities at their disposal, but by a law of 1750 they were forbidden to erect any
							rolling mill or furnace for making steel, in order <pb id="VAB8216-099" n="81"/> that
							English steel manufacturers might enjoy a monopoly of that trade. The colonists had
							built up a lucrative lumber and provision trade with the French West Indies, from
							which they imported large quantities of rum, sugar, and molasses, but in order to keep
							this trade within British dominions, the importation of these commodities was
							forbidden.</p>

						<note rend="right">The colonists evade the English restrictions</note>

						<p>The colonists naturally evaded these laws as far as possible; they carried on a
							flourishing smuggling trade and built up industries in spite of them. Tobacco, sugar,
							hemp, flax, and cotton were grown and cloth was manufactured. Furnaces, foundries,
							nail and wire mills supplied pig and bar iron, chains, anchors, and other hardware. It
							is clear that where so many people were interested in both manufacturing and commerce
							a loud protest was sure to be raised against the continued attempts of England to
							restrict the business of the colonists in favor of her own merchants.</p>

						<note rend="right">Taxes withdrawn except that on tea</note>

						<p>Parliament withdrew the unpopular stamp tax, but declared that it had a perfect right
							to tax the colonies as well as to make laws for them. Soon new duties on glass, paper,
							and tea were imposed, and a board was established to secure a firm observance of the
							navigation laws and other restrictions. But the protests of the colonists finally
							moved Parliament to remove all the duties except that on tea, which was retained to
							prove England's right to tax the colonists and later used to benefit the English East
							India Company.</p>

						<note rend="right">Opposition to "taxation without representation"</note>

						<p>The effort to make the Americans pay a very moderate import duty on tea and to force
							upon Boston markets the company's tea at a low price produced trouble in 1773. The
							young men of Boston seditiously boarded a tea ship in the harbor and threw the cargo
							into the water.<ref id="ref_051" rend="super" target="note_051">1</ref> The objection
							of the Boston tea merchants who abetted this enterprise was not so much to the tax as
							to the competition with East India Company merchants which they had to meet. Burke,
							perhaps the most able <note id="note_051"><ref target="ref_051" rend="super">1</ref> A

							<pb id="VAB8216-100" n="82"/> member of the House of Commons, urged the ministry to
							leave the Americans to tax themselves, but George III, and Parliament as a whole,
							could not forgive the colonists for their opposition. They believed that the trouble
							was largely confined to New England and could easily be overcome. In 1774 acts were
							passed prohibiting the landing and shipping of goods at Boston; and the colony of
							Massachusetts was deprived of its former right to choose its judges and the members of
							the upper house of its legislature, who were thereafter to be selected by the
							king.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Continental Congress</note>
						<note rend="right">Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776</note>

						<p>These measures, instead of bringing Massachusetts to terms, so roused the
							apprehension of the rest of the colonists that a congress of all the colonists was
							held at Philadelphia in 1774. This congress decided that all trade with Great Britain
							should cease until the grievances of the colonies had been redressed. The following
							year the Americans attacked the British troops at Lexington and made a brave stand
							against them in the battle of Bunker Hill. The second congress decided to prepare for
							war, and raised an army which was put under the command of George Washington, a
							Virginia planter who had gained some distinction in the late French and Indian War. Up
							to this time the colonies had not intended to secede from the mother country, but the
							proposed compromises came to nothing, and in July, 1776, Congress declared that "these
							United States are, and of right ought to be, free and independent."</p>

						<note rend="right">The United States seeks and receives aid from France</note>

						<p>This occurrence naturally excited great interest in France. The outcome of the Seven
							Years' War had been most lamentable for that country, and any trouble which came to
							her old enemy, England, could not but be a source of congratulation to the French. The
							United States therefore regarded France as their natural ally and immediately sent
							Benjamin Franklin to Versailles in the hope of obtaining the aid of the new French
							king, Louis XVI. The king's ministers were uncertain whether the colonies could long
							maintain their resistance against the overwhelming strength of the mother country. It

							1778, concluded a treaty with the United States in which the independence of the new

							enthusiasm for the Americans was so great in France that a number of the younger
							nobles, the most conspicuous of whom was the Marquis of Lafayette, crossed the
							Atlantic to fight in the American army.</p>

						<note rend="right">Close of the war, 1783</note>
						<note rend="right">England acknowledges the independence of the United States</note>

						<p>In spite of the skill and heroic self-sacrifice of Washington, the Americans lost
							more battles than they gained. It is extremely doubtful whether they would have
							succeeded in bringing the war to a favorable close, by forcing the English general,
							Cornwallis, to capitulate at Yorktown (1781), had it not been for the aid of the
							French fleet.<ref id="ref_052" rend="super" target="note_052">1</ref> The chief result

							Florida, which England had held since 1763 but now gave back.</p>

						<note rend="right">Revolt of the English colonies the beginning of the emancipation of
							the western hemisphere</note>

						<p>Spain and Portugal were able to hold their American possessions a generation longer
							than the English, but in the end practically all of the western hemisphere, with the

						<note rend="right">Results in Europe of wars between Treaty of Utrecht and Peace of
							Paris</note>

						<p>The results of the European wars during the seventy years which elapsed between the
							Treaty of Utrecht and the French Revolution may be summarized as follows. In the
							northeast two new powers, Russia and Prussia, had come into the European family of
							nations. Prussia had greatly extended her territory by gaining Silesia aid West
							Poland. She and Austria were, in the nineteenth century, to engage in a struggle for
							supremacy in Germany, which was to result in substituting the present German empire
							under the headship of the Hohenzollerns <note id="note_052"><ref target="ref_052"
									rend="super">1</ref> Cornwallis's account of his surrender is given in the <hi
									rend="i">Readings,</hi> Vol. I, p. 135.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-104" n="81"/> for the Holy Roman Empire, of which the House of
							Hapsburg had so long been the nominal chief.</p>

						<note rend="right">Origin of "eastern question"</note>

						<p>The power of the Sultan of Turkey was declining so rapidly that Austria and Russia
							were already considering the seizure of his European possessions. This presented a new
							problem to the European powers, which came to be known in the nineteenth century as
							the "eastern question." Were Austria and Russia permitted to aggrandize themselves by
							adding the Turkish territory to their possessions, it would gravely disturb the
							balance of power which England had so much at heart. So it came about that, from this
							time on, Turkey was admitted in a way to the family of western European nations, for
							it soon appeared that some of the states of western Europe were willing to form
							alliances with the Sultan, and even aid him directly in defending himself against his
							neighbors.</p>

						<note rend="right">England's colonial possessions</note>

						<p>England had lost her American colonies, and by her perverse policy had led to the
							creation of a sister state speaking her own language and destined to occupy the
							central part of the North American continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific. She
							still retained Canada, however, and in the nineteenth century added a new continent in
							the southern hemisphere, Australia, to her vast colonial empire. In India she had no
							further rivals among European nations, and gradually extended her influence over the
							whole region south of the Himalayas.</p>

						<note rend="right">English colonial policy</note>

						<p>It must not be thought, however, that the loss of the American colonies caused the
							British government to surrender at once its strict control over the affairs of the
							remaining domains. On the contrary, for a long time afterward the mother country kept
							a stricter watch than ever upon her distant provinces. As May points out: "In crown
							colonies-- acquired by conquest or cession-- the dominion of the crown was absolute;
							and the authority of the colonial office was exercised directly by instructions to the
							governors. In free colonies it was exercised, for the most part, indirectly through
							the influence of the governors and their councils. Self-government was there in
							theory; <pb id="VAB8216-105" n="85"/> but in practice the governors, aided by the
							dominant interests in the several colonies, contrived to govern according to the
							policy dictated from Downing Street." Nevertheless, as the spirit of local
							independence grew up in the colonies, this strict regime was relaxed, and open
							conflicts with colonists were avoided by British statesmen and ministers.</p>

						<note rend="right">France under Louis XV, 1715-1774</note>

						<p>As for France, she had played a rather pitiful rÃ´1e during the long reign of Louis
							XIV's great-grandson, Louis XV (1715-1774). She had, however, been able to increase
							her territory by the addition of Lorraine (1766) and, in 1768, of the island of
							Corsica. A year later a child was born in the Corsican town of Ajaccio, who one day,
							by his genius, was to make France the center for a time of an empire rivaling that of
							Charlemagne in extent. When the nineteenth century opened France was no longer a
							monarchy, but a republic; and her armies were to occupy in turn every European
							capital, from Madrid to Moscow. In order to understand the marvelous transformations
							produced by the French Revolution and the wars of Napoleon, we must consider somewhat
							carefully the conditions in France which led to a great reform of her institutions in
							1789, and to the founding of a republic four years later.</p>

						<note rend="right">How the French people accomplished reforms which had failed the
							benevolent despots</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">17.</hi> The benevolent despots had not succeeded in ridding Europe of
							the old institutions and confusion which had come down from the Middle Ages,-- indeed,
							there were many things which they had no desire to change. Even in England little was
							done in the eighteenth century to meet the most reasonable demands of the reformers.
							But in 1789 the king of France asked his people to submit their grievances to him and
							to send representatives to Versailles to confer with him upon the state of the realm
							and the ways in which the government might be improved so as to increase the general
							happiness and the prosperity of the kingdom. And then the miracle happened ! The
							French National Assembly swept away the old abuses with an ease and thoroughness which
							put the petty reforms of the benevolent despots to shame. It accomplished more in a
							few months than the reforming kings had done in a century; for the kings had never
							dreamed of calling in their people to aid them. Instead of availing themselves of the
							great forces of the nation, they had tried to do everything alone by royal decrees,
							and so had failed.</p>

						<note rend="right">The real French Revolution not to be confused with the Reign of
							Terror</note>

						<p>The unique greatness of the reformation accomplished by the French Assembly is,
							however, often obscured by the disorder which accompanied it. When one meets the words
							"French Revolution," he is pretty sure to call up before his mind's eye the storming
							of the Bastille, the guillotine and its hundreds of victims, and the Paris mob
							shouting the hymn of the Marseillaise as they parade the streets with the heads of
							unfortunate "aristocrats" on their pikes. Every one has heard of this <pb
								id="VAB8216-108" n="88"/> terrible episode in French history, even if he knows
							practically nothing of the permanent good which was accomplished at the time. Indeed,
							it has made so deep an impression on posterity that the Reign of Terror is often
							mistaken for the real Revolution. It was, however, only a sequel to it, an unhappy
							accident which will seem less and less important as the years go on, while the
							achievements of the Revolution itself will loom larger and larger. The Reign of Terror
							will be explained and described in good time, but it is a matter of far greater
							importance to understand clearly how the fundamental and permanent reforms were
							wrought out, and how France won the proud distinction of being the first nation to do
							away with the absurd and vexatious institutions which weighed upon Europe in the
							eighteenth century.</p>

						<note rend="right">Meaning of the term <hi rend="i">Ancien RÃ©gime</hi></note>

						<p>We have already examined these institutions which were common to most of the European
							countries,-- despotic kings, arbitrary imprisonment, unfair taxation, censorship of
							the press, serfdom, feudal dues, friction between Church and State,-- all of which the
							reformers had been busy denouncing as contrary to reason and humanity, and some of
							which the benevolent despots and their ministers had, in a half-hearted way, attempted
							to remedy. The various relics of bygone times and of outlived conditions which the
							Revolution abolished forever are commonly called in France the <hi rend="i">Ancien
								RÃ©gime</hi> (the old system). In order to see why France took the lead of other
							European countries in modernizing itself, it is necessary to examine somewhat
							carefully the particular causes of discontent there. We shall then see how almost
							every one, from the king to the peasant, came to realize that the old system was bad
							and consequently resolved to do away with it and substitute a more rational plan of
							government for the long-standing disorder.</p>

						<note rend="right">France not a well-organized state in the eighteenth century</note>

						<p>Of the evils which the Revolution abolished, none was more important than the
							confusion due to the fact that France was not in the eighteenth century a
							well-organized, homogeneous <pb id="VAB8216-109" n="89"/> state whose citizens all
							enjoyed the same rights and privileges. A long line of kings had patched it together,
							adding bit by bit as they could. By conquest and bargain, by marrying heiresses, and
							through the extinction of the feudal dynasties, the original restricted domains of
							Hugh Capet about Paris and Orleans had been gradually increased by his descendants. We
							have seen how Louis XIV gained Alsace and Strassburg and some towns on the borders of
							the Spanish Netherlands, how Louis XV added Lorraine on the death of his father-in-law
							in 1766. Two years later the island of Corsica was ceded to France by Genoa. So when
							Louis XVI came to the throne in 1774 he found himself ruler of practically the whole
							territory which makes up France to-day.</p>

						<note rend="right">The old provinces of France</note>

						<p>Some of the districts which the kings of France brought under their sway, like
							Languedoc, Provence, Brittany, and Dauphiny, were considerable states in themselves,
							each with its own laws, customs, and system of government. When these provinces had
							come, at different times, into the possession of the king of France, he had not
							changed their laws so as to make them correspond with those of his other domains. He
							was satisfied if a new province paid its due share of the taxes and treated his
							officials with respect. In some cases the provinces retained their local assemblies,
							and controlled, to a certain extent, their own affairs. The provinces into which
							France was divided before the Revolution were not, therefore, merely artificial
							divisions created for the purposes of administrative convenience, like the modern
							French departments,<ref id="ref_053" rend="super" target="note_053">1</ref> but
							represented real historical differences.</p>

						<note rend="right">Various systems of law</note>

						<p>While in a considerable portion of southern France the Roman law still prevailed, in
							the central parts and in the west and north there were no less than two hundred and
							eighty-five different local codes of law in force; so that one who moved from his own
							to a neighboring town might find a wholly unfamiliar legal system.</p>

						<note id="note_053"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_053" rend="super">1</ref> See
								below, p. 122.</hi></note>

						<pb id="VAB8216-110" n="90"/>

						<note rend="right">Interior customs lines</note>

						<p>Neither was France commercially a single state. The chief customs duties were not
							collected upon goods as they entered French territory from a foreign country; for the
							customs lines lay within France itself, so that the central provinces about Paris were
							cut off from the outlying ones as from a foreign <figure>
								<p><hi rend="center">The Provinces of France in the Eighteenth Century, showing<lb/>
										Interior Customs Lines</hi></p>
							</figure> land. A merchant of Bordeaux sending goods to Paris would have to see that
							the duties were paid on them as they passed the customs line, and, conversely, a
							merchant of Paris would have to pay a like duty on commodities sent to places without
							the line.</p>

						<note rend="right">Inequalities of taxation illustrated by the salt tax</note>

						<p>The monstrous inequalities in levying one of the oldest and heaviest of the taxes,
							i.e. the salt tax, still better illustrate <pb id="VAB8216-111" n="91"/> the strange
							disorder that existed in France in the eighteenth century. The government collected
							this form of revenue by monopolizing the sale of salt and then charging a high price
							for it. There would have been nothing remarkable in this had the same price been
							charged everywhere, but as it was, the <figure>
								<p><hi rend="center">Map showing the Amount paid in the Eighteenth Century for
										Salt<lb/> in Various Parts of France<ref id="ref_054" rend="super"
											target="note_054">1</ref></hi></p>
							</figure> people in one town might be forced to pay thirty times as much as their
							neighbors in an adjacent district. The accompanying map shows how arbitrarily France
							was divided. To take a single example : in the city of Dijon a certain amount of salt
							cost seven francs; a few miles to the east, on entering <note id="note_054"><hi
									rend="center"><ref target="ref_054" rend="super">1</ref> The figures indicate the
									various prices of a given amount of salt.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-112" n="92"/> Franche-ComtÃ©, one had to pay for the same amount
							twenty-five francs; a little to the north, fifty-eight francs; to the south, in the
							region of the little salt tax, twenty-eight francs; while still farther off, in Gex,
							there was no tax whatever. The government had to go to great expense to guard the
							boundary lines between the various districts, for there was every inducement to
							smugglers to carry salt from those parts of the country where it was cheap into the
							land of the great salt tax.</p>

						<note rend="right">The privileged classes</note>

						<p>Besides these unfortunate local differences, there were class differences which
							caused great discontent. All Frenchmen did not enjoy the same rights as citizens. Two
							small but very important classes, the nobility and the clergy, were treated
							differently by the State from the rest of the people. They did not have to pay one of
							the heaviest of the taxes, the notorious <hi rend="i">taille;</hi> and on one ground
							or another they escaped other burdens which the rest of the citizens bore. For
							instance, they were not required to serve in the militia or help build the roads.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Church</note>

						<p>We have seen how great and powerful the medieval Church was. In France, as in other
							Catholic countries of Europe, it still retained in the eighteenth century a
							considerable part of the power that it had possessed in the thirteenth, and it still
							performed important public functions. It took charge of education and of the relief of
							the sick and the poor. It was very wealthy and is supposed to have owned one fifth of
							all the land in France. The clergy claimed that their property, being dedicated to
							God, was not subject to taxation. They consented, however, to help the king from time
							to time by a "free gift," as they called it. The Church still collected the tithes
							from the people, and its vast possessions made it very independent. It will be
							remembered that those who did not call themselves Roman Catholics were excluded from
							some of the most important rights of citizenship. Since the revocation of the Edict of
							Nantes no Protestant could be legally married, or have the births of his children
							registered, or make a legal will.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-113" n="93"/>

						<note rend="right">The clergy</note>

						<p>A great part of the enormous income of the Church went to the higher clergy,-- the
							bishops, archbishops, and abbots. Since these were appointed by the king,<ref
								id="ref_055" rend="super" target="note_055">1</ref> often from among his courtiers,
							they paid but little attention to their duties as officers of the Church and were
							generally nothing more than "great lords with a hundred thousand francs income." While
							they amused themselves at Versailles the real work was performed-- and well
							performed-- by the lower clergy, who often received scarcely enough to keep soul and
							body together. This explains why, when the Revolution began, the parish priests sided
							with the people instead of with their ecclesiastical superiors.</p>

						<note rend="right">The privileges of the nobility</note>

						<p>The privileges of the nobles, like those of the clergy, had originated in the
							mediaeval conditions described in an earlier chapter.<ref id="ref_056" rend="super"
								target="note_056">2</ref> A detailed study of their rights would reveal many
							survivals of the institutions which prevailed in the eleventh and twelfth centuries,
							when the great majority of the people were serfs living upon the manors. While serfdom
							had largely disappeared in France long before the eighteenth century, and the peasants
							were generally free men who owned or rented their land, it was still the theory of the
							French law that there was "no land without its lord." Consequently the lords still
							enjoyed the right to collect a variety of time-honored dues from the inhabitants
							living within the limits of the former manors.</p>

						<note rend="right">The feudal dues</note>

						<p>The privileges and dues enjoyed by the nobles varied greatly in different parts of
							France. It was quite common for the noble landowner to have a right to a certain
							portion of the peasant's crops; occasionally he could still collect a toll on sheep
							and cattle driven past his house. In some cases the lord maintained, as he had done in
							the Middle Ages, the only mill, wine press, or oven within a certain district, and
							could require every <note id="note_055"><ref target="ref_055" rend="super">1</ref>
								According to the agreement made by Francis I with the Pope in 1516. See <hi rend="i"
									>Development of Modern Europe,</hi> Vol. I, p. 141.</note>
							<note id="note_056"><ref target="ref_056" rend="super">2</ref> See above, sect.
								3.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-114" n="94"/> one to make use of these and pay him a share of the
							product. Even when a peasant owned his land, the neighboring lord usually had the
							right to exact one fifth of its value every time it was sold.</p>

						<note rend="right">The hunting rights</note>

						<p>The nobles, too, enjoyed the exclusive privilege of hunting, which was deemed an
							aristocratic pastime. The game which they preserved for their amusement often did
							great damage to the crops of the peasants, who were forbidden to interfere with hares
							and deer. Many of the manors had great pigeon houses, built in the form of a tower, in
							which there were one or two thousand nests. No wonder the peasants detested these, for
							they were not permitted to protect themselves against the innumerable pigeons and
							their progeny, which spread over the fields devouring newly sown seed. These dovecotes
							constituted, in fact, one of the chief grievances of the peasants.</p>

						<note rend="right">Offices at court and in the Church and army reserved for
							nobles</note>

						<p>The higher offices in the army were reserved for the nobles, as well as the easiest
							and most lucrative places in the Church and about the king's person. All these
							privileges were vestiges of the powers which the nobles had enjoyed when they ruled
							their estates as feudal lords. Louis XIV had, as we know, induced them to leave their
							domains and gather round him at Versailles, where all who could afford it lived for at
							least a part of the year.</p>

						<note rend="right">Only a small part of the nobles belonged to old families</note>

						<p>Only a small part of the nobility in the eighteenth century were, however,
							descendants of the ancient and illustrious feudal families of France. The greater part
							of them had been ennobled in recent times by the king, or had purchased or inherited a
							government office or judgeship which carried the privileges of nobility with it. This
							fact rendered the rights and exemptions claimed by the nobility even more odious to
							the people at large than they would otherwise have been.</p>

						<note rend="right">The third estate</note>

						<p>Everybody who did not belong to either the clergy or nobility was regarded as being
							of the third estate. The third estate was therefore nothing more than the nation at
							large, which was made up in 1789 of about twenty-five million souls. The <pb
								id="VAB8216-115" n="95"/> privileged classes can scarcely have counted altogether
							more than two hundred or two hundred and fifty thousand individuals. A great part of
							the third estate lived in the country and tilled the soil. Most historians have been
							inclined to make out their condition as very wretched. They were certainly oppressed
							by an abominable system of taxation and were irritated by the dues which they had to
							pay to the lords. They also suffered frequently from local famines. Yet there is no
							doubt that the evils of their situation have been greatly exaggerated. When Thomas
							Jefferson traveled through France in 1787 he reports that the country people appeared
							to be comfortable and that they had plenty to eat. Arthur Young, a famous English
							traveler who has left us an admirable account of his journeys in France during the
							years 1787 and 1789, found much prosperity and contentment, although he gives, too,
							some forlorn pictures of destitution.</p>

						<note rend="right">Favorable situation of the peasant in France compared with other
							countries</note>
						<note rend="right">Rapid increase of population in the eighteenth century</note>

						<p>The latter have often been unduly emphasized by historical writers; for it has
							commonly been thought that the Revolution was to be explained by the misery and
							despair of the people, who could bear their burdens no longer. If, however, instead of
							comparing the situation of the French peasant under the old regime with that of an
							English or American farmer to-day, we contrast his position with that of his
							fellow-peasant in Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy, or Spain, in the eighteenth
							century, it will be clear that in France the agricultural classes were really much
							better off than elsewhere on the Continent. In almost all the other European
							countries, except England, the peasants were still serfs : they had to work certain
							days in each week for their lord; they could not marry or dispose of their land
							without his permission. Moreover the fact that the population of France had steadily
							increased from seventeen millions after the close of the wars of Louis XIV to about
							twenty-five millions at the opening of the Revolution, indicates that the general
							condition of the people was improving rather than growing worse.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-116" n="96"/>

						<note rend="right">Popular discontent, not the exceptionally miserable condition of the
							French people, accounts for the Revolution</note>

						<p>The real reason why France was the first among the European countries to carry out a
							great reform and do away with the irritating survivals of feudalism was not that the
							nation was miserable and oppressed above all others, but that it was sufficiently free
							and enlightened to realize the evils and absurdities of the old regime. Mere
							oppression and misery does not account for a revolution; there must also be active <hi
								rend="i">discontent;</hi> and of that there was a great abundance in France, as we
							shall see. The French peasant no longer looked up to his lord as his ruler and
							protector, but viewed him as a sort of legalized robber who demanded a share of his
							precious harvest, whose officers awaited the farmer at the crossing of the river to
							claim a toll, who would not let him sell his produce when he wished, or permit him to
							protect his fields from the ravages of the pigeons which it pleased his lord to
							keep.</p>

						<note rend="right">France still a despotism in the eighteenth century</note>

						<p>In the eighteenth century France was still the despotism that Louis XIV had made it.
							Louis XVI once described it very well in the following words: "The sovereign authority
							resides exclusively in my person. To me solely belongs the power of making the laws,
							and without dependence or coÃ¶peration. The entire public order emanates from me, and I
							am its supreme protector. My people are one with me. The rights and interests of the
							nation are necessarily identical with mine and rest solely in my hands." In short, the
							king still ruled "by the grace of God," as Louis XIV had done. He needed to render
							account to no man for his governmental acts; he was responsible to God alone. The
							following illustrations will make clear the dangerous extent of the king's power.</p>

						<note rend="right">The king's control of the government funds</note>

						<p>In the first place, it was he who levied each year the heaviest of the taxes, the
							hated <hi rend="i">taille,</hi> from which the privileged classes were exempted. This
							tax brought in about one sixth of the whole revenue of the State. The amount collected
							was kept secret, and no report was made to the nation of what was done with it or, for
							that matter, with any other part of the <pb id="VAB8216-117" n="97"/> king's income.
							Indeed no distinction was made between the king's private funds and the State
							treasury, whereas in England the monarch was given a stated allowance. The king of
							France could issue as many drafts payable to bearer as he wished; the royal officials
							must pay all such orders and ask no questions. Louis XV is said to have spent no less
							than seventy million dollars in this irresponsible fashion in a single year.</p>

						<note rend="right"><hi rend="i">Lettres de cachet</hi></note>

						<p>But the king not only controlled his subjects' purses; he had a terrible authority
							over their persons as well. He could issue orders for the arrest and arbitrary
							imprisonment of any one he pleased. Without trial or formality of any sort a person
							might be cast into a dungeon for an indefinite period, until the king happened to
							remember him again or was reminded of him by the poor man's friends. These notorious
							orders of arrest were called <hi rend="i">lettres de cachet,</hi> i.e. sealed letters.
							They were not difficult to obtain for any one who had influence with the king or his
							favorites, and they furnished a particularly easy and efficacious way of disposing of
							an enemy. These arbitrary orders lead one to appreciate the importance of the
							provision of Magna Carta which runs: "No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned except
							by the lawful judgment of his peers and in accordance with the law of the land." Some
							of the most eminent men of the time were shut up by the king's order, often on account
							of books or pamphlets written by them which displeased the king or those about him.
							The distinguished statesman, Mirabeau, when a young man, was imprisoned several times
							through <hi rend="i">lettres de cachet</hi> obtained by his father as a means of
							checking his reckless dissipation.</p>

						<note rend="right">Limitations on the power of the French king</note>

						<p>Yet, notwithstanding the seemingly unlimited powers of the French king, and in spite
							of the fact that France had no written constitution and no legislative body to which
							the nation sent representatives, the monarch was by no means absolutely free to do
							just as he pleased. He had not the time nor inclination to carry on personally the
							government of twenty-five million subjects, and he necessarily, and willingly, left
							much of the <pb id="VAB8216-118" n="98"/> work to his ministers and the numerous
							public officials, who were bound to obey the laws and regulations established for
							their control and guidance.</p>

						<note rend="right">The <hi rend="i">parlements</hi> and their protests</note>

						<p>Next to the king's council the most important governmental bodies were the higher
							courts of law, the <hi rend="i">parlements</hi>. These resembled the English
							Parliament in almost nothing but name. The French <hi rend="i">parlements</hi>-- of
							which the most important one was at Paris and a dozen more were scattered about the
							provinces-- did not, however, confine themselves solely to the business of trying
							lawsuits. They claimed, and quite properly, that when the king decided to make a new
							law he must send it to them to be registered, for how, otherwise, could they adjust
							their decisions to it? Now although they acknowledged that the right to make the laws
							belonged to the monarch, they nevertheless often sent a "protest" to the king instead
							of registering an edict which they disapproved. They would urge that the ministers had
							abused his Majesty's confidence. They would also take pains to have their protest
							printed and sold on the streets at a penny or two a copy, so that people should get
							the idea that the <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> was defending the nation against the
							oppressive measures of the king's ministers.</p>

						<p>When the king received one of these protests two alternatives were open to him. He
							might recall the distasteful decree altogether, or modify it so as to suit the court;
							or he could summon the <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> before him and in a solemn session
							(called a <hi rend="i">lit de justice</hi>) command it with his own mouth to register
							the law in its records. The <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> would then reluctantly obey;
							but as the Revolution approached it began to claim that a decree registered against
							its will was not valid.</p>

						<note rend="right">The <hi rend="i">parlements</hi> help to prepare the way for the
							Revolution</note>

						<p>Struggles between the <hi rend="i">parlements</hi> and the king's ministers were very
							frequent in the eighteenth century. They prepared the way for the Revolution, first,
							by bringing important questions to the attention of the people; for there were no
							newspapers, and no parliamentary or congressional debates, to enable the <pb
								id="VAB8216-119" n="99"/> public to understand the policy of the government.
							Secondly, the 5arlements not only frankly criticised the proposed measures of the king
							and his ministers, but they familiarized the nation with the idea that the king was
							not really at liberty to alter what they called "the fundamental laws" of the State.
							By this they meant that there was an unwritten constitution, which limited the king's
							power and of which they were the guardians. In this way they promoted the growing
							discontent with a government which was carried on in secret, and which left the nation
							at the mercy of the men in whom the king might for the moment repose confidence.</p>

						<note rend="right">Public opinion</note>

						<p>It is a great mistake to suppose that public opinion did not exercise a powerful
							check upon the king, even under the autocratic old regime. It was, as one of Louis
							XVI's ministers declared, "an invisible power which, without treasury, guards, or an
							army, ruled Paris and the court,-- yes, the very palace of the king." The latter half
							of the eighteenth century was a period of outspoken and acrid criticism of the whole
							existing social and governmental system. Reformers, among whom many of the king's
							ministers were counted, loudly and eloquently discussed the numerous abuses and the
							vicious character of the government, which gradually came to seem just as bad to the
							people of that day as it does to us now.</p>

						<note rend="right">Attempts to check the discussion of public questions</note>

						<p>Although there were no daily newspapers to discuss public questions, large numbers of
							pamphlets were written and circulated by individuals whenever there was an important
							crisis, and they answered much the same purpose as the editorials in a modern
							newspaper. We have already seen how French philosophers and reformers, like Voltaire,
							Diderot, and Montesquieu, had been encouraged by the freedom of speech which prevailed
							in England, and how industriously they had sown the seeds of discontent in their own
							country. We have seen how in popular works, in poems and stories and plays, and above
							all in the <hi rend="i">Encyclopedia</hi>, they explained the new scientific
							discoveries, attacked the old beliefs and misapprehensions, and <pb id="VAB8216-120"
								n="100"/> encouraged progress. Only the most ignorant could escape their influence
							altogether.</p>

						<note rend="right">The censorship of the press serves to advertise the reformers</note>

						<p>Sometimes the pamphlets and books treated the government, the clergy, or the Catholic
							religion with such open contempt that either the king, or the clergy, or the courts
							felt it necessary to prevent their circulation. The parlement of Paris now and then
							ordered some offensive writing, such as Diderot's <hi rend="i">Philosophic Thoughts,
								Voltaire's Handy Philosophic Dictionary,</hi> certain of Rousseau's works, pamphlets
							defending the Jesuits, etc., to be burned by the common hangman. The authors, if they
							could be discovered, were in some cases imprisoned, and the printers and publishers
							fined or banished, but in general the courts satisfied themselves with suppressing the
							books and pamphlets of which they disapproved. But the attempted suppression only
							advertised the attacks upon existing abuses, which followed one another in rapid
							succession. The efforts of the government and the clergy to check free discussion
							seemed an outrage to the more thoughtful among the citizens, and so rather promoted
							than prevented the consideration of the weaknesses of the Church and of the king's
							government.</p>

						<note rend="right">Economists argue against government restrictions on trade and
							manufacture</note>

						<p>The economists exposed and brought home to the people the many evils of which their
							new science took note. The unjust system of taxation, which tended to exempt the
							richer classes from their fair share of the public burdens; the wasteful and
							irritating methods of collecting the taxes; the interior customs lines, preventing the
							easy passage of goods from one part of France to another; the extravagance of the
							king's household; the pensions granted to undeserving persons; every evil of the
							bungling, iniquitous old regime was brought under the scrutiny of the new thinkers,
							who tested the existing system by the light of reason and the welfare of the great
							mass of the people.</p>

						<p>The French government, as has already been explained, had been in the habit of
							regulating manufactures with the hope of maintaining a standard which would insure
							large and regular <pb id="VAB8216-121" n="101"/> sales in foreign lands and in this
							way bring money into France. Governmental officials watched those who handled grain,
							forbade them to accumulate wheat, barley, rye, or bread stuffs, or to make any sales
							except in the public markets, and required them to report all their transactions to
							the government. The economists were flatly opposed to this system of regulation. They
							pointed out that these government restrictions produced some very bad results. They
							failed to prevent famine, and, in the case of industry, they discouraged new
							inventions and the adoption of better methods. The economists claimed that it would be
							far better to leave the manufacturer to carry on his business in his own way.<ref

						<note rend="right">Death of Louis SV and the accession of Louis XVI (1774)</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">18.</hi> In 1774 Louis XV died, after a disgraceful reign of which it
							has not seemed necessary to say much. His unsuccessful wars, which had ended with the
							loss of all his American possessions and the victory of his enemies in India, had
							brought France to the verge of bankruptcy; indeed in his last years his ministers
							repudiated a portion of the government's obligations. The taxes were already so
							oppressive as to arouse universal discontent and yet the government was running behind
							seventy millions of dollars a year. The king's personal conduct was scandalous, and he
							allowed his mistresses and courtiers to meddle in public affairs and plunder the royal
							treasury for themselves and their favorites. When at last he was carried off by
							smallpox every one hailed, with hopes of better times, the accession of his grandson
							and successor, Louis XVI.</p>

						<note rend="right">Character of Louis XVI</note>

						<p>The new king was but twenty years old, ill educated, indolent, unsociable, and very
							fond of hunting and of pottering about in a workshop where he spent his happiest
							hours. He was a well-meaning young man, with none of his grandfather's <note
								id="note_057"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_057" rend="super">1</ref> See

							<pb id="VAB8216-122" n="102"/> vices, who tried now and then to attend to the
							disagreeable business of government, and would gladly have made his people happy if
							that had not required more energy than he possessed. He had none of the restless
							interest in public affairs that we found in Frederick the Great, Catharine II, or his
							brother-in-law, Joseph II; he was never tempted to rise at five o'clock in the morning
							in order to read State papers.</p>

						<note rend="right">Marie Antoinette</note>

						<p>His wife was the beautiful Marie Antoinette, daughter of Maria Theresa. The marriage
							had been arranged in 1770 with a view of maintaining the alliance which had been
							concluded between France and Austria in 1756. The queen was only nineteen years old
							when she came to the throne, light-hearted and on pleasure bent. She disliked the
							formal etiquette of the court at Versailles and shocked people by her thoughtless
							pranks. She rather despised her heavy husband, who did not care to share in the
							amusements which pleased her best. She did not hesitate to interfere in the government
							when she wished to help one of her favorites or to make trouble for some one she
							disliked.</p>

						<note rend="right">Turgot, controller general (1774-1776)</note>

						<p>At first Louis XVI took his duties very seriously. It seemed for a time that he might
							find a place among the benevolent despots who were then ruling in Europe. He almost
							immediately placed the ablest of all the French economists, Turgot, in the most
							important of the government offices, that of controller general. Turgot was an
							experienced government official as well as a scholar. For thirteen years he had been
							the king's representative in Limoges, one of the least prosperous portions of France.
							There he had had ample opportunity to see the vices of the prevailing system of
							taxation. He had made every effort to induce the government to better its methods, and
							had tried to familiarize the people with the principles of political economy.
							Consequently, when he was put in charge of the nation's finances, it seemed as if he
							and the conscientious young king might find some remedy for the recognized abuses.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-123" n="103"/>

						<note rend="right">Turgot advocates economy</note>

						<p>The first and most natural measure was economy, for only in that way could the
							government be saved from bankruptcy and the burden of taxation be lightened. Turgot
							felt that the vast amount spent in maintaining the luxury of the royal court at
							Versailles should be reduced. The establishments of the king, the queen, and the
							princes of the blood royal cost the State annually toward twelve million dollars. Then
							the French king had long been accustomed to grant "pensions" in a reckless manner to
							his favorites, and this required nearly twelve million dollars more.</p>

						<note rend="right">How the courtiers governed France</note>

						<p>Any attempt, however, to reduce this amount would arouse the immediate opposition of
							the courtiers, and it was the courtiers who really governed France. They had every
							opportunity to influence the king's mind against a man whose economies they disliked.
							They were constantly about the monarch from the moment when he awoke in the morning
							until he went to bed at night; therefore they had an obvious advantage over the
							controller general, who only saw him in business hours.<ref id="ref_058" rend="super"
								target="note_058">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Turgot frees the grain trade and endeavors to teach political economy
							to the people</note>

						<p>Immediately upon coming into power Turgot removed a great part of the restrictions on
							the grain trade. He prefaced the edict with a very frank denunciation of the
							government's traditional policy of preventing persons from buying and selling their
							grain when and where they wished. He showed that this did not obviate famines, as the
							government hoped that it might, and that it caused great loss and hardship. If the
							government would only let matters alone the grain would always go to those provinces
							where it was most needed, for there it would bring the best price. Turgot seized this
							and every similar opportunity to impress important economic truths upon the minds of
							the people.</p>

						<note rend="right">Turgot abolishes the guilds</note>

						<p>Early in 1776 Turgot brought forward two edicts which could not fail to rouse much
							opposition. The first of these abolished the guilds,which he declared exercised "a
							vast tyranny <note id="note_058"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_058" rend="super"
										>1</ref> See Turgot's letter to the king, August, 1774, in <hi rend="i"
										>Readings</hi>, sect. 33.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-124" n="104"/> over trade and industry." In almost all the towns the
							various trades of the baker, tailor, barber, swordmaker, hatter, cooper, and all the
							rest, were each in the hands of a small number of masters who formed a union to keep
							every one else out, and who made such rules as they pleased about the way in which the
							trade should be conducted. Sometimes only the sons of masters or those who married
							masters' widows would be permitted to carry on a trade. Employers could not select the
							workmen they wished. "Often," Turgot declared, "one cannot get the simplest job done
							without having it go through the hands of several workmen of different guilds and
							without suffering the delays, tricks, and exactions which the pretensions of the
							various guilds encourage." The king, therefore, ordered that "it shall be free to all
							persons of whatever quality or condition they may be, even to all foreigners, to
							exercise in all our kingdom, and particularly in our good city of Paris, whatever
							profession or industry may seem good to them." All the guilds were abolished, in spite
							of those who declared that industry would be ruined as soon as everybody was free to
							open a shop and offer his goods to the public.</p>

						<note rend="right">Turgot abolishes the <hi rend="i">corvÃ©e</hi>and so attacks the
							privileges of the clergy and the nobility</note>

						<p>At the same time Turgot proposed an even more important reform. The government had
							been accustomed to build and repair the public roads, forcing the peasants to bring
							out their horses and carts and work for a certain time every year with out
							remuneration. This was of course a form of taxation and was known as the <hi rend="i"
								>corvÃ©e</hi>. Turgot held that the peasants should not be required to bear this
							burden and proposed to substitute for it a tax to be paid by the landholders. Both the
							clergy and nobility hotly opposed this reform on the ground that their privileges
							exempted them from the <hi rend="i">corvÃ©e</hi>, which was an ignoble exaction which
							could fall only upon a peasant. Turgot confessed that his main aim was to begin a
							great reform of the vicious system of taxation which exempted the privileged classes
							from the <hi rend="i">corvÃ©e</hi>, the <hi rend="i">taille</hi>, and other
							contributions which should be borne by everybody according to his capacity.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-125" n="105"/>

						<note rend="right">Turgot's enemies</note>

						<p>Turgot forced the parlement of Paris to register these edicts; but he had become very
							unpopular, for each one of his reforms injured a particular class who thereafter
							became his enemies. The nobles disliked him for substituting the land tax, which fell
							upon them, for the <hi rend="i">corvÃ©e</hi>, which only the peasants had borne. The
							clergy believed him a wicked philosopher, for it was known that he had urged the pious
							Louis XVI, when he took his coronation oath, to omit the pledge to extirpate heresy
							from his realms. The tradespeople hated him for doing away with the guilds.</p>

						<note rend="right">Turgot's position</note>

						<p>An Italian economist, when he heard of Turgot's appointment, wrote to a friend in
							France: "So Turgot is controller general! He will not remain in office long enough to
							carry out his plans. He will punish some scoundrels; he will bluster about and lose
							his temper; he will be anxious to do good, but will run against obstacles and rogues
							at every turn. Public credit will fall; he will be detested; it will be said that he
							is not fitted for his task. Enthusiasm will cool; he will retire or be sent off, and
							we shall have a new proof of the mistake of filling a position like his in a monarchy
							like yours with an upright man and a philosopher."</p>

						<note rend="right">Turgot dismissed, May 1776</note>

						<p>The Italian could not have made a more accurate statement of the case had he waited
							until after the dismissal of Turgot, which took place in May, 1776, much to the
							satisfaction of the court. The king, although upright and well-intentioned, was not
							fond of the governmental duties to which Turgot was always calling his attention. It
							was much easier to let things go along in the old way; for reforms not only required
							much extra work, but they also forced him to refuse the customary favors to those
							around him. It was not perhaps unnatural that the discontent of his young queen or of
							an intimate companion should outweigh the woes of the distant peasant.</p>

						<note rend="right">Turgot's plan for local assemblies</note>

						<p>Although the privileged classes, especially the courtiers who had the king's ear and
							the conservative lawyers in the <hi rend="i">parlements</hi>, prevented Turgot from
							carrying out the extensive <pb id="VAB8216-126" n="106"/> reforms that he had in mind,
							and even induced the king to restore the guilds and to continue the <hi rend="i"
								>corvÃ©e</hi>, Turgot's administration nevertheless forwarded the French Revolution.
							In the preambles to his edicts he carefully explained the nature of the abuses which
							the king was trying to remedy and so strove to enlist the sympathy of the public. He
							proposed that the king should form local assemblies to help him in the government, as
							otherwise too much power was left in the hands of the king's officials. In short,
							while Turgot was quite satisfied to have a benevolent despot in France so long as the
							king allowed himself to be led along the path of reform by a wise philosopher and
							economist, he was anxious to encourage public interest in the policy of the
							government, and believed it essential to have the people's representatives help in
							assessing the taxes and in managing local affairs.</p>

						<note rend="right">Necker succeeds Turgot</note>
						<note rend="right">Necker's financial report</note>

						<p>Necker, who, after a brief interval, succeeded Turgot, also contributed to the
							progress of the coming Revolution in two ways. He borrowed vast sums of money in order
							to carry on the war which France, as the ally of the United States, had undertaken
							against England. This greatly embarrassed the treasury later and helped to produce the
							financial crisis which was the immediate cause of the Revolution. Secondly, he gave
							the nation its first opportunity of learning what was done with the public funds by
							presenting to the king (February, 1781) a <hi rend="i">report</hi> on the financial
							condition of the kingdom which was publicly printed and eagerly read. There the people
							could see for the first time how much the <hi rend="i">taille</hi> and the salt tax
							actually took from them, and how much the king spent on himself and his favorites.</p>

						<note rend="right">Calonne, controller general (1783-1787)</note>
						<note rend="right">Calonne informs the king that France is on the verge of bankruptcy,
							August, 1786</note>

						<p>Necker was soon followed by Calonne, who may be said to have precipitated the
							momentous reform which constitutes the French Revolution. He was very popular at first
							with king and courtiers, for he spent the public funds far more recklessly than his
							predecessors. But naturally he soon found himself in a position where he could obtain
							no more money. The <pb id="VAB8216-127" n="107"/>
							<hi rend="i">parlements</hi> would consent to no more loans in a period of peace, and
							the taxes were as high as it was deemed possible to make them. At last Calonne,
							finding himself desperately put to it, informed the astonished king that the State was
							on the verge of bankruptcy, and that in order to save it a radical reformation of "the
							whole public order" was necessary. This report of Calonne's may be taken as the
							beginning of the French Revolution, for it was the first of the series of events that
							led to the calling of a representative assembly which abolished the old regime and
							gave France a written constitution.</p>

						<note rend="right">Reforms proposed by Calonne</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">19.</hi> Calonne claimed that it was necessary, in order to avoid ruin,
							"to reform everything vicious in the State." He proposed, therefore, to reduce the
							taille, reform the salt tax, do away with the interior customs lines, correct the
							abuses of the guilds, etc. But the chief reform, and by far the most difficult one,
							was to force the privileged classes to surrender their important exemptions from
							taxation. He hoped that if certain concessions were made to them they might be brought
							to consent to a land tax which should be levied on the nobility and clergy as well as
							on the third estate. So he proposed to the king that he should summon an assembly of
							persons prominent in Church and State, called "Notables," to ratify certain changes
							which would increase the prosperity of the country and bring money enough into the
							treasury to meet the necessary expenses.</p>

						<note rend="right">Summoning of the Notables, 1786</note>

						<p>The summoning of the Notables late in 1786 was really a revolution in itself. It was
							a confession on the part of the king that he found himself in a predicament from which
							he could not escape without the aid of his people. The Notables whom he selected
							-bishops, archbishops, dukes, judges, high government officials-- were practically all
							members of the privileged classes; but they still represented the nation, after a
							fashion, as distinguished from the king's immediate circle of courtiers.</p>

						<note rend="right">Calonne denounces the abuses (February 22, 1787)</note>

						<p>In his opening address Calonne gave the Notables an idea of the sad financial
							condition of the country. The government <pb id="VAB8216-129" n="109"/> was running
							behind some forty million dollars a year. He could not continue to borrow, and
							economy, however strict, would not suffice to cover the deficit. "What, then,", he
							asked, "remains to fill this frightful void and enable us to raise the revenue to the
							desired level? <hi rend="i">The Abuses!</hi> Yes, gentlemen, the abuses offer a source
							of wealth which the State should appropriate, and which should serve to reÃ«stablish
							order in the finances.... Those abuses which must now be destroyed for the welfare of
							the people are the most important and the best guarded of all, the very ones which
							have the deepest roots and the most spreading branches. For example, those which weigh
							on the laboring classes, the pecuniary privileges, exceptions to the law which should
							be common to all, and many an unjust exemption which can only relieve certain
							taxpayers by embittering the conditions of others; the general want of uniformity in
							the assessment of the taxes and the enormous difference which exists between the
							contributions of different provinces and of the subjects of the same sovereign; the
							severity and arbitrariness in the collection of the taille ; the apprehension,
							embarrassment, almost dishonor, associated with the trade in breadstuffs; the interior
							customhouses and barriers which make the various parts of the kingdom like foreign
							countries to one another... ,"-- all these evils, which public-spirited citizens had
							long deprecated, Calonne proposed to do away with forthwith.</p>

						<note rend="right">Calonne and the Notables dismissed</note>

						<p>The Notables, however, had no confidence in Calonne; most of them were determined not
							to give up their privileges, and they refused to ratify his program of reform. The
							king then dismissed Calonne and soon sent the Notables home, too (May, 1787). He then
							attempted to carry through some of the more pressing financial reforms in the usual
							way by drawing up edicts and sending them to the <hi rend="b">parlements</hi> to be
							registered.</p>

						<note rend="right">The <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> of Paris refuses to register new
							taxes and calls for the Estates General</note>

						<p>The <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> of Paris resolved, as usual, to make the king's
							ministry trouble and gain popularity for itself. This <pb id="VAB8216-130" n="110"/>
							time it resorted to a truly extraordinary measure. It not only refused to register two
							new taxes which the king desired, but asserted that <hi rend="i">Only the nation
								assembled in the Estates General can give the consent necessary to the establishment
								of a permanent tax."</hi> "Only the nation," the <hi rend="i">parlement</hi>
							continued, "after it has learned the true state of the finances, can destroy the great
							abuses and open up important resources." This declaration was followed in a few days
							by the respectful request that the king assemble the Estates General of his
							kingdom.</p>

						<p>The refusal of the <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> to register the new taxes led to one
							of the old struggles between it and the king's ministers. A compromise was arranged in
							the autumn of 1787; the <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> agreed to register a great loan,
							and the king pledged himself to assemble the Estates General within five years. During
							the early months of 1788 a flood of pamphlets appeared, criticising the system of
							taxation and the unjust privileges and exemptions enjoyed by a few citizens to the
							detriment of the great mass of the nation.</p>

						<note rend="right">The <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> of Paris protests against the
							"reform" of the judicial system</note>

						<p>Suddenly the parlement of Paris learned that the king's ministers were planning to
							put an end to its troublesome habit of opposing their measures. They proposed to
							remodel the whole judicial system and take from the <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> the
							right to register new decrees and consequently the right to protest. This the <hi
								rend="i">parlement</hi> loudly proclaimed was in reality a blow at the nation
							itself. The ministers were attacking it simply because it had acknowledged its lack of
							power to grant new taxes and had requested the king to assemble the representatives of
							the nation. The ministers, it claimed, were bent upon establishing an out-and-out
							despotism in which there should no longer be any check whatever on the arbitrary power
							of the king.</p>

						<note rend="right">The <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> of Paris draws up a Declaration of
							Rights (May, 1788)</note>

						<p>The <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> had long been wont to refer to certain "fundamental
							laws" which formed a sort of unwritten constitution limiting the powers of the king.
							It now ventured to <pb id="VAB8216-131" n="111"/> formulate some of these : (1) the
							right of the nation to grant all taxes voluntarily through their representatives in
							the Estates General; (2) the right of the provinces which had been annexed to France
							to retain all the liberties which the king had guaranteed to them when they came under
							his rule; and the right of the local <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> in each of these
							provinces to examine every edict of the king and refuse to register it if it did not
							conform to the constitutional laws of the province, or violated its rights; (3) the
							right of the judges to retain their offices no matter how anxious the king might be to
							dismiss them; (4) the right of every citizen, if arrested, to be brought immediately
							before a competent court and only to be tried by the regular judges.</p>

						<note rend="right">The provinces of France support the <hi rend="i"
							>parlements</hi></note>

						<p>This was a very poor and inadequate sketch of a constitution, but it was a definite
							protest against allowing the king to become an absolute and uncontrolled despot.
							According to the new edicts against which the <hi rend="i">parlement</hi> of Paris
							protested, tyrannical ministers might freely make new laws for the whole realm and
							completely ignore the special privileges which the king had pledged himself to
							maintain when Languedoc, Provence, Dauphiny, Brittany, BÃ©arn, Navarre, and other
							important provinces had originally been added to his kingdom. The cause of the <hi
								rend="i">parlements</hi> seemed the cause of the nation, and their protest
							contributed to the excitement and indignation which spread throughout France and which
							was to continue until the whole system of government was completely reformed.</p>

						<p>When the king's commissioners tried to proclaim the edicts which robbed the <hi
								rend="i">parlements</hi> of their right to register new laws, mobs collected and
							insulted them. At Rennes, in Brittany, they were besieged by the townspeople and had
							to be protected by soldiers. At Toulouse the mob tore up the pavement to build
							barricades and prepared to resist the entry of the commissioners. At Bordeaux the new
							laws were proclaimed under the protection of bayonets. Everywhere there were protests,
							usually accompanied by disorder.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-132" n="112"/>

						<note rend="right">Opposition roused in Dauphiny</note>
						<note rend="right">Meeting at Vizille</note>

						<p>The most interesting events took place at Grenoble, where the <hi rend="i"
								>parlement</hi> of Dauphiny was accustomed to meet. It declared that, if the king
							persisted in his plan, he would break all the bonds which bound that province to
							France and that Dauphiny would consider itself entirely freed from the oath of
							fidelity to him. When the king's officers arrived to punish the <hi rend="i"
								>parlement</hi> for its audacious utterances, they found the city ready to defend
							it. An assembly was convened at the neighboring Vizille where representatives of the
							nobility, clergy, and third estate came together. They denounced the policy of the
							king's ministers, demanded the speedy convocation of the Estates General, and
							reiterated the right of the nation to grant all taxes and to be protected from
							arbitrary punishment. They claimed that they were vindicating the rights of the nation
							at large, and that they were ready, if necessary, to sacrifice any of their special
							privileges in the interest of the whole kingdom.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Estates General summoned for 1789</note>

						<p>This demonstration on the part of Dauphiny and similar ones in the other provinces
							forced the king to dismiss the unpopular ministry and to recall Necker, who had

							Necker restored the <hi rend="i">parlements</hi> to their old power and, as the

						<note rend="right">General ignorance in regard to the Estates General</note>

						<p>It was now discovered that no one knew much about this body of which every one was
							talking, for it had not met since 1614. The king accordingly issued a general
							invitation to scholars to find out all they could about the customs observed <note
								id="note_059"><ref target="ref_059" rend="super">1</ref> The <hi rend="i"
									>parlements</hi> immediately lost all their importance. They had helped to
								precipitate the reform but they did not sympathize with any change which would
								deprive the privileged classes, to which their members belonged, of their ancient
								exemptions. They therefore forfeited their popularity when in September, 1788, they
								declared that the Estates General should meet in its old way, which would have
								enabled the privileged classes to stop any distasteful reforms.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-133" n="113"/> in the former meetings of the Estates. The public
							naturally became very much interested in a matter which touched them so closely, and
							there were plenty of readers for the pamphlets which now began to appear in greater
							numbers than ever before.</p>

						<note rend="right">The old system of voting by classes in the Estates General</note>

						<p>The old Estates General had been organized in a way appropriate enough to the feudal
							conditions under which it originated. Each of the three estates of the realm-- clergy,
							nobility, and third estate-- sent an equal number of representatives, who were
							expected to consider not the interests of the nation but the special interests of the
							particular social class to which they respectively belonged. Accordingly the deputies
							of the three estates did not sit together or vote as a single body. The members of
							each group first came to an agreement among themselves and then cast a single vote for
							the whole order. The Estates General thus had three houses instead of two, like the
							English Parliament and the Congress of the United States, which had just been
							established.</p>

						<note rend="right">Objections to the system</note>

						<p>It was natural that this system should seem preposterous to the average Frenchman in
							1788. If the Estates should be convoked according to the ancient forms, the two
							privileged classes would together be entitled to twice the number of representatives
							allotted to the other twenty-five million inhabitants of France. What was much worse,
							it seemed impossible that any important reforms could be adopted in an assembly where
							those who had every selfish reason for opposing the most necessary changes were given
							two votes out of three. Necker, whom the king had recalled in the hope that he might
							succeed in adjusting the finances, agreed that the third estate might have as many
							deputies as both the other orders put together, namely six hundred, but he would not
							consent to having the three orders sit and vote together, as the nation at large
							desired.</p>

						<note rend="right">SieyÃ¨s's pamphlet <hi rend="i">What is the Third Estate? (Qu'est-ce
								que le tiers Ã©tat?)</hi></note>

						<p>Of the innumerable pamphlets which now appeared, the most famous was that written by
							SieyÃ¨s, called <hi rend="i">What is the <pb id="VAB8216-134" n="114"/> Third
								Estate?</hi> He claimed that the "aristocrats," or privileged classes, should be
							simply neglected, since the deputies of the third estate would represent practically
							the whole nation, namely, some twenty-five million or more individuals of whom less
							than two hundred thousand, as he estimated, were nobles and priests. "It is
							impossible," he says, "to answer the question, What place should the privileged orders
							be assigned in the social body, for it is like asking Where, in the human body, does
							the malign ulcer belong which torments and weakens the unhappy victim?"</p>

						<note rend="right">The <hi rend="i">cahiers</hi></note>

						<p>Besides the great question as to whether the deputies should vote by head or by
							order, the pamphlets discussed what reforms the Estates should undertake. We have,
							however, a still more interesting and important expression of public opinion in France
							at this time, in the <hi rend="i">cashiers</hi><ref id="ref_060" rend="super"
								target="note_060">1</ref> or lists of grievances and suggestions for reform, which,
							in pursuance of an old custom, the king asked the nation to prepare. Each village and
							town throughout France had an opportunity to tell quite frankly exactly what it
							suffered from the existing system, and what reforms it desired that the Estates
							General should bring about. These <hi rend="i">cashiers</hi><ref id="ref_061"
								rend="super" target="note_061">2</ref> were the "last will and testament" of the old
							regime, and they constitute a unique historical document of unparalleled completeness
							and authenticity. No one can read the <hi rend="i">cashiers</hi> without seeing that
							the nation was ready for the great transformation which, within a year, was to destroy
							a great part of the social and political system under which the French had lived for
							centuries.</p>

						<note rend="right">Desire of the nation for a constitutional, instead of an absolute,
							monarchy</note>

						<p>Almost all the <hi rend="i">cahiers</hi> agreed that the prevailing disorder and the
							vast and ill-defined powers of the king and his ministers were perhaps the fundamental
							evils. One of them says: "Since arbitrary power has been the source of all the evils
							which afflict the State, our first desire is the establishment of a really national
							constitution, which shall define the rights of all and provide the <note id="note_060"
									><ref target="ref_060" rend="super">1</ref> Pronounced kÄƒ-yÃ¢'.</note>

								34.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-135" n="115"/> laws to maintain them." No one dreamed at this time of
							displacing the king or of taking the government out of his hands. The people only
							wished to change an absolute monarchy into a limited, or constitutional, one. All that
							was necessary was that the things which the government might not do should be solemnly
							and irrevocably determined and put upon record, and that the Estates General should
							meet periodically to grant the taxes, give the king advice in national crises, and
							expostulate, if necessary, against any violations of the proposed charter of
							liberties.</p>

						<note rend="right">Practically universal manhood suffrage</note>

						<p>The king expressed the wish that he might reach all his subjects, no matter how
							remote or humble they might be. He consequently permitted every one whose name
							appeared upon the list of taxpayers to vote, either directly or indirectly, for
							deputies. As he and his predecessors had always been careful to have every one pay
							taxes that had anything whatever to pay, this was practically equivalent to modern
							universal manhood suffrage.</p>

						<note rend="right">Many parish priests elected</note>

						<p>The village priests were all allowed to vote directly for deputies of their order.
							Since they hated the rich prelates who spent their time at the court of Versailles,
							they naturally elected as many as they could of their own rank. The result was that
							two thirds of the representatives of the clergy in the Estates General were simple
							parish priests who were in sympathy with the people and more commonly sided with the
							third estate than with the bishops and abbots, who were bent upon defending the old
							privileges and blocking reform.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Estates General meets May 5, 1789</note>
						<note rend="right">The representatives of the third estate declare themselves a
							"National Assembly"</note>

						<p>With these ideas expressed in the <hi rend="i">cahiers</hi> in mind, the Estates
							assembled in Versailles and held their first session on May 5, 1789. The king had
							ordered the deputies to wear the same costumes that had been worn at the last meeting
							of the Estates in 1614; but no royal edict could call back the spirit of earlier
							centuries. The representatives of the third estate refused to organize themselves in
							the old way as a separate order. They sent invitation after invitation to the deputies
							of <pb id="VAB8216-136" n="116"/> the clergy and nobility, requesting them to join the
							people's representatives and deliberate in common on the great interests of the
							nation. Some of the more liberal of the nobles-- Lafayette, for example-- and a large
							minority of the clergy wished to meet with the deputies of the third estate.<ref
								id="ref_062" rend="super" target="note_062">1</ref> But they were outvoted, and
							finally the deputies of the third estate (under the influence of Sieyes), losing
							patience, declared themselves on June 17 a "National Assembly." They argued that,
							since they represented at least ninety-six per cent of the nation, the deputies of the
							privileged orders might be neglected altogether. This usurpation of power on the part
							of the third estate transformed the old feudal Estates, voting by orders, into the
							first modern national representative assembly on the continent of Europe.</p>

						<note rend="right">The "Tennis-Court" oath</note>

						<p>Under the influence of his courtiers the king tried to restore the old system by
							arranging a solemn joint session of the three orders, at which he presided in person.
							He presented a long program of excellent reforms, and then bade the Estates sit apart,
							according to the former custom. But it was like bidding water to run up hill. Three
							days before, when the commons had found themselves excluded from their regular place
							of meeting on account of the preparations for the royal session, they had betaken
							themselves to a neighboring building called the "Tennis Court." Here, on June 20, they
							took the famous "Tennis-Court" oath, never to separate "until the constitution of the
							kingdom should be established and placed upon a firm foundation." They were emboldened
							in their purpose to resist all schemes to frustrate a general reform by the support of
							over half of the deputies of the clergy, who joined them the day before the royal
							session.</p>

						<note rend="right">The nobility and clergy forced to join the third estate</note>

							in, and a few days later ordered all the deputies of the privileged orders, who had
							not already done so, to join the commons.</p>

						<note rend="right">First momentous victory of the nation</note>

						<p>This was a momentous victory for the nation. The representatives of the privileged
							classes had been forced to unite with the third estate, to deliberate with them, and
							to vote "by head." Moreover the National Assembly had pledged itself never to separate
							until it had regenerated the kingdom and given France a constitution. It was no longer
							simply to vote taxes and help the king's treasury out of its perennial
							difficulties.</p>

							This court "ring" enjoyed the hearty support of the queen, Marie Antoinette, and of

						<note rend="right">Camille Desmoulins excites the Parisians, July 12, 1789 </note>

						<p>The king agreed to the court party's plans. He summoned the Swiss and German troops
							in the employ of France and sent a company of them into Paris in order that they might
							suppress any violence on the part of the townspeople, should he decide to send the
							arrogant deputies home. He was also induced to dismiss Necker, who enjoyed a
							popularity that he had, in reality, done little to merit. When the people of Paris saw
							the troops gathering and heard of the dismissal of Necker they became excited. Camille
							Desmoulins, a brilliant young journalist, rushed into the garden of the Palais Royal,
							where crowds of people were discussing the situation, and, leaping upon a table,
							announced that the Swiss and German soldiers would soon be slaughtering all the
							"patriots." He urged the people to arm and defend both themselves and the National
							Assembly from the attacks of the court party, which wished to betray the nation. All
							night the mob surged about the streets, seeking arms in the shops of the gunsmiths and
							breaking into bakeries and taverns to satisfy their hunger and thirst.</p>

						<note rend="right">Attack on the Bastille, July 14, 1789</note>

						<p>This was but the prelude to the great day of July 14, when crowds of people assembled
							to renew the search for arms, and to perform, mayhap, some deed of patriotism. One of
							the lawless bands made its way to the ancient fortress of the Bastille, which stood in
							the poorer quarter of the city. Here the mob expected to find arms, but the governor
							of the fortress, de Launay, naturally refused to supply the crowd with weapons. He
							had, moreover, mounted cannons on the parapets, which made the inhabitants of the
							region very nervous. The people hated the castle, which they imagined to be full of
							dark dungeons and instruments of torture. It appeared to them a symbol <pb
								id="VAB8216-141" n="19"/> of tyranny, for it had long been used as a place of
							confinement for those whom the king imprisoned by his arbitrary orders, the <hi
								rend="i">lettres de cachet.</hi> While there seemed no hope of taking the fortress,
							whose walls, ten feet thick, towered high above them, the attempt was made.
							Negotiations with the governor were opened and, during these, a part of the crowd
							pressed across a drawbridge into the court. Here, for some reason that has never been
							explained, the troops in the castle fired upon the people and killed nearly a hundred
							of them. Meanwhile the mob on the outside continued an ineffectual but desperate
							attack until de Launay was forced by the garrison to surrender on condition that they
							should be allowed to retire unmolested. The drawbridge was then let down and the crowd
							rushed into the gloomy pile. They found only seven prisoners, whom they freed with
							great enthusiasm. But the better element in the crowd was unable to restrain the
							violent and cruel class, represented in every mob, who proposed to avenge the
							slaughter of their companions in the courtyard of the Bastille. Consequently the Swiss
							soldiers, who formed the garrison, were killed, and their heads, with that of de
							Launay, were paraded about the streets on pikes.</p>

						<note rend="right">Significance of the fall of the Bastille</note>
						<note rend="right">Beginning of the emigration of the nobles</note>

						<p>The fall of the Bastille is one of the most impressive, striking, and dramatic events
							in modern history, and its anniversary is still celebrated in France as the chief
							national holiday. On that day the people of Paris rose to protect themselves against
							the plots of the courtiers, who wished to maintain the old despotic system. They
							attacked an ancient monument of despotism, forced the king's officer in charge of it
							to capitulate, and then destroyed the walls of the fortress so that nothing now
							remains except a line of white stones to mark its former site. The events of the i4th
							of July, 1789, have been "disfigured and transfigured by legends," but none the less
							they opened a new era of freedom inasmuch as they put an end to the danger of a return
							to the <hi rend="i">Ancien RÃ©gime.</hi> It is true that the court party continued to
							make trouble, but its <pb id="VAB8216-142" n="120"/> opposition served to hasten
							rather than to impede reform. Some of the leaders of the group, among them the king's
							younger brother, the count of Artois (who was destined to become king as Charles X),
							left France immediately after the fall of the Bastille and began actively urging
							foreign monarchs to intervene to protect Louis XVI from the reformers.</p>

						<note rend="right">The national guard</note>

						<p>It had become clear that the king could not maintain order in Paris. The shopkeepers
							and other respectable citizens were compelled to protect themselves against the wild
							crowds made up of the criminal and disorderly class of the capital and reinforced by
							half-starving men who had drifted to Paris on account of the famine which prevailed in
							the provinces. In order to prevent attacks on individuals and the sacking of shops, a
							"national guard" was organized, made up of volunteers from the well-to-do citizens.
							General Lafayette, one of the most liberal-minded of the nobles, was put in command.
							This deprived the king of every excuse for calling in his regular troops to insure
							order in Paris, and put the military power into the hands of the <hi rend="i"
								>bourgeoisie,</hi> as the French call the class made up of the more prosperous
							business men.</p>

						<note rend="right">Establishment of <hi rend="i">communes</hi> in Paris and other
							cities</note>

						<p>The government of Paris was reorganized, and a mayor, chosen from among the members
							of the National Assembly, was put at the head of the new <hi rend="i">commune,</hi> as
							the municipal government was called. The other cities of France also began with one
							accord, after the dismissal of Necker and the fall of the Bastille, to promote the
							Revolution by displacing or supplementing their former governments by committees of
							their citizens. These improvised communes, or city governments, established national
							guards, as Paris had done, and thus maintained order. The news that the king had
							approved the changes at Paris confirmed the citizens of other cities in the conviction
							that they had done right in taking the control into their own hands. We shall hear a
							good deal of the commune, or municipal government, of Paris later, as it played a very
							important rÃ´le in the Reign of Terror.</p>

						<note rend="right">Disorder in the country districts</note>

						<p>By the end of the month of July the commotion reached the country districts. A
							curious panic swept over the land, which the peasants long remembered as "the great
							fear." A mysterious rumor arose that the "brigands" were coming! The terrified people
							did what they could to prepare for the danger, although they had no clear idea of what
							it was; neighboring communities combined with one another for mutual protection. When
							the panic was over and people saw that there were no brigands after all, they turned
							their attention to an enemy by no means imaginary, i.e. the old rÃ©gime. The peasants
							assembled on the village common, or in the parish church, and voted to pay the feudal
							dues no longer. The next step was to burn the <hi rend="i">chÃ¢teaux,</hi> or castles
							of the nobles, in order to destroy the records of the peasants' obligations to their
							feudal lords.</p>

						<note rend="right">Night of August 4-5</note>

						<p>About the 1st of August news reached the National Assembly of the burning of <hi

							of the country people to pay the tithes, taxes, rents, and feudal dues. It seemed
							absolutely necessary to pacify and encourage the people by announcing sweeping
							reforms. Consequently during the celebrated night session of August 4-5, amid great
							excitement, the members of the privileged orders, led by the viscount of Noailles, a
							relative of Lafayette who had fought with him in America, vied with one another in

							without distinction of birth, are eligible to any office or dignity." Moreover,
							inasmuch as a national constitution would be of more advantage to the provinces than
							the privileges which some of these enjoyed, and-- so the decree continues-- "inasmuch
							as the surrender of such privileges is essential to the intimate union of all parts of
							the realm, it is decreed that all the peculiar privileges, pecuniary or otherwise, of
							the provinces, principalities, districts, cantons, cities, and communes, are once for

						<note rend="right">Unification of France through the abolition of the ancient provinces
							and the creation of the present departments</note>

						<p>This decree thus proclaimed the equality and uniformity for which the French people
							had so long sighed. The injustice of the former system of taxation could never be
							reintroduced. All France was to have the same laws, and its citizens were henceforth
							to be treated in the same way by the State, whether they lived in Brittany or
							Dauphiny, in the Pyrenees or on the Rhine. A few months later the Assembly went a step
							farther in consolidating and unifying France. It wiped out the old provinces
							altogether by dividing the whole country into districts of convenient size, called <hi
								rend="i">dÃ©partements.</hi> These were much more numerous than the ancient
							divisions, and were named after rivers and mountains. This obliterated from the map
							all reminiscences of the feudal disunion.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Declaration of the Rights of Man</note>

						<p>Many of the <hi rend="i">cahiers</hi> had suggested that the Estates should draw up a
							clear statement of the rights of the individual citizen. It was urged that the
							recurrence of abuses and the insidious encroachments of despotism might in this way be
							forever prevented. The National Assembly consequently determined <note id="note_064"
									><ref target="ref_064" rend="super">1</ref> This edict is given in the <hi
									rend="i">Readings,</hi> sect. 35. The nobles were to be indemnified for some of
								the important but less offensive of the feudal dues.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-145" n="123"/> to prepare such a declaration in order to gratify and
							reassure the people and to form a basis for the new constitution.</p>

						<p>This Declaration of the Rights of Man (completed August 26) is one of the most
							notable documents in the history of Europe. It not only aroused general enthusiasm
							when it was first published, but it appeared over and over again, in a modified form,
							in the succeeding French constitutions down to 1848, and has been the model for
							similar declarations in many of the other continental states. It was a dignified
							repudiation of the abuses described in the preceding chapter. Behind each article
							there was some crying evil of long standing against which the people wished to be
							forever protected,-- <hi rend="i">lettres de cachet,</hi> religious persecution,
							censorship of the press, and despotism in general.</p>

						<note rend="right">Contents of the Declaration</note>

						<p>The Declaration sets forth that "Men are born and remain equal in rights. Social
							distinctions can only be founded upon the general good." "Law is the expression of the
							general will. Every citizen has a right to participate, personally or through his
							representative, in its formation. It must be the same for all." "No person shall be
							accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the cases and according to the forms
							prescribed by law." "No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including
							his religious views, provided that their manifestation does not disturb the public
							order established by law." "The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the
							most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and
							print with freedom, being responsible, however, for such abuses of this freedom as
							shall be defined by law." "All citizens have a right to decide, either personally or
							by their representative, as to the necessity of the contribution to the public
							treasury, to grant this freely, to know to what uses it is put, and to fix the
							proportion, the mode of assessment and of collection, and the duration of the taxes."
							"Society has the right to require of every public agent an account of his
							administration." Well might the Assembly claim, <pb id="VAB8216-146" n="124"/> in its
							address to the people, that "the rights of man had been misconceived and insulted for
							centuries," and boast that they were "reÃ«stablished for all humanity in this
							declaration, which shall serve as an everlasting war cry against oppressors."</p>

						<note rend="right">The court party once more plans a counter-revolution</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">21.</hi> The king hesitated to ratify the Declaration of the Rights of
							Man, and about the first of October rumors became current that, under the influence of
							the courtiers, he was calling together troops and preparing for another attempt to put
							an end to the Revolution, similar to that which the attack on the Bastille had
							frustrated. A regiment arrived from Flanders and was entertained at a banquet given by
							the king's guard at Versailles. The queen was present, and it was reported in Paris
							that the officers, in their enthusiasm for her, had trampled under foot the new
							national colors,-- the red, white, and blue,-- which had been adopted after the fall
							of the Bastille. These things, along with the scarcity of food due to the poor crops
							of the year, aroused the excitable Paris populace to fever heat.</p>

						<note rend="right">A Paris mob invades the king's palace and carries him off to
							Paris</note>

						<p>On October 5 several thousand women and a number of armed men marched out to
							Versailles to ask bread of the king, in whom they had great confidence personally,
							however suspicious they might be of his friends and advisers. Lafayette marched after
							the crowd with the national guard, but did not prevent some of the people from
							invading the king's palace the next morning and nearly murdering the queen, who had
							become very unpopular. She was believed to be still an Austrian at heart and to be in
							league with the counter-revolutionary party.</p>

						<p>The people declared that the king must accompany them to Paris, and he was obliged to
							consent. Far from being disloyal, they assumed that the presence of the royal family
							would insure plenty and prosperity. So they gayly escorted the "baker and the baker's
							wife and the baker's boy," as they jocularly termed <pb id="VAB8216-147" n="125"/> the
							king and queen and the little dauphin, to the Palace of the Tuileries, where the king
							took up his residence, practically a prisoner, as it proved. The National Assembly
							soon followed him and resumed its sittings in a riding school near the Tuileries.</p>

						<note rend="right">Disastrous results of transferring the king and the Assembly of
							Paris</note>

						<p>This transfer of the king and the Assembly to the capital was the first great
							misfortune of the Revolution. The work of reform was by no means completed, and now
							the disorderly element of Paris could at any time invade the galleries and interrupt
							those deputies who proposed measures that did not meet with their approval. Marat's
							newspaper, <hi rend="i">The Friend of the People</hi>, assured the poor of the city
							that they were the real " patriots." Before long they came to hate the well-to-do
							middle class (the <hi rend="i">bourgeoisie</hi>) almost as heartily as they hated the
							nobles, and were ready to follow any leader who talked to them about "liberty" and
							vaguely denounced "traitors." Under these circumstances the populace might at any time
							get control of Paris, and Paris of the National Assembly. And so it fell out, as we
							shall see.</p>

						<note rend="right">Mirabeau advises the king to leave Paris and call the Assembly to
							him</note>

						<p>No one was more impressed by the danger than Mirabeau, whose keen insight cannot fail
							to fill every student of the French Revolution with admiration. After the transfer of
							the royal family to Paris, Mirabeau became a sort of official adviser to the king,
							who, however, never acted upon the advice, for both he and the queen abhorred the
							great orator and statesman on account of his views and his immorality. So it did no
							good when Mirabeau pointed out to Louis that both he and the Assembly were really
							prisoners in Paris, which was constantly subject to the most serious disturbances.
							"Its inhabitants when excited are irresistible. Winter is approaching and food may be
							wanting. Bankruptcy may be declared. What will Paris be three months hence?--
							assuredly a poorhouse, perhaps a theater of horrors. Is it to such a place that the
							head of the nation should intrust his existence and our only hope?" The king, he
							urged, should openly retire to Rouen <pb id="VAB8216-148" n="126"/> and summon the
							Assembly to him there, where reforms could be completed without interruption or
							coercion. Above all things, the king must not go eastward, else he would be suspected
							of joining the runaway nobles who were hanging about the boundaries. Yet, as we shall
							see, when the king finally decided to escape from Paris eighteen months later this was
							precisely what he did.</p>

						<note rend="right">The new constitution</note>

						<p>But for some time there was no considerable disorder. The deputies worked away on the
							constitution, and on February 4, 1790, the king visited the National Assembly and
							solemnly pledged himself and the queen to accept the new form of government. This
							provided that the sovereign should rule both by the grace of God and by the
							constitutional law of the State, but the nation was to be superior to the law and the
							law to the king. The king was to be the chief executive and to be permitted to veto
							bills passed by the Assembly, unless they were passed by three successive Assemblies,
							in which case they would become law without his ratification. This was called the
							suspensive veto and was supposed to be modeled upon that granted to the President of
							the United States.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Legislative Assembly established by the new constitution</note>

						<p>The constitution naturally provided that the laws should be made and the taxes
							granted by a representative body that should meet regularly. This was to consist, like
							the National Assembly, of one house, instead of two like the English Parliament. Many
							had favored the system of two houses, but the nobility and clergy, who would have
							composed the upper house on the English analogy, were still viewed with suspicion as
							likely to wish to restore the privileges of which they had just been deprived. Only
							those citizens who paid a tax equal to three days' labor were permitted to vote for
							deputies to the Legislative Assembly. The poorer people had, consequently, no voice in
							the government in spite of the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which assured equal
							rights to all. This and other restrictions tended to keep the power in the hands of
							the middle class.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-149" n="127"/>

						<note rend="right">The Assembly reforms the Church</note>
						<note rend="right">Unjust division of the revenue of the Church</note>

						<p>Of the other reforms of the National Assembly, the most important related to the
							Church, which, as has been explained, continued up to the time of the Revolution to be
							very rich and powerful, and to retain many of its mediaeval prerogatives and
							privileges. Its higher officials, the bishops and abbots, received very large revenues
							and often one prelate held a number of rich benefices, the duties of which he utterly
							neglected while he amused himself at Versailles. The parish priests, on the other
							hand, who really performed the manifold and important functions of the Church, were
							scarcely able to live on their incomes. This unjust apportionment of the vast revenue
							of the Church naturally suggested the idea that, if the State confiscated the
							ecclesiastical possessions, it could see that those who did the work were properly
							paid for it, and might, at the same time, secure a handsome sum which would help the
							government out of its financial troubles. Those who sympathized with Voltaire's views
							were naturally delighted to see their old enemy deprived of its independence and made
							subservient to the State, and even many good Catholics hoped that the new system would
							be an improvement upon the old.</p>

						<note rend="right">The National Assembly declares the property of the Church to be at
							the disposal of the nation</note>

						<p>The tithes had been abolished in August along with the feudal dues. This deprived the
							Church of perhaps thirty million dollars a year. On November 2, 1789, a decree was
							passed providing that "All the ecclesiastical possessions are at the disposal of the
							nation on condition that it provides properly for the expenses of maintaining
							religious services, for the support of those who conduct them, and for the succor of
							the poor." This decree deprived the bishops and priests of their benefices and made
							them dependent on salaries paid by the State. The monasteries and convents were also,
							when called upon, to give up their property to meet the needs of the State.<ref
								id="ref_065" rend="super" target="note_065">1</ref></p>

						<note id="note_065"><ref target="ref_065" rend="super">1</ref> The mediÃ¦val monastic
							orders, feeble and often degenerate, still continued to exist in France at the opening
							of the Revolution,-- Benedictines, Carthusians, Cistercians, Franciscans, Dominicans.
							The State still recognized the solemn vows of poverty taken by the monks and viewed
							them as incapable of holding any property or receiving any bequests. It also regarded
							it as its duty to arrest a runaway monk and restore him to his monastery. The National
							Assembly, shortly after declaring the property of the monasteries at the disposal of
							the nation, refused (February 13, 1790) longer legally to recognize perpetual monastic
							vows, and abolished all the orders which required them. The monks and nuns were to be
							free to leave their monasteries and were, in that case, to receive a pension from the
							government of from seven hundred to twelve hundred francs. Those, however, who
							preferred to remain were to be grouped in such houses as the government assigned them.
							In a year or so a good many of the monks appear to have deserted their old life, but
							very few of the nuns. Those who remained were naturally the most conservative of all;
							they opposed the Revolution and sided with the nonjuring clergy. This made them very
							unpopular with the Legislative Assembly, which in August, 1792, ordered all the
							monasteries to be vacated and turned over to the government for its use. At the same
							time it abolished all the other religious communities and associations, like the
							Oratorians and the Sisters of Charity, which, without requiring any solemn vows, had
							devoted themselves to teaching or charitable works. Many of these religious <hi
								rend="i">congregations,</hi> as the French call them, were revived in the nineteenth
							century and have been the cause of a good deal of agitation. See below, sect.
							62.</note>

						<pb id="VAB8216-150" n="128"/>

						<note rend="right">The <hi rend="i">assignats,</hi> or paper currency</note>

						<p>The National Assembly a little later ordered inventories to be made of the lands and
							buildings and various sources of revenue which the bishops, priests, and monks had so
							long enjoyed, and then the Church property was offered for sale. Meanwhile, in order
							to supply an empty treasury, the Assembly determined to issue a paper currency for
							which the newly acquired lands would serve as security. Of these <hi rend="i"
								>assignats,</hi> as this paper money was called, we hear a great deal during the
							revolutionary period. They soon began to depreciate, and ultimately a great part of
							the forty billions of francs issued during the next seven years was repudiated.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Civil Constitution of the Clergy, completed July 1, 1790</note>

						<p>After depriving the Church of its property, the Assembly deemed it necessary to
							completely reorganize it, and drew up the so-called Civil Constitution of the Clergy.
							The one hundred and thirty-four ancient bishoprics, some of which dated back to the
							Roman Empire, were reduced to eighty-three, so as to correspond with the new
							"departments" into which France had just been divided. Each of these became the
							diocese of a bishop, who was no longer to be appointed by the king and confirmed by
							the Pope<ref id="ref_066" rend="super" target="note_066">1</ref> but was looked upon
							as a government <note id="note_066"><ref target="ref_066" rend="super">1</ref> The
								decrees abolishing the feudal system (August 11, 1789) had already prohibited all
								remittances to the Pope in the shape of <hi rend="i">annates</hi> or other payments.
								The bishoprics were grouped into ten districts, each presided over by a
								"metropolitan," who corresponded to the former archbishop.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-151" n="129"/> official, to be elected, like other government
							officials, by the people, and paid a regular salary. The priests, too, were to be
							chosen by the people instead, as formerly, by the bishop or lord of the manor; and
							their salaries were to be substantially increased. In Paris they were to have six
							thousand francs, in smaller places less, but never an amount below twelve hundred
							francs; even in the smallest villages they received over twice the minimum paid under
							the old regime. Lastly, it was provided that clergymen, upon accepting office, must
							all take an oath, like other government officials, to be faithful to the nation, the
							law, and the king, and to "maintain with all their might the constitution decreed by
							the Assembly."<ref id="ref_067" rend="super" target="note_067">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Opposition aroused by the Civil Constitution</note>

						<p>The Civil Constitution of the Clergy proved a serious mistake. While the
							half-feudalized Church had sadly needed reform, the worst abuses might have been
							remedied without overturning the whole system, which was hallowed in the minds of most
							of the French people by age and religious veneration. The arbitrary suppression of
							fifty-one bishoprics, the election of the bishops by the ordinary voters, who included
							Protestants, Jews, and unbelievers, the neglect of the Pope's rights,-- all shocked
							and alienated thousands of those who had hitherto enthusiastically applauded the
							reforms which the Assembly had effected. The king gave his assent to the Civil
							Constitution, but with the fearful apprehension that he might be losing his soul by so
							doing. From that time on he became an enemy of the Revolution on religious
							grounds.</p>

						<note rend="right">Oath to the Constitution required of the clergy</note>

						<p>The bishops, with very few exceptions, opposed the changes and did all they could to
							prevent the reforms from being carried out. Accordingly (November 27, 1790) the
							irritated Assembly ordered all the bishops and priests to take the oath to the
							Constitution (which, of course, included the new laws in regard to the Church) within
							a week. Those who refused were to be regarded as having resigned; and if any of them

								Civil Constitution of the Clergy, see the <hi rend="i">Readings,</hi> sect.
								36.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-152" n="130"/> still continued to perform their functions they were to
							be treated as "disturbers of the peace."</p>

						<note rend="right">The "nonjuring" clergy become the enemies of the Revolution</note>

						<p>Only four of the bishops consented to take the required oath and but a third of the
							lower clergy, although they were much better off under the new system. Forty-six
							thousand parish priests refused to sacrifice their religious scruples. Before long the
							Pope condemned the Civil Constitution and forbade the clergy to take the oath. As time
							went on the "nonjuring" clergy were dealt with more and more harshly by the
							government, and the way was prepared for the horrors of the Reign of Terror. The
							Revolution ceased to stand for liberty, order, and the abolition of ancient abuses,
							and came to mean -in the minds of many besides those who had lost their former
							privileges-- irreligion, violence, and a new kind of oppression more cruel than the
							old.</p>

						<note rend="right">Celebration of the fall of the Bastille</note>

						<p>A year after the fall of the Bastille a great festival was held in Paris to celebrate
							the glorious anniversary which has been commemorated on the 14th of July ever since.
							Delegates were sent to Paris from all parts of France to express the sympathy of the
							country at large. This occasion made a deep impression upon all, as well it might. It
							was more than a year later, however, before the National Assembly at last finished its
							work and dissolved, to give place to the Legislative Assembly for which the
							constitution provided.</p>

						<note rend="right">The extraordinary achievements of the National Assembly</note>

						<p>It was little more than two years that the National Assembly had been engaged upon
							its tremendous task of modernizing France. No body of men has ever accomplished so
							much in so short a period. The English Parliament, during an existence of five hundred
							years, had done far less to reform England; and no monarch, with the possible
							exception of the unhappy Joseph II, has ever even attempted to make such deep and
							far-reaching changes as were permanently accomplished by the first French
							Assembly.</p>

						<note rend="right">The hostility aroused by the policy of the Assembly</note>

						<p>Despite the marvelous success of the Assembly, as measured by the multiplicity and
							the decisiveness of its reforms, it had <pb id="VAB8216-153" n="131"/> made many and
							dangerous enemies. The king and queen and the courtiers were in correspondence with
							the king of Prussia and the Emperor, with a hope of inducing them to intervene to
							check the Revolution. The runaway nobles were ready to call in foreign forces to
							restore, the old system, and many of the clergy now regarded the Revolution as hostile
							to religion. Moreover the populace in Paris and in other large towns had been aroused
							against the Assembly by their radical leaders, their newspapers, and the political
							clubs. They felt that the deputies had worked only for the prosperous classes and had
							done little for the poor people, who should have been supplied with bread and allowed
							to vote. They were irritated also by the national guard commanded by that ex-noble,
							the marquis of Lafayette, who looked altogether too fine on his white horse. The
							members of the guard, too, were well dressed and only too ready to fire on the
							"patriots" if they dared to make a demonstration. Altogether it is easy to see that
							there was trouble ahead. The Revolution had gone much too far for some and not far
							enough for others.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">22.</hi> We have now studied the progress and nature of the revolution
							which destroyed the old regime and created modern France. Through it the unjust
							privileges, the perplexing irregularities, and the local differences were abolished,
							and the people admitted to a share in the government. This vast reform had been
							accomplished without serious disturbance and, with the exception of some of the
							changes in the Church, it had been welcomed with enthusiasm by the French nation.</p>

						<note rend="right">The second revolution</note>

						<p>This permanent, peaceful revolution, or reformation, was followed by a second,
							violent revolution, which for a time destroyed the French monarchy. It also introduced
							a series of further changes, many of which were fantastic and unnecessary and could
							not endure, since they were approved by only a few fanatical leaders. France,
							moreover, became involved in a war with most of the powers of western Europe. The
							weakness of her government, which permitted the forces of disorder and fanaticism to
							prevail, combined with the imminent danger of an invasion by the united powers of
							Europe, produced the Reign of Terror. After a period of national excitement and
							partial anarchy, France gladly accepted the rule of one of her military commanders,
							who was to prove himself far more despotic than her former kings had been. This
							general, Napoleon Bonaparte, did not, however, undo the great work of 1789; his
							colossal ambition was, on the contrary, the means of extending, directly or
							indirectly, many of the benefits of the Revolution to other parts of western Europe.
							When, after Napoleon's fall, the elder <pb id="VAB8216-156" n="134"/> brother of Louis
							XVI came to the throne, the first thing that he did was solemnly to assure the people
							that all the great gains of the first revolution should be maintained.</p>

						<note rend="right">The emigration of the nobles</note>

						<p>While practically the whole of the nation heartily rejoiced in the earlier reforms
							introduced by the National Assembly, and celebrated the general satisfaction and
							harmony by that great national festival held in Paris on the first anniversary of the
							fall of the Bastille, of which mention has been made,<ref id="ref_068" rend="super"
								target="note_068">1</ref> some of the higher nobility refused to remain in France.
							The count of Artois (the king's younger brother), Calonne, the prince of CondÃ©, and
							others, set the example by leaving the country just after the events of July 14, 1789.
							They were followed by others who were terrified or disgusted by the burning of the <hi
								rend="i">chÃ¢teaux</hi>, the loss of their privileges, and the injudicious abolition
							of hereditary nobility by the National Assembly in June, 1790. Before long these
							emigrant nobles (<hi rend="i">Ã©migrÃ©s</hi>), among whom were many military officers
							like CondÃ©, organized a little army across the Rhine, and the count of Artois began to
							plan an invasion of France. He was ready to ally himself with Austria, Prussia, or any
							other foreign government which he could induce to help undo the Revolution and give
							back to the French king his former absolute power, and to the nobles their old
							privileges.</p>

						<p>The threats and insolence of the emigrant nobles and their shameful negotiations with

							The people suspected that the plans of the runaways met with the secret approval of
							the king, and more especially of the queen, whose brother, Leopold II, was now
							Emperor, and ruler of the Austrian dominions. This, added to the opposition of the

						<note rend="right">Mirabeau fails to strengthen the monarchy, and dies, April,
							1791</note>

						<p>Had the king been willing to follow the advice of Mirabeau, the tragedy of the
							approaching Reign of Terror might probably have been avoided. France needed a strong
							king who would adjust himself to the new constitution, guide the Assembly, maintain
							order in Paris and the other great cities, and, above all, avoid any suspicion of
							wishing for a restoration of the old regime. Mirabeau saw clearly that the welfare of
							France at this juncture depended upon strengthening the monarchy. His efforts to
							forward this end were, however, unavailing. The fact that he accepted money from the
							king for advice roused the natural suspicions of the radical members of the Assembly
							and he was denounced as a traitor. On the other hand, he never really enjoyed the
							confidence of Louis XVI, who, like the queen, heartily detested him. He died April 2,
							1791, at the age of forty-three, worn out by a life of dissipation, and the king was
							thus left with no one to hold him back from destruction.</p>

						<note rend="right">The flight to Varennes (June 21, 1791)</note>

						<p>The worst fears of the people seemed to be justified by the secret flight of the
							royal family from Paris, in June, 1791. Ever since the king had reluctantly signed the
							Civil Constitution of the Clergy, flight had seemed to him his only resource. A body
							of regular troops was collected on the northeastern boundary ready to receive and
							protect him. If he could escape and join them at MontmÃ©dy, which was just on the
							frontier, about a hundred and seventy miles from Paris, he hoped that, aided by a
							demonstration on the part of the queen's brother, Leopold, he might march back and
							check the further progress of the revolutionary movement. He had, it is true, no
							liking for the emigrants and disapproved of their policy, nor did he believe that the
							old regime could ever be restored. But, unfortunately, his plans led him to attempt to
							reach the boundary just at the point where the emigrants were collected, viz. at
							Coblenz and Worms. He and the queen were, however, arrested at Varennes, when within
							twenty-five miles of their destination, and speedily brought back to Paris.</p>

						<note rend="right">Effect of the king's flight</note>

						<p>The desertion of the king appears to have terrified rather than angered the nation.
							The consternation of the people at the thought of losing, and their relief at
							regaining, a poor weak ruler like Louis XVI clearly shows that France was still
							profoundly royalist in its sympathies. The National Assembly pretended that the king
							had not fled but had been carried off. This gratified France at large; in Paris,
							however, there were some who advocated the deposition of the king, on the ground that
							he was clearly a traitor. Indeed, for the first time a <hi rend="i">republican</hi>
							party, small as yet, made its appearance, which urged the complete abolition of the
							monarchical form of government and the substitution of a democracy.</p>

						<note rend="right">The leaders of the new republican party</note>

						<p>Of those who had lost confidence in the king and in the monarchy, the most prominent
							was Dr. Marat, a physician and scholar, who before the Revolution had published
							several scientific works, but was now conducting the very violent newspaper already
							quoted, <hi rend="i">The Friend of the People</hi>. In this he denounced in the most
							extravagant language both the "aristocrats" and the "bourgeoisie,"-- for by "the
							people" he meant the great mass of workingmen in the towns and the peasants in the
							fields. Then there was the gentle and witty Camille Desmoulins, who had made the
							famous address in the Palais Royal on the 12th of July, 1789, which roused the
							populace to defend themselves against the plots of the courtiers. He too edited a
							newspaper and was a leader in the radical club called the <hi rend="i"
								>Cordeliers.</hi><ref id="ref_069" rend="super" target="note_069">1</ref> Lastly
							Desmoulins's good friend Danton, with his coarse, strong face, his big voice, and his
							fiery eloquence, was becoming a sort of Mirabeau of the masses. He had much good sense
							and was not so virulent in his language as Marat, but his superabundant vitality led
							him to condone violence and cruelty in carrying on the Revolution and destroying its
							enemies.</p>

						<note id="note_069"><ref target="ref_069" rend="super">1</ref> So named after the
							monastery where the club held its meetings. The monks had belonged to the order of St.

						<note rend="right">Massacre of the Champ de Mars (July 17, 1791)</note>

						<p>Under the influence of these men a petition was drawn up demanding that the Assembly
							should regard the king as having abdicated by his flight, and that a new convention
							should be called to draw up a better constitution. On July 17 this petition was taken
							to the Champ de Mars (a great open space used for military maneuvers, where the
							festival had been held during the previous July), and here the people of Paris were
							called together to sign it. The mayor of Paris disapproved of the affair and decided
							to disperse the people. He marched out with Lafayette and the national guard and
							ordered the petitioners to go home. Unhappily the crowd did not take the warnings of
							the mayor seriously; some stones were thrown at the troops, who were thereupon ordered
							to fire, and a number of men, women, and children were killed. This unfortunate and
							quite needless "Massacre of the Champ de Mars" served to weaken the monarchy still
							farther. It was not forgotten, although the king remained on the throne for a year
							longer, and Marat, Danton, and Desmoulins were intimidated and thought it prudent to
							remain in hiding for a time.</p>

						<note rend="right">The National Assembly gives way to the Legislative Assembly
							(September, 1791)</note>

						<p>It was in the following September that the National Assembly at last put the
							finishing touches on the constitution which had occupied them for more than two years.
							The king swore to obey it faithfully, and a general amnesty was proclaimed so that all
							the discord and suspicion of the past few months might be forgotten. The Assembly then
							broke up and gave way to the regular congress provided for by the new constitution,--
							the Legislative Assembly,-- which held its first meeting October 1, 1791.</p>

						<note rend="right">Sources of danger at the opening of the Legislative Assembly,
							October, 1791</note>

						<p>In spite of the great achievements of the National Assembly it left France in a
							critical situation. Besides the emigrant nobles abroad there were the nonjuring clergy
							at home, and a king who was treacherously corresponding with foreign powers in the
							hope of securing their aid. When the news of the capture of the king and queen at
							Varennes reached the ears of Marie Antoinette's brother, Leopold II, he declared that
							the <pb id="VAB8216-160" n="137"/> violent arrest of the king sealed with unlawfulness
							all that had been done in France and "compromised directly the honor of all the
							sovereigns and the security of every government." He therefore proposed to the rulers
							of Russia, England, Prussia, Spain, Naples, and Sardinia that they should come to some
							understanding between themselves as to how they might "reÃ«stablish the liberty and
							honor of the most Christian king and his family, and place a check upon the dangerous
							excesses of the French Revolution, the fatal example of which it behooves every
							government to repress."</p>

						<note rend="right">The Declaration of Pillnitz, August 27, 1791</note>

						<p>On August 27 Leopold, in conjunction with the king of Prussia, had issued the famous
							Declaration of Pillnitz. In this the two sovereigns state that, in accordance with the
							wishes of the king's brothers (the leaders of the emigrant nobles), they are ready to
							join the other European rulers in an attempt to place the king of France in a position
							to establish a form of government "that shall be once more in harmony with the rights
							of sovereigns and shall promote the welfare of the French nation." They agreed in the
							meantime to prepare their troops for active service.</p>

						<note rend="right">Effect of the Declaration</note>

						<p>The Declaration was little more than an empty threat; but it seemed to the French
							people a sufficient proof that the monarchs were ready to help the seditious French
							nobles to reÃ«stablish the old rÃ©gime against the wishes of the nation and at the cost
							of infinite bloodshed. The idea of foreign rulers intermeddling with their internal
							affairs would in itself have been intolerable to a proud people like the French, even
							if the new reforms had not been endangered. Had it been the object of the allied
							monarchs to hasten instead of to prevent the deposition of Louis XVI, they could
							hardly have chosen a more efficient means than the Declaration of Pillnitz.</p>

						<note rend="right">The newspapers</note>
						<p>Political excitement and enthusiasm for the Revolution were kept up by the newspapers
							which had been established, especially in Paris, since the convening of the Estates
							General. Except in England there had been no daily newspapers before <pb
								id="VAB8216-161" n="139"/> the French Revolution, and those journals that were
							issued weekly or at longer intervals had little to say of politics,-- commonly a
							dangerous subject on the Continent. But after 1789 the public did not need longer to
							rely upon an occasional pamphlet, as was the case earlier. Many journals of the most
							divergent kinds and representing the most various opinions were published. Some, like
							the notorious <hi rend="i">Friend of the People</hi>, were no more than a periodical
							editorial written by one man. Others, like the famous <hi rend="i">Moniteur</hi>, were
							much like our papers of to-day and contained news, both foreign and domestic, reports
							of the debates in the assembly and the text of its decrees, announcements of theaters,
							etc. The royalists had their organ called <hi rend="i">The Acts of the Apostles</hi>,
							witty and irreverent as the court party itself. Some of the papers were illustrated,
							and the representations of contemporaneous events, especially the numerous
							caricatures, are highly diverting.<ref id="ref_070" rend="super" target="note_070"
								>1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">The Jacobians</note>

						<p>Of the numerous political clubs, by far the most famous was that of the <hi rend="i"
								>Jacobins</hi>. When the Assembly moved into Paris some of the provincial
							representatives of the third estate rented a large room in the monastery of the
							Jacobin monks, not far from the building where the National Assembly itself met. A
							hundred deputies perhaps were present at the first meeting. The next day the number
							had doubled. The aim of this society was to discuss questions which were about to come
							before the National Assembly. The club decided at its meetings what should be the
							policy of its members and how they should vote; and in this way they successfully
							combined to counteract the schemes of the aristocratic party in the Assembly. The club
							rapidly grew, and soon admitted to its sessions some who were not deputies. In
							October, 1791, it decided to permit the public to attend its discussions.</p>

						<note id="note_070"><ref target="ref_070" rend="super">1</ref> For example, in one of
							the caricatures, the formerly despotic king is represented as safely confined by the
							National Assembly in a huge parrot cage. When asked by his brother-in-law, Leopold II,
							what he is about, Louis XVI replies, "I am signing my name,"-- that is, he had nothing
							to do except meekly to ratify the measures which the Assembly chose to pass.</note>

						<pb id="VAB8216-162" n="140"/>

						<p>Gradually similar societies were formed in the provinces.<ref id="ref_071"
								rend="super" target="note_071">1</ref> These affiliated themselves with the "mother"
							society at Paris and kept in constant communication with it. In this way the Jacobins
							of Paris stimulated and controlled public opinion throughout France and kept the
							opponents of the old regime alert. When the Legislative Assembly met, the Jacobins had
							not as yet become republicans but they believed that the king should have hardly more
							power than the president of a republic. They were even ready to promote his deposition
							if he failed to stand by the Revolution.</p>

						<note rend="right">Parties in the Legislative Assembly</note>

						<p>The new Legislative Assembly was not well qualified to cope with the many
							difficulties which faced it. It was made up almost entirely of young and inexperienced
							men, for the National Assembly, on motion of the virtuous Robespierre, had passed a
							self-denying ordinance excluding all its members from election to the new body. The
							Jacobin clubs in the provinces had succeeded in securing the election of a good many
							of their candidates, sometimes by resorting to violence in order to defeat the more
							conservative candidates. Consequently the most active and powerful party in the
							Legislative Assembly was, on the whole, hostile to the king.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Girondists</note>

						<p>Many young and ardent lawyers had been elected, among whom the most prominent were
							from the department of the Gironde, in which the important city of Bordeaux was
							situated. They and their followers were called Girondists. They had much to say in
							their brilliant speeches of the glories of Sparta and of the Roman Republic; they too
							longed for a republic and inveighed against "tyrants." They applauded the eloquence of
							their chief orator, Vergniaud, and frequently assembled at the house of the ardent and
							fascinating Madame Roland to consider the regeneration of their beloved country. But
							in spite of their enthusiasm they were not statesmen and showed no skill in meeting
							the troublesome problems that kept arising.</p>

						<note id="note_071"><ref target="ref_071" rend="super">1</ref> By June, 1791, there were
							406 of these affiliated Jacobin clubs. See <hi rend="i">Readings</hi>, sect.

						<note rend="right">The emigrant nobles declared traitors</note>

						<p>The Assembly, not unnaturally, promptly turned its attention to the emigrant nobles.
							These had been joined by the king's elder brother, the count of Provence, who had
							managed to escape at the time that the royal family had been arrested at Varennes.
							Having succeeded in inducing the Emperor and the king of Prussia to issue the
							Declaration of Pillnitz, they continued to collect troops on the Rhine. The Assembly
							declared that "the Frenchmen assembled on the frontier" were under suspicion of
							conspiring against their country. The count of Provence was ordered to return within
							two months or forfeit any possible claim to the throne.<ref id="ref_072" rend="super"
								target="note_072">1</ref> Should the other <hi rend="i">Ã©migrÃ©s</hi> fail to return
							to France by January 1, 1792, they were to be regarded as convicted traitors, and

						<note rend="right">Harsh measures of the Assembly toward nonjuring clergy</note>

						<p>The harsh treatment of the emigrant nobles was perhaps justified by their desertion
							and treasonable intrigues; but the conduct of the Assembly toward the clergy was
							impolitic as well as cruel. Those who had refused to pledge themselves to support a
							system which was in conflict with their religious convictions and which had been
							condemned by the Pope were commanded to take the prescribed oath within a week, on
							penalty of losing their income from the State and being put under surveillance as
							"suspects." As this failed to bring the clergy to terms, the Assembly later (May,
							1792) ordered the deportation from the country of those who steadily persisted in
							their refusal to accept the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. In this way the Assembly
							aroused the active hostility of a great part of the most conscientious among the lower
							clergy, who had loyally supported the commons in their fight against the privileged
							orders. It also lost the confidence of the great mass of faithful Catholics,--
							merchants, artisans, and peasants,-- who had gladly accepted the abolition of the old
							abuses, but who would not consent to desert their priests at the bidding of the
							Assembly.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Legislative Assembly precipitates a war with Europe</note>

						<p>By far the most important act of the Legislative Assembly during the one year of its
							existence was its precipitation of a war between France and Austria.<ref id="ref_073"
								rend="super" target="note_073">1</ref> To many in the Assembly, including the

							was quite true<ref id="ref_074" rend="super" target="note_074">2</ref>-- that Louis
							was negotiating with foreign rulers and would be glad to have them intervene and
							reestablish him in his old despotic power. The Girondist deputies argued, therefore,
							that a war against the hated Austria would unite the sympathies of the nation and
							force the king to show his true character; for he would be obliged either to become
							the nation's leader or to show himself the traitor they believed him to be.</p>

						<note rend="right">France declares war on Austria (April 20, 1792)</note>

						<p>It was with a heavy heart that Louis XVI, urged on by the clamors of the Girondists,
							declared war upon Austria on April 20, 1792. Little did the ardent young lawyers of
							the Assembly surmise that this was the beginning of the most terrific and momentous
							series of wars that ever swept over Europe, involving, during twenty-three years of
							almost continuous conflict, every country and people from Ireland to Turkey, and from
							Norway to Naples. Although the Girondist leaders, Vergniaud, Brissot, Guadet, and
							their friend Madame Roland, were the first to be destroyed by the storm they had
							conjured up, could they have looked forward they would have been consoled to see that
							the tyrants they hated never permanently regained their old power; that the long wars
							served to bring the principles of the French Revolution home to all the European
							peoples, everywhere slowly but surely destroyed the old regime, and gave to the people
							the liberty and the control of the government which the Girondists had so hotly
							defended.</p>

						<note rend="right">The French fall in their first attack on the Austrian
							Netherlands</note>

						<p>The French army was in no condition for war. The officers, who, according to the law,
							were all nobles, had many of them deserted and joined the <hi rend="i">Ã©migrÃ©s</hi>.
							The regular troops were consequently demoralized, and the new national guard had not
							yet lands been employed except to maintain order in the towns. Naturally Dumouriez,
							the Girondist minister of war, first turned his attention to the Austrian Netherlands,
							which promised to be an easy conquest. The reforms of Joseph II and his attempt to
							make the Netherlands an integral part of the Austrian state had roused a revolt in
							1789. It is true that when Leopold II came to the throne and undid his brother's rash
							changes, all resistance had subsided. Still there was a strong party in the
							Netherlands which greeted the French Revolution with enthusiasm, and Dumouriez had
							good reason to think that the attempts made a century before by Louis XIV to add that
							region to France might at last be successful. But the raw troops that he collected for
							the invasion of Belgium ran away as soon as they caught sight of Austrian cavalry. The
							emigrant nobles rejoiced, and Europe concluded that the "patriots" were made of poor
							stuff.</p>

						<note rend="right">The king vetoes two measures of the Legislative Assembly and
							dismisses his Girondist ministers (May-June 1792)</note>

						<p>Meanwhile matters were going badly for the king of France. The Assembly had passed
							two bills, one ordering those priests who refused to take the oath to the constitution
							to leave the country within a month; the other directing the formation, just without
							the walls of Paris, of a camp of twenty thousand volunteers from various parts of
							France as a protection to the capital. The king resolved, for very good reasons, to
							veto both of these measures and to dismiss his Girondist ministry, with the exception
							of Dumouriez, his really able minister of war, who immediately resigned.</p>

						<note rend="right">Rising of June 20, 1792</note>

						<p>All this served to make the king far more unpopular than ever. The "Austrian woman"
							or "Madame Veto," as the queen was called, was rightly believed to be actively
							betraying France, and it is now known that she did send to Austria the plan of
							campaign which had been adopted before the war began. <pb id="VAB8216-166" n="144"/>
							On June 20 some of the lesser leaders of the Paris populace resolved to celebrate the
							anniversary of the Tennis-Court oath. They arranged a procession which was permitted
							to march through the Riding School where the Assembly sat.</p>

						<note rend="right">The <hi rend="i">sans-culottes</hi></note>

						<p>The ensigns of the mob were a calf's heart on the point of a pike, labeled "the heart
							of an aristocrat," and a pair of knee breeches representing the older costume of a
							gentleman, which was now going out of fashion since the Girondists, in order to
							exhibit their democratic sentiments, had adopted the long trousers which had hitherto
							been worn only by workingmen. To give up knee breeches and become a "sans-culotte," or
							breeches-less patriot, had come to be considered an unmistakable indication of love
							for the Revolution.</p>

						<note rend="right">Invasion of the Tuileries</note>

						<p>After visiting the Assembly, the crowd found their way into the neighboring palace of
							the Tuileries. They wandered through the beautiful apartments shouting, "Down with
							Monsieur Veto!" The king might have been killed by some ruffian had he not consented
							to drink to the health of the "nation"-- whose representatives were roughly crowding
							him into the recess of a window-- and put on a red "liberty cap," the badge of the
							"citizen patriots."</p>

						<note rend="right">Approach of the Prussian army</note>

						<p>This invasion of the Tuileries seemed to the European rulers a new and conclusive
							proof that the Revolution meant anarchy. Had not the populace of Paris treated the
							king of France as they might have disported themselves with a poor drunken fellow in
							the street? Prussia had immediately joined Austria when France declared war against
							the latter in April, and now the army which Frederick the Great had led to victory was
							moving, under his old general, the duke of Brunswick, toward the French boundary with
							a view of restoring Louis XVI to his former independent position.</p>

						<note rend="right">The country declared in danger (July 11, 1792)</note>

						<p>The Assembly now declared the country in danger. Every citizen, whether in town or
							country, was to report, under penalty of imprisonment, what arms or munitions he
							possessed. The national guards were to select from their ranks <pb id="VAB8216-167"
								n="145"/> those who could best join the active army. Every citizen was ordered to
							wear the tricolored cockade,-- the red, white, and blue of the Revolution. In this way
							the peasants, who had been accustomed to regard war as a matter of purely personal
							interest to kings, were given to understand that they were not now called upon to risk
							their lives, as formerly, because the Polish king had lost his throne, or because
							Maria Theresa had a grudge against Frederick the Great. Now, if they shed their blood,
							it would be to keep out of France two "tyrants" who proposed to force them to
							surrender the precious reforms of the past three years and restore to the hated
							runaway nobles their former privileges.</p>

						<note rend="right">The proclamation of the duke of Brunswick (July 25, 1792)</note>

						<p>As the allies approached the French frontier it became clearer and clearer that the
							king was utterly incapable of defending the country, even if he were willing to oppose
							the armies which claimed to be coming to his rescue and with which he was believed to
							be in league. France seemed almost compelled under the circumstances to rid herself of
							her traitorous and utterly incompetent ruler. The duke of Brunswick, who was in
							command of the Prussian army, sealed the king's fate by issuing a manifesto in the
							name of both the Emperor and the king of Prussia, in which he declared that the allies
							proposed to put an end to anarchy in France and restore the king to his rightful
							powers; that the inhabitants of France who dared to oppose the Austrian and Prussian
							troops "shall be punished immediately according to the most stringent laws of war, and
							their houses shall be burned." If Paris offered the least violence to king or queen,
							or again permitted the Tuileries to be invaded, the allies promised to "inflict an
							ever-to-be-remembered vengeance by delivering over the city of Paris to military
							execution and complete destruction."</p>

						<note rend="right">The volunteers of Marseilles and their war song</note>

						<p>The leaders in Paris now determined to force the Assembly to depose the king. Five

						<note rend="right">The Prussian army checked at Valmy</note>

						<p>Late in August the Prussians crossed the French boundary and on September z took the

							retreat without fighting a pitched battle. Notwithstanding the fear of the French,

							have driven out your tyrants. Show yourselves freemen and we will protect you from

						<note rend="right">Trial and execution of the king (January, 1793)</note>

						<p>Meanwhile the Convention was puzzled to determine what would best be done with the
							king. A considerable party felt that he was guilty of treason in secretly encouraging
							the foreign powers to come to his aid. He was therefore brought to trial, and when it
							came to a final vote he was, by a small majority, condemned to death. He mounted the
							scaffold on January 21, 1793, with the fortitude of a martyr. Nevertheless it cannot
							be denied that, through his earlier weakness and indecision, he brought untold misery

						<note rend="right">Pitt declares that England must oppose the Revolution</note>

						<p>On February 1 Pitt made a speech in the House of Commons in which he accused the

							affairs. They had seized the Netherlands and had declared the river Scheldt open to
							commerce although it had been closed by the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) in the
							interests of the Dutch ports. They had already occupied Savoy and now threatened
							Holland. They loudly proclaimed their intention to free all peoples from the dominion

							falling under the yoke of France.<ref id="ref_079" rend="super" target="note_079"

						<note rend="right">France declares war on England (February 1, 1793) and gives her

						<note rend="right">Second partition of Poland (1793)</note>

						<p>Catharine the Great abhorred the revolutionists, but she had contented herself with
							encouraging Austria and Prussia to fight for Louis XVI and the rights of monarchs in
							general, while she prepared to seize more than her share of Poland. Frederick William
							and the Emperor were well aware of her plans, and consequently felt that they must
							keep their eyes on her rather than move on Paris. This accounts, in a measure, for the
							ease with which the French had repulsed the allies and taken possession of the
							Austrian Netherlands in the autumn of 1792. It was in the following January that
							Prussia and Russia arranged the second partition of Poland. Austria, as has been
								explained,<ref id="ref_080" rend="super" target="note_080">1</ref> was treated very
							shabbily and forced to go without her share on the flimsy pretense that Frederick
							William and Catharine would use their good offices to induce the elector of Bavaria to
							exchange his possessions for the Austrian Netherlands,-- which were at that moment in
							the hands of Dumouriez's republican troops.</p>

						<note rend="right">French driven from the Netherlands; desertion of Dumouriez</note>

						<p>This adjustment of the differences between the allies gave a wholly new aspect to the
							war with France. When, in March, 1793, Spain and the Holy Roman Empire joined the
							coalition, France was at war with all her neighbors. The Austrians defeated Dumouriez
							at Neerwinden, March 18, and drove the French out of the Netherlands. Thereupon
							Dumouriez, disgusted by the failure of the Convention to support him and by their

							deserted to the enemy with a few hundred soldiers who consented to follow him.</p>

						<note rend="right">The allies consider a possible partition of France</note>

							of the French colonies. A Russian diplomat suggested that Spain and the king of
							Sardinia should also help themselves. "This done, let us all work in concert to give
							what remains of France a stable and permanent monarchical government. She will in this
							way become a second-rate power which will harm no one, and we shall get rid of this
							democratic firebrand which threatens to set Europe aflame."</p>

						<note rend="right">The French government put in the hands of the Committee of Public
							Safety, April, 1793</note>

						<p>The loss of the Netherlands and the treason of their best general made a deep
							impression upon the members of the put Convention. If the new French republic was to
							defend itself against the "tyrants" without and its many enemies within, it could not
							wait for the Convention to draw up an elaborate, permanent constitution. An efficient
							government must be devised immediately to maintain the loyalty of the nation to the
							republic, and to raise and equip armies and direct their commanders. The Convention
							accordingly put the government into the hands of a small committee, consisting
							originally of nine, later of twelve, of its members. This famous Committee of Public
							Safety was given practically unlimited powers. "We must," one of the leaders
							exclaimed, "establish the despotism of liberty in order to crush the despotism of
							kings."</p>

						<note rend="right">The Girondists</note>

						<p>Within the Convention itself there was dissension, especially between two groups of
							active men who came into bitter conflict over the policy to be pursued. There was,
							first, the party of the Girondists, led by Vergniaud, Brissot, and others. They were
							enthusiastic republicans and counted among their numbers some speakers of remarkable
							eloquence. The Girondists had enjoyed the control of the Legislative Assembly in 1792
							and had been active in bringing on the war with Austria and Prussia. They hoped in
							that way to complete the Revolution by exposing the bad faith of the king and his
							sympathy with the <pb id="VAB8216-179" n="154"/> emigrant nobles. They were not,
							however, men of sufficient decision to direct affairs in the terrible difficulties in
							which France found herself after the execution of the king. They consequently lost
							their influence, and a new party, called the "Mountain" from the high seats that they
							occupied in the Convention, gained the ascendency.</p>

						<note rend="right">The extreme republicans called the "Mountain"</note>

						<p>This was composed of the most vigorous and uncompromising republicans, like Danton,
							Robespierre, and Saint-Just, who had obtained control of the Jacobin clubs and were
							supported by the commune of Paris. They believed that the French people had been
							depraved by the slavery to which their kings had subjected them. Everything, they
							argued, which suggested the former rule of kings must be wiped out. A new France
							should be created, in which liberty, equality, and fraternity should take the place of
							the tyranny of princes, the insolence of nobles, and the impostures of the priests.
							The leaders of the Mountain held that the mass of the people were by nature good and
							upright, but that there were a number of adherents of the old system who would, if
							they could, undo the great work of the Revolution and lead the people back to slavery
							under king and Church. All who were suspected by the Mountain of having the least
							sympathy with the nobles or the persecuted priests were branded as
							"counter-revolutionary." The Mountain was willing to resort to any measures, however
							shocking, to rid the nation of those suspected of counter-revolutionary tendencies,
							and its leaders relied upon the populace of Paris to aid them in carrying out their
							designs.</p>

						<note rend="right">Girondist leaders expelled from the Convention, June 2, 1793</note>

						<p>The Girondists, on the other hand, abhorred the restless populace of Paris and the
							fanatics who composed the commune of the capital. They argued that Paris was not
							France, and that it had no right to assume a despotic rule over the nation. They
							proposed that the commune should be dissolved and that the Convention should remove to
							another town where they would not be subject to the intimidation of the Paris mob. The
							Mountain thereupon accused the Girondists of an attempt <pb id="VAB8216-180" n="155"/>
							to break up the republic, "one and indivisible," by questioning the supremacy of Paris
							and the duty of the provinces to follow the lead of the capital. The mob, thus
							encouraged, rose against the Girondists. On June 2 it surrounded the meeting place of
							the Convention, and deputies of the commune demanded the expulsion from the Convention
							of the Girondist leaders, who were placed under arrest.</p>

						<note rend="right">France threatened with civil war</note>

						<p>The conduct of the Mountain and its ally, the Paris commune, now began to arouse
							opposition in various parts of France, and the country was threatened with civil war
							at a time when it was absolutely necessary that all Frenchmen should combine in the
							loyal defense of their country against the invaders who were again approaching its
							boundaries.</p>

						<note rend="right">The revolt of the peasants of Brittany against the Convention</note>

						<p>The first and most serious opposition came from the peasants of Brittany, especially
							in the department of La VendÃ©e. There the people still loved the monarchy and their
							priests, and even the nobles; they refused to send their sons to fight or a republic
							which had killed their king and was persecuting those clergymen who declined to take
							an oath which their conscience forbade.</p>

						<note rend="right">Revolt of the cities against the Convention</note>

						<p>The cities of Marseilles and Bordeaux were indignant at the treatment to which the
							Girondist deputies were subjected in Paris, and they also organized a revolt against
							the Convention. In the manufacturing city of Lyons the merchants hated the Jacobins
							and their republic, since the demand for silk and other luxuries produced at Lyons had
							come from the nobility and clergy, who were now no longer in a position to buy. The
							prosperous classes were therefore exasperated when the commissioners of the Convention
							demanded money and troops. The citizens gathered an army of ten thousand men, placed
							it under a royalist leader, and prepared to bid defiance to the Jacobins who
							controlled the Convention.</p>

						<note rend="right">French fortresses fall into the hands of Austria and England (July,
							1793)</note>

						<p>Meanwhile France's enemies were again advancing against her. The Austrians laid siege
							to the border fortress of CondÃ©, which they captured on July 10, 1793, and two weeks
							later <pb id="VAB8216-181" n="156"/> the English took Valenciennes. In this way the
							allies gained a foothold in France itself. Once more they were hardly more than a
							hundred miles away from the capital, and there appeared to be no reason why they
							should not immediately march upon Paris and wreak the vengeance which the duke of
							Brunswick had threatened in his proclamation of the previous year. The Prussians had
							driven the French garrison out of Mayence and were ready to advance into Alsace.
							Toulon, the great naval station of southern France, now revolted against the
							Convention. It proclaimed the little dauphin as king, under the title of Louis XVII,
							and welcomed the English fleet as an ally.</p>

						<note rend="right">Carnot organized the French armies</note>

						<p>The French Republic seemed to be lost; but never did a the body of men exhibit such
							marvelous energy as the Committee of Public Safety. Carnot, who was to earn the title
							of Organizer of Victory, became a member of the committee in August. He immediately
							called for a general levy of troops and soon had no less than seven hundred and fifty
							thousand men. These he divided into thirteen armies which he dispatched against the
							allies. Each general was accompanied by two "deputies on mission" who were always on
							the watch lest the commanders desert, as Lafayette had done after August 10, 1792, and
							Dumouriez a few months later. These Jacobin deputies not only roused the patriotism of
							the raw recruits, but they let it be known that for a general to lose a battle meant
							death.</p>

						<note rend="right">The French easily repulse the allies</note>

						<p>Fortunately for the Convention the allies did not march on Paris, but Austria began
							occupying the border towns and the English moved westward to seize the coveted
							Dunkirk. The French were able to drive off the English and Hanoverians who were
							besieging Dunkirk, and in October General Jourdan defeated the Austrians at
							Wattignies. Since Frederick William continued to give his attention mainly to Poland,
							there was little danger from the duke of Brunswick and his army, so that by the close
							of 1793 all danger from foreign invasion was over for the time being.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-182" n="157"/>

						<note rend="right">The revolt of the cities suppressed by the Committee of Public
							Safety</note>

						<p>As for the revolt of the cities and of the Vendean peasants, the Committee of Public
							Safety showed itself able to cope with that danger too. It first turned its attention
							to Lyons. Some of the troops from the armies on the frontiers were recalled and the
							city was bombarded and captured. Then Collot d'Herbois, one of the stanchest believers
							in terrorism, was sent down to demonstrate to the conquered city what a fearful thing
							it was to rise against the Mountain. Nearly two thousand persons were executed, or
							rather massacred, as traitors, within five months. Indeed the Convention declared its
							intention to annihilate the great and flourishing city and rename its site Freedville
								(<hi rend="i">Commune affranchie</hi>). Happily a close friend of Robespierre, who
							was sent to execute this decree, contented himself with destroying forty houses.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bonaparte at Toulon</note>

						<p>Frightened by the awful fate of Lyons, the cities of Bordeaux and Marseilles judged
							it useless to oppose the Convention and admitted its representatives, who executed
							three or four hundred "traitors" in each place. Toulon held out until an artillery
							officer hitherto entirely unknown, a young Corsican by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte,
							suggested occupying a certain promontory in the harbor, from which he was able to
							train his cannon on the British fleet which was supporting the city. It sailed away
							with some refugees, leaving the town to the vengeance of the Convention, December 19,
							1793.</p>

						<note rend="right">Defeat of the peasants of the VendÃ©e</note>

						<p>Although the Vendean peasants fought bravely and defeated several corps of the
							national guard sent against them, their insurrection was also put down in the autumn--
							at least for a time-- with atrocious cruelty. A representative of the Convention at
							Nantes had perhaps two thousand Vendean insurgents shot or drowned in the Loire. This
							was probably the most horrible episode of the Revolution, and was not approved by the
							Convention, which recalled its bloodthirsty agent, who was finally sent to the
							scaffold for his crimes.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Reign of Terror</note>

						<p>In spite of the extraordinary success with which the Committee of Public Safety had
							crushed its opponents at home and <pb id="VAB8216-183" n="158"/> repelled the armies
							of the monarchs who proposed to dismember France, it was clear that the task of
							rendering the Revolution complete and permanent was by no means accomplished. The
							revolt of the VendÃ©e and of the cities had shown that there were thousands of
							Frenchmen who hated the Jacobins. All such were viewed by the Convention as guilty of
							holding counter-revolutionary sentiments and therefore "suspect." It was argued that
							any one who was not an ardent and demonstrative <hi rend="i">sans-culotte</hi> might
							at any time become a traitor. In order to prevent this and force people to be faithful
							to the republic, the Convention decided that they must be terrorized by observing the
							fearful vengeance which the republic wrought upon traitors. The Reign of Terror was
							only a systematic attempt to secure the success of the Revolution by summarily
							punishing or intimidating its enemies. While it had no definite beginning or end, it
							lasted, in its more acute stages, for about ten months,-- from September, 1793 to
							July, 1794.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Revolutionary Tribunal</note>

						<p>Even before the fall of the Girondists a special court had been established in Paris,
							known as the Revolutionary Tribunal. Its function was to try all those who were
							suspected of treasonable acts. At first the cases were very carefully considered and
							few persons were condemned. In September, after the revolt of the cities, two new men
							who had been implicated in the September massacres were added to the Committee of
							Public Safety. They were selected with the particular purpose of intimidating the
							counter-revolutionary party by bringing all the disaffected to the guillotine.<ref
								id="ref_081" rend="super" target="note_081">1</ref> A terrible law was passed,
							declaring all those to be suspects who by their conduct or remarks had shown

									rend="super">1</ref> In former times it had been customary to inflict capital

								guillotine, which has until very recently been used in France, was more speedy and

						<note rend="right">Execution of Marie Antoinette (October, 1793)</note>

						<p>In October Marie Antoinette, after a trial in which false and atrocious charges were
							urged against her in addition to the treasonable acts of which she had been guilty,
							was executed in Paris. A number of high-minded and distinguished persons, including
							Madame Roland and a group of Girondists, suffered a like fate. But the most horrible
							acts of the Reign of Terror were, as has been noted, perpetrated in the provinces,
							especially at Lyons and Nantes.</p>

						<note rend="right">Schism in the party of the Mountain</note>

						<p>It was not long before the members of the radical party who were conducting the
							government began to disagree among party themselves. Danton, a man of fiery zeal for
							the republic, who had hitherto enjoyed great popularity with the Jacobins, became
							tired of bloodshed and convinced that the system of terror was no longer necessary.
							Camille Desmoulins, another ardent republican, began to attack the harsher Jacobins as
							he had earlier attacked the unpractical Girondists. He started a witty but very
							serious little newspaper, called <hi rend="i">The Old Cordelier</hi>, in the interests
							of moderation.</p>

						<note rend="right">The <hi rend="i">Vieux Cordelier</hi> of Desmoulins</note>

						<p>Desmoulins began by showing that the severities of the Reign of Terror were, after
							all, as nothing compared with the atrocities of the earlier Roman emperors which one
							read about in Tacitus. "Vice, pillage, and crime are diseases in republics, whereas
							rogues are absolutely necessary to the maintenance of a monarchy." In his next issue
							he ceased to extenuate the work of the guillotine and pleaded for clemency. "You would

							should no longer be the order of the day, and a committee of clemency should take the

						<note rend="right">HÃ©bert and the ultra-radicals</note>

						<p>On the other hand, the radical leader of the Paris commune, HÃ©bert, had also his
							newspaper, an indecent sheet which called on the people to complete the Revolution. He
							proposed that the worship of Reason should be substituted for that of God and arranged
							a service in the cathedral of Notre Dame where Reason, in the person of a handsome
							actress, took her place on the altar.</p>

						<note rend="right">Robespierre and Saint-Just</note>

						<p>Robespierre, who was a member of the Committee of Public Safety, sympathized neither
							with the moderates nor with HÃ©bert and his Goddess of Reason. He himself enjoyed a
							great reputation for high ideals, republican virtue, and incorruptibility. He and
							Saint-Just had read their Rousseau with prayerful attention and dreamed of a glorious
							republic in which there should be neither rich nor poor; in which men and women should
							live in independence and rear robust and healthy children. These should be turned over
							to the republic at five years of age to be educated in Spartan fashion by the nation;
							they were to eat together and to live on roots, fruit, vegetables, milk, cheese,
							bread, and water. The Eternal was to be worshiped in temples, and in these temples at
							certain times every man should be required publicly to state who were his friends. Any
							man who said he had no friends, or was convicted of ingratitude, was to be
								banished.<ref id="ref_083" rend="super" target="note_083">2</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Robespierre has the leaders of both the moderates and extremists

						<p>Robespierre was, however, insignificant and unattractive in person and a tiresome

							hand, as a deist, he believed that HÃ©bert and his followers were discrediting the
							Revolution by their atheism. Accordingly, through his influence, the leaders of both
							the moderate and the extreme parties were arrested and sent to the guillotine (March
							and April, 1794).</p>

						<note rend="right">Robespierre's brief period of influence</note>

						<p>Robespierre now enjoyed a brief dictatorship. He read in the Convention a report on a
							system of festivals which were to help regenerate the land by celebrating such
							abstractions as liberty, equality, glory, immortality, frugality, stoicism, and old
							age. He had a decree passed proclaiming that the French nation believed in God and the
							immortality of the soul, and organized a ceremony in honor of the Supreme Being in
							which he himself assumed a very conspicuous rÃ´le as a sort of high priest of deism.
							The Convention was so far in sympathy with the aspirations of Robespierre and
							Saint-Just as to assert that "it is necessary to refashion a people completely if it
							is to be made free. Its prejudices must be destroyed, its habits changed, its needs
							limited, its vices eradicated, and its desires purified. Strong forces must be invoked
							to develop social virtues and repress the passions of men."</p>

						<note rend="right">Law of 22d Prairial heightens the Reign of Terror</note>

						<p>In order the more effectively to destroy his enemies and those who opposed his
							designs for the regeneration of society, Robespierre had the Revolutionary Tribunal
							divided into four sections (June 10, 1794), so that it could work far more rapidly
							than hitherto. It could condemn any suspected "enemy of the people " on almost any
							evidence. The accused were in many cases deprived of counsel and no witnesses were
							examined. The result was that in seven weeks thirteen hundred and seventy-six persons
							were sent to the guillotine in Paris, whereas only eleven hundred and sixty-five had
							been executed from December 1 of the previous year to the passage of Robespierre's
							terrible new law in June.</p>

						<note rend="right">Fall of Robespierre on the 9th Thermidor (July 27, 1794)</note>

						<p>It was of course impossible for Robespierre to maintain his power long. Many of his
							colleagues in the Convention began <pb id="VAB8216-187" n="162"/> to fear that they
							might at any moment follow Danton and HÃ©bert to the guillotine. They did not
							sympathize very deeply with Robespierre's ideas; as one of the most ardent terrorists
							said, "Robespierre begins to bore me with his Supreme Being." A conspiracy was formed
							against him and the Convention was induced to order his arrest. When, on July 27,--
							the 9th Thermidor of the new republican calendar,-- he appeared in the Convention and
							attempted to speak he was silenced by cries of "Down with the tyrant!" In his
							consternation he could not at first recover his voice, whereupon one of the deputies
							shouted, "The blood of Danton chokes him!" Finally he called upon the commune of Paris
							to defend him, but the Convention was able to maintain its authority and to send
							Robespierre and Saint-Just, his fellow-idealist, to the guillotine. It is sad enough
							that two of the most sincere and upright of all the revolutionists should, in their
							misguided and over-earnest efforts to better the condition of their fellow-men, have
							become objects of execration to posterity.</p>

						<note rend="right">Reaction after the overthrow of Robespierre</note>

						<p>In successfully overthrowing Robespierre the Convention and Committee of Public
							Safety had rid the country of the only man who, owing to his popularity and his
							reputation for uprightness, could have prolonged the Reign of Terror. There was almost
							an immediate reaction after his death, for the country was weary of executions. The
							Revolutionary Tribunal henceforth convicted very few indeed of those who were brought
							before it. It made an exception, however, of those who had themselves been the leaders
							in the worst atrocities, as, for example, the public prosecutor, who had brought
							hundreds of victims to the guillotine in Paris, and the terrorists who had ordered the
							massacres at Nantes and Lyons. Within a few months the Jacobin Club at Paris was
							closed by the Convention and the commune of Paris abolished.</p>

						<note rend="right">Review of the Reign of Terror</note>
						<note rend="right">First state</note>

						<p>The importance and nature of the Reign of Terror are so commonly misunderstood that
							it is worth our while to stop a moment to reconsider it as a whole. When the Estates
								<pb id="VAB8216-188" n="163"/> General met, the people of France were loyal to their
							king but wished to establish a more orderly government; they wanted to vote the taxes,
							have some share in making the laws, and abolish the old feudal abuses, including the
							unreasonable privileges of the nobility and the clergy. The nobility were frightened
							and began to run away. The king and queen urged foreign powers to intervene and even
							tried to escape to join the traitorous emigrant nobles. Austrian and Prussian troops
							reached the frontier and the Prussian commander threatened to destroy Paris unless the
							royal family were given complete liberty. Paris, aided by the men of Marseilles,
							retaliated by deposing the king, and the Convention decided by a narrow majority to
							execute Louis XVI for treason, of which he was manifestly guilty. In the summer, just
							as Austria and England were taking the French border fortresses of CondÃ© and
							Valenciennes, the cities of Lyons, Marseilles, and Toulon and the peasants of the
							VendÃ©e revolted. The necessity of making head against invasion and putting down the
							insurrection at home led to harsh measures on the part of the Convention and its
							Committee of Public Safety.</p>

						<note rend="right">Second state</note>

						<p>When the immediate danger was dispelled Robespierre, Saint-Just, and others sought to
							exterminate the enemies of that utopian republic of which they dreamed and in which
							every man was to have a fair chance in life. This led to the second, and perhaps less
							excusable, phase of the Reign of Terror. To the executions sanctioned by the
							government must be added the massacres and lynchings perpetrated by mobs or by
							irresponsible agents of the Convention. Yet Camille Desmoulins was right when he
							claimed that the blood that had flowed "for the eternal emancipation of a nation of
							twenty-five millions" was as nothing to that shed by the Roman emperors (and it may be
							added, by bishops and kings), often in less worthy causes.</p>

						<note rend="right">A great part of the French people unaffected by the Reign of
							Terror</note>

						<p>Then it should be remembered that a great part of the French people were nearly or
							quite unaffected by the Reign <pb id="VAB8216-189" n="164"/> of Terror. In Paris very
							few of the citizens stood in any fear of the guillotine. The city was not the gloomy
							place that it has been pictured by Dickens and other story-tellers. Never did the
							inhabitants appear happier than when the country was being purged of the supposed
							traitors; never were the theaters and restaurants more crowded. The guillotine was
							making way with the enemies of liberty, so the women wore tiny guillotines as
							ornaments, and the children were given toy guillotines and amused themselves
							decapitating the figures of "aristocrats."</p>

						<note rend="right">Sound reforms introduced by the Convention</note>
						<note rend="right">The metric system</note>

						<p>Moreover the Convention had by no means confined its attention during the months of
							the Reign of Terror to hunting down "suspects" and executing traitors. Its committees
							had raised a million troops, organized and equipped them with arms, and sent them
							forth to victory. The reforms sketched out by the National Assembly had been developed
							and carried on. The Convention had worked out a great system of elementary education
							which should form the basis of the new republic. It had drafted a new code of laws
							which should replace the confusion of the <hi rend="i">ancien rÃ©gime</hi>, although it
							was left for Napoleon to order its revision and gain the credit of the enterprise. The
							republican calendar was not destined to survive, but the rational system of weights
							and measures known as the metric system, which the Convention introduced, has been
							adopted by most of the nations of Continental Europe and is used by men of science in
							England and America.</p>

						<note rend="right">Anxiety of the Convention to blot out all suggestions of the
							past</note>
						<note rend="right">The Convention's efforts to improve the condition of the poorer
							classes</note>

						<p>In its anxiety to obliterate every suggestion of the old order of things, the
							Convention went to excess. The old terms of address, Monsieur and Madame, seemed to
							smack of the <hi rend="i">ancien rÃ©gime</hi> and so were replaced by "citizen" and
							"citizeness." The days were no longer dedicated to St. Peter, St. James, St. Bridget,
							or St. Catharine, but to the cow, the horse, celery, the turnip, the harrow, the
							pitchfork, or other useful creature or utensil. The Place Louis XV became Place de la
							Revolution. Throne Square was rechristened Place of the Overturned <pb
								id="VAB8216-190" n="165"/> Throne. The Convention endeavored to better the condition
							of the poor man and deprive the rich of their superfluity. The land which had been
							taken from the Church and the runaway nobles was sold in small parcels and the number
							of small land-holders was thus greatly increased. In May, 1793, the Convention tried
							to keep down the price of grain by passing the Law of the Maximum, which forbade the
							selling of grain and flour at a higher price than that fixed by each commune. This was
							later extended to other forms of food and worked quite as badly as the grain laws
							which Turgot had abolished.</p>

						<note rend="right">Trouble with depreciated paper money</note>

						<p>The reckless increase of the paper currency, or <hi rend="i">assignats</hi>, and the
							efforts to prevent their depreciation by a law which made it a capital offense to
							refuse to accept them at par caused infinite confusion. There were about forty
							billions of francs of these <hi rend="i">assignats</hi> in circulation at the opening
							of the year 1796. At that time it required nearly three hundred francs in paper to
							procure one in specie.</p>

						<note rend="right">Constitution of the Year III</note>
						<note rend="right">The Directory</note>

						<p>At last the Convention turned its attention once more to the special work for which
							it had been summoned in September, 1792, and drew up a constitution for the republic.
							This was preceded by a "Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the Citizen,"
							which summed up, as the first Declaration of Rights had done, the great principles of
							the Revolution.<ref id="ref_084" rend="super" target="note_084">1</ref> The lawmaking
							power is vested by the Constitution of the Year III in a Legislative Body to be
							composed of two chambers, the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of the Elders
							(consisting of two hundred and fifty members). Members of the latter were to be at
							least forty years old and either married or widowers. Practically all men over
							twenty-one years of age were permitted to vote for the members of the electoral
							colleges, which in turn chose the members of the <note id="note_084"><ref
									target="ref_084" rend="super">1</ref> All the duties of man and the citizen are
								derived, according to this constitution, from two principles which are graven by
								nature in the hearts of all: Ne faites pas Ã  autrui ce que vous ne voudriez pas
								qu'on vous fit. Faites constamment aux autres le bien que vous voudriez en recevoir.
								This is after all only an amplification of the Golden Rule.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-191" n="166"/> Legislative Body. To take the place of a king, a
							Directory composed of five members chosen by the Legislative Body was invested with
							the executive power. One director was to retire each year, as well as one third of the
							members of the Legislative Body (a system suggesting that of the United States
							Senate).</p>

						<note rend="right">Opposition to the convention</note>

						<p>Before the Convention completed the constitution its enemies had become very strong.
							The richer classes had once more got the upper hand; they abhorred the Convention
							which had killed their king and oppressed them, and they favored the reÃ«stablishment
							of the monarchy without the abuses of the <hi rend="i">ancien rÃ©gime</hi>. The
							Convention, fearing for itself and the republic, decreed that in the approaching
							election, at least two thirds of the new Legislative Body were to be chosen from the
							existing members of the Convention. Believing that it could rely upon the armies, it
							ordered that the constitution should be submitted to the soldiers for ratification and
							that bodies of troops should be collected near Paris to maintain order during the
							elections. These decrees roused the anger of the wealthier districts of Paris which
							did not hesitate to organize a revolt and prepare to attack the Convention.</p>

						<note rend="right">The 13th VendÃ©miaire (October 5, 1795)</note>

						<p>The latter, however, chose for its defender that same Napoleon Bonaparte who, after
							helping to take Toulon, had resigned his commission rather than leave the artillery
							and join the infantry as he had been ordered to do, and was earning a bare subsistence
							as a clerk in a government office. Bonaparte stationed the regulars around the
							building in which the Convention sat and then loaded his cannon with grapeshot. When
							the bourgeois national guard attacked him, he gave the order to fire and easily swept
							them from the streets.<ref id="ref_085" rend="super" target="note_085">1</ref> The
							royalists were defeated. The day had been saved for the Convention by the army and by
							a military genius who was destined soon not only to make himself master of France but
							to build up an empire comprising a great part of western Europe.</p>

						<note id="note_085"><ref target="ref_085" rend="super">1</ref> More people were killed

						<note rend="right">How the Revolution transformed and democratized the army</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">24.</hi> The French army had undergone a complete transformation during
							the Revolution. The rules of the ancien regime had required all officers to be nobles,
							and many of these had left France after the fall of the Bastille. Others, like
							Lafayette and Dumouriez, who had at first favored the Revolution, deserted soon after
							the opening of the war. Still others, like Custine and Beauharnais (the Empress
							Josephine's first husband), were executed because the "deputies on mission" believed
							that they were responsible for the defeats that the armies of the French republic had
							suffered.</p>

						<p>The former rigid discipline disappeared, and the hundreds of thousands of volunteers
							who pressed forward to defend and extend the boundaries of the Republic found new
							leaders, who rose from the ranks, and who hit upon novel and quite unconventional ways
							of beating the enemy. Any one might now become a general if he could prove his ability
							to lead troops to victory. Moreau was a lawyer from Brittany, Murat had been a waiter,
							Jourdan before the Revolution had been selling cloth in Limoges. In short, the army,
							like the State, had become democratic.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Napoleonic Period</note>

						<p>Among the commanders who by means of their talents rose to take the places of the
							"aristocrats" was one who was to dominate the history of Europe as no man before him
							had ever done. For fifteen years his biography and the political history of Europe are
							so nearly synonymous that the period we are now entering upon may properly be called
							after him, the Napoleonic Period.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-194" n="169"/>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon Bonaparte (b. 1769) a Corsican by birth, an Italian by
							descent</note>

						<p>Napoleon Bonaparte was hardly a Frenchman by birth. It is true that the island of
							Corsica where he was born, August 15, 1769, had at that time belonged to France for a
								year,<ref id="ref_086" rend="super" target="note_086">1</ref> but Napoleon's native
							language was Italian, and he was descended from Italian ancestors who had come to the
							island in the sixteenth century. His father, Carlo Buonaparte, although he claimed to
							be of noble extraction, busied himself with the profession of the law in the town of
							Ajaccio where Napoleon was probably born. He was poor and found it hard to support his
							eight boys and girls, all of whom were one day to become kings and queens, or at
							worst, princes and princesses. Accordingly he took his two elder sons, Joseph and
							Napoleon, to France, where Joseph was to be educated for the priesthood and Napoleon,
							who was but ten years old, after learning a little French was to prepare for the army
							in the military academy at Brienne.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bonaparte at the military school (1779-1784)</note>

						<p>Here the boy led an unhappy life for five or six years. He soon came to hate the
							young French nobles with whom he was associated. He wrote to his father, "I am tired
							of exposing my poverty and seeing these shameless boys laughing over it, for they are
							superior to me only in wealth and infinitely beneath me in noble sentiments."
							Gradually the ambition to free his little island country from French control developed
							in him.</p>

						<note rend="right">His political intrigues in Corsica</note>
						<note rend="right">The Bonapartes banished from Corsica (1793)</note>

						<p>On completing his course in the military school he was made second lieutenant. Poor
							and without influence, he had little hope of any considerable advance in the French
							army, and he was drawn to his own country both by a desire to play a political r61le
							there and to help his family, which had been left in straitened circumstances by his
							father's death. He therefore absented himself from his command as often and as long as
							he could, and engaged in a series of intrigues in Corsica in the hope of getting
							control of the forces of the island. He <note id="note_086"><ref target="ref_086"
									rend="super">1</ref> It is possible that Bonaparte was born in the previous year,
								when Corsica still belonged to the republic of Genoa.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-195" n="170"/> fell into disfavor, however, with the authorities, and
							he and his family were banished in 1793, and fled to France.</p>

						<note rend="right">How Bonaparte won the confidence of Barras and the Directory</note>
						<note rend="right">Napoleon marries Josephine Beauharnais</note>

						<p>The following three years were for Bonaparte a period of great uncertainty. He had
							lost his love for Corsica and as yet had found no foothold in France. Soon after his
							return his knowledge of artillery enabled him, as we have seen, to suggest a
							successful method of capturing.Toulon; and two years later his friend Barras selected
							him to defend the Convention against its enemies on the 13th Vend6miaire. This was the
							beginning of his career, for Barras, who had been chosen a member of the Directory,
							introduced him into the gay and reckless social circle to which he belonged. Here he
							met and fell in love with the charming widow of poor General Beauharnais, who had lost
							his head just before Thermidor. Madame Beauharnais accepted the pale, nervous little
							republican officer in spite of his awkward manners and ill-fitting uniform. Nine years
							later he was able to place an imperial crown upon her brow.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bonaparte made commander in chief of the army of Italy (1796)</note>

						<p>In the spring of 1796 Bonaparte was selected by the Directory to command one of the
							three armies which it was sending against Austria. This important appointment at the
							age of twenty-seven forms the opening of an astonishing military career which can be
							compared only with that of Alexander the Great.</p>

						<note rend="right">How Prussia and Austria neglected the war with France in 1794</note>

						<p>France, as has been pointed out, found herself in 1793 at war with Austria, Prussia,
							England, Holland, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, Sardinia, the Kingdom of Naples (i.e.
							of the Two Sicilies), and Tuscany. This formidable alliance, however, only succeeded
							in taking a few border fortresses which the French easily regained. Prussia and
							Austria were far more interested in Poland, where a third and last partition was
							pending, than in fighting the Revolution and keeping the French out of the Austrian
							Netherlands. The Polish patriot, Kosciusko, had led a revolt of the Poles against
							their oppressors, and the Russian garrison which Catharine had placed in Warsaw was
							cut down by the Polish rebels in April, 1794. Catharine then <pb id="VAB8216-196"
								n="171"/> appealed to Frederick William for assistance. He therefore turned his
							whole attention to Poland,<ref id="ref_087" rend="super" target="note_087">1</ref> and
							Pitt had to pay him handsomely to induce him to leave sixty thousand Prussian troops
							to protect the Netherlands from the French invaders. But England's money was wasted,
							for the Prussians refused to take active measures, and even Austria, after one or two
							reverses, decided to evacuate the Netherlands, in the summer of 1794, in order to
							center all her energies upon Polish affairs and prevent Russia and Prussia from
							excluding her, as they had done the last time, when it came to a division of the
							booty.</p>

						<note rend="right">England unable to check the French, who occupy Holland and the Rhine
							region</note>

						<p>England was naturally disgusted. She had joined the war in order to aid Austria and
							Prussia to maintain the balance of power and defend the Netherlands, which formed a
							protective barrier between Holland and France. Lord Malmesbury, one of the English
							diplomats, declared that in his dealings with the allies he encountered only "shabby
							art and cunning, ill will, jealousy and every sort of dirty passion." By October,
							1794, the Austrians had disappeared beyond the Rhine; the English were forced to give
							up Holland and to retreat forlornly into Hanover before the French under General
							Pichegru, who captured the Dutch fleet imprisoned in the ice near Texel. The Dutch
							towns contained some enthusiastic republicans who received the French cordially. The
							office of hereditary stadholder, which was really that of a king except in name, was
							abolished, and the United Netherlands became the Batavian Republic under French
							control.</p>

						<note rend="right">The French republic concludes the Treaties of Basel with Prussia and
							Spain (April and July, 1795)</note>

						<p>Instead of being crushed by the overwhelming forces of the allies, the armies of the
							French republic had, in the three years since the opening of the war, conquered the
							Spanish Netherlands, Savoy, and Nice; they had metamorphosed Holland into a friendly
							sister republic, and had occupied western Germany as far as the Rhine. The Convention
							was now ready to conclude its first treaties of peace. Prussia signed the Treaty of

						<note rend="right">Bonaparte forces Sardinia to conclude peace and enters Milan (May,
							1796)</note>

						<p>General Bonaparte had to face the combined forces of Austria and Sardinia, which had
							joined the enemies of France in 1793. By marching north from Savona he skillfully
							separated his two enemies. He forced the Sardinian troops back toward Turin and
							compelled the king to conclude a treaty by which Savoy and Nice were ceded to France.
							Bonaparte was now free to advance into Lombardy. He marched down the Po, and the
							Austrians, fearing that he might cut them off, hastened eastward, leaving Milan to be
							occupied by the French. Here Bonaparte made a triumphal entry on May 15, 1796,
							scarcely more than a month after the campaign opened.</p>

						<note rend="right">The French begin to plunder Italy</note>

						<p>As he descended the mountains into the plains of Lombardy, Bonaparte had announced
							that the French army came to break the chains of the tyrants, for the French people
							was the friend of all peoples. Nevertheless the Directory expected him to force those
							that he "freed" to support the French armies. Their directions to Bonaparte were
							sufficiently explicit: "Leave nothing in Italy which will be useful to us and which
							the political situation will permit you to remove." Accordingly Milan was not only
							required to pay its deliverers twenty million francs but also to give up some of the
							finest old masterpieces in its churches and galleries. The dukes of Parma and Modena
							made similar "contributions" on condition that Bonaparte would grant them an
							armistice.</p>

						<note rend="right">The campaign about Mantua (May, 1796-February, 1797)</note>

						<p>Bonaparte soon moved east and defeated the Austrian army, a part of which took refuge
							in the impregnable fortress of Mantua to which the French promptly laid siege. There
							is more fascinating chapter in the history of warfare than the story of the audacious
							maneuvers by which Bonaparte successfully repulsed the Austrian armies sent to relieve
							Mantua. Toward the end of July an Austrian army nearly twice the size of Bonaparte's
							descended in three divisions from Tyrol. The situation of the French was critical, but
							Bonaparte managed to defeat each of the three divisions before they had an opportunity
							to join forces. In five days the Austrians retired, leaving <pb id="VAB8216-199"
								n="174"/> fifteen thousand prisoners in the hands of the French. Bonaparte now
							determined to advance up the river Adige into Germany. He again routed the Austrians
							and took possession of Trent. Wurmser, the Austrian commander, tried to cut him <figure>
								<p>Central Europe to illustrate Napoleon's Campaigns, 1796-1801</p>
							</figure> off from Italy but was himself shut up in Mantua with the remains of his

						<p>In November two more armies were sent down to relieve Mantua, one approaching by the

							last effort to relieve the fortress was <pb id="VAB8216-200" n="175"/> frustrated by

							which gave the French complete control of northern Italy.</p>

						<note rend="right">Truce at Leoben (April, 1797)</note>

						<p>All danger of an attack in the rear was now removed, and the victorious French
							general could lead his.army through the mountains to Vienna. He forced back the
							Austrians, who attempted to block the road, and when, on April 7, he was within eighty
							miles of the capital, the Austrian commander requested a truce, which Bonaparte was
							not unwilling to grant, since he was now far from home, and both the other armies
							which the Directory had sent out, under Moreau and Jourdan, had been routed and forced
							back over the Rhine. A preliminary peace was accordingly arranged, which was followed
							by the definitive Treaty of Campo Formio (October, 1797).</p>

						<note rend="right">Provisions of the Treaty of Campo Formio (October, 1797)</note>
						<note rend="right">Creation of the Cisalpine Republic</note>

						<p>The provisions of the Treaty of Campo Formio illustrate the unscrupulous manner in
							which Bonaparte and Austria disposed of the helpless lesser states. It inaugurated the
							bewilderingly rapid territorial redistribution of Europe which was so characteristic
							of the Napoleonic period. Austria ceded to France the Austrian Netherlands and
							secretly agreed to use its good offices to secure for France a great part of the left
							bank of the Rhine. Austria also recognized the Cisalpine Republic, which Bonapart had
							created out of the smaller states of northern Italy, and which was under the "
							protection" of France. This new state included Lombardy, which Bonaparte had
							conquered, the duchy of Modena, some of the papal dominions, and, lastly, a part of
							the possessions of the venerable and renowned but now defenseless republic of Venice,
							which Napoleon had ruthlessly destroyed. Austria received as an indemnity for the
							Netherlands and Lombardy the rest of the possessions of the Venetian republic,
							including Venice itself.</p>

						<note rend="right">General Bonaparte establishes a court</note>

						<p>While the negotiations were going on, the young general had established a brilliant
							court at a villa near Milan. "His salons," an observer informs us, "were filled with a
							throng of generals, officials, and purveyors, as well as the highest nobility and the
								<pb id="VAB8216-201" n="176"/> most distinguished men of Italy, who came to solicit
							the favor of a glance or a moment's conversation." It would appear, from the report of
							a most extraordinary conversation which occurred at this time, that he had already
							conceived the rÃ´le that he was to play later.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bonaparte's analysis of the French character and of his own
							aims</note>

						<p>"What I have done so far," he declared, "is nothing. I am but at the opening of the
							career that I am to run. Do and you suppose that I have gained my victories in Italy
							in order to advance the lawyers of the Directory,-- the Carnots and the Barras'? Do
							you think either that my object is to establish a republic? What a notion! . .. What
							the French want is Glory and the satisfaction of their vanity; as for Liberty, of that
							they have no conception. Look at the army! The victories that we have just gained have
							given the French soldier his true character. I am everything to him. Let the Directory
							attempt to deprive me of my command and they will see who is the master. The nation
							must have a head, a head who is rendered illustrious by glory and not by theories of
							government, fine phrases, or the talk of idealists, of which the French understand not
							a whit."</p>

						<p>There is no doubt whom General Bonaparte had in mind when he spoke of the needed head
							of the French nation who should be "rendered illustrious by glory." This son of a poor
							Corsican lawyer, but yesterday a mere unlucky adventurer, had arranged his program;
							two years and a half later he was the master of the French republic.</p>

						<note rend="right">Personal characteristics</note>

						<p>We naturally ask what manner of person this was who could frame such audacious
							schemes at twenty-eight and realize them at thirty years of age. He was a little man,
							less than five feet two inches in height. At this time he was extremely thin, but his
							striking features, quick, searching eye, abrupt, animated gestures, and rapid speech,
							incorrect as it was, made a deep impression upon those who came in contact with him.
							He possessed in a supreme degree two qualities that are ordinarily considered
							incompatible. He was a dreamer and, at the same <pb id="VAB8216-202" n="177"/> time, a
							man whose practical skill and mastery of detail amounted to genius. He once told a
							friend that he was wont, when a poor lieutenant, to allow his imagination full play
							and fancy things just as he would have them. Then he would coolly consider the exact
							steps to be taken if he were to try to make his dream come true.</p>

						<note rend="right">Sources of power in Napoleon's character</note>

						<p>In order to explain Bonaparte's success it must be remembered that he was not
							hampered or held back by the fear of doing wrong. He was utterly unscrupulous, whether
							dealing with an individual or a nation, and appears to have been absolutely without
							any sense of moral responsibility. Neither did affection for his friends and relatives
							ever stand in the way of his personal aggrandizement. To these traits must be added
							unrivaled military genius and the power of intense and almost uninterrupted work.</p>

						<note rend="right">The political conditions which rendered Napoleon's wonderful
							successes possible</note>

						<p>But even Bonaparte, unexampled as were his abilities, could never have extended his
							power over all of western Europe, had it not been for the peculiar political weakness
							of most of the states with which he had to deal. There was no strong German Empire in
							his day, no united Italy, no Belgium whose neutrality was guaranteed-- as it now is--
							by the other powers of Europe. The French republic was surrounded by petty,
							independent, or practically independent, principalities, which were defenseless
							against an unscrupulous invader. Prussia, much smaller than it now is, offered, as we
							shall see, no efficient opposition to the extension of French control, while Austria
							had been forced to capitulate, after a short campaign, by an enemy far from its source
							of supplies and led by a young and inexperienced general.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bonaparte conceives the plan of an expedition to Egypt</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">25.</hi> After arranging the Peace of Campo Formio, General Bonaparte
							returned to Paris. He at once perceived that <pb id="VAB8216-203" n="178"/> France, in
							spite of her enthusiasm over his victories, was not yet ready to accept him as her
							ruler. The pear was not yet ripe, as he observed. He saw, too, that he would soon
							sacrifice his prestige if he lived quietly in Paris like an ordinary person. His
							active mind promptly conceived a plan which would forward his interests. France was
							still at war with England, its most persevering enemy during this period. Bonaparte
							convinced the Directory that England could best be ruined in the long run by occupying
							Egypt and so threatening her commerce in the Mediterranean, and perhaps ultimately her
							dominion in the East. Fascinated by the career of Alexander the Great, Bonaparte
							pictured himself riding to India on the back of an elephant and dispossessing England
							of her most precious colonial dependencies. He had, however, still another and a
							characteristic reason for undertaking the expedition. France was on the eve of a new
							war with the European powers. Bonaparte foresaw that, if he could withdraw with him
							some of France's best officers, the Directory might soon find itself so embarrassed
							that he could return as a national savior. And even so it fell out.</p>

						<p>Accordingly General Bonaparte, under authority of the Directory, collected forty
							thousand of the best troops and fitted out a strong fleet, which should serve to give
							France the control of the Mediterranean. He did not forget to add to the expedition a
							hundred and twenty scientists and engineers, who were to study the country and prepare
							the way for French colonists to be sent out later.<ref id="ref_091" rend="super"

						<p>The Porte (i.e. the Turkish government) having declared war against France, Bonaparte

							fleet. Pursued by pestilence, the army regained Cairo in June, after terrible
							suffering and loss. It was still strong enough to annihilate a Turkish army that
							landed at Alexandria; but news now reached Bonaparte from Europe <pb id="VAB8216-205"
								n="180"/> which convinced him that the time had come for him to hasten back. The
							powers had formed a new coalition against France. Northern Italy, which he had won,
							was lost; the allies were about to invade France itself, and the Directory was
							hopelessly demoralized. Bonaparte accordingly secretly deserted his army and managed,
							by a series of happy accidents, to reach France by October 9, 1799.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bonaparte made first Consul</note>

						<p>The Directory, one of the most corrupt and inefficient governmental bodies that the
							world has ever seen, had completely disgraced itself and Bonaparte readily found
							others to join with him in a conspiracy to overthrow it. A plan was formed for
							abruptly destroying the old government and replacing it by a new one without observing
							any constitutional forms. This is a procedure so familiar in France during the past
							century that it is known even in English as a <hi rend="i">coup d'Ã©tat</hi> (literally
							translated, a "stroke of state"). The conspirators had a good many friends in the two
							assemblies, especially among the "Elders." Nevertheless Bonaparte had to order his
							soldiers to invade the hall in which the Assembly of the Five Hundred was in session
							and scatter his opponents before he could accomplish his purpose. A chosen few were
							then reassembled under the presidency of Lucien Bonaparte, one of Napoleon's brothers,
							who was a member of the Assembly. They voted to put the government in the hands of
							three men,-- General Bonaparte and two others,-- to be called "Consuls." These were to
							proceed, with the aid of a commission and of the Elders, to draw up a new
							constitution.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Constitution of the Year VIII</note>
						<note rend="right">The Council of State</note>

						<p>The new constitution was a very cumbrous and elaborate one. It provided for no less
							than four assemblies, one to propose the laws, one to consider them, one to vote upon
							them, and one to decide on their constitutionality. But Bonaparte saw to it that as
							First Consul he himself had practically all the power in his own hands. The Council of
							State, to which he called talented men from all parties and over which he presided,
							was the most important of the governmental bodies.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-206" n="181"/>

						<note rend="right">The centralized administrative system established by Bonaparte</note>

						<p>Bonaparte's chief aim was to centralize the government. Nothing was left to local
							assemblies, for he proposed to control everything from Paris. Accordingly, in each
							department he put an officer called a <hi rend="i">prefect</hi>; in each subdivision
							of the department a <hi rend="i">subprefect</hi>. These, together with the mayors and
							police commissioners of the towns, were all appointed by the First Consul. The
							prefects-- "little First Consuls," as Bonaparte called them-- resembled the former
							intendants, the king's officers under the old regime. Indeed, the new government
							suggested in several important respects that of Louis XIV. This administrative system
							which Bonaparte perfected has endured, with a few changes, down to the present day. It
							has rendered the French government very stable in spite of the startling changes in
							the constitution which have occurred. There is no surer proof of Napoleon's genius
							than that, with no previous experience, he could conceive a plan of government that
							should serve a great state like France through all its vicissitudes for a century.</p>

						<note rend="right">The new government accepted by a plebiscite</note>

						<p>The new ruler objected as decidedly as Louis XIV had done to the idea of being
							controlled by the people, who, he believed, knew nothing of public affairs. It was
							enough, he thought, if they were allowed to say whether they wished a certain form of
							government or not. He therefore introduced what he called a <hi rend="i"
								>plebiscite</hi>.<ref id="ref_092" rend="super" target="note_092">1</ref> The new
							constitution when completed was submitted to the nation at large, and all were allowed
							to vote "yes" or "no" on the expediency of its adoption. Over three million voted in
							favor of it and only fifteen hundred. and sixty-two against it. This did not
							necessarily mean, however, that practically the whole nation wished to have General
							Bonaparte as its ruler. A great many may have preferred what seemed to them an
							objectionable form of government to the risk of rejecting it. Herein lies the
							injustice of the plebiscite; there are many questions that cannot be answered by a
							simple "yes" or "no."</p>

							folly that they believe that any change cannot fail to be for the better. ... Even the

							attribute to him the intention of gradually restoring the old order of things. The

						<p>Within a few months, however, the situation was completely changed. The Austrians
							defeated Jourdan at Stockach in southern Germany, and the French retreated to the
							Rhine. In Italy the brave Russian general, Suvaroff, with the small but valiant army
							which the Tsar had sent to the west, forced the French out of northern Italy and, with

							their forces in Genoa, to which the Austrians laid siege. Suvaroff, after expelling
							the French from Piedmont, burned to push on into France. But the Austrian minister,
							Thugut, opposed the restoration of the king of Sardinia to his throne, and urged that
							Austria should be permitted to annex Piedmont since she alone would be powerful enough
							to keep the French out of Italy. Thereupon, utterly disgusted with his Austrian ally,
							Suvaroff turned northward through the Swiss mountains, across which he forced his way

						<p>In November, 1799, the corrupt and inefficient Directory was, as we have seen, thrust

							Lombards from the "Austrian rod," and then moved westward to find and crush the
							enemy.</p>

						<note rend="right">The battle of Marengo (June 14, 1800)</note>

						<p>In his uncertainty as to the exact whereabouts of the Austrians, Bonaparte divided
							his forces when near the village of Marengo (June 14) and sent a contingent under
							Desaix southward to head off the enemy in that direction. In the meantime the whole
							Austrian army approached from Alessandria and the engagement began. The Austrians at
							first repulsed the French, and Bonaparte saw all his great plans in jeopardy as he
							vainly besought his soldiers to make another stand. The defeat was soon turned,
							however, into one of his most brilliant victories, for Desaix had heard the firing and
							returned with his division. Meanwhile the aged and infirm Austrian commander had
							returned to Alessandria, supposing that the battle was won. The result was that the
							French troops, reÃ«nforced, returned to the attack and carried all before them. The
							brave Desaix, who had really saved the day, was killed; Bonaparte simply said nothing
							of his own temporary defeat, and added one more to the list of his great military
							triumphs. A truce was signed next day, and the Austrians retreated behind the Mincio
							River, leaving Bonaparte to restore French influence in Lombardy. The districts that
							he had "freed" were obliged to support his army, and the reestablished Cisalpine
							Republic was forced to pay a monthly tax of two million francs.</p>

						<note rend="right">Provisions of the Treaty of LunÃ©ville (February, 1801)</note>

						<p>In this, the arrangements made at Campo Formio were in general reaffirmed. France was

						<note rend="right">General peace of 1801</note>

						<p>Austria's retirement from the war was the signal for a general peace. Even England,
							who had not laid down her arms since hostilities first opened in 1793, saw no
							advantage in continuing a struggle in which the continental powers refused longer to
							participate. After defeating the French army which Bonaparte had left in Egypt, she
							suspended hostilities and opened negotiations with France in the autumn of 1801 i,
							although the definite peace was not signed until the following March, at Amiens.</p>

						<note rend="right">Two most important results of the treaties of 1801</note>
						<note rend="rght">(<hi rend="i">a</hi>) Bonaparte sells Louisiana to the United States
							(1803)</note>

						<p>Among many merely transitory results of these treaties, there were two provisions of
							momentous import. The first of these, Spain's cession of Louisiana to France in
							exchange for certain advantages in Italy, does not concern us here directly. But when
							war again broke out Bonaparte sold the district to the United States, and among the
							many transfers of territory that he made during his reign, none was more important
							than this. We must, however, treat with some detail the second of the great changes,
							which led to the complete reorganization of Germany and ultimately rendered possible
							the establishment of the present powerful German Empire.</p>

						<note rend="right">(<hi rend="i">b</hi>) Effects of the cession of the left bank of the
							Rhine to France</note>

						<p>In the Treaty of LunÃ©ville, the Emperor had agreed on his own part, as the ruler of
							Austria, and on the part of the Holy Roman Empire, that the French republic should
							thereafter possess in full sovereignty the territories of the Empire which lay on the
							left bank of the Rhine, and that thereafter the Rhine <note id="note_098"><hi

							<pb id="VAB8216-214" n="189"/> should form the boundary of France from the point where
							it left the Helvetic Republic to the point where it entered the Batavian Republic. As
							an inevitable consequence of this cession, numerous rulers and towns-- nearly a
							hundred in number-- found themselves dispossessed wholly or in part of their lands.
							The territories involved included the Palatinate and the duchy of JÃ¼lich (both of
							which then belonged to Bavaria), the possessions of the archbishops of Treves and
							Cologne and of the bishop of Liege, the ancient free cities of Worms, Speyer, and
							Cologne, Prussia's duchy of Cleves, besides the tiny realms of dozens of counts and
							abbots.</p>

						<note rend="right">Only the hereditary princes to be indemnified</note>

						<p>The Empire bound itself by the treaty to furnish the <hi rend="i">hereditary</hi>
							princes who had been forced to give up their territories to France "an indemnity
							within the Empire." Those who did not belong to the class of hereditary rulers were of
							course the bishops and abbots and the free cities. The ecclesiastical princes were
							forbidden as clergymen to marry, and consequently could have no lawful heirs. Hence if
							they were deprived of their realms they might be adequately indemnified by a pension
							for life, with no fear of injustice to their heirs, since they could have none. As for
							the towns, once so prosperous and important, they now seemed scarcely worth
							considering to the more powerful rulers of Germany. Indeed it seemed absurd at the
							opening of the nineteenth century that a single town should be permitted to constitute
							an independent state with its own system of coinage and its particular customs
							lines.</p>

						<note rend="right">The ecclesiastical states and the free towns to be used to indemnify
							the hereditary rulers</note>

						<p>There was, however, no unoccupied land within the Empire with which to indemnify even
							the hereditary princes, like the elector of Bavaria, the margrave of Baden, the king
							of Prussia, or the Emperor himself, who had seen their possessions on the left bank of
							the Rhine divided up into French departments. It was understood by France, and by the
							princes concerned, that the ecclesiastical rulers and the free towns should pay the
							costs of this cession by sacrificing their territories on the right bank as well as on
							the left. The <hi rend="i">secularization</hi> of <pb id="VAB8216-215" n="190"/> the
							church lands,-- as the process of transferring them to lay rulers was called,-- and
							the annexation of the free towns implied a veritable revolution in the old Holy Roman
							Empire, for the possessions of the ecclesiastical princes were vast in extent and were
							widely scattered, thus contributing largely to the disunion of Germany.</p>

						<note rend="right">The work of the imperial commission in reconstructing Germany</note>

						<p>A commission of German princes was appointed to undertake the reconstruction of the
							map; and the final distribution was preceded by an undignified scramble among the
							hereditary rulers for bits of territory. All turned to Paris for favors, since it was
							really the First Consul and his minister, Talleyrand, who determined the distribution.
							Needy princelings are said to have caressed Talleyrand's poodle and played "drop the
							handkerchief" with his niece in the hope of adding a monastery or a shabby village to
							their share. At last the Imperial Commission, with France's help, finished its
							intricate task and the <hi rend="i">Reichsdeputationshauptschluss</hi>, as the outcome
							of their labors was officially called, was ratified by the diet in 1803.</p>

						<note rend="right">Destruction of the ecclesiastical states and free towns</note>

						<p>All the ecclesiastical states except Mayence were turned over to lay rulers, while of
							the forty-eight imperial cities only six were left. Three of these-- Hamburg, Bremen,
							and LÃ¼beck-- still exist as members of the new German Empire. No map could make clear
							all the shiftings of territory which the Imperial Commission sanctioned. A few

							Bavaria, for more considerable sacrifices on the left bank, was rewarded with the
							bishoprics of WÃ¼rzburg, Bamberg, Freising, Augsburg, and Passau, besides the lands of
							twelve abbots and of seventeen free towns; which materially extended his boundaries.
							Austria got the bishoprics of Brixen and Trent; the duke of WÃ¼rtemberg and the
							margrave of Baden also rounded out and consolidated their dominions. A host of princes
							and counts received their little allotments of land or were assigned an income of a
							few thousand gulden to solace their woes,<ref id="ref_100" rend="super"
								target="note_100">1</ref> but the more important rulers carried off the lion's share
							of the spoils. Bonaparte wished to add Parma as well as Piedmont to France, so the

							the archbishopric of Salzburg.<ref id="ref_101" rend="super" target="note_101"

						<note rend="right">Over two hundred independent states extinguished</note>

						<p>These bewildering details are only given here to make clear the hopelessly minute
							subdivision of the old Holy Roman Empire and the importance of the partial
							amalgamation which took place in 1803. One hundred and twelve sovereign and
							independent states lying to the east of the Rhine were wiped out by being annexed to
							larger states, such as Prussia, Austria, Bavaria, WÃ¼rtemberg, Baden, Hesse, etc.,
							while nearly a hundred more had disappeared when the left bank of the Rhine was
							converted into'departments by the French.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bonaparte's purpose to gain allies in southern Germany</note>

						<p>Although Germany never sank to a lower degree of nationaldegradation than at this

						<note rend="right">General disorder in France under the Directory</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">27.</hi> Bonaparte was by no means merely a military genius; he was a
							distinguished statesman as well. He found France in a sad plight after ten years of
							rapid and radical change, incompetent government, and general disorder. The turmoil of
							the Reign of Terror had been followed by the mismanagement and corruption of the
							Directory. There had been no opportunity to perfect the elaborate and thoroughgoing
							reforms introduced by the first National Assembly, and the work of the Revolution
							remained but half done. Bonaparte's officials reported to him that the highways were
							infested with murderous bands of robbers, that the roads and bridges were dilapidated
							and the harbors filled with sand. The manufacturers and business men were discouraged
							and industry was demoralized.</p>

						<note rend="right">The paper money</note>

						<p>The financial situation was intolerable. The disorder had reached such a pitch that
							scarcely any taxes were paid in the year 1800. The <hi rend="i">assignats</hi> had so
							depreciated in March, 1796, that three hundred francs in paper were required to
							procure one in gold. Thereupon the Directory had withdrawn them at one thirtieth of
							their value and substituted another kind of paper money which rapidly declined in
							value in the same way that the <hi rend="i">assignats</hi> had done. The hard-beset
							government had issued all sorts of government securities which were at a hopeless
							discount, and had repudiated a considerable part of the public debt.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bonaparte's financial measures</note>

						<p>The First Consul and his able ministers began at once to devise measures to remedy
							the difficulties, and his officials, <pb id="VAB8216-219" n="0194"/> scattered
							throughout France, saw to it that the new laws were enforced. The police was
							everywhere reorganized and the robbers brought to summary justice. The tax rate was
							fixed and the taxes regularly collected. A sinking fund was established designed
							gradually to extinguish the public debt; this served to raise the credit of the State.
							New government securities replaced the old ones, and a Bank of France was founded to
							stimulate business. The Directory had so grossly mismanaged the disposal of the lands
							of the clergy and emigrant nobles that they had brought in very little to the
							government. Bonaparte carefully cherished what remained unsold and made the most of
							it.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Convention had separated Church and State (February, 1795), but
							the Directory continued to persecute the clergy</note>

						<p>In no respect had the revolutionary governments been less successful than in dealing
							with the Church. We have seen how those priests who refused to swear to support the
							Civil Constitution of the Clergy had been persecuted. After HÃ©bert's attempt to
							replace Christianity by the worship of Reason, and that of Robespierre to establish a
							new deistic worship of the Supreme Being, the Catholic churches began early in 1795 to
							be opened once more, and the Convention declared (February 21, 1795) that the
							government would no longer concern itself with religion; it would not in the future
							pay salaries to any clergyman, and every one should be free to worship in any way he
								pleased.<ref id="ref_102" rend="super" target="note_102">1</ref> Thereupon both the
							"constitutional" and the non-juring clergy began actively to reorganize their
							churches. But while thousands of priests managed to perform their duties, the
							Convention, and later the Directory, continued <note id="note_102"><ref
									target="ref_102" rend="super">1</ref> This first law separating Church and State
								is interesting in view of the efforts which are now being made in France to effect
								the same result (see below, sect. 62). The Convention's decree read as follows: "No
								form of worship shall be interfered with. The Republic will subsidize none of them.
								It will furnish no buildings for religious exercises nor any dwellings for
								clergymen. The ceremonies of all religions are forbidden outside of the confines of
								the place chosen for their performance. The law recognizes no minister of religion
								and no one is to appear in public with costumes or ornaments used in religious
								ceremonies." The Convention gruffly added other limitations on religious freedom. It
								required, for example, that all services be conducted in a semi-private manner, with
								none of the old gorgeous display or public ceremonials and processions.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-220" n="195"/> to persecute those who did not take a new oath to
							submit to the laws of the republic, and many suspected of hostility to the government
							were exiled or imprisoned.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bonaparte hopes to gain the support of the church</note>

						<p>General Bonaparte, although himself a deist, nevertheless fully appreciated the
							importance of gaining the support of the Church and the Pope, and consequently,
							immediately upon becoming First Consul, he set to work to settle the religious
							difficulties. He freed the imprisoned priests upon their promising not to oppose the
							constitution, while those who had been exiled began to return in considerable numbers
							after the 18th Brumaire. Sunday, which had been abolished by the republican calendar,
							was once more generally observed, and all the revolutionary holidays, except July 14,
							the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille, and September 22, the first day of the
							republican year, were done away with.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Concordat of 1801</note>

						<p>A formal treaty with the Pope, known as the <hi rend="i">Concordat</hi>, was
							concluded in September, 1801, which was destined to remain in force for over a hundred
							years. It declared that the Roman Catholic religion was that of the great majority of
							the French citizens and that its rites might be freely observed; that the Pope and the
							French government should arrange a new division of the country into bishoprics; that
							the bishops should be appointed by the First Consul and confirmed by the Pope, and the
							priests should be chosen by the bishops. Both bishops and priests were to receive a
							suitable remuneration from the government, but were to be required to swear to support
							the Constitution of the republic. The churches which had not been sold should be put
							at the disposition of the bishops, but the Pope agreed never to disturb in any way
							those who had acquired the former property of the clergy.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bonaparte brings the Church under the control of the State</note>

						<p>It is to be observed that Bonaparte showed no inclination to separate Church and
							State, but carefully brought the Church under the control of the State by vesting the
							appointment of the bishops in the head of the government,-- the First Consul. The
							Pope's confirmation was likely to be a mere form. The <pb id="VAB8216-221" n="196"/>
							bishops were to choose no priests who were not agreeable to the government, nor was
							any papal bull or decree to be published in France without its permission.<ref
								id="ref_103" rend="super" target="note_103">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">How the Revolution had changed the Church</note>

						<p>In some ways the arrangements of the Concordat of 1801 resembled those which
							prevailed under the <hi rend="i">ancien rÃ©gime</hi>, but the Revolution had swept away
							the whole medieval substructure of the Church, its lands and feudal rights, the
							tithes, the monks and nuns with their irrevocable vows enforced by law, the Church
							courts, the monopoly of religion, and the right to persecute heretics,-- all of these
							had disappeared and General Bonaparte saw no reason for restoring any of them.</p>

						<note rend="right">The emigrant nobles permitted to return</note>

						<p>As for the emigrant nobles, Bonaparte decreed that no more names should be added to
							the lists. The striking of names from the list, and the return of confiscated lands
							that had not already been sold, he made favors to be granted by himself. Parents and
							relatives of emigrants were no longer to be regarded as incapable of holding public
							offices. In April, 1802, a general amnesty was issued, and no less than forty thousand
							families returned to France.</p>

						<note rend="right">Old habits resumed</note>

						<p>There was a gradual reaction from some of the innovations of the Reign of Terror. The
							old titles of address, Monsieur and Madame, again came into use instead of the
							revolutionary "Citizen." Streets which had been rebaptized with republican names
							resumed their former ones. Old titles of nobility were revived, and something very
							like a royal court began to develop at the Palace of the Tuileries; for Bonaparte, in
							all but his title, was already a king, and his wife, Josephine, a queen.</p>

						<note rend="right">The grateful reliance of the nation on Bonaparte</note>

						<p>It had been clear for some years that the nation was weary of political agitation.

						<p>One of the greatest and most permanent of Bonaparte's achievements still remains to

							was discussed in the Council of State, and the First Consul had many suggestions to
							make. The resulting codification of the civil law-- the <hi rend="i">Code
								NapolÃ©on</hi>-- is still used to-day, not only in France but also, with some
							modifications, in Rhenish Prussia, Bavaria, Baden, Holland, Belgium, Italy, and even
							in the state of Louisiana. The criminal and commercial law was also codified. These
							codes carried with them into foreign lands the principles of equality upon which they
							were based, and thus diffused the benefits of the Revolution beyond the borders of
							France.</p>

						<p>Bonaparte had always shown the instincts of a despotic ruler, and France really

							not averse to its traditional splendor, its palaces, ermine robes, and gay courtiers.
							A royalist plot gave him an excuse for secretly urging that he be made emperor. France
							might, he argued, be replunged into civil war as long as there was any chance of

						<note rend="right">A new royal court established in the Tuileries</note>

						<p>December 2, 1804, General Bonaparte was crowned, in the Cathedral of Notre Dame, as
							Napoleon I, emperor of the French. The Pope consented to grace the occasion, but the
							new monarch seized the golden laurel chaplet before the Pope could take it up, and
							placed it on his own head, since he wished the world to understand that he owed the
							crown not to the head of the Church but to his own sagacity and military genius. A
							royal court was reÃ«stablished in the Tuileries, and SÃ©gur, an emigrant noble, and
							Madame de Campan-- one of Marie Antoinette's ladies-in-waiting, who had been earning
							an honest livelihood by conducting a girls' school-- were called in to show the new
							courtiers how to deport themselves according to the rules of etiquette which had
							prevailed before the red cap of liberty had come into fashion. A new nobility was
							established to take the place of that abolished by the first National Assembly in
							1790: Bonaparte's uncle was made Grand Almoner; Talleyrand, Lord High Chamberlain;
							General Duroc, High Constable; and fourteen of the most important generals were
							exalted to the rank of Marshals of France. The stanch republicans, who had believed
							that the court pageantry of the <hi rend="i">old rÃ©gime</hi> had gone to stay, were

						<p><hi rend="b">28.</hi> A great majority of the French undoubtedly longed for peace,
							but Napoleon's position made war a personal necessity e necessity peace, for him. No
							one saw this more clearly than he. "If," he said to his Council of State in the summer
							of 1802, "the European states intend ever to renew the war, the sooner it comes the
							better. Every day the remembrance of their defeats grows dimmer and at the same time
							the prestige of our victories pales. ... France needs glorious deeds, and hence war.
							She must be the first among the states or she is lost. I shall put up with peace as
							long as our neighbors can maintain it, but I shall regard it as an advantage if they
							force me to take up my arms again before they rust. ... In our position I shall look
							on each conclusion of peace as simply a short armistice, and I regard myself as
							destined during my term of office to fight almost without intermission."</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon dreams of becoming emperor of Europe</note>

						<p>On another occasion, in 1804, Napoleon said, "There will be no rest in Europe until

							distribute kingdoms to his lieutenants, and shall make this one king of Italy, that
							one of Bavaria; this one ruler of Switzerland, that one governor of Holland, each

						<note rend="right">Reasons for England's persistent opposition to Napoleon</note>

						<p>There were many reasons why the peace with England (concluded at Amiens in March,
							1802) should be speedily broken, especially as the First Consul was not averse to a
							renewal of the war. The obvious intention of Napoleon to bring as much of Europe under
							his control as he could, and the imposition of high duties on English goods in those
							territories that he already controlled, filled commercial and industrial England with
							apprehension. The English people longed for peace, but peace appeared only to offer an
							opportunity to Napoleon to develop French commerce at their expense. This was the
							secret of England's pertinacity. All the other European powers concluded treaties with
							Napoleon at some time during his reign. England alone did not lay down her arms a
							second time until the emperor of the French was a prisoner.</p>

						<note rend="right">War between France and England renewed in 1803. Napoleon institutes a
							coast blockade</note>

						<p>War was renewed between England and France, May, 1803. Bonaparte promptly occupied
							Hanover, of which it will be remembered that the English king was elector, and
							declared the coast blockaded from Hanover to Otranto. Holland, Spain, and the Ligurian
							Republic-- formerly the republic of Genoa-- were, by hook or by crook, induced to
							agree to furnish each their contingent of men or money to the French army and to
							exclude English ships from their ports.</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon threatens to invade England</note>

						<p>To cap the climax, England was alarmed by the appearance of a French army at
							Boulogne, just across the Channel. A great number of flatboats were collected and
							troops trained to embark and disembark. Apparently Napoleon harbored the firm purpose
							of invading the British Isles. Yet the transportation of a large body of troops across
							the English Channel, trifling as is the distance, would have been very hazardous, and
							by many it was deemed downright impossible.<ref id="ref_107" rend="super"

						<note rend="right">Alexander I joins England, April, 1805</note>

						<p>The new Tsar, Alexander I,<ref id="ref_108" rend="super" target="note_108">1</ref>
							had submitted a plan for the reconciliation of France and England in August, 1803; the
							rejection of this, the continued aggressions of Napoleon, and above all, his shocking
							execution of the duke of Enghien, a Bourbon prince whom he had arrested on the ground
							that he was plotting against the First Consul, roused the Tsar's indignation and led
							him to conclude an alliance with England, the objects of which were the expulsion of
							the French from Holland, Switzerland, Italy, and Hanover, and the settlement of
							European affairs upon a sound and permanent basis by a great international
							congress.</p>

						<note rend="right">Austria joins the coalition of 1805, but Prussia remains
							neutral</note>

						<p>Russia and England were immediately joined by Austria, who found Napoleon intent upon
							developing in northern Italy a strong power which would threaten her borders. He had
							been crowned king of Italy in May, 1805, and had annexed the Ligurian Republic to
							France. There were rumors, too, that he was planning to seize the Venetian territories
							which had been assigned to Austria at Campo Formio. The timid king of Prussia,
							Frederick William III, could not be induced to join the alliance, nor would he ally
							himself with Napoleon, although he was offered the electorate of Hanover, a very
							substantial inducement. He persisted in maintaining a neutrality which was to cost him
							dear.</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon fails to get control of the sea and turns his attention to

						<p>Napoleon had been endeavoring to get the advantage of the English on the sea, for
							there was no possibility of ferrying his armies across to England so long as English

							to free the French ships and concentrate them in the Channel proved vain, for Lord

						<note rend="right">Napoleon captures Mack's army at Ulm (October 20, 1805) and then
							occupies Vienna</note>

						<p>He misled Austria by massing troops about Strassburg and pretending that he was going
							to march through the Black Forest. Consequently, the Austrian general, Mack,
							concentrated his forces about Ulm in order to be ready for the French when they should
							appear. Napoleon was, however, really taking his armies around to the north through
							Mayence and Coblenz, so that he occupied Munich, October 14, and cut off the Austrians
							from Vienna in somewhat the same way that he had done when he crossed the St. Bernard
							Pass in i8oo. He then moved westward, and six days later General Mack, finding himself
							surrounded and shut up in Ulm, was forced to capitulate, and Napoleon made prisoners
							of a whole Austrian army, sixty thousand strong, without losing more than a few
							hundred of his own men. The French could now safely march down the Danube to Vienna,
							which they reached, October 31.</p>

						<note rend="right">Battle of Austerlitz (December 2, 1805)</note>

						<p>Emperor Francis II had retired before the approaching enemy and was concentrating his
							troops north of Vienna in Moravia. Here he had been joined by the Russian army. The
							allies determined to risk a battle with the French and occupied a favorable position
							on a hill near the village of Austerlitz, which was to be made forever famous by the
							terrible winter battle which occurred there, December 2. The Russians having descended
							the hill to attack the weaker wing of Napoleon's army, the French occupied the heights
							which the Russians had deserted, and poured a deadly fire upon the enemy's rear. The
							allies were routed and thousands of their troops were drowned as they sought to escape
							across the thin ice of a little lake which lay at the foot of the hill. The Tsar
							withdrew the <pb id="VAB8216-230" n="203"/> remnants of his forces, while the Emperor
							in despair agreed to submit to a humiliating peace, the Treaty of Pressburg.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Treaty of Pressburg (December 26, 1805)</note>

						<p>By this treaty Austria recognized all Napoleon's changes in Italy, and ceded to his
							kingdom of Italy that portion of the Venetian territory which she had received at
							Campo Formio. Moreover, she ceded Tyrol to Bavaria, which was friendly to Napoleon,
							and other of her possessions to WÃ¼rtemberg and Baden, also friends of the French
							emperor. As head of the Holy Roman Empire, Francis II also agreed that the rulers of
							Bavaria and WÃ¼rtemberg should be raised to the rank of kings, and that they and the
							grand duke of Baden should enjoy "the plenitude of sovereignty" and all rights derived
							there-from, precisely as did the rulers of Austria and Prussia.</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon forms a new dependency,-- the Confederation of the Rhine
							(1806)</note>

						<p>These provisions of the Treaty of Pressburg are of vital importance in the history of
							Germany. By explicitly declaring several of the larger of the German states altogether
							independent of the Emperor, Napoleon prepared the way for the formation in Germany of
							another dependency which, like Holland and the kingdom of Italy, should support France
							in future wars. In the summer of 1806 Bavaria, WÃ¼rtemberg, Baden, and thirteen lesser
							German states united into a league known as the Confederation of the Rhine. This union
							was to be under the "protection" of the French emperor and to furnish him with
							sixty-three thousand soldiers, who were to be organized by French officers and to be
							at his disposal when he needed them.</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon refuses longer to recognize the existence of the Holy Roman
							Empire</note>

						<p>On August 1 Napoleon announced to the diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Ratisbon that
							he had, "in the dearest interests of his people and of his neighbors," accepted the
							title of Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine, and that he could therefore no
							longer recognize the existence of the Holy Roman Empire, which had long been merely a
							shadow of its former self. A considerable number of its members had become sovereign
							powers and its continuation could only be a source of dissension and confusion.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-231" n="204"/>

						<note rend="right">Francis II assumes the title of Emperor of Austria (1804)</note>

						<p>The Emperor, Francis II, like his predecessors for several hundred years, was the
							ruler of the various Austrian dominions. He was officially known as King of Hungary,
							Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Galicia, and Laodomeria, Duke of Lorraine, Venice,
							Salzburg, etc., etc. When, however, the First Consul received as ruler of France the
							title of Emperor of the French, Francis determined to substitute for his long array of
							individual titles the brief and dignified formula, Hereditary Emperor of Austria and
							King of Hungary.</p>

						<note rend="right">Francis abdicates as Emperor (August 6, 1806) and the Holy Roman
							Empire is dissolved</note>

						<p>After the Treaty of Pressburg and the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine, he
							became convinced of the utter impossibility of longer fulfilling the duties of his
							office as head of the Holy Roman Empire and accordingly abdicated on August 6, 1806.
							In this way he formally put an end to a line of rulers who had, for well-nigh eighteen
							centuries, proudly maintained that they were the successors of Augustus Caesar, the
							first Roman emperor. The slight bond that had held the practically independent German
							states together was now dissolved, and the way was left clear for a series of
							reconstructions which have resulted in the formation of a new and powerful German
							Empire with the king of Prussia at its head. But the story of this must be
							deferred.</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon assigns Naples to Joseph Bonaparte and Holland to
							Louis</note>

						<p>Napoleon went on steadily developing what he called "the real French Empire," namely,
							the dependent states under his control which lay outside the bounds of France itself.
							Immediately after the battle of Austerlitz, he had proclaimed that Ferdinand IV, the
							Bourbon king of Naples, had ceased to reign. He ordered one of his generals to proceed
							to southern Italy and "hurl from the throne that guilty woman," Queen Caroline, who
							had favored the English and entertained Lord Nelson. In March he appointed his elder
							brother, Joseph, king of Naples and Sicily, and a younger brother, Louis, king of
							Holland.</p>

						<note rend="right">Prussia forced into war with France</note>

						<p>One of the most important of the continental states, it will have been noticed, had
							taken no part as yet in the opposition <pb id="VAB8216-232" n="205"/> to the extension
							of Napoleon's influence. Prussia, the first power to conclude peace with the new
							French republic in 1795, had since that time maintained a strict neutrality. Had it
							yielded to Tsar Alexander's persuasions and joined the coalition in 18o5, it might
							have turned the tide at Austerlitz, or at any rate have encouraged further resistance
							to the conqueror. The hesitation of Frederick William III at that juncture proved a
							grave mistake, for Napoleon now forced him into war at a time when he could look for
							no efficient assistance from Russia or the other powers.</p>

						<note rend="right">Question of Hanover</note>

						<p>The immediate cause of the declaration of war was the disposal of Hanover. This
							electorate Frederick William had consented to hold provisionally, pending its possible
							transfer to him should the English king give his assent. Prussia was anxious to get
							possession of Hanover because it lay just between her older possessions and the
							territory which she had gained in the redistribution of 1803.</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon's insolent behavior toward Prussia</note>

						<p>Napoleon, as usual, did not fail either to see or to use his advantage. His conduct
							toward Prussia was most insolent. After setting her at enmity with England and
							promising that she should have Hanover, he unblushingly offered to restore the
							electorate to George III. His insults now began to arouse the national spirit in
							Prussia, and the reluctant Frederick William was forced by the party in favor of war,
							which included his beautiful queen, Louise, and the great statesman Stein, to break
							with Napoleon.</p>

						<note rend="right">Decisive defeat of the Prussian army at Jena, 1806</note>

						<p>The Prussian army was, however, as has been well said, "only that of Frederick the
							Great grown twenty years older"; one of Frederick's generals, the aged duke of
							Brunswick, who had issued the famous manifesto in 1792, was its leader. A double
							defeat near Jena (October 14, 1806) put Prussia entirely in the hands of her enemy.
							This one disaster produced complete demoralization throughout the country. Fortresses
							were surrendered without resistance and the king fled to the uttermost parts of his
							realm on the Russian boundary.</p>

						<note rend="right">The campaign in Poland (November-June, 1806-1807)</note>

						<p>After crushing Prussia, Napoleon led his army into what had once been the kingdom of
							Poland. Here he spent a winter of great hardships and dangers in operations against
							the Russians and their feeble allies, the Prussians. He closed a difficult campaign
							far from France by the signal victory of Friedland (not far from KÃ¶nigsberg), and then
							arranged for an interview with the Tsar. The two rulers met on a raft in the river
							Niemen (June 25, 1807), and there privately arranged the provisions of the Treaty of
							Tilsit between France, Russia, and Prussia. The Tsar, Alexander I, was completely won
							over by Napoleon's skillful diplomacy. He shamefully deserted his he less ally,
							Frederick William III of Prussia, and turned against England, whose subsidies he had
							been accepting.</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon dismembers Prussia in order to create the grand duchy of

						<p>Napoleon had no mercy upon Prussia, which he ruthlessly dismembered by depriving it
							of all its possessions west of the Elbe River, and all that it had gained in the
							second and third partitions of Poland. From the lands which he forced Frederick
							William to cede to him at Tilsit, Napoleon established two new French dependencies by
							forming the Polish territories into the grand duchy of Warsaw, of which his friend,
							the king of Saxony, was made ruler; and creating from the western territory (to which
							he later added Hanover) the kingdom of Westphalia for his brother Jerome.</p>

						<note rend="right">Terms of the secret alliance of Tilsit between Napoleon and the

						<p>Russia, on the other hand, he treated with marked consideration, and proposed that he

							Europe and Alexander in the east. The Tsar consented to the dismemberment of Prussia
							and agreed to recognize all the sweeping changes which Napoleon had made during
							previous years. He secretly promised, if George III refused to conclude peace, to join
							France against England, and to force Denmark and Portugal to exclude English ships
							from their ports. In this way England would be cut off from all of western Europe,
							since Napoleon would have the whole coast practically under his control. In return for
							these promises, Napoleon engaged <pb id="VAB8216-234" n="207"/> to aid the Tsar in

							annihilated off Cape Trafalgar the French squadron which had ventured out from Cadiz.
							After Tilsit, Napoleon set himself more earnestly than ever to bring England to terms
							by ruining her commerce and industry, since he had no hope of subduing her by arms. He
							proposed to make "that race of shopkeepers" cry for peace by absolutely cutting them

						<note rend="right">Napoleon's Berlin Decree (November 21, 1806)</note>

						<p>In May, 1806, England had declared the coast from the mouth of the Elbe to Brest to

							would capture any vessel that attempted to enter or leave any of the ports between

							natural right to use the same measures against her that she employed against him. He
							therefore retaliated by declaring the British Isles in a state of blockade and
							forbidding all commerce with them. Letters or packages addressed to England or to an
							Englishman, or even written in the English language, were not to be permitted to pass
							through the mails in the countries he controlled. All trade in English goods was
							prohibited. Any British subject discovered in the countries occupied by French troops,
							or in the territories of Napoleon's allies, was to be regarded as a prisoner of war
							and his property as a lawful prize. This was, of course, only a "paper" blockade,
							since France and her allies could do little more than capture, now and then, some
							unfortunate vessel which was supposed to be coming from, or bound to, an English
							port.</p>

							France could not but fill the nation with pride.</p>

						<note rend="right">Public works</note>

						<p>He sought to gain popular approval by great public improvements. He built magnificent

							constructing bridges and triumphal arches that kept fresh in the people's minds the
							recollection of his victories. By these means he gradually converted a medieval town

						<note rend="right">The "university" established by Napoleon in 1806</note>

						<p>In order to be sure that the young people were brought up to venerate his name and

							<pb id="VAB8216-238" n="211"/> comprised all the instruction from the most elementary
							to the most advanced. A "grand master" was put at its head, and a university council
							of thirty members drew up regulations for all the schools, prepared the text-books,
							and controlled the teachers, high and low, throughout France. The university had its
							own large endowment, and its instructors were to be suitably prepared in a normal
							school established for the purpose.</p>

						<note rend="right">The <hi rend="i">Imperial Catechism</hi></note>

						<p>The government could at any time interfere if it disapproved of the teaching; the

						<note rend="right">The new nobility and the Legion of Honor</note>

						<p>Napoleon not only created a new nobility but he endeavored to assure the support of

							founded. The "princes," whom he nominated, received an annual income of two hundred
							thousand francs. The ministers of state, senators, members of his Council of State,
							and the archbishops received the title of Count and a revenue of thirty thousand
							francs, and so on. The army was not forgotten, for Napoleon felt that to be his chief
							support. The incomes of his marshals were enormous, and brave actions among the
							soldiers were rewarded with the decoration of the Legion of Honor.</p>

						<note rend="roght">Napoleon's discontent with his achievements</note>

						<p>Napoleon was, however, never content with his achievements or his glory. On the day

							<pb id="VAB8216-239" n="212"/> remonstrating, he added: "I admit that my career has
							been brilliant and that I have made a good record. But what a difference is there if
							we compare ours with ancient times. Take Alexander the Great, for example. When he
							announced himself the son of Jupiter, the whole East, except his mother, Aristotle,
							and a few Athenian pedants, believed this to be true. But now, should I nowadays
							declare myself the son of the Eternal Father, there is n't a fishwife who would n't
							hiss me. No, the nations are too sophisticated, nothing great is any longer
							possible."</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon's depositism in France</note>

						<p>As time went on Napoleon's despotism grew more and more oppressive. No less than
							thirty-five hundred prisoners of state were arrested at his command, one because he
							hated Napoleon, another because in his letters he expressed sentiments adverse to the
							government. No grievance was too petty to attract the attention of the emperor's
							jealous eye. He ordered the title of <hi rend="i">A History of Bonaparte</hi> to be
							changed to <hi rend="i">The History of the Campaigns of Napoleon the Great</hi>. He
							forbade the performance of certain of Schiller's and Goethe's plays in German towns,
							as tending to arouse the patriotic discontent of the people with his rule.</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon's European power threatened by the growth of national

						<p>Up to this time Napoleon had had only the opposition of the several European courts
							to overcome in the extension of his power. The people of the various states which he

							was clear, however, that as soon as the national spirit was once awakened, the highly
							artificial system created by the French emperor would collapse. His first serious
							reverse came from the people, and from an unexpected quarter.</p>

						<note rend="right">A French army occupies Portugal (November, 1807)</note>

						<p>After concluding the Treaty of Tilsit, Napoleon turned his attention to the Spanish
							peninsula. He was on friendly terms with the court of Spain, but little Portugal
							continued to admit English ships to her harbors. In October he ordered the Portuguese
							government to declare war on England and to confiscate <pb id="VAB8216-240" n="213"/>
							all English property. Upon its refusal to obey the second part of the order, he
							commanded General Junot to invade Portugal and take charge of the government.
							Thereupon the royal family resolved to take refuge in their vast Brazilian empire, and
							when Junot reached Lisbon they were receiving the salutes of the English squadron as
							they moved down the Tagus on the way to their new home across the Atlantic. Easy and

						<note rend="right">Napoleon makes his brother Joseph king of Spain (1808)</note>

						<p>Owing to quarrels and dissensions in the Spanish royal family, Spain also seemed to

						<note rend="right">Revolt in Spain against the foreign ruler (1808)</note>

						<p>Joseph entered Madrid in July, armed with excellent intentions and a new

							stirred up the people against Napoleon, on the ground that he was an enemy of the Pope
							and an oppressor of the Church. One French army was captured at Bail6n, and another

						<note id="note_113"><ref target="ref_113" rend="super">1</ref> Charles IV resigned all

						<note rend="right">Spain subdued by arms (December, 1808)</note>

						<p>In November the French emperor himself led into Spain a magnificent army, two hundred
							thousand strong, in the best of condition and commanded by his ablest marshals. The
							Spanish troops, perhaps one hundred thousand in number, were ill clad and inadequately
							equipped; what was worse, they were over-confident in view of their late victory. They
							were, of course, defeated, and Madrid surrendered on December 4. Napoleon thereupon
							issued a proclamation to the Spanish people in which he said, "It depends upon you
							alone whether this moderate constitution that I offer you shall henceforth be your
							law. Should all my efforts prove vain, and should you refuse to justify my confidence,
							then nothing will remain for me but to treat you as a conquered province and find a
							new throne for my brother. In that case I shall myself assume the crown of Spain and
							teach the ill-disposed to respect that crown, for God has given me the power and the
							will to overcome all obstacles."</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon begins radical reform in Spain</note>

						<p>Decrees were immediately issued in which Napoleon abolished all vestiges of the

							laws to carry on any industry that he pleased. The tribunal of the Inquisition, for
							which Spain had been noted for hundreds of years,<ref id="ref_114" rend="super"
								target="note_114">1</ref> was abolished and its property seized. The monasteries and
							convents were to be reduced to one third of their number, and no one, for the time
							being, was to be permitted to take any monastic vows. The customs lines which
							separated the Spanish provinces and hampered trade were obliterated and the
							customhouses transferred to the frontiers of the kingdom. These measures illustrate
							the way in which Napoleon spread the principles of the French Revolution by arms in
							those states which, in spite of their benevolent despots, still clung to their

							due to the persistent hostility of the Spanish people.</p>

						<note rend="right">Austria takes the field against Napoleon (April, 1809)</note>

						<p>Austria was fearful, since Napoleon had gained Russia's friendship, that he might be
							tempted, should he succeed in putting down the stubborn resistance of the Spaniards,
							still further to increase his empire at her expense. She had been reorganizing and
							increasing her army, and decided that it was best to strike while some two hundred
							thousand of Napoleon's troops were busy in Spain. So the Austrian emperor's brother,
							the Archduke Charles, led his forces westward in April, 1809, and issued an appeal to
							the German nation in which he urged them to imitate the heroic Spaniards and rise
							against their oppressors. Although there was an ever-growing party in Prussia and
							southern Germany which longed to throw off Napoleon's yoke, the king of Prussia
							refused to join Austria unless Russia would lend her aid. The monarchs who composed
							the Confederation of the Rhine also clung to their "Protector," so Austria was left to
							meet "the enemy of Europe" single-handed.</p>

						<note rend="right">Battles of Aspern and Wagram (May and July, 1808)</note>

						<p>After defeating the Archduke Charles in Bavaria, Napoleon marched on to Vienna, but
							he did not succeed in crushing the Austrian forces as easily and promptly as he had
							done at Austerlitz in 1805. Indeed he was actually defeated at the battle of Aspern
							(May 21-22), but finally gained a rather doubtful victory in the fearful battle of
							Wagram, near Vienna (July 5-6). Austria was disheartened and again consented to
							conclude a peace quite as humiliating as that of Pressburg.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Treaty of Vienna (October, 1809)</note>

						<p>She had announced that her object in going to war once more was the destruction of
							Napoleon's system of dependent states and had proposed "to restore to their rightful

							usurpation." The battle of Wagram put an <pb id="VAB8216-246" n="216"/> end to these
							dreams and the emperor of Austria was forced to surrender to the victor and his
							friends extensive territories, together with four million Austrian subjects. A strip
							of land, including Salzburg, was given to the king of Bavaria; on the north, Galicia
							(which Austria had received in the first partition of Poland) was ceded to Napoleon's
							ally, the grand duke of Warsaw; and finally, along the Adriatic, Napoleon exacted a
							district which he added to his own empire under the name of the Illyrian Provinces.
							This last cession served to cut Austria entirely off from the sea.</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon marries the Archduchess Maria Louisa (April 1810)</note>

						<p>The new Austrian. minister, Metternich, was anxious to establish a permanent alliance

						<note rend="right">Napoleon "reunites" the Papal States to France (1809)</note>

						<p>While Napoleon was in the midst of the war with Austria, he had issued a proclamation

						<note rend="right">Maximum extent of Napoleon's power</note>

						<p>Napoleon had now reached the zenith of his power. All of western Europe, except

							The emperor of the French was also king of Italy and "protector" of the Confederation
							of the Rhine, which now included all of the German states except Austria and the
							remains of the kingdom of Prussia. Napoleon's brother Joseph was king of Spain, and
							his brother-in-law, Murat, king of Naples. Poland once more appeared on the map as the

							his later title of the Duke of Wellington) had landed English troops in Portugal
							(August, 1808) and forced Junot and the French army to evacuate the country. While

							Torres Vedras-- on a rocky promontory near Lisbon. From here he could carry on his
							operations against the French with security and success. He and his Spanish allies
							continued to occupy the attention of about three hundred thousand of Napoleon's troops
							and some of his very best generals. So Napoleon never really conquered Spain, which
							proved a constant drain on his resources, a source of humiliation to him and of
							exultation and encouragement to his enemies.</p>

						<note rend="right">Relations between Napoleon and Alexander I of Russia</note>

						<p>Among the continental states Russia alone was entirely out of Napoleon's control. Up

							reestablishing Poland as a national kingdom, which might threaten Russia's interests,
							was a constant source of apprehension to Alexander.</p>

						<note rend="right">Russia could not afford to enforce the continental blockade</note>

						<p>The chief difficulty lay, however, in Russia's unwillingness to enforce the

						<note rend="right">Napoleon's campaign in Russia (1812)</note>

						<p>The story of the fearful Russian campaign which followed cannot be told here in
							detail. Napoleon had planned to take three years to conquer Russia, but he was forced
							on by the necessity of gaining at least one signal victory before he closed the first
							season's campaign. The Russians simply retreated and led him far within a hostile and
							devastated country before they offered battle at Borodino (September 7). Napoleon won
							the battle, but his army was reduced to something over one hundred thousand men when
							he entered Moscow a week later. The town had been set on fire by the Russians before
							his arrival; he found his position untenable, and had to retreat as winter came on.
							The cold, the lack of food, and the harassing attacks of the people along the route
							made that retreat the most signal military tragedy on record. Napoleon regained Poland
							early in December, accompanied by scarcely twenty thousand men of the five hundred
							thousand with whom he had opened the campaign less than six months before.<ref

						<note id="note_117"><ref target="ref_117" rend="super">1</ref> This does not mean that

						<p>He hastened back to Paris, where he freely misrepresented the true state of affairs,

							enormous, just those few had naturally survived who would be most essential in the

							called into service until 1814, besides older men who had been hitherto exempted.</p>

						<note rend="right">What Prussia had suffered from Napoleon</note>

						<p>The first of his allies to desert Napoleon was Prussia,-- and no wonder. She had felt
							his tyranny as no other country had. He had not only taken her lands; he had cajoled
							and insulted her; he had forced her to send her ablest minister, Stein, into exile
							because he had aroused the French emperor's dislike; he had opposed every measure of
							reform which might have served to strengthen the diminished kingdom which he had left
							to Frederick William III.</p>

						<note rend="right">Reform of Prussia after the battle of Jena</note>

						<p>Prussia, notwithstanding the reforms of Frederick the Great, had retained its
							half-feudal institutions down to the decisive defeat of Jena. The agricultural classes
							were serfs bound to the soil and compelled to work a certain part of each week for
							their lords without remuneration. The population was still divided into three distinct
							castes, nobles, burghers, and peasants, who could not acquire one another's land. The
							disaster of Jena and the losses at Tilsit convinced the statesmen of Prussia-- among
							whom Baron von Stein and Prince Hardenberg were conspicuous-- that the country's only
							hope of recovery was a complete social and political revolution not unlike that which
							had taken place in France. They saw that the old system must be abolished, the
							peasants freed, and the restrictions which hedged about the different classes done
							away with, before it would be possible to arouse public spirit to a point where a
							great popular uprising might expel the intruder forever.</p>

						<p>Every thoughtful Prussian had been deeply shocked by the cowardly way in which the

							reform. The University of Berlin, now one of the foremost institutions of learning in
							the world, was founded, and four hundred and fifty-eight students matriculated during
							the first year (1810-1811). The <hi rend="i">Gymnasien,</hi> or high schools, were
							also greatly improved. A League of Virtue (<hi rend="i">Tugendbund</hi>), which was

						<p>The Prussian contingent which Napoleon had ordered to support him in his campaign
							against Alexander was under the command of Yorck. It had held back and so was not
							involved in the destruction of the main army. On learning of Napoleon's retreat from
							Moscow, Yorck joined the Russians.</p>

						<note rend="right">Prussia joins Russia against Napoleon (February, 1813)</note>

						<p>This action of Yorck and the influence of public opinion finally induced the
							faint-hearted king, who was still apprehensive of Napoleon's vengeance, to sign a
							treaty with the Tsar (February 27, 1813), in which Russia agreed not to lay down arms
							until Prussia should be restored to a total area equal to that she had possessed
							before the fatal battle of Jena. It was understood that she should give up to the Tsar
							all that she had received in the second and third partitions of Poland and be
							indemnified by annexations in northern Germany. This proved a very important
							stipulation. On March 17 Frederick William issued a proclamation "To my People," in
							which he summoned his subjects-- Brandenburgers, Prussians, Silesians, Pomeranians,
							and Lithuanians-- to follow the example of the Spaniards and free their country from
							the rule of a faithless and insolent tyrant.</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon's campaign in Saxony (1813)</note>

						<p>Napoleon's situation was, however, by no means desperate so long as Italy, Austria,
							and the Confederation of the Rhine stood by him. With the new army which he had
							collected after his disastrous campaign in Russia the previous year, he marched to
							Leipzig, where he found the Russians and the Prussians under BlÃ¼cher awaiting him. He
							once more defeated the allies at LÃ¼tzen (May 2, 1813), and then moved on to Dresden,
							the capital of his faithful friend, the king of Saxony. During the summer he inflicted
							several defeats upon the allies, and on August 26-27 he won his last great victory,
							the battle of Dresden.</p>

						<note rend="right">Austria and Sweden turn against Napoleon</note>

						<p>Metternich's friendship had grown cold as Napoleon's position became more and more
							uncertain. He was willing to maintain the alliance between Austria and France if
							Napoleon would abandon a considerable portion of his conquests since 1806. As Napoleon
							refused to do this, Austria joined the allies in August. Meanwhile Sweden, which a
							year or two before had chosen one of Napoleon's marshals, Bernadotte, as its crown
								prince,<ref id="ref_119" rend="super" target="note_119">1</ref> also joined the
							allies and sent an army into northern Germany.</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon defeated in the battle of Leipzig (October, 1813)</note>

						<p>Finding that the allied armies of Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Sweden, under
							excellent generals like BlÃ¼cher and Bernadotte, had at last learned that it was
							necessary to cooperate if they hoped to crush their ever-alert enemy, and that they
							were preparing to cut him off from France, Napoleon retreated early in October to
							Leipzig. Here the tremendous "Battle of the Nations," as the Germans love to call it,
							raged for four days. No less than one hundred and twenty thousand men were killed or
							wounded and Napoleon was totally defeated (October 16-19).</p>

						<note rend="right">The dissolution of Napoleon's campus</note>

						<p>As the emperor of the French escaped across the Rhine with the remnants of his army,

							fled from his kingdom of Westphalia, and the Dutch drove the French officials out of
							Holland. Wellington had been steadily and successfully engaged in aiding the Spanish
							against their common enemy and by the end of 1813 Spain was practically cleared of the

							allies consequently marched into France, and the almost superhuman activity of the
							hard-pressed emperor could not prevent their occupation of Paris (March 31, 1814).
							Napoleon was forced to abdicate, and the allies, in seeming derision, granted him full

							to retain his imperial title. In reality he was a prisoner on his island kingdom, and

						<p>Within a year, encouraged by the dissensions of the allies and the unpopularity of

							not hostile, to his attempt to reestablish his power. Certainly no one could place
							confidence in his talk of peace and liberty. Moreover, whatever disagreement there
							might be among the allies on other matters, there was perfect unanimity in their
							attitude toward "the enemy and destroyer of the world's peace." They solemnly
							proclaimed him an outlaw, and devoted him to public vengeance.</p>

						<p>Upon learning that English troops under Wellington and a Prussian army under BlÃ¼cher

							Wellington then took his station south of Brussels, at Waterloo. Napoleon advanced
							against him (June 18, 1815) and might have defeated the English had they not been
							opportunely reinforced by BlÃ¼cher's Prussians, who had recovered themselves. As it
							was, Napoleon lost the most memorable of modern battles. Yet even if he had not been
							defeated at Waterloo, he could not long have opposed the vast armies which were being
							concentrated to overthrow him.</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon banished to St. Helena</note>

						<p>The fugitive emperor hastened to the coast, but found it so carefully guarded by
							English ships that he decided to throw himself upon the generosity of the English
							nation. The British government treated him, however, as a dangerous prisoner of war
							rather than as a retired foreign general and statesman of distinction who desired, as
							he claimed, to finish his days in peaceful seclusion. He was banished with a few
							companions and guards to the remote island of Saint Helena.<ref id="ref_121"
								rend="super" target="note_121">1</ref> Here he spent the six years until his death

						<p>"For the general history of Europe the captivity at St. Helena possesses a double

							ungracious and hard and violent, and to draw in firm and authoritative outline a
							picture of his splendid achievements and liberal designs. . . The great captain, hero

						<note rend="right">Extreme difficulty of adjusting the map of Europe after the great
							changes of the Napoleonic Period</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">32.</hi> The readjustment of the map of Europe after Napoleon's downfall
							was an extremely perplexing and delicate operation. Geographical lines centuries old
							had been swept away by the storms of war and the ambition of the conqueror. Many
							ancient states had disappeared altogether,-- Venice, Genoa, Piedmont, the Papal
							States, Holland, and scores of little German principalities. These had been either
							merged into France or the realms of their more fortunate neighbors, or formed into new
							countries,-- the kingdom of Italy, the kingdom of Westphalia, the Confederation of the
							Rhine, the grand duchy of Warsaw. Those which had survived had, with the exception of
							England and Russia, received new bounds, new rulers, or new institutions. When
							Napoleon was forced to abdicate, the princes whose former patrimonies had vanished
							from the map, or who had been thrust aside, clamored to be restored to their thrones.
							The great powers, England, Austria, Russia, and Prussia, whose rulers had been able
							with more or less success to resist the despoiler and had finally combined to bring
							about his overthrow, naturally assumed the r81e of arbiters in the settlement. But
							they were far from impartial judges, since each proposed to gain for itself the
							greatest possible advantages in the reapportionment of territory.</p>

						<note rend="right">Some matters settled at the first Peace of Paris, May 30, 1814</note>

						<p>The least troublesome points were settled by the allies in the first Treaty of Paris,
							which had been concluded in May, 1814, immediately after Napoleon had been sent to
							Elba. They readily agreed, for instance, that the Bourbon dynasty <pb id="VAB8216-260"
								n="228"/> should be restored to the throne of France in the person of Louis XVI's
							younger brother, the count of Provence, who took the title of Louis XVIII.<ref
								id="ref_123" rend="super" target="note_123">1</ref> They at first permitted France
							to retain the boundaries she had had on November 1, 1792, but later deprived her of
							Savoy as a penalty for yielding to Napoleon after his return from Elba.<ref
								id="ref_124" rend="super" target="note_124">2</ref> The powers also agreed, at
							Paris, upon a kingdom of the Netherlands, with increased territories, to be
							established under the House of Orange; the union of Germany into a confederation of
							sovereign states; the independence of Switzerland; and the restoration of the
							monarchical states of Italy. The graver issues and the details of the settlement were
							left to the consideration of the great congress which was to convene at Vienna in the
								autumn.<ref id="ref_125" rend="super" target="note_125">3</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Holland made a kingdom and given the former Austrian
							Netherlands</note>

						<p>Some questions, however, the allies easily settled. They confirmed their former
							decision that Holland should become an hereditary kingdom under the House of Orange,
							which had so long played a conspicuous rÃ´le in the nominal republic. In order that
							Holland might be better able to check any encroachments on the part of France, the
							Austrian Netherlands (which had been seized by the French Convention early in the
							revolutionary wars) were joined to the new Dutch kingdom. The fact that most of the
							inhabitants of the Austrian Netherlands were not closely connected by language,<ref
								id="ref_126" rend="super" target="note_126">4</ref> traditions, or religion with the
							Dutch had no weight in the councils of the powers, just as no such consideration had
							arisen in former times when the provinces had passed to Spain by inheritance <note
								id="note_123"><ref target="ref_123" rend="super">1</ref> The young son of Louis XVI
								had been imprisoned by the Convention and, according to reports, maltreated by the

								discussion, but it is probable that he died in 1795. Though he never exercised power
								in any form, he takes his place in the line of French kings as Louis XVII.</note>
							<note id="note_124"><ref target="ref_124" rend="super">2</ref> The second Peace of
								Paris (November, 1815) also provided for the return of the works of art and

							<pb id="VAB8216-261" n="229"/> and, later, to Austria by conquest. The Vienna Congress
							simply continued the old policy of carving out and distributing states among princes
							without regard to the wishes of the people concerned.</p>

						<note rend="right">The consolidation of Germany leaves only thirty-eight surviving
							states</note>
						<note rend="right">Strengthening of Germany's western boundary</note>

						<p>The territorial settlement of Germany did not prove to be so difficult as might have
							been expected. No one except the petty princes and the ecclesiastics desired to undo
							the work 1803 and restore the old minute subdivisions which had been done away with by
							the <hi rend="i">Reichsdeputationshauptschluss.</hi> The restoration of the Holy Roman
							Empire could not be seriously considered by any one, but some sort of union between
							the surviving thirty-eight German states seemed to be expedient. They were accordingly
							united by a very loose bond, which permitted the former members of the Confederation
							of the Rhine to continue to enjoy that precious " sovereignty" which Napoleon had
							granted them. Formerly that portion of Germany which lies on the Rhine had been so
							broken up into little states that France was constantly tempted to take advantage of
							this disintegration to encroach upon German territory. After 1815 this source of
							weakness was partially remedied, for Prussia was assigned a large tract on the Rhine,
							while Bavaria, Baden, and WÃ¼rtemberg stood by her side to discourage new aggressions
							from their dangerous enemy on the west.</p>

						<note rend="right">In the readjustment of Italy, Austria assigned a predominating
							influence</note>

						<p>Italy was not so fortunate as Germany in securing greater unity than she had enjoyed
							before the French Revolution. Napoleon had reduced and consolidated her various
							divisions into the kingdom of Italy, of which he was the head, and the kingdom of
							Naples, which he had finally bestowed on Murat, while Piedmont, Genoa, Tuscany, and
							the Papal States he had annexed to France.<ref id="ref_127" rend="super"
								target="note_127">1</ref> Naturally the powers had no reason for maintaining this
							arrangement and determined to restore all the former monarchical states. Tuscany,
							Modena, the Papal States, <note id="note_127"><ref target="ref_127" rend="super"
									>1</ref> Nothing need be said of a half dozen petty Italian territories,-- Lucca,
								San Marino, Benevento, etc.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-262" n="230"/> and Naples were given back to their former princes, and
							little Parma was assigned to Napoleon's second wife, the Austrian princess, Maria
							Louisa. The king of Sardinia returned from his island and reestablished himself in
							Turin. There were few at the congress to plead for a revival of the ancient republics
							of Genoa and Venice. The lands of the former were therefore added to those of the king
							of Sardinia, in order to make as firm a bulwark as possible against France. Austria
							deemed the territories of Venice a fair compensation for the loss of the Netherlands,
							and was accordingly permitted to add Venetia to her old duchy of Milan and thus form a
							new province in northern Italy, the so-called Lombardo-Venetian kingdom.</p>

						<note rend="right">Switzerland</note>

						<p>Switzerland gave the allies but little trouble. The Congress of Vienna recognized the
							cantons as all free and equal, and established their "neutrality" by agreeing never to
							invade Switzerland or send troops through her territory. The cantons (which had been
							joined by the former free city of Geneva) then drew up a new constitution, which bound
							them together into a federation consisting of twenty-two little states.</p>

						<note rend="right">Personal union of Sweden and Norway under the rule of the House of
							Bernadotte</note>

						<p>The Congress of Vienna ratified an arrangement by which Sweden and Norway were joined
							under a single ruler, one of Napoleon's generals, Bernadotte. The Norwegians
							protested, drew up a constitution of their own, and elected a king, but Bernadotte
							induced them to accept him as their ruler on condition that Norway should have its own
							separate constitution and government. This was the origin of the "personal union"<ref
								id="ref_128" rend="super" target="note_128">1</ref> of Sweden and Norway under
							Bernadotte and his successors, which lasted until October, 1905.<ref id="ref_129"
								rend="super" target="note_129">2</ref></p>

						<note id="note_128"><ref target="ref_128" rend="super">1</ref> This is the term applied
							in international law to describe the union of two or more independent states under a
							single ruler.</note>

						<note id="note_129"><ref target="ref_129" rend="super">2</ref> This personal union
							worked very well so long as the joint king was tolerably free from control by the
							Swedish parliament, for the Norwegians had their own constitution and parliament, or
							Storthing, as it is called, and they could regard themselves as practically
							independent under a sovereign who also happened to be king of Sweden. However,
							especially near the close of the nineteenth century, the interests of the two
							countries diverged more and more widely. With the development of parliamentary
							government the diets of both countries desired to control the king's choice of
							ministers and the foreign policy of the two kingdoms. So, after a long period of
							friction, the two states agreed to separate on October 26, 19o5. Sweden retained her
							old king, Oscar II (1872-1907), while Norway elected as king Prince Carl, second son
							of Frederick, king of Denmark, and gave him the title of Haakon VII. The Norwegians
							still retain the constitution which was drawn up in 1814, but it has been several
							times modified by democratic measures. See Seignobos, <hi rend="i">Political History
								of Europe since 1814</hi>, pp. 554-556.</note>

						<note rend="right">Russia and Prussia agree upon the fate of the grand duchy of Warsaw
							and of the kingdom of Saxony</note>

						<p>In these adjustments all was fairly harmonious, but when it came to the rewards
							claimed by Russia and Prussia there developed at the congress serious differences of
							opinion which nearly brought on war between the allies themselves, and which
							encouraged Napoleon's return from Elba. Russia desired the grand duchy of Warsaw,
							which Napoleon had formed principally out of the territory seized by Austria and
							Prussia in the partitions of the previous century. The Tsar proposed to increase this
							duchy by the addition of a portion of Russian Poland and so form a kingdom to be
							united in a personal union with his other dominions. The king of Prussia agreed to
							this plan on condition that he should be indemnified for the loss of a large portion
							of his former Polish territories by the annexation of the lands of the king of Saxony,
							who, it was argued, merited this retribution for remaining faithful to Napoleon after
							the other members of the Confederation of the Rhine had deserted him.</p>

						<note rend="right">England, Austria, and France prepare to oppose the plans of Russia
							and Prussia</note>
						<note rend="right">Skillful diplomacy of Talleyrand</note>

						<p>Austria and England, on the other hand, were opposed to this arrangement. They did
							not approve of dispossessing the king of Saxony or of extending the Tsar's influence
							westward by giving him Poland; and Austria had special grounds for objection because a
							large portion of the duchy of Warsaw which the Tsar proposed to take had formerly
							belonged to her. The great French diplomatist, Talleyrand, now saw his chance to
							disturb the good will existing between England, Prussia, Austria, and Russia. The
							allies had resolved to treat France as a black sheep and arrange everything to suit
							themselves. But now that they were hopelessly at odds Austria and England found the
							hitherto discredited France a welcome ally. Acting with the consent of Louis XVIII,
							Talleyrand offered to Austria the aid <pb id="VAB8216-267" n="232"/> of French arms in
							resisting the proposal of Russia and Prussia, and on January 3, 1815, France, England,
							and Austria joined in a secret treaty against Russia and Prussia, and even went so far
							as to draw up a plan of campaign. So France, the disturber of the peace of Europe for
							the last quarter of a century, was received back into the family of nations, and the
							French ambassador joyfully announced to his king that the coalition against France was
							dissolved forever.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Tsar gets Poland, and Prussia becomes powerful on the
							Rhine</note>

						<p>A compromise was, however, at length arranged without resorting to arms. The Tsar
							gave up a small portion of the duchy of Warsaw, but was allowed to create the kingdom
							of Poland on which he had set his heart. Only about one half of the possessions of the
							king of Saxony were ceded to Prussia, but as a further indemnity Prussia received
							certain districts on the left bank of the Rhine, which had belonged to petty lay and
							ecclesiastical princes before the Peace of LunÃ©ville. This proved an important gain
							for Prussia, although it was not considered so at the time. It gave her a large number
							of German subjects in exchange for the Poles she lost, and so prepared the way for her
							to become the dominant power in Germany.</p>

						<note rend="right">Map of Europe in 1815 as compared with the conditions established by
							the Treaty of Utrecht</note>

						<p>If one compares the map of Europe as it was reconstructed by the plenipotentiaries of
							the great powers at Vienna, with the situation after the Treaty of Utrecht a hundred
							years before, several very important changes are apparent. A general consolidation had
							been effected. Holland and the Austrian Netherlands were united under one king. The
							Holy Roman Empire, with its hundreds of petty principalities, had disappeared and a
							union of thirty-eight states and free towns had taken its place. Prussia had greatly
							increased the extent of its German territories, although these remained rather
							scattered. The kingdom of Poland still appeared on the map, but had lost its
							independence and been reduced in extent. Portions of it had fallen to Prussia and

						<p>The gains of England resulting from the Napoleonic conflict, like all her other
							acquisitions since the War of the Spanish Succession, were colonial. The most
							important of these were Ceylon, off the southeastern coast of the Indian peninsula,
							and the Cape of Good Hope, which had been wrested from the Dutch (18o6) while they
							were under Napoleon's influence. This seemingly insignificant conquest proved to be
							the basis of the British expansion which has secured the most valuable portions of

						<note rend="right">Vast extent of England's colonial posessions in 1815</note>

						<p>In spite of the loss of the American colonies on the eve of the French Revolution,
							England possessed in 1815 the foundations of the greatest commercial and colonial
							power which has ever existed. She still held Canada and all the vast northwest of the
							North American continent, except Alaska. Important islands in the West Indies
							furnished stations from which a lucrative trade with South America could be carried
							on. In Gibraltar she had a sentinel at the gateway of the Mediterranean, and the
							possession of the Cape of Good Hope not only afforded a basis for pressing into the
							heart of the most habitable part of Africa, but also a halfway port for vessels bound
							to distant India. In India the beginnings of <note id="note_130"><ref target="ref_130"

								got the island of Trinidad near Tobago, and from Denmark the island of Heligoland,
								commanding the mouth of the Elbe (recently ceded to Germany). In the Mediterranean
								England held Malta and, as a protectorate, the Ionian Islands off the coast of
								Greece, thus securing a basis for operations in the eastern Mediterranean.</note>

							along the east and west coasts. Finally, in Australia, far away in the southern
							Pacific, penal settlements had been made which were in time to be supplanted by rich,
							populous, and prosperous commonwealths. In addition to her colonial strength England
							possessed the most formidable navy and the largest mercantile marine afloat.</p>

						<p>The Congress of Vienna marks the condemnation of one of the most atrocious practices

							than declare the traffic contrary to the principles of civilization and human right;
							but, under the leadership of England, the various states, with the exception of Spain

							the business had roused the conscience of the more enlightened and humane Englishmen
							and Frenchmen in the eighteenth century. Finally, in March, 1807, three weeks after
							the Congress of the United States had forbidden the importation of slaves,<ref
								id="ref_132" rend="super" target="note_132">2</ref> Parliament prohibited Englishmen
							from engaging in the traffic. Sweden followed England's example in 1813, and Holland a

							confidence of England, abolished the French slave trade.</p>

						<note rend="right">Disregard of nationality before the nineteenth century</note>

							Before the French Revolution kings went to war without consulting their subjects, and
							made arrangements with other monarchs in regard to the distribution, division, and
							annexation of territory without asking the consent of those who lived in the regions
							involved. Practically no attention was paid to differences in race, for kings gladly
							added to their realms any lands they could gain by conquest, negotiation, marriage, or
							inheritance, regardless of the particular kind of subjects that they might bring under
							their scepters.</p>

						<note rend="right">The French National Assembly declares the monarch responsible to the
							nation, and so awakens political life among the people</note>

						<p>However, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789 had proclaimed that the
							law was the expression of the general will, and that every citizen had a right,
							personally or through his representatives, to participate in its formation. The king
							and his officials were made responsible for their public acts not to God but to the
							people. This idea that the nation had a right to control the making of the laws and
							the granting of the taxes, and to choose or depose its ruler, who was responsible to
							it, served to rouse a general interest in political questions, which could not
							possibly have developed as long as people were content to believe that God had
							excluded them from all participation in affairs of State. Political leaders appeared,
							the newspapers began to discuss public questions, and political societies were
							formed.</p>

						<note rend="right">The awakening of nationalism</note>

						<p>The various nations became more and more keenly conscious that each had its own
							language and traditions which made it different from other peoples. Patriotic orators
							in Germany, Italy, and Greece recalled the glorious past of the ancient Germans,
							Romans, and Hellenes, with a view to stimulating this enthusiasm. National feeling may
							be defined as a general recognition that a people should have a government suited to
							its particular traditions and needs, and should be ruled by its own native officials,
							and that (if nations were entitled to political rights, as the French Revolution had
							taught) it is wrong for one people to dominate another, or for monarchs to divide <pb
								id="VAB8216-271" n="236"/> up, redistribute, and transfer territories with no regard
							to the wishes of the inhabitants, merely to provide some landless prince with a
							patrimony.</p>

						<p>We shall have to reckon hereafter with this national spirit, which continued to
							spread and to increase in strength during the nineteenth century. It has played a
							great part in the unification of Italy and Germany, in the emancipation of Greece and
							the Balkan states from Turkish dominion, and in the problems which have faced Austria,
							with its heterogeneous population.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">33.</hi> In June, 1815, the Congress of Vienna brought together the
							results of all the treaties and arrangements which its various members had agreed upon
							among themselves, and issued its "Final Act," in which its work was summed up for

							reviewed the wars and turmoil which had begun with the French Revolution and lasted
							more than a quarter of a century, longed for peace at any cost, and viewed with the
							utmost suspicion any individual or party who ventured to suggest further changes. The
							word "revolution" had acquired a hideous sound, not only to the rulers and their
							immediate advisers, but to all the aristocratic class and the clergy, who thought that
							they had reason enough to abhor the modern tendencies as they had seen them at
							work.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Holy Alliance devised by Alexander I (September, 1815)</note>

						<p>It was clear that the powers which had combined to reestablish order must continue

							<pb id="VAB8216-272" n="237"/> unless the most constant vigilance was exercised.
							Alexander I proposed a plan for preserving European tranquillity by the formation of a
							religious brotherhood of monarchs, which was given the name of "The Holy Alliance."
							This was accepted by the emperor of Austria and the king of Prussia, and published in
							September, 1815. In this singular instrument their majesties agreed to view one
							another as brothers and compatriots, as "delegates of Providence to govern three
							branches of the same family." All the other European powers which recognized the
							sacred principles of the act were to be welcomed cordially and affectionately into
							this "holy alliance."<ref id="ref_134" rend="super" target="note_134">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">The Holy Alliance not a union to prevent revolution</note>

						<p>The Tsar and Frederick William took the alliance seriously, but to most of the
							diplomats who had participated in the scramble for the spoils at Vienna, and who
							looked back upon the habits of monarchs in dealing with one another, it was an amusing
							vagary of the devout Tsar. It was not, as has often been supposed, a conspiracy of
							despotic monarchs to repress all liberal movements. It contained no definite allusions
							to the dangers of revolution or to the necessity of maintaining the settlement of
							Vienna. The name "Holy Alliance" came nevertheless to be applied by the more liberal
							newspapers and reformers to a real and effective organization of the powers opposed to
							change. In this case the monarchs did not unite in "the name of the Most High" to
							promote Christian charity, but frankly combined to fight reform under the worldly
							guidance of Clement Wencelaus Nepomuk Lothaire, Prince of
							Metternich-Winneburg-Ochsenhausen.</p>

						<note rend="right">Metternich's political creed</note>

						<p>Metternich, who was destined to succeed Napoleon as the most conspicuous statesman in
							Europe, was born in 1773 and had followed the course of the French Revolution from the
							beginning, with hatred and alarm. All talk about constitutions and national unity was
							to him revolutionary, and therefore highly dangerous.<ref id="ref_135" rend="super"
								target="note_135">2</ref></p>

						<note id="note_134"><ref target="ref_134" rend="super">1</ref> See the text of this

						<pb id="VAB8216-273" n="238"/>

						<note rend="right">Any development of the spirit of nationality dangerous to
							Austria</note>

						<p>He was doubtless much strengthened in his hostility to reform by the situation of
							Austria,. whose affairs he had been guiding since 1809. No country, except Prussia,
							had suffered more from the Revolution, which it had been the first to oppose in 1792.
							Should the idea of nationality gain ground, the various peoples included in the
							Austrian Empire-- Germans, Czechs, Poles, Hungarians, Italians, and the rest-- would
							surely revolt and each demand its own constitution. Liberal ideas, whether in Austria,
							Italy, or Germany, foreboded the destruction of the highly artificial Austrian realms,
							which had been accumulated through the centuries by conquest, marriage, and
							inheritance, without regard to the great differences between the races which were
							gathered together under the scepter of Francis I. Consequently, to Metternich the
							preservation of Austria, the suppression of reformers and of agitators for
							constitutional government, and "the tranquillity of Europe," all meant one and the
							same thing.</p>

						<note rend="right">Secret alliance of November 20, 1815</note>

						<p>On November 20, 1815, Austria, Prussia, England, and Russia entered a secret
							agreement to keep peace in Europe. In order to effect their ends the powers agreed to
							hold periodical meetings with a view to considering their common interests and taking
							such measures as might be expedient for the preservation of general order. Thus a sort
							of international congress was established for the purpose of upholding the settlement
							of Vienna.</p>

						<note rend="right">Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1818</note>

						<p>The first formal meeting of the powers under this agreement took place at
							Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, to arrange for the evacuation of France by the troops of the
							allies, which had been stationed there since 1814 to suppress any possible disorder.
							France, once more admitted to the brotherhood of nations, joined Metternich's
							conservative league, and that judicious statesman could report with complacency that
							the whole conference was a brilliant triumph for those principles which he held
							dearest.</p>

						<note rend="right">Main changes in the map of Europe since the Congress of Vienna</note>

						<p>A glance at the map of Europe to-day will make plain that the Congress of Vienna
							failed to fix forever the metes and bounds, <pb id="VAB8216-274" n="239"/> and the
							system of government, of the European countries. Metternich's flimsy union of German
							states has given way to the German Empire. Prussia, Austria's old rival, has evidently
							grown at the expense of its neighbors, as several of the lesser German states of
							1815-- Hanover, Nassau, and Hesse-Cassel-- no longer appear on the map, and
							Schleswig-Holstein, which then belonged to Denmark, is now Prussian. It will be noted
							that the present German Empire does not include any part of the Austrian countries, as
							did the confederation of 1815, and that, on the other hand, Prussia is its dominant
							member. The kingdom of Poland has become an integral part of the Russian dominions.
							Austria, excluded from the German union, has entered into a dual union with Hungary,
							in which the two countries are placed upon a footing of equality.</p>

						<p>There was no kingdom in Italy in 1815. Now Austria has lost all hold on Lombardy and
							Venetia, and all the little Italian states reestablished by the Congress of Vienna,
							including the Papal States, have disappeared. A new kingdom, Belgium, has been created
							out of the old Austrian Netherlands which the Congress gave to the king of Holland.
							France, now a republic again, has recovered Savoy but has lost all her possessions on
							the Rhine by the cession of Alsace and Lorraine to the German Empire. Lastly, Turkey
							in Europe has nearly disappeared, and several new states-- Greece, Servia, Roumania,
							and Bulgaria-- have appeared in southeastern Europe.</p>

						<note rend="right">Changes in governments and industries</note>

						<p>Even more important, for the common people, than the changes in the map has been the
							revolution in the governments, laws, and industries of the several countries.
							Everywhere except in Russia absolute monarchies have been supplanted by some form of
							constitutional government, more or less democratic. Workingmen and peasants, who were
							generally excluded from the right to vote in 1815, have now been enfranchised in
							western Europe. The industrial revolution, brought about by the steam engine,
							machinery, and railways, has changed all of the old ways of living, traveling, and
							working. Laws and <pb id="VAB8216-275" n="240"/> policies which were utterly abhorrent
							to Metternich and his fellow-statesmen are now accepted commonplaces throughout
							Europe.</p>

						<p>It is the purpose of the following chapters to show how the great changes indicated
							on the map took place, and to explain the accompanying internal, changes, in so far as
							they represent the general trend of modern development, or have an importance for
							Europe at large.</p>

						<note rend="right">The French do not oppose the restoration of the Bourbons in
							1814</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">34.</hi> When, in 1792, the Austrian and Prussian armies had advanced
							toward Paris with the object of freeing Louis XVI from the restrictions placed upon
							him by the National Assembly, the French, roused to fury, had deposed and executed
							their ruler, who was convicted of plotting with foreign powers to maintain his
							authority. In 1814 the allies placed on the throne the brother of Louis XVI, a veteran
							Ã©migrÃ©, who had openly derided the Revolution and had been intriguing with other
							European powers for nearly twenty years to gain the French crown. Yet there was no
							organized opposition to the new king. The French were still monarchical at heart.</p>

						<note rend="right">Louis XVIII is not tempted to undo the work of Napoleon and the
							Revolution</note>

						<p>There was, however, no danger that Louis XVIII would undo the great work of the
							Revolution and of Napoleon. He was no fanatic like his younger brother, the count of
							Artois. In his youth he had delighted in Voltaire and the writings of the
							philosophers; he had little sympathy for the Church party. His sixty years, his
							corpulence, his gout, and a saving sense of humor prevented him from undertaking any
							wild schemes for restoring the old regime which might be suggested to him by the
							emigrant nobles, who now returned to France in great numbers.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Constitutional Charter granted to France by Louis XVIII, June,
							1814</note>

						<p>The Constitutional Charter which he issued in June, 1814, was indeed a much more
							liberal form of government than that which Napoleon had permitted the French to enjoy,
							and suggested in some ways the English constitution.<ref id="ref_136" rend="super"
								target="note_136">1</ref> The power of <note id="note_136"><ref target="ref_136"
									rend="super">1</ref> The leading provisions of the Charter are to be found in the
									<hi rend="i">Readings</hi>, Vol. II, p. 2.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-277" n="242"/> making laws was vested in the king and a parliament
							consisting of two chambers,-- a house of peers chosen by the king, and a chamber of
							deputies elected by the wealthier citizens. The king alone could propose laws, but the
							chambers were empowered to petition the sovereign to lay before them any specific
							measure which they thought desirable.</p>

						<note rend="right">Some of the "Rights of Man" guaranteed by the charter</note>

						<p>In addition to establishing representative government, the Charter guaranteed almost
							all the great principles of reform laid down in the first Declaration of the Rights of
							Man. It proclaimed that all men were equal before the law and equally eligible to
							offices in the government and the army; taxation was to be apportioned according to
							the wealth of each citizen; personal and religious liberty was assured, although the
							Roman Catholic faith was to be the religion of the State; freedom of the press was
							guaranteed, but subject to such laws as might be passed for the purpose of checking
							the abuses of that freedom.</p>

						<note rend="right">The origin of parties</note>

						<p>In view of what France had suffered it might have been supposed that the moderation
							of the restored monarch and his enlightened measures would have pacified the
							distracted kingdom; but the granting of a constitution could not bring back that quiet
							submission to the royal will which had existed in the days of Louis XV. The interest
							of the people in public questions had been aroused by the Revolution, and quite
							naturally they differed among themselves on current issues, such as the amount of
							power the king should really be permitted to exercise, the extension of the right to
							vote to the poorer classes, the authority of the clergy, the position of the ancient
							nobility, and the like. In this way political parties developed.</p>

						<note rend="right">The ultra-royalists led by the count or Artois</note>

						<p>The reactionary group, known as the ultra-royalists, was composed largely of emigrant
							nobles and clergy, who wished to undo the work of the past twenty-five years and to
							restore the old rÃ©gime in its entirety. They clamored for greater power for the
							clergy, for the restriction of the liberal press, for the king's absolute control over
							his ministers, and for the restoration of the property that they had lost during the
							Revolution. This party, <pb id="VAB8216-278" n="243"/> though small in numbers, was
							composed of zealots, and with the king's brother, the count of Artois, at their head,
							they constituted an active and influential minority.</p>

						<note rend="right">The moderate royalists</note>

						<p>The most valuable and effective support for the king, however, came from a more
							moderate group of royalists who had learned something during the last quarter of a
							century. They knew that the age of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette could not return,
							and consequently they urged the faithful observance of the Charter, and sought, on the
							one hand, to induce the reactionary nobility and clergy to accept the results of the
							Revolution, and, on the other hand, to reconcile the people to the restored monarchy.
							The two royalist parties-- extreme and moderate-- doubtless made up the greater
							portion of the nation.</p>

						<note rend="right">The liberals</note>

						<p>A third party was composed of liberals, who, though loyal to the king, did not regard
							the Charter as containing the last word on French liberties. They favored a reduction
							of the amount of property which a man was required to own in order to vote, and they
							maintained that the king should be guided by ministers responsible to the
							chambers.</p>

						<note rend="right">The irreconcilables</note>
						<note rend="right">The Bonapartists</note>

						<p>Finally, there was a large group of persons who were irreconcilable enemies of the
							Bourbons and everything savoring of Bourbonism. Among them were the Bonapartists,
							soldiers of Napoleon, who remembered the glories of Austerlitz and Wagram and were
							angered by the prestige suddenly given to hundreds of Frenchmen who had borne arms
							against their country, but who now crowded around the king to receive offices,
							rewards, and honors.<ref id="ref_137" rend="super" target="note_137">1</ref> While
							Napoleon lived they longed for his return, and after his death in 1821, they placed

						<note rend="right">The republicans</note>

						<p>On the other hand, there were the republicans, who detested Bonapartism no less than
							Bourbonism and wished to restore the republic of 1792.</p>

						<note rend="right">Views of Charles X (1824-1830)</note>

						<p>As long as Louis XVIII lived, the party loyal to him grew stronger, and at the time
							of his death in 1824 the restored Bourbon line seemed to have triumphed completely
							over its enemies. Had his brother, who succeeded him as Charles X, been equally wise,
							he too might have retained the throne until his death. But he frankly declared that he
							would rather chop wood than be king on the same terms as the king of England. During
							the early years of his reign the clergy and Jesuits exercised a great deal of
							influence upon the policy of the government, and the nobles, who had been deprived of
							their lands during the Revolution, were granted a thousand million francs by way of
							indemnity.</p>

						<note rend="right">The July ordinances, July 25, 1830</note>

						<p>As might have been anticipated, Charles's policy aroused violent antagonism. But he
							did not heed the warnings, and in July, 1830, determined upon a bold stroke. Acting
							under a provision of the Charter which empowered him to make regulations for the
							security of the realm, he and his ministers issued a series of ordinances establishing
							press censorship, increasing the property qualifications for voters, and confining the
							initiation of laws to the king.<ref id="ref_139" rend="super" target="note_139"
								>1</ref> These ordinances practically destroyed the last vestiges of constitutional
							government and left the French people without any guarantee against absolutism.</p>

						<note rend="right">The protests of the journalists</note>

						<p>The day following the promulgation of the ordinances, July 26, 1830, the Paris
							journalists published a protest, which became the signal for open resistance to the
							king. They declared that they would issue their papers in spite of the king, and that
							all citizens were absolved from their allegiance by this attack on their rights.</p>

						<note rend="right">The republicans start an insurrection in Paris, July 27</note>

						<p>The revolt, however, which brought about the overthrow of Charles X was the work of

						<p>On July 29 the entire city of Paris was in the hands of the insurgents. The king, now
							realizing the seriousness of the situation, opened negotiations with the deputies and
							promised to repeal the obnoxious ordinances. It was, however, too late for
							concessions; a faction of wealthy bankers and business men was busily engaged in an
							intrigue to place upon the throne Louis Philippe, the son of that duke of Orleans who
							had supported the popular cause in the early days of the first revolution and had
							finally been executed as a "suspect" during the Reign of Terror. The son had been
							identified with the Jacobins and had fought in the army of the republic at Valmy and
							Jemappes. He was later exiled, and spent some time in England. When he returned to
							France after the restoration he sought popular favor by professing democratic
							opinions, affecting the airs of a plain citizen, and sending his children to ordinary
							schools instead of employing private tutors. He was therefore the logical candidate of
							those who wished to preserve the monarchy and yet establish the middle class in power
							in place of the nobles and clergy.</p>

						<note rend="right">Charles X abdicates; Louis Philippe appointed lietenant
							general</note>

						<p>Charles X, despairing of his ability to retain the crown for himself, abdicated in
							favor of his grandson, the duke of Bordeaux. He then charged Louis Philippe with the
							task of proclaiming the young duke as King Henry V, and fled with his family to
							England. Though this arrangement might very well have met the approval of the nation
							at large, Louis Philippe was not inclined to execute the order of Charles X. On the
							contrary, he began to seek the favor of the republicans who had done the actual
							fighting and had already formed a provisional government with the aged Lafayette at
							its head.</p>

						<p>This committee occupied the City Hall and was surrounded by the insurgents who
							supported it. Louis Philippe forced his way through the throng and, in a conference
							with Lafayette, won him over to his cause by fair promises. The two men then went out
							on the balcony and Lafayette embraced his companion before <pb id="VAB8216-281"
								n="246"/> the crowd as a sign of their good understanding, while the duke on his
							part showed his sympathy for liberal doctrines by waving the tricolored flag,-- the
							banner of the Revolution,-- which had not been unfurled in Paris since the last days
							of Napoleon. The hopes of the republicans who had borne the brunt of the Revolution
							were now at an end, for they realized that they formed too small a party to prevent
							Louis Philippe's accession to the throne.</p>

						<p>Louis Philippe convoked the Chamber of Deputies on August 3 and announced the

							dethroned king had indicated his grandson as his successor. Four days later the
							Chamber of Deputies passed a resolution-- which was ratified by the Chamber of Peers--
							calling Louis Philippe to the throne as <pb id="VAB8216-282" n="247"/> king of the
							French; he accepted their invitation, declaring that "he could not resist the call of

						<note rend="right">The Charter is revised</note>

						<p>The parliament undertook to make the necessary changes in the existing Charter which
							Louis XVIII had granted, and required the new king to accept it before his coronation.
							The preamble of the Charter was suppressed because it wounded "national dignity in
							appearing to <hi rend="i">grant</hi> to Frenchmen the rights which essentially
							belonged to them." The clause under which the July ordinances were issued was altered
							so that the king had no power to suspend the laws. Freedom of the press and the
							responsibility of the ministers to the Legislative Assembly were expressly proclaimed.
							Lastly, the provision establishing the Roman Catholic religion as the religion of the
							State was stricken out.</p>

						<note rend="right">The slight results of the revolution</note>

						<p>In reality, however, the Revolution of 1830 made few innovations. One king had been
							exchanged for another who professed more liberal views, but the government was no more
							democratic than before. The right to vote was still limited to the few wealthy
							taxpayers, and government by clergy and nobility had given place to government by
							bankers, speculators, manufacturers, and merchants. The tricolored flag of the
							Revolution was adopted as the national flag, instead of the white banner of the
							Bourbons, but France was still a monarchy, and the labors of the republicans in
							organizing the insurrection had gone for naught.</p>

							in the former Austrian Netherlands, where many grievances had developed since the

							dissatisfied with William's government. He had granted a constitution to his entire
							kingdom on the model of the French Charter, but many people objected to his making the
								<pb id="VAB8216-283" n="248"/> ministers responsible to himself instead of to the
							parliament, and also to the restricted suffrage which excluded all but the well-to-do
							from the right to vote. Although the southern provinces had over a million more
							inhabitants than the Dutch portion of the kingdom, they had only an equal number of
							representatives. Moreover the Dutch monopolized most of the offices and conducted the
							government in their own interests. There were religious difficulties too. The southern
							provinces were Catholic, the northern mainly Protestant. The king was a Protestant,
							and took advantage of his position to convert Catholics to his own faith.<ref

						<note rend="right">The independent kingdom of Belgium is established</note>

						<p>Louis Philippe had been seated on his throne only a few days when the agitation over
							these grievances broke out into open revolt at Brussels. The revolution spread; a
							provisional government was set up; and on October 4, 1830, it declared: "The province
							of Belgium, detached from Holland by force, shall constitute an independent state."
							The declaration was soon followed by. the meeting of a congress to establish a
							permanent form of government. This assembly drew up a constitution based on the idea
							of the sovereignty of the people, and decided that the head of the new government
							should be a king constrained by oath to observe the laws adopted by the people. The
							Belgians were therefore very much in the same position as the English in i688 when
							they made William of Orange their king on their own terms. They finally chose as their

						<note rend="right">Three chief results of Napoleon's influence in Germany</note>
						<note rend="right">1. Disappearance of most of the little states</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">36.</hi> The chief effects of the Napoleonic occupation of Germany were
							three in number. First, the consolidation of territory that followed the cession of
							the left bank of the Rhine to France, as explained previously, had done away with the
							ecclesiastical states, the territories of the knights, and most of the free towns.
							Only thirty-eight German states, including four free towns, were left when the
							Congress of Vienna took up the question of forming a confederation to replace the
							defunct Holy Roman Empire.<ref id="ref_142" rend="super" target="note_142">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">2. Advantageous position of Prussia</note>

						<p>Secondly, the external and internal conditions of Prussia had been so changed as to
							open the way for it to replace Austria as the controlling power in Germany. A great
							part of the Slavic possessions gained in the last two partitions of Poland had been
							lost, but as an indemnity Prussia had received half of the kingdom of Saxony, in the
							very center of Germany, and also the Rhine provinces, where the people were thoroughly
							imbued with the revolutionary doctrines that had prevailed in France. Prussia now
							embraced all the various types of people included in the German nation and was
							comparatively free from the presence of non-German races. In this respect it offered a
							marked contrast to the heterogeneous and mongrel population of its great rival,
							Austria.</p>

						<p>The internal changes in Prussia were no less remarkable. The reforms carried out
							after Jena by the distinguished minister Stein and his successor, Hardenberg, had done
							for Prussia somewhat the same service that the first National Assembly had done for
							France. The abolition of the feudal social castes and the liberation of the serfs made
							the economic development of the country possible. The reorganization of the whole
							military system prepared the way for Prussia's great victories in 1866 and 1870, which
							led to the formation of a new German Empire under her headship.</p>

						<note id="note_142"><ref target="ref_142" rend="super">1</ref> The leading provisions of

							ff.</note>

						<pb id="VAB8216-285" n="250"/>

						<note rend="right">3. Demand for constitutional government</note>

						<p>Thirdly, the agitations of the Napoleonic period had aroused the national spirit.<ref
								id="ref_143" rend="super" target="note_143">1</ref> The appeal to the people to aid
							in freeing their country from foreign oppression, and the idea of their participation
							in a government based upon a written constitution, had produced widespread discontent
							with the old absolute monarchy.</p>

						<note rend="right">The German Confederation of 1815</note>

						<p>When the form of union for the German states came up for discussion at the Congress
							of Vienna, two different plans were advocated. Prussia's representatives submitted a
							scheme for a firm union, in some respects like that of the United States, in which the
							central government should control the individual states in all matters of general
							interest. This idea was successfully opposed by Metternich, supported by the other
							German rulers. Austria realized that her possessions, as a whole, could never be
							included in any real German union, for even in the western portion of her territory
							there were many Slavs, while in Hungary and the southern provinces there were
							practically no Germans at all. On the other hand, she felt that she might be the
							leader in a very loose union in which all the members should be left practically
							independent. Her ideal of a union of sovereign princes under her own headship was
							almost completely realized in the constitution adopted.</p>

						<note rend="right">The German Confederation a union of rulers and free towns</note>

						<p>The confederation was not a union of the various <hi rend="i">countries</hi>
							involved, but of "The Sovereign Princes and Free Towns of Germany," including the
							emperor of Austria and the king of Prussia for such of their possessions as were
							formerly included in the German Empire; the king of Denmark for Holstein; and the king
							of the Netherlands for the grand duchy of Luxemburg. The union thus included two
							sovereigns who were out-and-out foreigners, and, on the other hand, did not include
							all the possessions of its two most important members.<ref id="ref_144" rend="super"
								target="note_144">2</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">The insignificant diet at Frankfort</note>

						<p>The assembly of the confederation was a diet which met at Frankfort. It was composed
							(as was perfectly logical) not of <note id="note_143"><ref target="ref_143"
									rend="super">1</ref> See above, p. 235<ptr targType="pb" target="VAB8216-270"
								/>.</note>
							<note id="note_144"><ref target="ref_144" rend="super">2</ref> Observe the boundary of
								the German Confederation as indicated on the map, pp. 232-233.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-286" n="251"/> representatives of the people, but of plenipotentiaries
							of the rulers who were members of the confederation. The diet had very slight powers,
							for it could not interfere in the domestic affairs of the states, and the delegates
							who composed it could not vote as they pleased, since they had to obey the
							instructions of the rulers who appointed them, and refer all important questions to
							their respective sovereigns. So powerless and so dilatory was this assembly that it
							became the laughingstock of Europe.</p>

						<note rend="right">Weakness of the German Union</note>

						<p>The members of the confederation reserved to themselves the right of forming
							alliances of all kinds, but pledged themselves to make no agreement prejudicial to the
							safety of the union or of any of its members, and not to make war upon any member of
							the confederation on any pretense whatsoever. The constitution could not be amended
							without the approval of <hi rend="i">all</hi> the governments concerned. In spite of
							its obvious weaknesses, the confederation of 1815 lasted for half a century, until
							Prussia finally expelled Austria from the union by arms, and began the formation of
							the present German federation.</p>

						<note rend="right">Political associations of German students</note>

						<p>The liberal and progressive party in Germany was sadly disappointed by the failure of
							the Congress of Vienna to weld Germany into a really national state. The university
							students denounced the reactionary party in their meetings, and drank to the freedom
							of Germany. On October i8, 1817, they held a celebration in the Wartburg to
							commemorate both Luther's revolt and the anniversary of the battle of Leipzig.
							Speeches were made in honor of the brave who had fallen in the war of independence,
							and of the grand duke of Weimar, who was the first of the North German princes to give
							his people a constitution.</p>

						<note rend="right">The murder of Kotzebue</note>

						<p>This innocent burst of enthusiasm excited great apprehension in the minds of the
							conservative statesmen of Europe, of whom Metternich was, of course, the leader. The
							murder by Sand, a fanatical student, of a journalist, Kotzebue, who was supposed to
							have influenced the Tsar to desert his former <pb id="VAB8216-287" n="252"/> liberal
							policy, cast further discredit upon the liberal party. It also gave Metternich an
							opportunity to emphasize the terrible results which he anticipated would come from the
							students' associations, liberal governments, and the freedom of the press.</p>

						<note rend="right">The "Carlsbad Resolution," 1819</note>

						<p>Metternich called together the representatives of the larger states of the
							confederation at Carlsbad in August, 1819. Here a series of resolutions were drawn up
							with the aim of checking the free expression of opinions in newspapers and
							universities hostile to existing institutions, and of discovering and bringing to
							justice the revolutionists who were supposed to exist in dangerous numbers. These
							"Carlsbad Resolutions" were laid before the diet of the confederation by Austria and
							adopted, though not without protest.<ref id="ref_145" rend="super" target="note_145"
								>1</ref></p>

						<p>The attack upon the freedom of the press, and especially the interference with the
							liberty of teaching in the great institutions of learning which were already becoming
							the home of the highest scholarship in the world, scandalized all the progressive
							spirits in Germany; yet no successful protest was raised, and Germany as a whole
							acquiesced for a generation in Metternich's system of discouraging reform of all
							kinds.</p>

						<note rend="right">The southern German states receive constitutions, 1818-1820</note>
						<note rend="right">Formation of customs union-- <hi rend="i">Zollverein</hi>-- with
							Prussia at its head</note>

						<p>Nevertheless, important progress was made in southern Germany. As early as 1818 the
							king of Bavaria granted his people a constitution in which he stated their rights and
							admitted them to a share in the government by establishing a parliament. His example
							was followed within two years by the rulers of Baden, WÃ¼rtemberg, and Hesse. Another
							change for the better was the gradual formation of a customs union, which permitted
							goods to be sent freely from one German state to another without the payment of duties
							at each boundary line. This yielded some of the advantages of a political union. This
							economic confederation, of which Prussia was the head and from which Austria was
							excluded, was a harbinger of the future German Empire.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">37.</hi> The restoration in Spain after Napoleon's downfall was more
							thoroughgoing than in any other country involved in the revolutionary conflicts.
							Napoleon's efforts to keep his brother Joseph on the Spanish throne had led to a war
							which brought misery and demoralization upon the country until the autumn of 1812,
							when Wellington drove the invaders beyond the Pyrenees. During this entire period the
							Spanish people steadily resisted French dominion and maintained the semblance of an
							independent government.</p>

						<p>The Cortes or parliament was loyal to the dethroned Bourbon, Ferdinand VII, but it
							took advantage of his absence to draw up a liberal constitution in 1812.</p>

						<note rend="right">Ferdinand VII abolishes the constitution</note>

						<p>When Ferdinand VII (who had spent the previous six years in France surrounded by
							Napoleon's guards) was, in 1814, restored to power by the strength of English arms, he
							repudiated entirely this liberal government. He declared that the Cortes which had
							drawn up this instrument had usurped his rights by imposing on his people "an
							anarchical and seditious constitution based on the democratic principles of the French
							Revolution." He accordingly annulled it and proclaimed those who continued to support
							it guilty of high treason and worthy of death.<ref id="ref_146" rend="super"
								target="note_146">1</ref> With the old absolute government, he restored the
							Inquisition, feudal privileges, and the religious orders. The Jesuits returned, the
							press was strictly censored, free speech repressed, monastic property returned to the
							former owners, and the liberals were imprisoned in large numbers or executed.</p>

						<note rend="right">Italy only "a geographical expression" after 1815</note>

						<p>The Congress of Vienna left Italy, as Metternich observed, merely "a geographical
							expression"; it had no political unity whatever. Lombardy and Venetia, in the northern
							part, were in the hands of Austria, while Parma, Modena, and Tuscany belonged to
							members of the Austrian family. In the south the considerable kingdom of Naples was
							ruled over by a branch of <note id="note_146"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_146"
										rend="super">1</ref> This manifesto is printed in the <hi rend="i"
									>Readings</hi>, Vol. II, p. 23.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-289" n="254"/> the Spanish Bourbons. In the center, cutting the
							peninsula in twain, were the Papal States, which extended north to the Po. The
							presence of Austria, and the apparent impossibility of inducing the Pope to submit to
							any government but his own, seemed to preclude all hope of making Italy into a true
							nation.</p>

						<note rend="right">Reforms introduced in Italy during the Napoleonic occupation</note>

						<p>Although Napoleon had governed Italy despotically, he had introduced many important
							reforms. The vestiges of the feudal rÃ©gime had vanished at his approach; he had
							established an orderly administration and had forwarded public improvements. But his
							unscrupulous use of Italy to advance his personal ambitions disappointed those who at
							first had received him with enthusiasm, and they came to look eagerly for his
							downfall.</p>

						<note rend="right">Abolition of reforms in Piedmont</note>

						<p>The king of Sardinia, Victor Emmanuel I, entered his capital of Turin on May 20,
							1814, amid great rejoicing, but immediately proceeded to destroy with a stroke of his
							pen all the reforms which the Revolution had accomplished in Piedmont during his
							absence. He gave back to the nobility their ancient feudal rights; he restored to the
							clergy their property, their courts, and their press censorship; religious freedom was
							suppressed.</p>

						<note rend="right">The clergy regurn to power in the Papal States</note>

						<p>The same policy was adopted in the States of the Church, where, in 1814, an edict was
							issued which swept away French legislation and restored the old order. In the zeal to
							destroy the work of the French, root and branch, vaccination and street lighting at
							Rome were abolished as revolutionary innovations.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Austrian possessions in Italy</note>

						<p>In Lombardy and Venetia, where Austrian sovereignty was established, the reforms
							instituted during the Napoleonic Period were practically nullified. In order to fasten
							securely their government on these provinces, the Austrians set up a public and secret
							police system, which constantly interfered with individual liberty in the most
							arbitrary fashion.</p>

						<note rend="right">Austrian influence in Italy</note>

						<p>In addition to his Lombardo-Venetian kingdom in the northern part of Italy, the
							Austrian emperor enjoyed a protectorate over Modena; by treaty the duke of Tuscany
							practically surrendered his duchy to him; Maria Louisa of Parma turned the
							administration of her domain over to his officers; and Ferdinand <pb id="VAB8216-290"
								n="255"/> of Naples was bound to him in a defensive and offensive alliance. In
							short, only Sardinia and the Papal States retained their freedom from "German"
							domination.</p>

						<note rend="right">The work of the French not entirely undone</note>

						<p>Though dismembered and subjected to a foreign yoke, the Italy of 1815 was not the
							Italy which Napoleon had found when he first entered it at the head of the French army
							in 1796. Despite the restoration, traces of the Revolution were everywhere apparent,
							not only in law and government but, above all, in the minds of men. National
							aspirations had been awakened which the Austrian police could not stamp out; Italians,
							high and low, came to know and appreciate French reforms at firsthand, though they
							might loathe the memory of Napoleon as a conqueror and a tyrant.</p>

						<p>Spain itself was, of course, but a small part of the vast Spanish empire, which
							included Mexico (and the regions to the northwest later acquired by the United
							States), Central America, and large portions of South America, besides her island
							possessions. The Spanish colonies had from the first been the victims of the selfish
							commercial policy of the mother country, which forced them to carry on all their trade
							with one or two favored Spanish ports. The enlightened despot, Charles III, had
							somewhat reduced the restrictions upon trade; as a result, the commerce of the Spanish
							dependencies increased nearly sevenfold from 1778 to 1788. The advantages of greater
							freedom and the success of the North American colonies in <pb id="VAB8216-291" n="256"
							/> throwing off the yoke of England both served to suggest ideas of independence;
							these suddenly developed into downright revolt when the news reached the colonies that
							Napoleon had placed his brother on the Spanish throne and proposed to control the
							Spanish commerce in his own interests.</p>

						<note rend="right">Revolt of the Spanish colonies, 1810-1815</note>

						<p>Beginning in 1810, the colonies of Mexico, New Granada (now Colombia), Venezuela,
							Peru, Buenos Ayres, and Chile, while they still professed to be loyal to Ferdinand
							VII, took their government into their own hands, drove out the former Spanish agents,
							and finally rejected Spanish rule altogether. At first the revolt was put down with
							great cruelty, but in 1817, under the leadership of Bolivar, Venezuela won its
							independence, and during the following five years the Spaniards lost New Granada,
							Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Mexico, and lastly (1825) Upper Peru, which was renamed Bolivia
							after its liberator.</p>

						<note rend="right">England opposes reconquest of the Spanish colonies</note>

						<p>Ever since his restoration Ferdinand VII had been sending thousands of men to die of
							fever and wounds in the vain attempt to subdue the insurgents. He had called upon the
							other powers to help him, on the ground that his colonies were guilty of the
							revolutionary crimes which it was to the interest of all the allied monarchs to aid in
							suppressing. He was disappointed however.</p>

						<note rend="right">Restoration of the constitution of 1812 in Spain, 1820</note>

						<p>At last, in January, 1820, the soldiers who were waiting in Cadiz to be sent to
							America, well aware of the sufferings of the regiments which had preceded them, were
							easily aroused to revolt by two adventurous officers. The revolutionists proclaimed
							the restoration of the constitution of 1812, which Ferdinand had abolished on his
							return. Their call was answered by the liberals in the larger towns, including Madrid,
							where a mob surrounded the palace (March 9), and forced the king to take the oath to
							the constitution.</p>

						<note rend="right">News of Spanish revolution reaches Italy</note>

						<p>News of the Spanish revolt spread quickly throughout Italy, where the spirit of
							insurrection had been at work among the secret societies which had everywhere been
							organized. By far the most noted of these was that of the Carbonari, i.e. charcoal <pb
								id="VAB8216-292" n="257"/> burners. Its objects were constitutional government and
							national independence and unity. When the Neapolitans heard that the king of Spain had
							been forced by an insurrection to accept a constitution, they made the first attempt
							on the part of the Italian people to gain constitutional liberty by compelling their
							king (July, 1820) to agree to accept this same Spanish constitution of 1812. The king,
							however, at once began to cast about for foreign assistance to suppress the revolution
							and enable him to return to his former ways.</p>

						<note rend="right">Metternich regards revolution as a terrible disease</note>

						<p>He had not long to wait. The alert Metternich invited Russia, Prussia, France, and
							England to unite, in order to check the development of "revolt and crime."
							"Revolution" appeared to him and his sympathizers as a fearful disease that not only
							destroyed those whom it attacked directly, but spread contagion wherever it appeared.
							Therefore prompt and severe measures of quarantine were justified, in view of the
							necessity of stamping out the devastating plague.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Laibach conference and Austrian intervention in Italy</note>

						<p>A conference was called at Laibach in January, 1821, for the purpose of taking
							practical measures to restore absolutism in southern Italy. To this conference King
							Ferdinand of Naples was summoned. After taking renewed oaths to maintain the
							constitution which he had granted his people, he started northward, but on the way to
							Laibach he repudiated his promises to his subjects, and at the conference heartily
							concurred in the plan to send an Austrian army to Naples to abolish the noxious
							constitution. The leaders of the revolt were executed, imprisoned, or exiled, and the
							king freed from the embarrassments of the constitution.</p>

						<p>Meanwhile the revolution in Spain had developed into a civil war, and the
							representatives of the great powers, Russia, Austria, Prussia, France, and England,
							met at Verona in 1822 to discuss their common interests and decide what should be done
							about the Spanish crisis.<ref id="ref_147" rend="super" target="note_147">1</ref>
							England refused to interfere in any way; so finally it was left to Louis XVIII, urged

							Pyrenees "with the purpose of maintaining a descendant of Henry IV on the throne of
							Spain." This interference in the affairs of a neighboring nation which was struggling
							for constitutional government disgusted the French liberals, who saw that France, in
							intervening in favor of Ferdinand VII, was doing just what Prussia and Austria had
							attempted in 1792 in the interests of Louis XVI. But, unlike the duke of Brunswick,
							the French commander easily defeated the revolutionists and placed Ferdinand in a
							position to stamp out his enemies in such a ferocious and bloodthirsty manner that his
							French allies were heartily ashamed of him.</p>

						<note rend="right">Question of the revolted Spanish colonies</note>

						<p>While France was helping to restore absolutism in Spain the Spanish colonies, as we
							have seen, were rapidly winning their independence, encouraged by the United States
							and England. At the Congress of Verona all the powers except England were anxious to
							discuss a plan by which they might aid Spain to get the better of her rebellious
							colonies, since it was the fixed purpose of the allies to suppress "rebellion in
							whatever place and under whatever form it might show itself."</p>

						<note rend="right">The Monroe Doctrine</note>

						<p>The threats of Metternich and his friends led President Monroe, in his message to
							Congress, December, 1823, to call attention to the dangers of intervention as
							practiced by the European alliance of great powers, and clearly state what has since
							become famous as the "Monroe Doctrine,"<ref id="ref_148" rend="super"
								target="note_148">1</ref> namely, that the United States would consider any attempt
							on the part of the European allies to extend their system to any portion of this
							hemisphere as dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States and as an
							unfriendly act.</p>

						<note rend="right">England recognizes independence of some Spanish colonies</note>

						<p>About the same time the English foreign secretary, Canning, informed the French
							ambassador in London that any attempt to bring the Spanish colonies again under their
							former submission to Spain would prove unsuccessful; and that while England <note
								id="note_148"><ref target="ref_148" rend="super">1</ref> See <hi rend="i"

							<pb id="VAB8216-294" n="259"/> would remain neutral in the troubles between the mother
							country and her American dominions, the intervention of a third party would constitute
							cause for action on the part of the English government. Toward the close of 1824
							England recognized the independence of Buenos Ayres, Mexico, and Colombia, and paid no
							heed to the remonstrance of the continental powers that such an action "tended to
							encourage the revolutionary spirit which it had been found so difficult to restrain in
							Europe."</p>

						<note rend="right">Portugal</note>

						<p>A word may be said here of Spain's little neighbor Portugal. It will be remembered
							that when Napoleon dispatched his troops thither in 1807 the royal family fled across
							the Atlantic to their colony of Brazil. After the expulsion of the French by the
							English, the government was placed in the hands of an English general, Beresford, who
							ruled so despotically that he stirred up a revolt in 1820, at the time when the
							insurrection in Spain was in progress. The insurgents demanded the return of the royal
							family from Brazil and the granting of a constitution. The king, John VI, accordingly
							set sail for Portugal, leaving his elder son, Pedro, to represent him in Brazil.<ref
								id="ref_149" rend="super" target="note_149">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Matternich's international police system fails</note>

						<p>It will have become apparent that Metternich's international police system, designed
							to prevent innovation and revolution, was for all practical purposes a failure. The
							action of Great Britain and the United States had weakened it. The struggle of the
							Greek revolutionists against Turkey for independence,<ref id="ref_150" rend="super"
								target="note_150">2</ref> which finally involved Russia in a war with the Sultan and
							ended in victory for the Greeks, demonstrated that even Russia would not hesitate to
							aid and abet revolution if she could thereby advance her own interests. The climax was
							reached in 1830 by the revolution in France described above, which deposed the older
							Bourbon line and established a liberal government, thus <note id="note_149"><ref
									target="ref_149" rend="super">1</ref>In 1822 Pedro proclaimed the independence of

							Metternich had fought with so much determination. In fact, the Holy Alliance, as such,
							never accomplished any great work, and it went to pieces as much through its own
							inherent weakness as through the growth of revolutionary spirit.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Industrial Revolution due to mechanical inventions</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">39.</hi> In the preceding chapters we have reviewed the startling
							changes and reforms introduced by the leaders of the French Revolution and by Napoleon
							Bonaparte, the reconstruction of Europe at the Congress of Vienna, and finally the
							chief modifications of these arrangements which occurred during the following
							generation. These were mainly the work of statesmen, warriors, and diplomats,-- who
							have certainly done their part in making Europe what it is to-day. But a still more
							fundamental revolution than that which has been described had begun in England before
							the meeting of the Estates General. The chief actors in this never stirred an assembly
							by their fiery denunciation of abuses, or led an army to victory, or conducted a
							clever diplomatic negotiation. On the contrary, their attention was concentrated upon
							the homely operations of everyday life,-- the housewife drawing out her thread with
							distaff or spinning wheel, the slow work of the weaver at his primitive loom, the
							miner struggling against the water which threatened to flood his mine. They busied
							themselves perseveringly with wheels, cylinders, bands, and rollers, patiently
							combining and recombining them, until, after many discouragements, they made
							discoveries destined to alter the habits, ideas, and prospects of the great mass of
							the people far more profoundly than all the edicts of the National Assembly and all
							the conquests of Napoleon taken together.</p>

						<note rend="right">Few new inventions added to the old stock before the eighteenth
							century</note>

						<p>The Greeks and Romans, notwithstanding their refined civilization, had shown slight
							aptitude for mechanical invention, <pb id="VAB8216-297" n="262"/> and little had been
							added to their stock of human appliances before the opening of the eighteenth
								century.<ref id="ref_151" rend="super" target="note_151">1</ref> In the time of
							Louis XIV, when inventors were already becoming somewhat numerous, especially in
							England, the people of western Europe for the most part continued to till their
							fields, weave their cloth, and saw and plane their boards by hand, much as the ancient
							Egyptians had done. Merchandise was still transported in slow, lumbering carts, and
							letters were as long in passing from London to Rome as in the reign of Constantine.
							Could a peasant, a smith, or a weaver of the age of Caesar Augustus have visited
							France or England eighteen hundred years later, he would have recognized the familiar
							flail, forge, and hand loom of his own day.</p>

						<note rend="right">Importance of the history of mechanical inventions</note>

						<p>Suddenly, however, a series of ingenious devices were invented, which in a few
							generations eclipsed the achievements of ages and revolutionized every branch of
							industry. These serve to explain the world in which we live, with its busy cities, its
							gigantic factories filled with complicated machinery, its commerce and vast fortunes,
							its trades unions and labor parties, its bewildering variety of plans for bettering
							the lot of the great mass of the people. The story of the substitution for the distaff
							of the marvelous spinning machine with its swiftly flying fingers, of the development
							of the locomotive and the ocean steamer which bind together the uttermost parts of the
							earth, of the perfecting press, producing a hundred thousand newspapers an hour, of
							the marvels of the telegraph and the telephone,-- this story of mechanical invention
							is in no way inferior in fascination and importance to the more familiar history of
							kings, parliaments, wars, treaties, and constitutions.</p>

						<note id="note_151"><ref target="ref_151" rend="super">1</ref> Roger Bacon, in the
							thirteenth century (see above, p. 22<ptr targType="pb" target="VAB8216-024"/>), firmly
							believed that the lot of mankind could be greatly improved by mechanical inventions.
							In his century spectacles first began to be used, and in the fourteenth and fifteenth
							centuries gunpowder was introduced, the printing press invented, and a method
							discovered by which iron could be not merely softened, but melted so that it could be
							cast.</note>

						<pb id="VAB8216-298" n="263"/>

						<p>The revolution in manufacture during the past two centuries may perhaps be best
							illustrated by the improvements in the methods of spinning and weaving wool and
							cotton, which are so important to our welfare and comfort. The main operations had
							remained essentially the same from the time when men first began to substitute coarse
							woven garments for the skins of animals, down to the eighteenth century.</p>

						<note rend="right">Old ways of spinning and weaving</note>

						<p>At the opening of that century spinning was done on the old-fashioned wheel such as
							one may find stowed away in his great-grandmother's attic. The loom used in Louis
							XIV's day was so crude that it required two men to operate it,-- one to push the
							shuttle part way through the weft, and the other to finish the stroke and start the
							shuttle on its return trip.</p>

						<note rend="right">The invention of the spinning jenny</note>

						<p>In 1738, however, there began a series of inventions which ended in the creation of
							automatic steam-driven machines and power looms. In that year John Kay, of Bury in
							Lancashire, England, invented the fly-shuttle, a contrivance which enabled the weaver,
							without any assistant, to drive the shuttle to and fro by means of a handle placed
							conveniently in front of his stool. One weaver could now do the work of two; and the
							spinners set about inventing a machine that would enable them to meet the new demand
							for thread. By 1767 James Hargreaves, a weaver of Blackburn, invented a spinning jenny
							which enabled a child, by turning a wheel, to spin eight or ten threads at one time,
							and thus do the work of eight or ten spinners.<ref id="ref_152" rend="super"
								target="note_152">1</ref> A year later a barber of Preston, Richard Arkwright,
							patented a device for spinning by rollers, and made a large fortune- for his time-- by
							establishing a great factory filled with power-driven machines. In 1779 Samuel
							Crompton, of Bolton in Lancashire, made a happy combination of Hargreaves's spinning
							jenny and Arkwright's roller machine, which was called the "mule." Before the end of
							the eighteenth century, machines spinning two hundred threads simultaneously had been
							invented, and as they <note id="note_152"><ref target="ref_152" rend="super">1</ref>
								For an account of inventions of Hargreaves, Crompton, and Cartwright, see <hi
									rend="i">Readings</hi>, Vol. II, pp. 45-53.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-299" n="264"/> were driven by power and required only one or two
							watchers, the hand workers could by no means compete with them.</p>

						<note rend="right">The power loom and cotton gin</note>

						<p>The enormous output of thread and yarn on these new machines made the weavers
							dissatisfied with the clumsy old hand loom. At length, in 1784, Dr. Cartwright, a
							clergyman of Kent, patented a new and workable loom driven by power, which
							automatically threw the shuttle and shifted the weft. This machine was steadily
							improved until by the end of the nineteenth century a single machine watched by one
							workman could do as much weaving in a day as two hundred weavers could do with
							old-fashioned hand looms. Speedily following Dr. Cartwright's invention came a number
							of other improvements in the methods of manufacturing cloth. The time required for the
							process of bleaching was reduced from several months to a few days by the use of
							acids, instead of relying principally upon the sunlight. In 1792 Eli Whitney, in the
							United States, announced the invention of a power "gin," which enabled one man to
							clean over a thousand pounds of cotton a day instead of five or six pounds, which had
							been the limit for the hand worker.</p>

						<p>The effect of these inventions in increasing the amount of cloth manufactured was
							astonishing. In 1764 England imported only about four million pounds of raw cotton,
							but by 1841 she was using nearly five hundred million pounds annually. At the close of
							the Napoleonic wars Robert Owen, a distinguished manufacturer and philanthropist,
							declared that his two thousand workmen at New Lanarck could do as much work with the
							new machinery which had been invented during the past forty years as all the operators
							of Scotland could do without it.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">

						<head rend="center">THE STEAM ENGINE</head>

						<note rend="right">Iron and power necessary of the development of machinery</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">40.</hi> In order that inventions could further develop and become
							widely useful, two things were necessary: In the first place, there must be available
							a sufficiently strong material <pb id="VAB8216-300" n="265"/> out of which to
							construct the machinery, and for this purpose iron and steel have, with few
							exceptions, proved the most satisfactory. In the second place, some adequate power had
							to be found to propel the machinery, which is ordinarily too heavy to be run by hand
							or foot. Of course windmills were common, and waterfalls and running streams had long
							been used to turn water wheels, but these forces were too restricted and uncertain to
							suffice for the rapid development of machinery which resulted from the beginnings we
							have described. Consequently while Hargreaves, Arkwright, and Crompton were
							successfully solving the problem of new methods of spinning and weaving, other
							inventors were endeavoring to supply the material for making the machinery and to
							discover an adequate power to run it.</p>

						<note rend="right">Expansive power of steam observed by the ancients</note>

						<p>Iron and steel had, of course, been used for hundreds and even thousands of years for
							tools, weapons, and armor; and the expansive power of steam was known before the
							opening of the Christian era, but had not been put to any useful purpose. So, although
							the eighteenth-century inventors could base their new devices upon older discoveries,
							they were forced to find some means for greatly cheapening the production of iron and
							steel, and for applying steam to everyday uses.</p>

						<note rend="right">Watt improves the steam engine</note>

						<p>Contrary to popular impression, James Watt did not invent the steam engine.<ref
								id="ref_153" rend="super" target="note_153">1</ref> Important parts of the engine--
							the boiler, cylinder, and the piston-- had been invented before he was born, and crude
							engines had been employed for a long time in pumping water. Indeed, Watt's interest in
							the steam engine seems to have been awakened first during the winter of 1763-1764,
							when, as an instrument maker in the University of Glasgow, he was called upon to
							repair the model of a steam engine which had been invented by an ingenious mechanic
							named Newcomen. Watt, however, was a brilliant and industrious experimenter, and
							building upon the work of Newcomen <note id="note_153"><ref target="ref_153"
									rend="super">1</ref> For a brief account of the life and works of Watt, see <hi
									rend="i">Readings</hi>, Vol. II, pp. 58-62.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-301" n="266"/> and other men, he was able to make the steam engine a
							practical and relatively economical machine for furnishing power to the new factories.
							By a simple arrangement of a rod and crank he made it possible to drive a wheel which
							could be connected by a belt and furnish rotary motion. In 1785 the steam engine was
							first applied to run spinning machinery at a factory at Pappelwick in Nottinghamshire.
							Arkwright adopted it in 1790, and by the end of the century steam engines were as
							common as wind and water mills.</p>

						<note rend="right">Older method of working iron</note>

						<p>These inventions reacted powerfully on the iron industry, which had hitherto been
							relatively insignificant. The importance of this metal can scarcely be overestimated.
							Its qualities of durability, malleability, and strength, and the manifold uses to
							which it can be adapted make it the very foundation of all mechanical industry. Though
							it had been in use for ages before the day of Arkwright and Watt, it was still worked
							up in the crudest fashion. A huge pair of bellows, operated by hand or water power,
							was used to supply the blast required to melt the metal for casting; charcoal made
							from wood was used for fuel in the smelting furnace; and the metal was hammered out
							either by hand or by heavy iron blocks fixed on the ends of levers worked up and down
							by horse or water power.</p>

						<note rend="right">Smelting with coal; new methods of working and handling iron</note>

						<p>When the manufacturers of the new spinning machines began to demand more and better
							iron, the smiths at their forges turned their attention to the improvement of their
							crude tools. About 1750 the process of smelting by coal became available, and at once
							led to a rapid development of the industry. Ten years later the bellows were
							supplanted by Smeaton's cylinder blowing apparatus, and in 1790 the advantage of a
							steady and continuous blast was secured by the adoption of steam as a motor force.
							About the same time a great improvement was made in the machinery for handling heavy
							castings, and in the methods of changing cast or brittle iron into wrought or
							malleable iron.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Industrial Revolution in France</note>

						<p>Now it so happened that the Industrial Revolution took place first in England, for
							conditions there were peculiarly favorable <pb id="VAB8216-302" n="267"/> to the
							development of the peaceful arts of industry. Although England was the first country
							to develop the modern industrial system, it was impossible for her to prevent the
							gradual introduction of new inventions on the Continent. Napoleon had endeavored to
							foster and protect French industries and stimulate the employment of machinery in
							manufacturing; but in spite of his best efforts, French industry remained in a
							backward state. It was not until after the establishment of peace in 1815 that the
							Industrial Revolution really began in France. On the eve of Napoleon's downfall there
							was only one small steam engine employed in French industry-- at a cotton factory in
							Alsace; but by 1847 France had nearly five thousand steam engines with a capacity of
							sixty thousand horse power. The consumption of raw cotton was multiplied fivefold in
							thirty years, and in 1847 there were over one hundred thousand spinning machines with
							three and a half million spindles at work. During this period a corresponding
							development took place in the other staple branches of French manufacturing. On the
							eve of the revolution of 1848 France had many important manufacturing centers. Paris
							alone had three hundred and forty-two thousand working people, and other cities, such
							as Lyons, Marseilles, Lille, Bordeaux, and Toulouse, had their great factories and
							whole quarters peopled by factory laborers. And the working class had begun by that
							time to form unions and organize strikes against their employers for the purpose of
							increasing wages and reducing the hours of labor.</p>

						<note rend="right">The "domestic" system of industry</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">41.</hi> Having seen how machinery was introduced into England in the
							latter part of the eighteenth century, and how steam came to be utilized as a motive
							power, we have now to consider the important results of these inventions in changing
							the conditions under which people lived and worked. Up to this time the term
							"manufacture" still meant, as it did in the original Latin (<hi rend="i">manun
								facere</hi>), "to make by hand." Artisans carried on trades <pb id="VAB8216-303"
								n="268"/> with their own tools in their own homes or in small shops, as the cobbler
							does to-day. Instead of working with hundreds of others in great factories and being
							entirely dependent upon his wages, the artisan, in England at least, was often able to
							give some attention to a small garden plot, from which he derived a part of his
							support. This "domestic system," as it is called, is graphically described by the
							journalist, Defoe, as he observed it in Yorkshire during a journey through England in
							1724-1726:</p>

						<note rend="right">Defoe's description of Yorkshire artisans about 1725</note>

						<p><q rend="blockquote"> "The land was divided into small enclosures of from two acres
								to six or seven acres each, seldom more, every three or four pieces having a house
								belonging to them; hardly a house standing out of speaking distance from another. We
								could see at every house a tenter and on almost every tenter a piece of cloth, or
								kersie, or shalloon. At every considerable house there was a manufactory. Every
								clothier keeps one horse at least to carry his manufactures to market, and every one
								generally keeps a cow or two, or more, for his family. By this means the small
								pieces of enclosed land about each house are occupied, for they scarce sow corn
								[i.e. grain] enough to feed their poultry. The houses are full of lusty fellows,
								some at their dye vat, some at their looms, others dressing the cloth; the women and
								children carding or spinning, all being employed from the youngest to the
								eldest."</q></p>

						<note rend="right">Principle of "factory system"</note>

						<p>As the Industrial Revolution progressed, these hand workers found themselves unable
							to compete with the swift and tireless machines. Manufacturing on a small scale with
							the simple old tools and appliances became increasingly unprofitable. The workers had
							to leave their cottages and spend their days in great factories established by
							capitalists who had enough money to erect the huge buildings and install in them the
							elaborate and costly machinery and the engines to run it. As an English writer has
							concisely put it, "The typical unit of production is no longer a single family or
							group of persons working with a few cheap, simple tools upon small quantities of raw
							material, but a compact and closely organized mass of <pb id="VAB8216-304" n="269"/>
							labor composed of hundreds or thousands of individuals cooperating with large
							quantities of expensive and intricate machinery through which passes a continuous and
							mighty volume of raw material on its way to the consuming public."<ref id="ref_154"

						<note rend="right">1. Division of labor</note>

						<p>One of the principal results of the factory system is that it makes possible a minute
							division of labor. Instead of giving his time and thought to the whole process, each
							worker concentrates his attention upon a single stage of it, and by repeating a simple
							set of motions over and over again acquires wonderful dexterity. At the same time the
							period of necessary apprenticeship is shortened, because each separate task is
							comparatively simple. Moreover the invention of new machinery is increased, because
							the very subdivision of the process into simple steps often suggests some way of
							substituting mechanical action for that of the human hand.</p>

						<note rend="right">2. Examples of the increased production of goods by machinery</note>

						<p>An example of the greatly increased output rendered possible by the use of machinery
							and the division of labor is given by the distinguished Scotch economist, Adam Smith,
							whose great work, <hi rend="i">The Wealth of Nations</hi>, appeared in 1776. Speaking
							of the manufacture of a pin in his own time, Adam Smith says: "To make the head
							requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business, to
							whiten the pin is another. It is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper,
							and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about
							eighteen distinct operations." By this division, he adds, ten persons can make upwards
							of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. This was when machinery was in its infancy. A
							recent writer reports that an English machine now makes one hundred and eighty pins a
							minute, cutting the wire, flattening the heads, sharpening the points, and dropping
							the pins into their proper places. In a single factory which he visited seven million
							pins were made in a day, and three men were all that were required to manage the
							mechanism.</p>

							III p. 63.</note>

						<pb id="VAB8216-305" n="270"/>

						<note rend="right">Printing</note>

						<p>Another example of modern mechanical work is found in printing. For several centuries
							after Gutenberg printed his first book, the type was set by hand, inked by hand, each
							sheet of paper was laid by hand upon the type and then printed by means of a press
							operated by a hand lever. Nowadays our newspapers, in the great cities at least, are
							printed almost altogether by machinery, from the setting up of the type until they are
							dropped, complete, and counted out by hundreds, at the bottom of a rotary press. The
							paper is fed into the press from a great roll and is printed on both sides and folded
							at the rate of five hundred or more newspapers a minute.</p>

						<note rend="right">3. Growth of great manufacturing towns</note>

						<p>Before the coming of machinery industry was not concentrated in a few great cities,
							but was scattered more or less evenly over the country in the hands of small masters,
							or independent workmen, who combined manufacturing with agriculture on a small scale.
							For example, the metal workers of West Bromwich and the cutlers of Sheffield (already
							famous in Chaucer's day) lived in cottages with small plots of land around them, and
							in dull seasons, or to change their occupation, engaged in gardening. The factory
							system put an end to all this. The workmen now had to live near their work; long rows
							of houses, without gardens or even grass plots, were hastily built around the factory
							buildings, and thus the ugly tenement districts of our cities came into existence.</p>

						<note rend="right">4. Appearance of capitalist class</note>

						<p>This great revolution in the methods of manufacturing produced also a sharp
							distinction between two classes of men involved. There were, on the one hand, the
							capitalists who owned the buildings and all the mechanism, and, on the other, the
							workmen whom they hired to operate the machines. Previous to the eighteenth century
							those who owned large estates had been, on the whole, the most important class in
							political and social life. But, alongside of the landed aristocracy, a powerful
							mercantile class had arisen, whose wealth, gained by commerce and trade, gave them
							influence in the affairs of the <pb id="VAB8216-306" n="271"/> nation.<ref
								id="ref_155" rend="super" target="note_155">1</ref> With the improvements in
							machinery there was added the new class of modern capitalists, who amassed fortunes by
							establishing great manufacturing industries.<ref id="ref_156" rend="super"
								target="note_156">2</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">5. The workman becomes dependent upon the capitalist</note>
						<note rend="right">Problem of Labor <hi rend="i">vs.</hi> Capital</note>

						<p>The workingman necessarily became dependent upon the few who were rich enough to set
							up factories. He could no longer earn a livelihood in the old way by conducting a
							small shop to suit himself. The capitalist owned and controlled the necessary
							machinery, and so long as there were plenty of workmen seeking employment in order to
							earn their daily bread, the owner could fix a low wage and long hours. While an
							individual employee of special ability might himself become a capitalist, the ordinary
							workman would have to remain a workman. The question of the proportion of the product
							which should go to the workers, and that which may properly be taken by the
							capitalist, or manager, who makes a successful business possible, lies at the basis of
							the great problem of capital and labor.</p>

						<note rend="right">6. Women and children in the factories</note>

						<p>The destruction of the domestic system of industry had also a revolutionary effect
							upon the work and the lives of women and children. In all except the heaviest of the
							mechanical industries, such as iron working or ship building, the introduction of
							simple machines tended greatly to increase the number of women and children employed
							compared with the men. For example, in the textile industry in England during the
							fifty years from 1841 to 1891, the number of males employed increased fifty-three per
							cent, and the number of females two hundred and twenty-one per cent. Before the
							invention of the steam engine, when the simple machines were worked by hand, children
							could be employed only in some of the minor processes such as preparing the cotton for
							spinning. But in <note id="note_155"><ref target="ref_155" rend="super">1</ref> See
								Defoe's description of eighteenth-century merchant princes, <hi rend="i"
									>Readings</hi>, Vol. II, p. 67.</note>
							<note id="note_156"><ref target="ref_156" rend="super">2</ref> The industrial
								capitalist began to appear even before the days of Arkwright and Watt, for there
								were employers earlier, who in some cases collected ten, twenty, or more looms in a
								town and employed workmen who had no tools of their own, thus creating something
								like the later factory system.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-307" n="272"/> the modern factory labor is largely confined to
							watching machines, piecing broken threads, and working levers, so that both women and
							children can be utilized as effectively as men, and much more cheaply.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Industrial Revolution relieves some women of their former
							duties</note>

						<p>Doubtless the women were by no means idle under the old system of domestic industry,
							but their tasks were varied and performed at home, whereas under the new system they
							must flock to the factory at the call of the whistle, and labor monotonously at a
							speed set by the foreman. This led to many grave abuses which, as we shall see, the
							State has been called upon to remedy by factory legislation, which has served to save
							the women and children from some of the worst hardships, although a great deal still
							remains to be done. On the other hand, thousands of women belonging to the more
							fortunate classes have been relieved of many of the duties which devolved upon the
							housewife in the eighteenth century, when many things were made at home which can now
							be better and more cheaply produced on a large scale.</p>

						<note rend="right">7. Broadening effects of mechanical progress on the workingman</note>

						<p>Before the Industrial Revolution there had been no sudden change in the life and
							habits of the people, since the same tools had been used in the same way, often by the
							same family, from generation to generation. When invention began change began, and it
							seems likely to become more and more rapid, since new and better ways of doing things
							are discovered daily. Old methods give way to new ones, and the workman of to-day may
							successively engage in a considerable variety of occupations during his life as
							industries rise, are transformed, and decline under the stress of competition and
							invention. This serves to shake the workingman out of the old routine, encourages him
							to move from place to place as circumstances dictate, and so widens his experience and
							broadens his mind. He has also learned to combine with his fellows into national
							unions, and even international congresses of workingmen are held to consider their
							common interests and agree upon general policies to be pursued.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-308" n="273"/>

						<note rend="right">8. Expansion of commerce</note>

						<p>To these changes still another may be added, i.e. the expansion of commerce. In spite
							of the development of trade before the eighteenth century, a great part of the goods
							produced was destined to be consumed in the neighborhood, whereas, after the invention
							of machinery, it became customary to manufacture goods to be sold in any part of the
							world; so that one would find the products of Manchester or Birmingham in Hong-kong,
							Melbourne, or Bulawayo. According to official estimates, the exports of England, which
							amounted to less than fourteen million pounds sterling in 1783, exceeded twenty-nine
							millions thirteen years later.</p>

						<note rend="right">9. Effect of the Industrial Revolution on governments and
							politics</note>

						<p>The Industrial Revolution, in addition to changing fundamentally the old methods of
							living, traveling, and working, gave an entirely new direction to European politics
							and to theories of government and industry. The two great classes created by the
							Industrial Revolution, namely, the middle class and the working class, each entered
							politics on its own account; and the struggle of these two groups against the feudal
							landlords and the clergy constitutes a very large portion of the political history of
							Europe during the nineteenth century. The contest of the manufacturers of Europe to
							win markets for their products in the four corners of the earth is largely responsible
							for the opening up of backward places in the Orient and Africa.</p>

						<note rend="right">The middle class</note>

						<p>The enterprising mill owners and merchants handling products naturally were
							discontented with the way in which feudal landlords and absolute monarchs monopolized,
							or attempted to monopolize, government. They also were dissatisfied with the attempts
							of governments to maintain many of the restrictions on industry and business
							enterprise which originated in the Middle Ages, and which only hampered the individual
							initiative of the man who wanted to run his business in his own way and sell his goods
							as he pleased.</p>

						<note rend="right">Political economy</note>

						<p>This middle class of manufacturers and traders developed a theory of government
							suited to their particular interests, which they called political economy. According
							to this theory of <pb id="VAB8216-309" n="274"/> government or political economy,
							which was formulated by Adam Smith and developed by Ricardo and other writers, the
							government should keep its hands off of industry. It should not attempt to regulate
							prices of goods or pass upon their quality. Neither should it interfere with the
							employer and his workmen, nor prescribe the hours or conditions of labor in
							factories.</p>

						<note rend="right">The theory of individualism</note>

						<p>The principle on which this early political economy was based was that every person
							was the best judge of what was good for himself, and, if left alone, would rise or
							fall in the scale of prosperity according to his individual efforts and abilities.
							Prices would be kept at the lowest possible point by competition among manufacturers,
							and a "natural" rate of wages would be established in each industry under the law of
							supply and demand. This theory was peculiarly acceptable to the prosperous middle
							class of merchants and manufacturers, and they assumed that their doctrines were not
							only sound and productive of the greatest happiness, but partook of the character of
							"natural laws" which could not be broken by governments or by organizations of
							workingmen without disastrous consequences.</p>

						<note rend="right">The working class and their "political economy"</note>

						<p>The chief trouble with this political economy was that it did not work out in
							practice, as the theorists had imagined, in universal well-being. On the contrary, the
							great manufacturing cities, instead of being filled with happy and prosperous people,
							became the homes of a relatively few well-to-do and multitudes of poor working people,
							who rapidly grew discontented with their lot in life and refused to be pacified by
							declarations that the condition in which they found themselves was the product of
							"nature." The working class and their sympathizers began to criticize the political
							economy of the middle class, and their spokesmen began to formulate one of their own.
							Their attitude toward the economy of Adam Smith and Ricardo is summed up in the words
							of Charles Kingsley: "The man who tells us that we ought to investigate nature simply
							to sit still patiently under her and let her freeze and ruin and starve and <pb
								id="VAB8216-310" n="275"/> stink us to death is a goose, whether he calls himself a
							chemist or a political economist." Out of this revolt against the conditions of life
							imposed by the uncontrolled factory system grew what is called vaguely the socialist
							movement.</p>

						<note rend="right">Saint-Simon 1760-1825</note>

							assume a leading place. The first is commonly regarded as the founder of French
							socialism. He was the heir to a great name and a considerable fortune and received his
							education from some of the leading scholars of his day; after demonstrating his love
							of liberty by participating in the American War of Independence, he devoted himself to
							the study of means for improving the social order. He came to the conclusion that the
							government should organize and manage industry through associations which would secure
							to each worker a reward proportionate to his services to the State. In his book <note

							distress. After his death a small school of followers continued to propagate his
							doctrine.</p>

						<note rend="right">Fourier, 1772-1837</note>

						<p>While Saint-Simon was elaborating his plan for the regeneration of society, another
							Frenchman, Charles Fourier (b. 1772), was advocating a different remedy for poverty.
							He did not believe that the central government could possibly manage properly the
							great business enterprises necessary to human welfare, so he urged the formation of
							groups of families into what he called "phalanxes," which should each contain about
							two thousand members. Each group was to own buildings and all the needful implements
							for the production of the necessities of life. The total product was to be divided up
							in the following manner: capital was to receive four twelfths, labor five twelfths,
							and the talent necessary for the proper management of the phalanxes and all their
							enterprises was to receive three twelfths. Fourier believed that in this way universal
							harmony would be produced. His profound confidence in his theory is illustrated by the
							fact that for years he was at his house at twelve o'clock to confer with any
							philanthropist who felt inclined to furnish the money to start the first phalanx. The
							awaited visitor never came, but nevertheless Fourier's theories won many sympathizers,
							especially in the United States, among men of no less insight than Horace Greeley,
							Charles A. Dana, and George William Curtis. The experiment of actually founding a
							species of phalanx was made in Massachusetts by the Brook Farm Colony, of which
							several distinguished Americans were members for a time.</p>

						<note rend="right">Robert Owen</note>

						<p>In England the first great exponent of socialism was Robert Owen,<ref id="ref_158"
								rend="super" target="note_158">1</ref> a successful manufacturer and a generous
							friend of the poor. Like Fourier, he believed that he had found the secret for the
							regeneration of mankind in the formation of cooperative groups which should own and

							He wrote <note id="note_158"><ref target="ref_158" rend="super">1</ref> See below, p.
								400.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-312" n="277"/> innumerable works and tracts and preached his doctrine
							with untiring zeal; he even appealed to the crowned heads of Europe to take up his
							plan, and came to the United States to defend it before the House of Representatives.
							Several of his proposed colonies were actually founded in Great Britain, and also in
							the United States (for example, at New Harmony, Indiana), but they failed for a
							variety of reasons. Nevertheless, Owen's writings and labors influenced the working
							classes in England, and it is to his inspiration that the great British cooperative
							enterprises of the present day are largely due. It is probable, too, that we owe to
							Owen the word "socialism."</p>

						<note rend="right">The utopian socialists regarded by modern socialists as
							unpractical</note>

						<p>All these theorists had much in common. They were deeply moved by the misery which
							they saw about them, they boldly condemned the system of society in which they lived,
							and proposed a revolution which should remedy its evils. They did not, however, reckon
							with the great complexity of human nature or the respect for tradition which always
							stands in the way of change. They assumed that it would only be necessary to present a
							reasonable and beautiful theory of harmony and plenty in order to induce men to found
							a new social order. They also appealed to the upper classes for aid in realizing their
							schemes, and made no attempt to organize the great mass of workingmen into political
							parties for the purpose of getting control of the government and forcing it to forward
							their plans. The modern socialists look back upon these men as unpractical "utopians"

						<note rend="right">Karl Marx, 1818-1883</note>

						<p>The first of these young men may be regarded as the founder of international
							socialism, although there is no doubt that he owed a great deal to the labors of his
							colleague. Karl Marx was born in 1818 in Treves, reared in an enlightened home, and
							educated at the Universities of Bonn and Berlin. He had early decided upon the career
							of a university professor, but the boldness of his speech and his radical tendencies
							barred his way and consequently he entered journalism. His attacks on the Prussian
							government led to the suppression of his paper in 1843, and the close surveillance of
							the police caused him to migrate to Paris. He was, however, expelled from France by
							Guizot, and after some wanderings he finally settled in London, where he studied and
							wrote until his death in 1883.</p>

						<note rend="right"><hi rend="i">Das Kapital</hi></note>

						<p>Throughout his life Marx wrote voluminously on history, philosophy, and current
							politics, and for a time he was a correspondent of the New York <hi rend="i"
								>Tribune</hi> when it was under the management of Horace Greeley. His fundamental
							views on political economy were brought together in a large work of three volumes
							entitled <hi rend="i">Das Kapital</hi> ("Capital"), the first part of which appeared
							in 1867, but which was left unfinished at his death. This work is so widely circulated
							among socialist leaders that it is sometimes called "the workingman's Bible," although

								>1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Central idea of socialism</note>

						<p>In this present struggle, Marx believed, the working class would win by uniting to
							overthrow the capitalist class, <hi rend="i">not, however, by dividing up the
								property,</hi>-- which would even to a socialist seem sheer folly,-- but by
							transferring ownership to the state or nation as a whole, which should operate the
							means of production for the direct benefit of the people.</p>

						<note rend="right">The manner in which Marx believed socialism would be brought
							about</note>

						<p>The very development of modern industry, Marx contended, favors the establishment of
							socialism. Wealth and industries are concentrating in the control of great companies,
							trusts, and corporations, which are managed from central offices and carried on by
							salaried employees and manual laborers, while the capitalist, he declared, is becoming
							only a stockholder, an idle drone drawing dividends earned for him by other men.
							Hence, argued Marx, the capitalist has become a mere owner of property, as useless as
							the feudal lords in the eighteenth century, <note id="note_161"><ref target="ref_161"
									rend="super">1</ref> That is, the great mass of the people as distinguished from
								the capitalistic class, or "bourgeoisie."</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-317" n="280"/> who neither fought in the armies nor protected the
							peasants around their castles as their ancestors had done, but crowded about the court
							of the king, where they lived magnificently on revenues collected by their stewards
							from the poor people who tilled their estates. Marx therefore predicted that in time
							the capitalist's right of ownership will be abolished, and that the salaried employees
							of the great corporations will become the salaried clerks of the government when it
							takes over all the industries for the common good; thus socialism will be
							established.</p>

						<note rend="right">Socialists maintain "labor" is the source of all wealth and is
							therefore entitled to the whole product</note>

						<p>It seems to the socialist that labor, in the broadest sense of the word, is the
							source of all wealth, whether this consists in houses, railroads, shoes and stockings,
							flour and potatoes, books, pictures, schools, libraries, newspapers, chemical
							laboratories, telephones. It was labor, they argue, which produced the capital
							necessary to establish the factories or railroads, and it is labor which keeps up the
							stream of goods of all kinds and directs man's energies into new and profitable
							fields. Only one who contributes in some way to the welfare of mankindwhether as a
							simple day laborer or an engineer, manager, inventor, designer, teacher, author,
							editor, or artist-- should have any share in the general output.</p>

						<note rend="right">Socialists would abolish private ownership of the means of
							production</note>

						<p>But as industry is now organized, the socialist holds, those who happen to have money
							to invest in machines, farms, and mines often derive a very large revenue from them
							without taking any part in the work. Consequently the socialists would turn over all
							of the means of production to the State, just as the roads, the waterworks, the
							telegraphs and telephones, and the postal system are now frequently in the hands of
							the government. Private ownership would then be confined to personal effects and
							articles of consumption,-- food, clothing, furniture, pictures, and books. This, they
							believe, would free the poor from the "exploitation" of the rich capitalists, who now
							too often control the newspapers and the lawmaking in their own interests and are able
							to arrange everything to increase their <pb id="VAB8216-318" n="281"/> personal share
							in the wealth produced. The extinction of the capitalist is to the socialist the only
							method of relieving the people as a whole from poverty and oppression.</p>

						<note rend="right">Reply of Marx to those who cry out against the abolition of private
							property</note>

						<p>To those who raise a cry against the injustice of this plan Marx replies: "You are
							horrified at our intention to do away with private property. But in your existing form
							of society private property is already done away with for nine tenths of the people;
							its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those
							nine tenths. You reproach us, therefore, for proposing to abolish a form of property
							which can only exist because it is denied to the immense majority of society." So
							long, he urges, as the fundamental vice remains, the well-meaning efforts of
							"economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, improvers of the condition of the working
							class, organizers of charity, members of societies for the prevention of cruelty to
							animals, temperance agitators, and hole-in-the-corner reformers of every kind" must
							prove vain or insignificant.</p>

						<note rend="right">Glorious picture of a socialistic future</note>

						<p>In the name of "true democracy and human welfare" Marx and his followers summon the
							proletariat of every land, who, they urge, have nothing now to lose except their
							chains, to unite and make the world their own. They hold up before the workingman a
							picture of a time to come when the idle will be set to labor, and no one will become
							rich at the cost of his neighbor, when every one will have an opportunity to develop
							for the benefit of society the best that is in him. Poverty will then disappear, and
							all men, organized into a great army for the conquest of Nature, will emancipate
							themselves from hunger and disease and live together in harmony and brotherly
							love.</p>

						<p>It was some time before the principles laid down by Marx and Engels in the <hi
								rend="i">Communist Manifesto</hi> became accepted dogmas of great socialist parties;
							but the working-class leaders during the early part of the nineteenth century
							everywhere in Europe struggled to obtain the ballot for workingmen and to secure
							government interference to improve their lot. They participated actively in the

						<note rend="right">Character of Louis Philippe</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">43.</hi> The revolution of 1830 gave the final blow in France to the
							divine right of kings. The sovereignty of the people was proclaimed in the revised
							Charter which Louis Philippe accepted from the parliament. He added to the former
							title-- "King of the French by the Grace of God "-- the significant phrase "and the
							Will of the Nation." But in spite of these externals, only a small fraction of the
							nation had any part in the new government. The revised election law, which reduced the
							voting age from forty to thirty years and the property qualification by one third,
							still excluded the majority of Frenchmen from political life. The king himself
							announced that his policy would be the golden mean between conservatism and
							liberalism. He lived without the pomp of royalty, and was fond of going shopping,
							almost unattended, carrying his green umbrella under his arm. He was cautious,
							grasping, and avaricious, and as time wore on he grew more and more conservative. His
							reign of eighteen years was a period of political stagnation.</p>

						<note rend="right">The legitimists</note>

						<p>The so-called "July monarchy" was therefore stoutly opposed by two types of
							extremists,-- the adherents of the older Bourbon line, or "legitimists," as they were
							called, and the republicans. The former regarded as their lawful king a grandson of
							Charles X whom they called Henry V. This party was numerically small; it was mainly
							recruited from the nobility and the clergy, and was not given to violent measures,
							such as throwing up barricades and seizing public buildings.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-321" n="284"/>

						<note rend="right">The republicans</note>

						<p>It was an altogether different matter with the republicans, who cherished the
							memories of 1793 and continued to threaten France with another violent revolution.
							This party carried on its work mainly through secret societies, similar to the
							Carbonari in Italy, which spread rapidly in the new manufacturing towns. Remembering
							the ease with which they had overturned the throne in 1830, the republicans made
							several futile attempts to organize insurrections, which were speedily put down,
							however, by Louis Philippe's troops.</p>

						<note rend="right">The government takes measures to suppress the republican party</note>

						<p>In addition to their other efforts to destroy the monarchy, the republicans published
							a number of papers which attacked the government and even ventured to make sport of
							the king. The administration thereupon determined to suppress entirely this
							revolutionary party by strict police supervision of societies and by press censorship.
							By these vigorous methods the republicans, as a political party, were reduced for the
							time being to insignificance.</p>

						<note rend="right">The socialists</note>

						<p>Meanwhile there was growing up in the large industrial cities a socialistic party,
							which no mere change of rulers or extension of the suffrage would satisfy. Its members
							had seen the republic, the empire, and the Bourbon monarchy come and go, and
							constitutions made and unmade, leaving the poverty of the peasants and workingmen
							unalleviated. On the other hand, they had seen the nobles deprived of their privileges
							and the clergy of their property, and it was only natural that bold thinkers among
							them should demand that the triumphant middle class, who owed their wealth to commerce
							and the new machinery, should in turn be divested of some of their riches and
							privileges in the interest of the working classes.</p>

						<note rend="right">BabÅ“uf advocates a socialistic system during the Reign of
							Terror</note>

						<p>Denunciations of private property and of the unequal distribution of wealth had been
							heard during the first French Revolution and even earlier, but they had attracted
							little attention. BabÅ“uf (1760-1797) had declared in the days of the Terror that a <hi
								rend="i">political</hi> revolution left the condition of the people practically
							unchanged. "When I see the poor without the <pb id="VAB8216-322" n="285"/> clothing
							and shoes which they themselves are engaged in making, and contemplate the small
							minority who do not work and yet want for nothing, I am convinced that government is
							still the old conspiracy of the few against the many, only it has taken a new form."
							His proposal to transfer all property to the State and so administer it that every one
							should be assured employment, speedily found adherents, and a society was formed to
							usher in the new order. The organization was soon suppressed and BabÅ“uf himself
							executed; but his writings were widely circulated, and after the July revolution in
							1830 several groups of socialists began to agitate their plans of social
							revolution.</p>

						<note rend="right">Louis Blanc's <hi rend="i">Organization of Labor</hi>, 1839</note>

						<p>The work of formulating a practical program for these different factions was
							undertaken by Louis Blanc, whose volume on <hi rend="i">The Organization of
							Labor</hi>, published in 1839, gave definiteness to the vague aspirations of the
								reformers.<ref id="ref_162" rend="super" target="note_162">1</ref> Blanc proclaimed
							the right of all men to employment and the duty of the State to provide it. He
							proposed that the government should furnish the capital to found national workshops
							which should be managed by the workmen, who were to divide the profits of the industry
							among themselves, thus abolishing the employing class altogether. The "organization of
							labor" became the battle cry of the labor leaders; it was heard even in the Chamber of
							Deputies. Nevertheless, there was no well-organized socialist party ready to enter the
							political field or to work for a definite aim.</p>

						<note rend="right">Views of Thiers and Guizot</note>

						<p>The political power at this time was really in the hands of two groups of statesmen,
							one headed by Thiers, and the other by Guizot, both famous as historians and men of
							letters. Thiers wished to have a constitution like that of England, where, as he was
							wont to say, "the king reigns but does not rule." Guizot wished the king to exercise
							real power; he did not want the throne to become an "empty armchair," and regarded
							further changes in the constitution as undesirable. In 1840 he became prime minister,
							and he and the king together <note id="note_162"><hi rend="center"><ref
										target="ref_162" rend="super">1</ref> For Blanc's labor program, see <hi
										rend="i">Readings</hi>, Vol. II, p. 76.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-323" n="286"/> ruled France for eight years. Though personally
							honorable, Guizot placed the government on a thoroughly corrupt basis and then
							attempted to stifle protest by police measures and the prosecution of newspaper
							editors. He steadily refused to undertake any legislation for the benefit of the
							working classes and opposed all efforts to extend the suffrage, maintaining that there
							were not more than one hundred thousand persons in all France "capable of voting with
							good judgment and independence."</p>

						<note rend="right">The February revolution in Paris</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">44.</hi> In spite of Guizot's strong position, there were, in February,
							1848, disturbances in the streets of Paris which frightened Louis Philippe and led to
							the resignation of the unpopular minister. But this did not restore quiet, for the
							leaders in the street disturbances wanted far more than a change in the ministry.
							During the evening of the twenty-third they made a formidable demonstration before the
							Foreign Office, where Guizot resided; thereupon the soldiers on guard fired upon and
							killed several of the rioters. This roused the anger of the populace to fever heat;
							the bodies of the victims were placed on a cart and carried through the boulevards in
							a weird torch-light procession. Before the dawn of February 24 the eastern part of the
							city was covered with barricades. In the narrow winding streets a cart or two and a
							heap of cobblestones formed an effective fortification, while the tall houses on
							either side enabled a few defenders to check a considerable body of soldiers.</p>

						<note rend="right">Abdication of Louis Philippe, February 24, 1848</note>
						<note rend="right">A republic proclaimed</note>

						<p>The entire city was soon in the hands of the insurgents, and Louis Philippe in
							despair abdicated in favor of his grandson, the count of Paris. Both the republicans
							and the labor party were determined to have no more royalty, so they proclaimed a
							republic on the afternoon of the twenty-fourth, subject to the ratification of the
							people in a national assembly to be summoned immediately.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-324" n="286"/>

						<note rend="right">How the labor party was able to control the provisional
							government</note>

						<p>The moderate republicans were quite satisfied with merely abolishing the monarchy,
							but the workingmen, whose active coÃ¶peration had put the revolutionists in power, had
							set their hearts on introducing the whole scheme advocated by Louis Blanc. A decree
							was issued by the provisional government ordering the establishment of national
							workshops and charging the minister of public works with carrying the plan into
							execution. This measure was accepted by the majority of the provisional government in
							order to avoid a division in their ranks, which at that moment might have led to a
							renewal of disorder in Paris.</p>

						<note rend="right">A labor commission established at the Luxembourg</note>

						<p>As a further concession to the labor element the provisional government declared that
							it was necessary without delay to assure to the people the legitimate fruits of their
							labor, and established in the Luxembourg palace a committee charged with the special
							task of looking after the interests of the working classes. This was really a shrewd
							move on the part of the opponents of the "socialists," for it sent the latter away
							from the City Hall to waste their time in making fine speeches and expounding theories
							for the execution of which no money had been appropriated.</p>

						<note rend="right">The labor parliament assembles in the hall hitherto occupied by the
							House of Peers</note>

						<p>The Luxembourg committee, headed by Louis Blanc and a leader of the workingmen named
							Albert, began its sessions on March i, and at once proceeded to organize a labor
							parliament composed of delegates from each craft. This was opened on March 10 with a
							speech by the eloquent Blanc. He declared that as he beheld the workmen assembled in
							the Hall of the Peers, hitherto the sanctuary of privilege, in which so many laws
							directed against them had been made, he felt an emotion which he could with difficulty
							repress. "On these same seats," he exclaimed, "once glittering with embroidered coats,
							what do I see now? Garments threadbare with honorable toil, some perhaps bearing the
							marks of recent conflict." The labor parliament, however, accomplished very little,
							for the government had furnished them with no capital, and consequently Louis Blanc
							and his supporters were powerless to carry <pb id="VAB8216-325" n="288"/> out their
							plan for coÃ¶perative workshops, which they regarded as the most vital of all their
								reforms.<ref id="ref_163" rend="super" target="note_163">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">The national workshops a mere temporary expedient unworthy the
							name</note>

						<p>The provisional government had, it is true, ordered the establishment of national
							workshops and issued a decree guaranteeing employment to all, but with very different
							motives from those of the labor committee. Louis Blanc and his followers sought to
							organize the various trades into permanent, self-supporting coÃ¶perative industries,
							financed in the beginning by the State, but managed by the workingmen themselves. The
							provisional government, on the contrary, merely desired to allay the restlessness of
							the unemployed by fair promises. It opened relief works accordingly, which offered
							more or less useless occupation to the idle men who thronged to Paris. It attempted no
							more than merely to organize into brigades those who applied for work, and set them to
							digging ditches and building forts at a uniform wage of two francs a day.</p>

						<p>This crude temporary expedient was put into operation March 1, and in fifteen days
							six thousand men had enrolled in the government employ. In April the number reached a
							hundred thousand, and several million francs were being expended to pay these labor
							gangs. The plan, however, realized the original object of the government,-- it kept
							the idle busy and prevented disorder until the conservative classes could regain their
							usual ascendency.</p>

						<note rend="right">The National Assembly exhibits no sympathy for socialism</note>

						<p>On May 4 the provisional government gave way to a National Assembly elected by
							practically universal manhood suffrage, which was called upon to draft a new
							republican constitution for the country. The majority of the deputies were moderate
							republicans who were bitterly opposed to all socialistic tendencies. The rural
							districts which had taken no part in the Revolution could now make themselves felt,
							and it was clear enough that the representatives of the peasants did not sympathize in
							any way with the projects and demands of the Paris workingmen.</p>

						<note rend="right">The terrible "June days" of 1848</note>

						<p>Before it could proceed to consider seriously the form of the new constitution the
							National Assembly was forced to take decisive measures in regard to the "national
							workshops," to which crowds continued to flock, draining the treasury to pay for their
							useless labor. It soon resolved to close the "workshops," and ordered the men either
							to join the army or leave the city. The people at once set up the cry of "bread or
							lead," and the most terrible street fighting that Paris had ever witnessed ensued. The
							streets of the districts inhabited by the working classes were again torn up for
							barricades, and from Friday, June 23, until the following Monday a desperate conflict
							raged. The assembly, fearing the triumph of the labor party, invested General
							Cavaignac with dictatorial power to crush the revolt. Victory was inevitably on the
							side of the government troops, who were well disciplined and well equipped, while the
							insurgents fought irregularly and were half-starved. In its hour of triumph the
							government's retaliation was most unjustifiably severe; about four thousand citizens
							were transported without trial, thirty-two newspapers were suppressed, and the leading
							writers among the radicals imprisoned. Order was restored, but the carnage of the
							"June days" left a heritage of undying hatred between the workingmen and the
							capitalists of Paris.</p>

						<note rend="right">The constitution of the second French Republic completed, November,
							1848</note>

						<p>After this "solution" of the labor problem the assembly turned to the work of drawing
							up a constitution. In spite of a strong royalist minority, the assembly had declared
							itself in favor of a republic on the very first day of meeting. It revived the motto
							of "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity," and urged all Frenchmen to forget their former
							dissensions and "to constitute henceforth but a single family."</p>

						<p>After six months of debate a new constitution was promulgated. It proclaimed the
							sovereignty of the people and guaranteed religious freedom and liberty of the press.
							The government was vested in a single chamber elected by popular vote, and in a
							president, to be chosen, also by popular vote, for a term, of four years.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-329" n="290"/>

						<note rend="right">The candidates for the presidency</note>

						<p>After the establishment of the constitution, interest centered in the first
							presidential election, held on December 10, 1848. Three leading candidates entered the
							contest, Ledru-Rollin, representing the labor party, General Cavaignac, who had so
							ruthlessly suppressed the June insurrection, and Louis Napoleon, a nephew of Napoleon
							I.</p>

						<note rend="right">Checkered career of Louis Napoleon</note>

						<p>The last of these candidates had up to this time led a varied and interesting life.
							He was born in Paris while his father, Louis Napoleon, was king of Holland. After his
							uncle's down-fall, when he was six years old, he was expelled from France with his
							mother, who wandered about with him for some time. She continually impressed upon his
							youthful mind the fact that one who bore the great name of Bonaparte was destined to
							accomplish something in the world, and he came firmly to believe that it was his
							mission to reestablish the Napoleonic dynasty on the throne of France.</p>

							labored only for the good of the people, and who was overthrown by tyrants.</p>

						<p>In 1840 it seemed to Louis Napoleon that the time was ripe for another attempt to win
							the coveted crown. He landed with a few companions at Boulogne, bringing with him a
							tame eagle as an emblem of the empire. This second enterprise, like the first, proved
							a fiasco, and the unhappy leader was shut up in a fortress, from which, in 1846, he
							escaped to England to await the good fortune to which he still firmly believed himself
							destined.</p>

						<note rend="right">Louis Napoleon returns to France in 1848</note>

						<p>The insurrection in 1848 offered just the opportunity he desired, and four days after

							promised the working classes special laws for their benefit; but, on the other hand,
							he distinctly repudiated all socialistic schemes and reassured the middle classes by
							guaranteeing order and the security of property. He did not forget the soldiers, to
							whom he recalled the glories of the empire and offered an assured existence in return
							for their long and faithful services to their country. This time his plans worked
							admirably, for he was elected president by an overwhelming majority of five and a half
							million votes to less than one million and a half cast for the two other candidates
							combined.</p>

						<note rend="right">How Louis Napoleon began to work toward reÃ«establishing the

						<p>He speedily began to work for a revision of the constitution that would extend his
							term of office from four to ten years. He selected his ministers from among his

							journeys through the country sought to arouse the enthusiasm of the people for the
							restoration of the empire.</p>

						<note rend="right">Coup d'Ã©tat of December 1-2, 1851</note>

						<p>As the Assembly refused to coÃ¶perate in his plans he finally determined to risk a <hi
								rend="i">coup d'Ã©tat</hi>, which he had been meditating for some time. After a
							social function held in his palace on the evening of December 1, 1851, he gathered
							about him a few of his most trusted advisers and confided his designs to them. When
							the morning of December 2-- the anniversary of the glorious victory of Austerlitz--
							broke, the walls of Paris were placarded with copies of a decree issued by the
							president, dissolving the Assembly, reÃ«stablishing universal suffrage, and ordering a
							new election.<ref id="ref_167" rend="super" target="note_167">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">The president is given dictatorial power by a plebiscitum</note>

						<p>Finally, he submitted to the people of France the following proposition: "The French

							delegate to him the necessary powers in order to make a constitution on the basis
							announced in his proclamation of December 2." Every Frenchman twenty-one years of age
							was permitted to vote "yes" or "no" on this proposition, and the result was officially
							estimated at 7,740,000 for the measure and 646,000 against it. The <hi rend="i">coup

							including the leaders of the opposition in the assembly, were arrested, and nearly ten
							thousand were deported, but the people at large accepted the situation without
							protest. The workingmen generally rejoiced in the overthrow of the politicians who had
							waged war on them in the bloody June days of 1848.</p>

						<note rend="right">ReÃ«stablishment of the empire, November 1852</note>

						<p>The president was now master of France. He appointed officers, initiated laws,
							declared war, made peace, and in fact himself constituted the real power in the
							government. Though already an emperor in reality, he was not satisfied until he
							secured the title, and it was evident that the country was ready for the fulfillment
							of his hopes, for wherever he went he was greeted with cries of "Long live the
							Emperor." Part of this public sentiment was doubtless inspired by the president's
							officials, but the name of Napoleon awakened glorious memories, and there was a
							genuine desire throughout France to see the empire reÃ«stablished.</p>

						<p>Toward the close of 1852 Louis Napoleon, in a speech at Bordeaux,<ref id="ref_168"
								rend="super" target="note_168">1</ref> at last openly announced his belief that
							France was ready for the abolition of the second republic. Inasmuch as the members of
							the senate were chosen by Louis Napoleon himself they readily agreed to pass a decree
							making him Napoleon III, emperor of the French. This decree was submitted to popular
							vote (November, 1852) and ratified by an overwhelming majority. The dream of Louis
							Napoleon's life was at last realized,-- the Napoleonic dynasty was restored.</p>

						<note rend="right">Despotic character of Napoleon III's government</note>

						<p>For over ten years his government was a thinly veiled despotism. Though the imperial
							constitution confirmed the great principles of the Revolution, a decree abolishing the
							liberty of the press was immediately issued. No periodical or newspaper treating of
							political or social economy could be published without previous authorization on the
							part of the government. Moreover the government officers could suppress journals at
							will. Napoleon III had promised liberty of instruction, but he <note id="note_168"><hi

						<note rend="right">Prosperity of France under the second empire, 1852-1870</note>

						<p>Notwithstanding this autocratic rÃ©gime, the country was prosperous and the people
							fairly contented. If the emperor was a despot, he endeavored-- and with no little
							success-- to be an enlightened one. Benevolent institutions increased in number.
							Railway construction was rapidly pushed forward, and great trunk lines which had been
							begun under Louis Philippe were completed. The city of Paris was improved and
							beautified; the narrow streets were widened and broad avenues laid out. The great
							exposition of 1855 testified to the industrial and scientific advance of France; and
							if little of all this progress is to be attributed to the emperor's initiative, it
							nevertheless remains a fact that it was accomplished under his rule. Moreover, in
							1870, he yielded to the imperative demand of the Liberals for a reform of the
							constitution, and established the responsibility of his ministers to parliament. If it
							had not been for a series of foreign events which weakened his prestige at home,
							Napoleon III might have remained securely on his throne until his death.</p>

						<note rend="right">The issues of the revolution of 1848 broader than those of the first
							French Revolution</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">46.</hi> When Metternich heard of the February revolution in France all
							his old fears were revived. "Europe finds herself to-day," he declared, "in the
							presence of a second 1793." Great changes had, however, taken place during the
							fifty-five years which had elapsed since France first offered to aid other nations to
							free themselves from their "tyrants" and throw off the trammels of feudalism. In 1848
							the principles proclaimed in the Declaration of the Rights of Man were accepted by the
							liberal parties which had come into existence in every state of Europe, and which were
							actively engaged in promoting the cause of popular government, a free press, equality
							of all before the law, and the abolition of the vestiges of the feudal system.
							Moreover the national spirit which had awakened during the Napoleonic Period was at
							work, and served more than anything else to excite opposition to the existing order.
							Lastly, the Industrial Revolution was quickening the thought and rousing the
							aspirations of the great mass of the population. Those who lived by the labor of their
							hands and were employed in the new industries which were rapidly developing now had
							their spokesmen, especially in France, and claimed the right to vote and to mold the
							laws to meet their particular interests. So in 1848 the rights of nations and of the
							laborer were added to the rights of man, which had constituted the main issue in
							1793.</p>

						<note rend="right">The agitation of 1848 general throughtout western Europe</note>

						<p>In nearly every European country, the liberals were encouraged by the successful
							February revolution in Paris to undertake <pb id="VAB8216-336" n="297"/> to win, by
							violence if necessary, the reforms which they had so long been advocating. In England
							a body of workingmen, known as "Chartists," made a desperate though futile effort to
							wring from Parliament the right to vote. The Swiss, who had just passed through a
							civil conflict, swept away the constitution which had been adopted in 1814, and drew
							up a new one.<ref id="ref_169" rend="super" target="note_169">1</ref> The chief
							agitations of 1848-- if we except that in France, described in the preceding chapter--
							occurred in Germany, Italy, and the Austrian dominions, and it seems best to consider
							first the disturbances in Vienna, where Metternich had for forty years been doing his
							best to prevent any hint of change.</p>

						<note rend="right">Extraordinary mixture of peoples under Austrian rule</note>

						<p>But before proceeding it will be necessary to consider more carefully than we have
							hitherto done the singular composition of the realms of the House of Hapsburg. The
							regions west of Vienna, extending to Switzerland and Bavaria, were inhabited chiefly
							by Germans. To the south, in the provinces of Carniola, Styria, Carinthia, and Istria,
							there were many Slavs; and to the north, in Bohemia and Moravia, were the Czechs,
							interspersed among twice their number of Germans. On the borders of Russia dwelt the
							Poles, whose territories the emperor had received at <note id="note_169"><ref
									target="ref_169" rend="super">1</ref> The settlement of 1815 in Switzerland, like
								that in Germany, Italy, and other European countries, met with opposition from the
								liberals. It had left the internal government of each canton in the hands of a small
								minority of the wealthy classes, and had modeled the diet on that of Germany, making
								it merely a congress of ambassadors with slight powers. Agitation for a revision of
								this system was begun immediately after its establishment, but it was opposed
								especially by the Catholics, who were in a slight minority and feared that a
								stronger central government would be used by the Protestants to restrict their
								rights. In 1841 the government of Aargau precipitated a civil conflict by
								suppressing the monasteries within its jurisdiction. Although the Swiss constitution
								guaranteed the monasteries in their rights, the federal government refused to
								interfere with the domestic concerns of Aargau. Thereupon the Catholic cantons,
								under the leadership of Lucerne, Uri, and Zug, formed a Catholic alliance, or <hi
									rend="i">Sonderbund</hi>, which defied the entire democratic and nationalist
								party. After some skirmishes which scarcely deserve the name of war, this party of
								disunion was suppressed, and in 1848 a new federal constitution drawn up. Instead of
								a diet of ambassadors it provided for a senate representing the states, and for
								deputies elected by the people at large on the plan of the government of the United
								States. This constitution was revised in 1874, when still larger powers were given
								to the federal government. For further details see Seignobos, <hi rend="i">Political
									History of Europe since 1814</hi>, pp. 256-285.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-337" n="298"/> the partition of their kingdom. The inhabitants of the
							kingdom of Hungary included, besides the Magyars, or Hungarians proper, who dwelt in
							the vast plains of the Danube valley, Roumanians in the south and east, and the
							independence-loving Croats (Croatians) in the south and west. Beyond the Alps was the
							Lombardo-Venetian kingdom inhabited by Italians. Among this mass of people of
							different tongues and traditions, the most important were the Germans of Austria, the
							Czechs of Bohemia, the Magyars of Hungary, and the Italians in Lombardy and
							Venetia.</p>

						<note rend="right">The government of Austria</note>

						<p>In the provinces of the Austrian Empire, Ferdinand I ruled personally through
							ministers whom he appointed and dismissed. Laws were made, taxes levied, and revenues
							spent without consulting the people. Newspapers, books, theaters, and teachers were
							under close police surveillance to prevent the introduction of any new ideas. Travel
							abroad was restricted by a decree which required every citizen leaving the realm to
							have a government passport. Scholars were therefore largely cut off from the thought
							of western Europe, and Metternich boasted that the scientific spirit had been kept out
							of even the universities. The nobles still enjoyed their ancient authority over their
							serfs, including the right to prevent their leaving the villages without permission,
							and to exact from them the old feudal services. The clergy were as powerful as they
							had been before the French Revolution, and non-Catholics were excluded entirely from
							government offices.</p>

						<note rend="right">Hungary controlled by the Magyar nobles</note>

						<p>In the kingdom of Hungary the government was under the control of the proud and
							tyrannical Magyar nobles, who still enjoyed their old feudal privileges. There was a
							diet, or parliament, composed of an upper house of nobles, and a lower house of
							representatives chosen by the smaller landlords. Although the Magyars, or Hungarians
								proper<ref id="ref_170" rend="super" target="note_170">1</ref>, constituted less
							than one <note id="note_170"><ref target="ref_170" rend="super">1</ref> The
								Hungarians-- who belong to a very different race from the Slavic peoples and speak
								the Magyar tongue-- invaded the Danube valley in the year 895, and wedged themselves
								in between the Slavic Russians and Poles on the north and the Slavic Croats,
								Slovaks, and Servians on the south.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-338" n="299"/> half of the population, they held their neighbors, the
							Croats, Roumanians, and Slovaks, in contempt, and denied them all national rights.
							There were, however, enlightened liberals in Hungary, whose programme included the
							admission of the public to the discussions in the diet; a parliamentary journal in
							which the debates should be published in full; regular yearly meetings of the diet;
							equal taxation of all classes; the abolition of the forced labor required of the
							peasant, and all other vestiges of serfdom.</p>

						<note rend="right">Kossuth (1802-1894)</note>

						<p>The government did all it could to suppress these tendencies. The publication of
							reform speeches was forbidden, and a prominent Hungarian leader, Kossuth, was
							imprisoned for circulating them in manuscript. Undaunted by this punishment, however,
							Kossuth, on his release, established a newspaper at Pesth and began to advocate
							radical reforms in the Hungarian government itself, as well as greater freedom from
							Austrian interference. With fiery zeal he wrote and spoke on the abolition of feudal
							privileges, the introduction of trial by jury, revision of the barbarous criminal law,
							and similar questions which had long agitated the rest of Europe.</p>

						<note rend="right">Causes of discontent in Lombardo-Venetia</note>

						<p>The Italians in Lombardo-Venetia were no less dissatisfied than the Hungarians. The
							Austrian government there was in the hands of police officials and judges who arrested
							and imprisoned freely all advocates of Italian rights. Tariffs were so arranged as to
							enrich the emperor's treasury and check Italian industries in favor of those of
							Austria. The forts were garrisoned with Austrian troops which the government employed
							to suppress any violent demonstrations.</p>

						<note rend="right">March revolution in Vienna</note>
						<note rend="right">Fall of Metternich</note>

						<p>The ground was therefore thoroughly prepared for the seeds of insurrection when the
							overthrow of Louis Philippe encouraged the opponents of Metternich in Germany,
							Austria, Hungary, and Italy to hope that they could destroy his system at once and
							forever. On March 13, 1848, a number of students proceeded to the assembly hall in
							Vienna where the local diet was in session, and, supported by the crowd <pb
								id="VAB8216-339" n="300"/> that quickly gathered, invaded the building. Outside, the
							mob continued to increase, barricades were built, street fighting began, and shouts of
							"Down with Metternich" penetrated the imperial palace. The aged minister, convinced
							that it was no longer possible to check the rising torrent of revolution, tendered his
							resignation. He fled from Austria and found refuge in England, where he was heartily
							welcomed by his old friend, the duke of Wellington, who was himself occupied with a
							threatened uprising in London. After the flight of Metternich a new ministry was
							formed, which began to draft a constitution.</p>

						<note rend="right">Reform measures in Hungary</note>

						<p>Two days after the uprising in Vienna the Hungarian diet at Pressburg, by a unanimous
							vote, dispatched a delegation to the emperor, demanding a responsible ministry,
							freedom of the press, trial by jury, and a national educational system. Then the
							Hungarian diet, under the influence of the zealous patriot, Kossuth, swept away the
							old offices through which the emperor had ruled in Hungary, and established its own
							ministries of finance, war, and foreign affairs,-- a first step toward independence.
							It also emancipated the peasants without providing compensation to the landlords,
							leaving that as a "debt of honor" to be paid in the future. The king, owing to the
							insurrection in Vienna, was in no position to reject even these revolutionary
							measures.</p>

						<note rend="right">Revolution in Prague</note>

						<p>His troubles were, moreover, not yet at an end, for on March 15 the patriotic Czechs
							in the city of Prague held a mass meeting at which a petition for civil liberty and
							the abolition of serfdom was drawn up. Solemn mass was then said, and a delegation
							bearing the petition left by special train for Vienna amid the cheers of the crowd and
							the waving of Czech flags. The emperor addressed the Bohemian delegates, to their
							great joy, in their own language, and approved most of their proposals. It will be
							observed that so far neither in Hungary nor in Bohemia had the patriots showed any
							desire to throw off their allegiance to their Austrian ruler.</p>

						<note rend="right">Revolution throughout Italy, March, 1848</note>

						<p>In Italy, however, the Austrian rule was thoroughly hated. Immediately on hearing the
							news of Metternich's fall the <pb id="VAB8216-340" n="301"/> Milanese expelled the
							imperial troops from their city, and the Austrians were soon forced to evacuate a
							great part of Lombardy. The Venetians followed the lead of Milan and set up once more
							their ancient republic which Napoleon had suppressed. The Milanese, anticipating a
							struggle, appealed to Charles Albert, king of Sardinia, for aid. By the middle of
							March a great part of Italy was in revolt, and constitutions had been granted by the
							rulers in Naples, Rome, Tuscany, and Piedmont. The king of Sardinia was forced by
							public opinion to assume the leadership in the attempt to expel the interloping
							Austria and ultimately perhaps to found some sort of an Italian union which would
							satisfy the national aspirations of the Italian people. Pope Pius IX, who was just
							beginning his long and celebrated pontificate of more than thirty years, and even the
							Bourbon king of Naples, were induced to consent to the arming of troops in the cause
							of Italian freedom, and thus Italy began her first war for independence.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Prussians demand a constitution</note>

						<p>The crisis in Vienna and the war in Italy now made it impossible for Austria to
							continue to exercise the control over the German states which she had enjoyed for more
							than thirty years. Consequently there were almost simultaneous risings in Baden,
							WÃ¼rtemberg, Bavaria, and Saxony. The news of the February revolution in Paris caused
							great excitement also in Berlin, where deputations were sent to the king, asking him
							to grant Prussia a constitution. On March 18 a crowd before the royal palace came into
							serious collision with the police; some street fighting ensued, and barricades were
							constructed after the Paris fashion in the districts in which the working people
							lived. Frederick William IV, hoping to avoid more disorder and bloodshed, promised to
							summon an assembly to draft the desired constitution.</p>

						<note rend="right">A National Assembly convoked at Frankfort to draw up a new
							constitution for Germany, May, 1848</note>

						<p>Now that Metternich was overthrown there was some hope of reorganizing the weak
							German confederation and forming a new and firm union which would at last make a real
							nation of the Germans. At the instigation of the liberals the diet of <pb
								id="VAB8216-341" n="302"/> the confederation convoked a National Assembly made up of
							representatives chosen by popular vote in all the states. This met at Frankfort, May
							18, 1848, amid high hopes, and proceeded to take up the difficult question of drafting
							a constitution which should please at once the German princes and their liberal-minded
							subjects.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bright outlook for reform in March, 1848</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">47.</hi> By the end of March, 1848, the prospects of reform seemed
							bright indeed. Hungary and Bohemia had been granted the rights which they had so long
							desired; a committee in Vienna was busy drawing up a constitution for the Austrian
							provinces; Lombardy and Venetia had declared their independence; four other Italian
							states had obtained their longed-for constitutions; a Prussian convention to reform
							the government had been promised; and, lastly, a great National Assembly was about to
							be convened at Frankfort to prepare a constitution for a united Germany.</p>

						<note rend="right">How the radicals by their want of coÃ¶peration and their extreme

						<p>The reformers who had gained these seeming victories had, however, only just reached
							the most difficult part of their task. They were opposed by two parties, who abhorred
							each other, but who effectually combined to frustrate the plans for reform. These
							were, first, the conservatives, represented by the rulers and nobles, who were
							naturally reluctant to see popular constitutions established; and, secondly, the
							radicals of various degrees, from those who only wanted universal suffrage, to the
							socialists, who wished to overturn the whole existing economic system in favor of the
							working classes. As in France, so also in the other countries, the revolutionists were
							divided among themselves, and this division enabled the reactionary rulers and their
							supporters to recover from the extraordinary humiliations which they had suffered
							during the various uprisings in March.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-342" n="303"/>

						<note rend="right">Divergent views of the Czechs and Germans in Bohemia</note>

						<p>The first notable victory for the reaction was in Bohemia, where race rivalry proved
							favorable to the reÃ«stablishment of the emperor's former influence. The Czechs hated
							the Germans, while the Germans, on their part, feared that they would be oppressed if
							the Czechs were given a free hand. They therefore opposed the plan of making Bohemia
							practically independent of the government at Vienna, for it was to German Vienna that
							they were wont to look for protection against the enterprises of their Czechish
							fellow-countrymen. The German element also wanted to send delegates to the Frankfort
							Convention and were very anxious that Bohemia should not be excluded from the
							reorganized German confederation.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Pan-Slavic congress forced to carry on its debates in
							German</note>

						<p>The Czechs, on the other hand, determined to offset the movement toward German
							consolidation by a Pan-Slavic congress, which should bring together the various Slavic
							peoples comprised in the Austrian Empire. To this assembly, which met at Prague early
							in June, 1848, came representatives of the Czechs, Moravians, and Ruthenians in the
							north, and the Servians and Croatians in the south. Unfortunately the several Slavonic
							languages differ from one another quite as much as English, Swedish, Dutch, and
							German, and after trying French as a common tongue, the delegates had to fall back
							upon German, which was the only language with which they were all familiar.</p>

						<note rend="right">WindischgrÃ¤tz puts an end to the Bohemian revolution, June 18,
							1848</note>

						<p>The congress accomplished nothing beyond fraternal declamations, and was about to
							dissolve on June 12, when some of the more radical students and workingmen began
							singing Bohemian songs and denouncing General WindischgrÃ¤tz, a Bohemian nobleman in
							command of the troops in Prague, who was especially hated on account of his
							aristocratic bearing and sentiments. A street fight broke out between the crowd and
							his soldiers, which was followed by an attack on his residence. On June 17 he
							retaliated by bombarding the town, which caught fire. The next day he entered the
							flaming streets and announced that the revolution in Bohemia was at an end. This was
							Austria's first real victory over her rebellious subjects.</p>

						<note rend="right">WindischgrÃ¤tz bombards and takes Vienna, October 31, 1848</note>

						<p>In Vienna affairs were going from bad to worse. Frightened by the growing disorder,
							the incompetent emperor fled to Innsbruck (May 18). A provisional government was set
							up and an assembly called to draft a new constitution, but nothing was accomplished.
							Meantime the turmoil increased. The emperor's government was helpless, and finally
							WindischgrÃ¤tz announced his intention of marching on Vienna and, with the emperor's
							approval, putting an end to revolution there as he had done in Prague. The Viennese
							attempted to defend the city, but all in vain. After a cruel bombardment WindischgrÃ¤tz
							entered the capital on October 31, and once within the walls, he showed little mercy
							on the people.<ref id="ref_171" rend="super" target="note_171">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Francis Joseph becomes emperor of Austria</note>

						<p>A reactionary ministry was soon formed, and a new Metternich discovered in the person
							of Schwartzenberg, who forced the weak Ferdinand to abdicate, December 2, in favor of
							his youthful nephew, Francis Joseph, who still (1912) sits on the Austrian throne.</p>

						<note rend="right">Dissension between the Magyars and Slavs</note>

						<p>It will be remembered that after the fall of Metternich the emperor had not been in a
							position to refuse the demands of the Hungarians, and that they had succeeded in
							gaining practical independence for their kingdom. But the spirit of nationalism had
							also been awakened in the other races which the Magyars had so long dominated. The
							Slavs in Hungary, southern Austria, and the neighboring Turkish Empire had long
							meditated on the possibility of a united Slavic kingdom in the south, and when the
							Magyars attempted to force their language on the Croats, one of the Slav leaders
							hurled back at them: "You Magyars are only an island in an ocean of Slavs. Take heed
							that the waves do not rise and overwhelm you." Indeed, the Croats and Servians were,
							on the whole, friendly to the Vienna government, and ready to fight the
							Hungarians.</p>

							an army, and on January 5 entered Pesth. The war seemed for a time at an end, but the
							Hungarians rallied in a mighty national uprising against the Austrians, and on April
							19, 1849, they declared their complete and eternal separation from the Vienna
							government. They might have succeeded in maintaining their independence had not the
							Tsar, Nicholas I, placed his forces at the disposal of Francis Joseph. Attacked by an
							army of a hundred and fifty thousand Russians, who marched in from the east, the
							Hungarians were compelled, by the middle of August, to give up the contest. Austria
							took terrible vengeance upon the rebels. Thousands were shot, hanged, or imprisoned,
							and many, including Kossuth,<ref id="ref_172" rend="super" target="note_172">1</ref>
							fled to the United States or elsewhere. The ancient kingdom of Hungary seemed about to
							be reduced to the state of an insignificant Austrian province, but, as we shall see,
							within less than twenty years she was able to secure substantially the coveted
							independence.</p>

						<p>The Italian republicans now attempted to carry out their own programme. Florence
							followed the example of Venice and proclaimed itself a republic. At Rome the liberal

							assassinated in November just as he was ready to promulgate his reforms. Pius IX fled
							from the city and put himself under the protection of the king of Naples. A

						<note rend="right">Impossibility of a German state which should include both Austria and
							Prussia</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">49.</hi> In Germany, as elsewhere, Austria profited by the dissensions
							among her opponents. On May 18, 1848, the National Assembly, consisting of nearly six
							hundred representatives of the German people, had met at Frankfort. It immediately
							began the consideration of a new constitution that should satisfy the popular longings
							for a great free German state, to be governed by and for the people. But what were to
							be the confines of this new German state? The confederation of 1815 did not include
							all the German inhabitants of Prussia, and did include the heterogeneous western
							possessions of Austria,-- Bohemia and Moravia, for example, where many of the people
							were Slavs. There was no hesitation in deciding that all the Prussian territories
							should be admitted to the new union. As it appeared impossible to leave out Austria
							altogether, the Assembly agreed to include those parts of her territory which had
							belonged to the confederation formed in 1815. This decision rendered the task of
							founding a real German state practically impossible; for the new union was to include
							two great European powers which might at any moment become rivals, since Prussia would
							hardly consent to be led forever by Austria. So heterogeneous a union could only
							continue to be, as it had been, a loose confederation of practically independent
							princes.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Assembly at Frankfort gives Austria time to recover</note>

						<p>The improbability that the Assembly at Frankfort would succeed in its undertaking was
							greatly increased by its unwise conduct. Instead of proceeding immediately to frame a
							new form of government, it devoted several months to the formulation of the general
							rights of the German citizen. Consequently by the time that the constitution itself
							came up for discussion, Austria had begun to regain her influence and was ready to <pb
								id="VAB8216-347" n="308"/> lead the conservative forces once more. She could rely
							upon the support of the rulers of southern Germany, for they were well satisfied with
							the old confederation and the independence that it gave them.</p>

							Germany</note>
						<note rend="right">Frederick William IV refuses the imperial crown</note>
						<note rend="right">The National Assembly disperses and the old diet is restored</note>

						<p>In spite of her partiality for the old union, Austria could not prevent the Assembly
							from completing its new constitution. This provided that there should be an hereditary
							emperor at the head of the government, and that exalted office was tendered to the
							king of Prussia. Frederick William IV had been alienated from the liberal cause, which
							he had at first espoused, by the insurrection in Berlin. He was, moreover, timid and
							conservative at heart; he hated revolution and doubted whether the National Assembly
							had any right to confer the imperial title. He also greatly respected Austria, and
							felt that a war with her, which was likely to ensue if he accepted the crown, would be
							dangerous to Prussia. So he refused the imperial title and announced his rejection of
							the new constitution (April, 1849). This decision rendered the year's work of the
							National Assembly fruitless, and its members gradually dispersed. Austria now insisted
							upon the reestablishment of the old diet and Germany returned once more to its old
							ways.</p>

						<note rend="right">Prussia granted a constitution by Frederick William IV (January,

						<p>Yet amid the meager results of the revolution of 1848 there was one gain of great
							significance for the future of Germany; Prussia emerged from the turmoil of the period
							with a written constitution which established a legislative assembly and admitted a
							portion of the people to a share in the government. As we have seen, the news of the
							revolution in France caused great excitement in Berlin, and the king, fearing a
							continuance of violence, promised to convoke an assembly to formulate a constitution.
							This convention met at Berlin in May of the same year, and, amid prolonged debates,
							advocated many radical measures which displeased the king. It proposed to abolish the
							nobility and to strike from the royal title the phrase "King by the Grace of God."
							Meanwhile there was disorder in the quarters occupied by the working class, and on
							June 14 a mob <pb id="VAB8216-348" n="[]"/>

							and he withdrew to Potsdam. He then ordered the assembly to adjourn to Brandenburg,
							and on its refusal, he dissolved it in spite of its protests. After getting rid of the
							popular assembly, the king, in 1849, submitted a constitution of his own to a more
							tractable convention of carefully selected subjects. This document, which was
							promulgated in January, 1850, remains, with some minor changes, the constitution of
							Prussia to-day.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Prussian constitution disappoints the liberals</note>

						<p>It proved, however, a great disappointment to the liberals, who had hoped for a
							really democratic form of government. It provides for a ministry, but makes it
							responsible to the king rather than to the diet. The latter comprises a house of
							lords-- consisting of princes, nobles, life peers selected by the king,
							representatives of the universities, and burgomasters of the large towns-- and a house
							of deputies.</p>


						<p>All men over twenty-five years of age may vote for the electors, who in turn select
							the deputies to the lower house, but the constitution carefully arranges to give the
							rich a predominating influence in the election. Those who stand first on the tax list,
							and pay together one third of the total taxes, are permitted to choose one third of
							the electors. The second third on the list also choose a third of the electors, and,
							finally, the great mass of the poorer people, whose small contributions to the
							treasury make up the remaining third of the revenue, are entitled to cast their votes
							for the remaining third of the electors assigned to the district. It may happen that a
							single wealthy man, if he pays a third of the taxes, has as much influence in electing
							representatives from his district as all the working people combined.</p>

						<note rend="right">Italy in 1850</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">50.</hi> The efforts of the Italian liberals to expel Austria from the
							peninsula and establish constitutional governments in the various Italian states had
							failed, and after the battle of Novara it seemed as if the former political conditions
							were to be restored. The king of Naples broke all the promises which he had made to
							his subjects, revoked the constitution which he had granted, and imprisoned, exiled,
							or in some cases executed the revolutionists. The Pope, with the assistance of France,
							Austria, Naples, and Spain, was able to destroy the Roman Republic which had been set
							up, and place the government again in the hands of the ecclesiastics. In northern
							Italy Austria was once more in control, and she found faithful adherents in the rulers
							of Modena, Parma, and Tuscany, who looked to her for continued support. The leading
							spirits of the revolution who had escaped prison or death fled to foreign countries to
							await a more auspicious opportunity to secure their ends, for they did not surrender
							the hope that Austria would sometime be driven from their country, and all the Italian
							states brought together in a federation, or perhaps united into a single monarchy or
							republic.</p>

						<note rend="right">Divergent views of those intent on unifying Italy</note>

						<p>However, those who, since the fall of Napoleon I, had been interested in promoting
							Italian independence and liberty differed among themselves as to the best way in which
							to make Italy a nation. There were the republicans, who became more and more disgusted
							with monarchy and believed that nothing could be accomplished until the various rulers
							should give way <pb id="VAB8216-353" n="312"/> to a great democratic republic, which
							should recall the ancient glories of Rome; others were confident that an enlightened
							Pope could form an Italian federation, of which he should be the head; lastly, there
							was a practical party, whose adherents placed their hopes in the king of Sardinia, who
							seemed to them to be the natural leader in the emancipation of Italy. Little as the
							revolution of 1848 had accomplished, it had at least given Sardinia a young and
							energetic king and a new constitution.</p>

						<note rend="right">Mazzini, 1805-1872</note>

						<p>Among the republican leaders the most conspicuous was the delicately organized and
							highly endowed Giuseppe Mazzini. Born in 1805, he had, as he tells us, become a
							republican from hearing his father discuss the achievements of the French Revolution,
							and had read eagerly the old French newspapers which he found hidden behind the
							medical books in his father's library. He joined the secret society of the Carbonari,
							and in 1830 was caught by the police and imprisoned in the fortress of Savona, west of
							Genoa. Here he arranged a secret code, which enabled him to keep in communication with
							the revolutionists.</p>

						<note rend="right">"Young Italy"</note>

						<p>Becoming disgusted with the inefficiency and the silly mystery of the Carbonari,
							Mazzini planned a new association, which he called "Young Italy." This aimed to bring
							about the regeneration of Italy through the education of young men in lofty republican
							principles. Mazzini had no confidence in princes or in foreign aid. He urged that all
							the Italians should be brought together into a single republic, for he feared that any
							form of federation would leave the country too weak to resist the constant
							interference of neighboring nations. Mazzini was not a man to organize a successful
							revolution, but he inspired the young Italians with almost religious enthusiasm for
							the cause of Italy's liberation.<ref id="ref_174" rend="super" target="note_174"
								>1</ref> Still other patriots, however, who dreamed of a new Italy, placed their
							hopes, not in a republic in which the common man should have a voice in the conduct of
							the government, but in a federation <note id="note_174"><hi rend="center"><ref

							princes, the bishop of Rome.</p>

						<note rend="right">Progressive government of Victor Emmanuel</note>

						<p>The future, however, belonged neither to the republicans nor to the papal party, but
							to those who looked to the king of Sardinia to bring about the salvation of Italy.
							Only under his leadership was there any prospect of ousting Austria, and until that
							was done no independent union could possibly be formed. Practical men therefore began
							to turn to the young Victor Emmanuel, whose devotion to the cause of freedom in the
							war with Austria in 1848, and whose frank acceptance of the principles of
							constitutional government, distinguished him from all the other rulers of Italy. His
							father, Charles Albert, had granted Piedmont a constitution in 1848, which provided
							for a parliament with two houses and a responsible ministry. This constitution (which
							was later to become that of a united Italy) Victor Emmanuel maintained in spite of
							Austria's demands that he suppress it.</p>

						<note rend="right">Count Cavour, 1810-1861</note>

						<p>Victor Emmanuel was wise enough to call to his aid one of the most distinguished of
							modern statesmen, Count Cavour, who had long been an advocate both of constitutional
							government and of Italian unity.<ref id="ref_175" rend="super" target="note_175"
								>1</ref> Cavour, however, did not believe that unity could be secured without
							foreign aid, for Sardinia was a rather insignificant kingdom when compared with the
							more important countries of Europe. It had a population of less than five millions and
							consisted of four distinct regions which were more or less hostile to one another. In
							view of this fact Cavour held that it was impossible to disregard the other powers of
							Europe, who had so long interfered freely in Italian affairs. He early declared,
							"Whether we like it or not, our destinies depend upon France; we must be her partner
							in the great game which will be played sooner or later in Europe."</p>

						<note rend="right">Sardinia joins France in the Crimean War</note>

						<p>An opportunity soon offered itself for Sardinia to become the ally of France. The
							Crimean War<ref id="ref_176" rend="super" target="note_176">2</ref> had broken out in
							1854 between England and France on the one side, and Russia on <note id="note_175"

							<pb id="VAB8216-355" n="314"/> the other, and in 1855 Cavour signed an offensive and
							defensive alliance with France and sent troops to her aid in the Crimea. This gave him
							an opportunity to take part in the European congress which met in Paris in 1856 to
							conclude a peace. There he warned the powers that Austrian control in northern Italy
							was a menace to the peace of Europe, and succeeded in enlisting the interest of
							Napoleon III in Italian affairs;-- it will be remembered that in his younger days the
							French emperor had sympathized with the Carbonari, and he had a number of Italian
							relatives who besought his aid in forwarding the cause of Italian unity.</p>

						<note rend="right">Position and policy of Napoleon III</note>

						<p>There were other reasons, too, why Napoleon was ready to consider intervention in
							Italy. Like his distinguished uncle, he was after all only a usurper. He knew that he
							could not rely upon mere tradition, but must maintain his popularity by deeds that
							should redound to the glory of France. A war with Austria for the liberation of the
							Italians, who like the French were a Latin race, would be popular, especially if
							France could thereby add a bit of territory to her realms and perhaps become the
							protector of the proposed Italian confederation. A conference was arranged between
							Napoleon and Cavour. Just what agreement was reached we do not know, but Napoleon no
							doubt engaged to come to the aid of the king of Sardinia, should the latter find a
							pretense for going to war with Austria. Should they together succeed in expelling
							Austria from northern Italy, the king of Sardinia was to reward France by ceding to
							her Savoy and Nice, which belonged to her geographically and racially.</p>

						<note rend="right">Victories of Victor Emmanuel and Napoleon III over Austria</note>

						<p>By April, 1859, Victor Emmanuel had managed to involve himself in a war with Austria.
							The French army promptly joined forces with the Piedmontese, defeated the Austrians at
							Magenta, and on June 8 Napoleon III and Victor Emmanuel entered Milan amid the
							rejoicings of the people. The Austrians managed the campaign very badly and were again
							defeated at Solferino (June 24).</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon III unexpectedly consents to a truce</note>

						<p>Suddenly Europe was astonished to hear that a truce had been concluded and that the
							preliminaries of a peace had been arranged which left Venetia in Austria's hands, in
							spite of Napoleon III's boast that he would free Italy to the Adriatic. The French
							emperor was shocked, however, by the horrors of a real battlefield; he believed,
							moreover, that it would require three hundred thousand soldiers to drive the Austrians
							from their strongly fortified Quadrilateral, and he could not draw further upon the
							resources of France. Lastly he had begun to fear that, in view of the growing
							enthusiasm which was showing itself throughout the peninsula for Piedmont, there was
							danger that it might succeed in forming a national kingdom so strong as to need no
							French protector. By leaving Venetia in the possession of Austria and agreeing that
							Piedmont should only be increased by the incorporation of Lombardy and the little
							duchies of Parma and Modena, Napoleon III hoped to prevent the consolidation of Italy
							from proceeding too far. He had, however, precipitated changes which he was powerless
							to check. Italy was now ready to fuse into a single state.</p>

						<note rend="right">Parma, Modena, Tuscany, and the Romagna request to be annexed to
							Sardinia (August-September, 1859)</note>

						<p>During the months of August and September, 1859, the people in the three duchies of
							Parma, Modena, and Tuscany declared in favor of the permanent expulsion of their
							respective rulers and for annexation to the kingdom of Sardinia. An assembly in the
							Romagna repudiated the temporal rule of the Pope and also expressed the wish to be
							joined to Sardinia.</p>

						<note rend="right">Garibaldi, 1807-1882</note>

						<p>The king of Naples stubbornly refused either to form any kind of an alliance with the
							king of Sardinia or to grant his people a constitution. Garibaldi thereupon determined
							to bring him to terms and prepare the way for the union of southern Italy and Sicily
							with the expanding Sardinia. This bold sailor, warrior, and ardent revolutionist
							decided to carry on the work of unifying Italy on his own responsibility, and
							accordingly set sail from Genoa for Sicily in May, 1860, with a band of a thousand
							"Red Shirts," as his followers were called <pb id="VAB8216-359" n="316"/> from their
							rough costume.<ref id="ref_177" rend="super" target="note_177">1</ref> He gained an
							easy victory over the few troops that the king of the Two Sicilies was able to send
							against him, and made himself dictator of the island in the name of Victor Emmanuel.
							He then crossed over to the mainland, and after a slight skirmish he was received in
							Naples with enthusiasm on September 6.</p>

						<note rend="right">Napoleon III intervenes to prevent the annexation of Rome to the
							kingdom of Italy</note>

						<p>Garibaldi now proposed to march on Rome and proclaim the kingdom of Italy from the
							Quirinal. This would have imperiled all the previous gains, for Napoleon III could
							not, in view of the strong Catholic sentiment in France, possibly permit the
							occupation of Rome and the destruction of the political independence of the Pope. He
							agreed that Victor Emmanuel might annex the outlying papal possessions to the north
							and reestablish a stable government in Naples instead of Garibaldi's dictatorship. But
							Rome, the imperial city, with the territory immediately surrounding it, must be left
							to its old master. Victor Emmanuel accordingly marched southward and occupied Naples
							(October). Its king capitulated and all southern Italy became a part of the kingdom of
							Italy.</p>

						<p>In February, 1861, the first Italian parliament was opened at Turin, and the process
							of really amalgamating the heterogeneous portions of the new kingdom began. Yet the
							joy of the Italians over the realization of their hopes of unity and national
							independence was tempered by the fact that Austria still held one of the most famous
							of the Italian provinces, and that Rome, which typified Italy's former grandeur, was
							not included in the new kingdom.</p>

							Adriatic." Meanwhile Pius IX declared that the ruler of Sardinia had forgotten every
							religious principle, despised every right, trampled every law under foot, and deprived
							the head of the Church of the most flourishing portions of his legitimate possessions.
							He therefore excommunicated the king and his ministers and declared the new
							constitution to be a creation of revolution, which was a thing to be struck down like
							a mad dog wherever it showed itself. Any temptation, however, that the Italians may
							have felt to add Rome to the kingdom of Italy was discouraged by the intervention of
							Napoleon III, who, at the instigation of the French Catholics, sent a French garrison
							to Rome with a view to protecting the Pope from attack.</p>

						<note rend="right">How Venetia was added to the kingdom of Italy, 1866</note>

						<p>Help, however, soon came from an unexpected quarter. In the early months of 1866
							Prussia and Austria were on the eve of war, and in order to gain the support of Italy,
							Prussia concluded a treaty with Victor Emmanuel in April of that year. When the war
							came in July the Italians as well as the Prussians attacked Austria. The Italians were
							worsted in the battle of Custozza, but the Prussians more than made up for this defeat
							by their memorable victory at Sadowa. Thereupon Austria consented to cede Venetia to
							Napoleon III, with the understanding that he should transfer it to Italy. The efforts
							of the Italians to wrest Trent and Trieste from Austria failed, however, for their
							fleet was defeated, and they were forced to content themselves with Venetia, which
							they owed rather to the victories of others than to their own.</p>

						<note rend="right">Rome occupied by the king of Italy, 1870</note>

						<p>Four years later, when war broke out between France and Prussia, Napoleon III was
							forced to withdraw the French garrison from Rome, and Victor Emmanuel, having nothing
							further to fear from French intervention, dispatched an ultimatum to Pius IX demanding
							that he make terms with the kingdom of Italy. The Pope refused, whereupon the Italian
							troops blew open the gates of the city and, without further violence, took possession
							of Rome, while the Pope withdrew <pb id="VAB8216-361" n="318"/> to the Vatican and
							proclaimed himself the prisoner of the Italian government. The inhabitants, however,
							welcomed the invaders, and, by a vote of one hundred and thirty thousand to fifteen
							hundred, Rome and the remaining portions of the Papal States were formally annexed to
							the kingdom of Italy in January, 1871.</p>

						<note rend="right">Rome becomes the capital of the kingdom of Italy, 1871</note>

						<p>Italy was at last free and united from the Alps to the sea, and, as King Victor
							Emmanuel said at the opening of the parliament of 1871, "It only remains to make our
							country great and happy." The capital was transferred from Florence to Rome in 1871,
							and the king made his solemn entry into the city, announcing to the people, "We are at
							Rome and we shall remain here." The Sardinian constitution became the constitution of
							the kingdom of Italy.</p>

						<note rend="right">Position of the Pope</note>

						<p>It was a difficult problem to determine the relations which should exist between the
							new government and the head of the Christian Church, who for a thousand years had
							regarded the city of Rome as his capital. By a law of May, 1871, the Pope was declared
							to enjoy perfect freedom in all his spiritual functions, and his person was made
							sacred and inviolable like that of the king. He was to continue to enjoy the honors
							and dignity of a sovereign prince, and to send and receive diplomatic agents like any
							other sovereign. Within the trifling domain which was left to him,-- the Vatican and
							Lateran palaces, Castel Gandolfo and the gardens attached to them,-- he may live as an
							independent ruler, since no officer of the Italian government is permitted to enter
							these precincts on any business of State. In order to indemnify him decently for the
							loss of his possessions, the Italian government assigned him something over six
							hundred thousand dollars a year from the State treasury. The Pope, however, has not
							only always refused to accept this sum, but he persistently declines, down to the

						<note rend="right">Italy becomes a European power</note>

						<p>In order to maintain the dignity of her new position, Italy adopted the expensive
							policy of rapidly increasing her army and navy. Modern warships were constructed, the
							principle of universal military service was introduced, and the army reorganized on
							the Prussian model. This nearly doubled the military expenses and served to produce a
							deficit which amounted in 1887 to $83,000,000. In 1882 the government concluded the
							famous triple alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary in which the powers guaranteed
							one another in the possession of their recently acquired territories. Alsace-Lorraine
							was assured to Germany, Bosnia and Herzegovina to Austria-Hungary, and Rome to
								Italy.<ref id="ref_179" rend="super" target="note_179">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Italy's colonial policy in Africa</note>

						<p>Having secured unity at home, the Italians also turned their attention to winning
							colonial domains in the region of Abyssinia, near the outlet of the Red Sea. An army
							of occupation was dispatched thither in 1887, and after some fifteen years of
							intermittent warfare, treaties, negotiations, and massacres of the Italian troops by
							the natives, the Italians were able to make themselves masters of an area about twice
							the size of the state of Pennsylvania, inhabited by half a million of nomad peoples.
							More recently the Italians have waged war on the Turks for the purpose of securing
							dominion in northern Africa by the conquest of Tripoli.<ref id="ref_180" rend="super"
								target="note_180">2</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Political parties in Italy</note>

						<p>It is clear that the old ideals of Cavour and King Victor Emmanuel have been left far
							behind. The heavy burden of taxation which the Italians have had to bear, in order to
							play the part of a European power and pay for the very expensive luxury of
							colonization, has roused deep discontent among the peasants and workingmen. The
							patriotic feelings which had nerved the people to heroic service in behalf of unity
							and independence gave way later to a spirit of selfishness in the various provinces,
							the interests of which were by no means identical, for the conditions in Naples were
							essentially different from those of Venetia or Piedmont. The republicans, who still

							<pb id="VAB8216-365" n="320"/> clung to the ideas of Mazzini and Garibaldi, continued
							to oppose the monarchy, while the ideals of socialism, as elsewhere in Europe,
							appealed strongly to the workingmen. Lastly there were the defenders of the Pope's
							political power, who were among the bitterest enemies of the new government.</p>

						<note rend="right">Progress of Italy</note>

						<p>Notwithstanding these adverse circumstances, the kingdom has made remarkable progress
							during the last generation. Italy is rapidly becoming an industrial state, and to-day
							more than one third of its population is engaged in manufacturing and commercial
							pursuits. Silk, cotton, and woolen mills export large quantities of goods to foreign
							markets.</p>

						<note rend="right">Improvements in education</note>

						<p>Many laws have been passed for the improvement of the public schools, in the hope of
							diminishing the illiteracy which is a reproach to the kingdom. The republicans and
							socialists are not satisfied, however, with the amount of money voted for education;
							they admit that there has been a steady reduction in the number of persons over twenty
							years of age who are unable to read and write,-- from 73 per cent in 1862, to 52 per
							cent in 1901,-- but they contend that it is a disgrace for the nation to spend six or
							eight times as much a year on the army and navy as it does for the schools.<ref
								id="ref_181" rend="super" target="note_181">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Burden of taxation</note>

						<p>Italy has suffered more from strikes and riots than her neighbors; this is doubtless
							partly attributable to the fact that the sources of discontent are particularly
							obvious. In proportion to its wealth, the Italian nation has the largest debt and the
							heaviest taxation of any country in Europe.<ref id="ref_182" rend="super"
								target="note_182">2</ref> There are the land tax, the income tax, the house tax, the
							inheritance tax, the stamp tax, the excise, the customs duties, in addition to the
							government monopolies of tobacco, lotteries, salt, and quinine. These are so
							distributed that the most burdensome of them fall on the workingmen and the peasants,
							who receive very low <note id="note_181"><ref target="ref_181" rend="super">1</ref> In
								1901, 28 per cent of the population of northern Italy over six years of age could
								not read or write, and in southern Italy, from whence a large proportion of the
								American immigrants come, 70 per cent were illiterate.</note>
							<note id="note_182"><ref target="ref_182" rend="super">2</ref>
								<hi rend="i">Readings</hi>, Vol. II, p. 141.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-366" n="321"/> wages, so that it is estimated that the poor pay over
							one half of the revenue of the government.</p>

						<p>The heaviest taxes are imposed on the necessities of life, such as grain and salt;
							and in times of scarcity this has been a source of serious bread riots in the towns.
							As for the salt, the government in 1900 was charging eight dollars for a quintal (two
							hundred and twenty pounds) of salt, which cost it only thirty cents. An Italian
							economist estimated in 1898 that the family of a Florentine workingman was forced to
							pay in local and national taxes no less than one fourth of its income, whereas in
							England the government demanded less than one twentieth of the earnings of a workman
							in a similar position.</p>

						<note rend="right">Assassination of King Humbert</note>

						<p>Victor Emmanuel died in 1878. His son and successor, Humbert I, although personally
							courageous and faithful to the constitution, was not the man to undertake the reforms
							necessary to relieve the prevailing discontent. He was not the controlling factor in
							the government either for or against reform; nevertheless the anarchists marked him as
							one of their victims, and on July 29, 1900, he was assassinated while distributing
							prizes at a great public meeting in Monza. He was succeeded by his son, Victor
							Emmanuel III, who has continued the general policy of his father.</p>

						<note rend="right">Emigration from Italy</note>

						<p>The discontent continues, and if emigration can be taken as in any sense a measure of
							it, the year after the assassination of Humbert was a period of exceptional distress.
							In 1888 Italy lost by emigration one hundred and nineteen thousand subjects; this had
							increased by 1900 to three hundred and fifty-two thousand, and in 1901 to over half a
							million. Italy had never come into possession of any of those new territories which
							her sons, Columbus, Cabot, and Verrazano, had laid claim to in the name of other
							European nations, and her acquisitions in Africa were entirely uninviting to her
							discontented peasants and workingmen. Those who leave Italy, therefore, go to foreign
							lands,-- to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay; while hundreds of thousands
							settle in the United States. In 1910, however, no less than 147,000 returned from
							abroad.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-367" n="322"/>

						<p>This enormous emigration does not appear to relieve the discontent. In 1905 the
							strength of the socialists became so alarming that Pope Pius X instructed faithful
							Catholics to aid in the struggle against socialism by taking part in the elections,
							from which they had hitherto been admonished by the Church to abstain. Indeed it seems
							not impossible that the Pope may forget his grievance against the Italian State in his
							anxiety to combat the common enemy. Others, on the contrary, have reached the
							conclusion that the socialist party is an effective instrument for arousing the more
							conservative people to undertake important reforms.</p>

						<note rend="right">Industrial Revolution in Germany</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">52.</hi> The failure of the liberals to bring about the unity of Germany
							at the congress at Frankfort in 1848 was largely due to the tenacity with which the
							numerous German rulers clung to their sovereignty and independence. No fine theories
							of national union formulated by an assembly of lawyers and professors could destroy
							the spirit of state sovereignty. However, industry and commerce were silently but
							surely welding the German people into a nation. In 1835 the first railway line had
							been built, and the era of steam transportation inaugurated; a network of telegraph
							lines quickly brought the separate states into close and constant touch with one
							another; and the growth of machine industry compelled them to seek wider markets
							beyond their borders. A solid foundation for unity was thus laid by steam,
							electricity, and machinery, and the development of common interests.</p>

						<note rend="right">Commercial disadvantages of the division of Germany into practically
							independent states</note>

						<p>Statesmen as well as leaders in commerce and industry began, shortly after the
							settlement of 1815, to realize the disastrous effects of the existing division of
							Germany into numerous independent countries. Each of the thirty-eight states had its
							own customs line, which cut it off from its German neighbors as well as from
							foreigners. How this hampered trade can be readily seen by examining the map of
							Germany at that time. One who traveled in a straight line from Fulda to Altenburg, a
							distance of some one hundred and twenty-five English miles, crossed on the way
							thirty-four boundary lines and passed through <pb id="VAB8216-369" n="324"/> the
							dominions of nine sovereign and independent monarchs. A merchants' association
							complained to the diet of the Confederation in 1819 that in order to trade from
							Hamburg to Austria, or from Berlin to Switzerland, one had to cross ten states, study
							ten different customs systems, and pay ten tariff charges.</p>

						<note rend="right">The customs union (<hi rend="i">Zollverein</hi>)</note>

						<p>In January, 1834, a <hi rend="i">Zollverein</hi>, or tariff union, was formed, which
							was composed of seventeen states with a combined population of twenty-three millions.
							Goods were allowed to pass freely from one of these states to another, while the
							entire group was protected against all outsiders by a common tariff frontier. Austria,
							after some hesitation, decided not to join this union, but other German states were
							from time to time compelled by their own interests to do so.</p>

						<note rend="right">Accession of William I, 1858 (1861)</note>

						<p>As the center of this commercial reorganization of Germany, Prussia gathered strength
							for the coming conflict with her great rival, Austria, and with the accession of
							William I in 1858,<ref id="ref_183" rend="super" target="note_183">1</ref> a new era
							dawned for Prussia. A practical and vigorous man was now at the helm, whose chief aim
							was to expel Austria from the German Confederation, and out of the remaining states to
							construct a firm union under the leadership of Prussia, which would then take her
							place among the most powerful nations of Europe. He saw that war must come sooner or
							later, and therefore made it his first business to develop the military resources of
							his realms.</p>

						<note rend="right">The strengthening of the Prussian army</note>

						<p>The German army, which owes much of its fame to the reforms of William I, is so
							extraordinary a feature of Europe to-day that its organization merits attention. Fifty
							years before, the necessity of expelling Napoleon had led Scharnhorst to revolutionize
							the military strength of the kingdom by making military service a universal obligation
							for all healthy male citizens, who were to be trained in the standing army in all the
							essentials of discipline, and then retired to the reserve, ready <note id="note_183"
									><ref target="ref_183" rend="super">1</ref> He ruled until 1861 as regent for his
								brother, Frederick William IV, who had become incapacitated by disease.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-370" n="325"/> for service at need. The first thing that William I did
							was to increase the annual levy from forty to sixty thousand men, and to see that all
							the soldiers remained in active service three years. They then passed into the
							reserve, according to the existing law, where for two years more they remained ready
							at any time to take up arms should it be necessary. William wished to increase the
							term of service in the reserve to four years. In this way the State would claim seven
							of the years of early manhood and <figure>
								<p rend="center">The Zollverein</p>
							</figure> have an effective army of four hundred thousand, which would permit it to
							dispense with the service of those who were approaching middle life. The lower house
							of the Prussian parliament refused, however, to make the necessary appropriations for
							thus increasing the strength of the army.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bismark and his struggle with the Prussian parliament</note>

						<p>The king proceeded, nevertheless, with his plan, and in 1862 called to his side the
							most commanding figure among the statesmen of modern times, Otto von Bismarck. The new
							minister <pb id="VAB8216-371" n="326"/> conceived a scheme for humiliating Austria and
							exalting Prussia, which he carried out with startling precision. He could not,
							however, reveal it to the lower chamber; he would, indeed, scarcely hint its nature to
							the king himself. In defiance of the lower house and of the newspapers, he carried on
							the strengthening of the army without formal appropriations, on the theory that the
							constitution had made no provision in case of a deadlock between the upper and lower
							house, and that consequently the king, in such a case, might exercise his former
							absolute power.<ref id="ref_184" rend="super" target="note_184">1</ref> In one of his
							first speeches in parliament he said with brutal frankness, "The great questions of
							the time are to be decided not by speeches and votes of majorities, but by blood and
							iron." For a time it seemed as if Prussia was returning to a pure despotism, for there
							was assuredly no more fundamental provision of the constitution than the right of the
							people to control the granting of the taxes. Yet Bismarck was eventually fully
							exonerated by public opinion, and it was generally agreed in Germany that the end had
							amply justified the means.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Schleswig-Holstein affair</note>

						<p>Prussia now had a military force that appeared to justify the hope of victory should
							she undertake a war with her old rival. In order to bring about the expulsion of
							Austria from the Confederation, Bismarck took advantage of a knotty problem that had
							been troubling Germany, known as the Schleswig-Holstein affair. The provinces of
							Schleswig and Holstein, although inhabited largely by Germans, had for centuries
							belonged to the king of Denmark. They were not considered a part of Denmark, however,
							any more than Hanover had been a part of Great Britain. But in 1847 the king of
							Denmark proclaimed that he was going to incorporate these provinces into the Danish
							kingdom in spite of the large proportion of Germans in the population. This aroused
							great indignation throughout Germany. The controversy over the relation of these
							provinces to Denmark continued, and finally, in 1863, Schleswig was definitely united
							with the Danish kingdom.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bismarck's audacious plan for the expulsion of Austria from
							Germany</note>

						<q rend="blockquote">
							<p>"From this time the history of Germany is the history of the profound and audacious
								statecraft and of the overmastering will of Bismarck; the nation, except through its
								valor on the battlefield, ceases to influence the shaping of its own fortunes. What
								the German people desired in 1864 was that Schleswig-Holstein should be attached,
								under a ruler of its own, to the German Federation as it then existed; what Bismarck
								intended was that Schleswig-Holstein, itself incorporated more or less directly with
								Prussia, should be made the means of the destruction of the existing federal system,
								and of the expulsion of Austria from Germany. . . . The German people desired one
								course of action; Bismarck had determined on something totally different; with
								matchless resolution and skill he bore down all the opposition of people and of the
								[European] courts, and forced a reluctant nation to the goal which he himself had
								chosen for it."<ref id="ref_185" rend="super" target="note_185">1</ref></p></q>

						<note rend="right">Character of Bismarck</note>

						<p>Bismarck was forty-seven years old when, in 1862, he was called to the presidency of
							the Prussian cabinet, and he had already won a reputation as a shrewd diplomat and an
							ardent champion of the Prussian monarchy. He was an aristocrat of the aristocrats, and
							his policy was akin to that of the benevolent despots of the eighteenth century;
							Germany was to be united not by the will and the cooperation of the German people, but
							only by the aggrandizement of Prussia and the exaltation of the Prussian king. Firmly
							believing in the destiny of the German nation and justifying the means by the end,
							Bismarck proved himself just the leader needed to weld the nation by the heat and
							violence of war.</p>

							jointly (October, 1864). They were to make such disposition of the provinces as they
							saw fit. There was now no trouble in picking a quarrel with Austria. In April, 1866,
							Italy agreed that, should the king of Prussia take up arms during the following three
							months with the aim of reforming the German union, it too would immediately declare
							war on Austria, with the hope, of course, of obtaining Venice.<ref id="ref_186"

						<p>On June 14 war was declared between Austria and Prussia. With the exception of

						<note rend="right">The North German Federation</note>

						<p>Prussia was aware that the larger states south of the river Main were not ripe for
							the union that she desired. She therefore organized a so-called North German
							Federation, which included all the states north of the Main. Prussia had seized the
							opportunity to increase considerably her own boundaries and round out her territory by
							annexing the North German states (with the exception of Saxony) which had opposed her <figure>
								<p rend="center">Prussia's Annexations in 1866</p>
							</figure> in the war. Hanover, Hesse-Cassel, Nassau, and the free city of Frankfort,
							along with the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, all became Prussian.</p>

						<note rend="right">Requirements of the proposed constitution</note>

						<p>Prussia, thus enlarged, summoned the lesser states about her to confer upon a
							constitution that should accomplish four ends. First, it must give to all the people
							of the territory included in the new union, regardless of the particular state in
							which they lived, a voice in the government. A popular assembly satisfied this demand.
							Secondly, the predominating position of Prussia <pb id="VAB8216-377" n="330"/> must be
							secured; but at the same time, thirdly, the self-respect of the other monarchs whose
							lands were included must not be sacrificed. In order to accomplish this double purpose
							the king of Prussia was made "president" of the federation but not its sovereign. The
							chief governing body was the Federal Council (<hi rend="i">Bundesrath</hi>). In this
							each ruler, however small his state, and each of the three free towns-- Hamburg,
							Bremen, and LÃ¼beck-- had at least one vote; thus it was arranged that the other rulers
							should not become <hi rend="i">subjects</hi> of the king of Prussia. The real
							sovereign of the North German Federation was not the king of Prussia, but "all of the
							united governments." The votes were distributed as in the old diet, so that Prussia,
							with the votes of the states that she annexed in 1866, enjoyed seventeen votes out of
							forty-three. Lastly, the constitution was so arranged that when the time came for the
							southern states-- Bavaria, WÃ¼rtemberg, Baden, and South Hesse-- to join the union, it
							would be adapted to the needs of the widened empire.</p>

								he cherished imperial designs outside of the confines of Europe. What appeared to
								him to be an excellent opportunity to build up a Latin empire under his protection
								was afforded by disorders in Mexico. In the summer of 1861, at the opening of the
								great Civil War in America, the republic of Mexico suspended payments on its debts.
								England, France, and Spain made a joint demonstration against Mexico in favor of
								their subjects who held Mexican bonds. Napoleon then entered into negotiations with
								some Mexicans who wanted to overthrow the republic, and he offered to support the
								establishment of an empire if they would choose as their ruler Archduke Maximilian,
								brother of the Austrian emperor, to which they agreed. Little realizing how few of
								the Mexican people wanted him for their ruler, Maximilian landed in his new realm in
								1864, strongly supported by French troops. As soon as the Civil War in the United
								States was brought to a close, the American government protested, in the name of the
								Monroe Doctrine, against foreign intervention in Mexican affairs, and as Napoleon
								III was in no position to wage war with so formidable a power, he withdrew his
								soldiers and advised Maximilian to abdicate and return to Europe. The new emperor,
								however, refused to leave Mexico, and shortly afterwards he was captured and shot
								(June, 1867). The whole affair cost France a great deal of money and the lives of
								many soldiers, and discredited Napoleon's ability as a statesman.</note>

							also it was believed that Napoleon had been outwitted by Bismarck, and a war fever
							developed both in France and Germany, which was fostered by the sensational press of
							Paris and Berlin. Frenchmen began to talk about "avenging Sadowa," and the Prussians
							to threaten their "hereditary enemy" with summary treatment for past wrongs.</p>

						<note rend="right">Question of the succession to the throne of Spain</note>

						<p>In the midst of this irritation a pretext for war was afforded by the question of the
							Spanish throne then vacant as the result of the expulsion of Queen Isabella in 1868.
							After the flight of the queen a national Cortes was summoned to determine upon a form
							of government, and after long deliberations it finally tendered the crown to Leopold
							of Hohenzollern, a very distant relative of William I of Prussia. This greatly excited
							the journalists of Paris, who loudly protested that it was only an indirect way of
							bringing Spain under the influence of Prussia. The French minister of foreign affairs
							declared that the candidacy was an attempt to reestablish the empire of Charles V.
							This belief was entirely unfounded, for, in spite of the apprehensions of the French,
							the mass of the Spanish people were more anxious <pb id="VAB8216-379" n="332"/> to see
							the restoration of the Bourbon line in the person of Alfonso, the son of Queen
							Isabella, than they were to have as their ruler Leopold of Hohenzollern, or Amadeus
							(the son of the king of Italy), who was finally induced in 1870 to accept the
								crown.<ref id="ref_189" rend="super" target="note_189">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">France declares war on Prussia, July 19, 1870</note>

						<p>But the war parties in France and Prussia were looking for a pretext for a conflict,
							and consequently the candidacy of Prince Leopold was given an exaggerated importance.
							In June, 1870, with the consent of the king of Prussia, Leopold accepted the proffered
							crown; but when the French government protested he withdrew his acceptance, also with
							the approbation of the Prussian king. The affair now seemed to be closed, but the
							French ministry was not satisfied with the outcome and demanded that the king of
							Prussia should pledge himself that the candidacy should never be renewed. This William
							refused to do, and Bismarck, with gleeful malice,<ref id="ref_190" rend="super"
								target="note_190">2</ref> so edited the account given to the German newspapers of
							the refusal as to make it appear that the French ambassador had insulted King William,
							and had been rebuffed. This excited the "jingoes" in both countries to a state of
							frenzy, and although the war party in France was a small minority, that country
							nevertheless declared war against Prussia on July 19, 1870.</p>

								who opposed the new constitution because it granted religious liberty; and by the
								moderate royalists, who favored placing Isabella's son, Alfonso, on the throne.
								After little more than two years' experience, Amadeus laid down his crown, and the
								revolutionists proclaimed a republic (February 12, 1873) which lasted only about a
								year. At last, in 1875, the crown was given to Isabella's son, who took the title of
								Alfonso XII, and after a short civil war with the Carlists a new constitution was
								drawn up in 1876 providing for a parliament of two houses-- a senate composed of
								grandees, appointed dignitaries, and elected persons, and a lower house of
								representatives chosen by popular suffrage. (By the electoral law of 1890 all male
								Spaniards twenty-five years of age are entitled to vote.) This is the present

							sooner been declared than the Germans laid all jealousy aside and ranged themselves as
							a nation against a national assailant. The French army, moreover, was neither well
							equipped nor well commanded. The Germans hastened across the Rhine and within a few
							days were driving the French before them. In a series of bloody encounters about Metz,
							one of the French armies was defeated and finally shut up within the fortifications of
							the town. Seven weeks had not elapsed after the beginning of the war before the
							Germans had captured a second French army and made a prisoner of the emperor himself

								Lorraine had fallen to France in 1766, upon the death of its last duke. It had
								previously been regarded as a part of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1871 less than a

							billion francs, and German troops were to occupy France till it was paid. The French
							people made pathetic sacrifices to hasten the payment of this indemnity, in order that
							the country might be freed from the presence of the hated Germans. The bitter feeling
							of the French for the Germans dates from this war, and the longing for revenge has by
							no means disappeared. For many years after the war a statue in Paris, representing the
							lost city of Strassburg, was draped in mourning.</p>

						<p>The attack of France upon Prussia in 1870, instead of hindering the development of
							Germany, as Napoleon III had hoped it would, only served to consummate the work of
							i866. The South German states,-- Bavaria, WÃ¼rtemberg, Baden, and South Hesse,-- having
							sent their troops to fight side by side with the Prussian forces, consented after
							their common victory over France to join the North German Federation. By a series of
							treaties it was agreed, among other things, that the name "North German Federation"
							should give way to that of "German Empire," and that the king of Prussia, as president
							of the union, should be given the title of German Emperor. Surrounded by German
							princes, William, king of Prussia, and president of the North German Federation, was
							proclaimed German Emperor in the former palace of the French kings at Versailles,
							January 18, 1871. The long conflict for unity was now at an end; it only remained for
							Germany to assert its place among the great nations of the world.</p>

						<note rend="right">Problems facing Austria in 1866</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">55.</hi> The defeat at Sadowa and the formation of the North German
							Federation had served to cut off Austria from Germany altogether, and she was left to
							solve as best she might the problems of adjusting her relations with Hungary,
							reconciling the <pb id="VAB8216-385" n="335"/> claims of the various races within her
							borders, arid meeting the demands of the liberals for constitutional government and
							reforms in general.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Austro-Hungarian monarchy established in 1867</note>

						<p>An attempt had been made in 1861 to unite all the possessions of Francis Joseph into
							a single great empire with its parliament at Vienna, but the Hungarians obstinately
							refused to take part in the deliberations, and, by encouraging the Bohemians, Poles,
							and Croats to withdraw, brought the plan to naught.</p>

						<p>Soon after the defeat of Austria by Prussia in 1866 the relations between the
							Austrian Empire and the kingdom of Hungary were finally settled by a compromise (<hi
								rend="i">Ausgleich</hi>, as the Germans call it).<ref id="ref_193" rend="super"
								target="note_193">1</ref> Francis Joseph agreed to regard himself as ruling over two
							separate and practically independent states: (1) the Austrian Empire, which includes
							seventeen provinces,-- Upper and Lower Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Carinthia, Carniola,
							and the rest; and (2) the kingdom of Hungary, including Croatia and Slavonia. While
							each of these had its own constitution and its own parliament, one at Vienna, and the
							other at Pesth, and managed its own affairs under the guidance of its own ministers,
							the two governments, in dealing with foreign nations, declaring war, and concluding
							treaties, were to appear as one state, to be called Austria-Hungary. They were to have
							a common army and navy and to be united commercially by using the same coins, weights,
							and measures, and agreeing upon a common tariff. Although this particular kind of
							union between two states was a new thing in Europe, it has so far proved a permanent
							one.</p>

						<note rend="right">The government of the Austro-Hungarian dualism consists of a common
							sovereign, three ministries and the <hi rend="i">Delegations</hi></note>

						<p>In order to manage the affairs common to the two states, their joint monarch appoints

							responsible to a curious kind of joint parliament, called the <hi rend="i"
								>Delegations</hi>, one of which is chosen by the Austrian parliament, and the other
							by the Hungarian diet. These Delegations consist of sixty members each and hold their
							sessions alternately at Vienna and at Pesth, <note id="note_193"><hi rend="center"

							bodies, one carrying on its discussions in German and the other in Hungarian, and
							ordinarily communicate with each other in writing, except in cases of disagreement,
							when the two Delegations come together and vote as a single body, but without
							debate.</p>

						<note rend="right">Continued difficulties due to the mixture of races</note>

						<p>The problem of satisfying the various races, with their differing languages and their
							national aspirations, has been the most characteristic difficulty which both Austria
							and Hungary have had to face. There were in Austria in 1867, 7,100,000 Germans,
							4,700,000 Czechs, 2,440,000 Poles (in Galicia), 2,580,000 Ruthenians (in eastern
							Galicia), 1,190,000 Slovenians (principally in Carniola), 520,000 Croats (in Dalmatia
							and Istria), 580,000 Italians (in Trieste and southern Tyrol), and 200,000 Roumanians
							(in Bukovina). The Germans held that the German town of Vienna, the old seat of the
							court, was the natural center of all the provinces, and that the German language,
							since it was spoken more generally than any other in the Austrian provinces and was
							widely used in scientific and literary works, should be given the preference
							everywhere by the government. The Czechs and Poles, on their part, longed for their
							old freedom and independence, wished to use their own language, and constantly
							permitted their dislike of the Germans to influence their policy in the parliament at
								Vienna.<ref id="ref_194" rend="super" target="note_194">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Power of the Church reduced in Austria</note>

						<p>The three most noteworthy achievements in Austria during the past fifty years have
							been the establishment of a constitutional system in 1867, the readjustment of the
							relations between Church and State in 1867-1868, and the extension of the suffrage in
							1906. After the settlement of 1867 the German liberal party forced through the
							Austrian parliament a series of laws which restricted the time-honored prerogatives of
							the Catholic clergy.<ref id="ref_195" rend="super" target="note_195">2</ref> Every

							to all citizens, regardless of creed; the State, not the Church, was thereafter to
							manage the schools; civil marriage was instituted for those who did not wish to have a
							priest officiate at their marriage, as well as for those whom the priests refused to
							unite. The Pope vigorously condemned the constitutional laws of 1867, which had
							guaranteed complete religious liberty; the laws of 1868 he pronounced "abominable,"
							and rejected them as null and void. Nevertheless the reforms which Joseph II had
							striven to introduce before the French Revolution were at last secured.</p>

						<note rend="right">Question of the suffrage</note>

						<p>Austria, like the other European states, has been profoundly affected by the
							Industrial Revolution. The ever-increasing numbers of workingmen began to urge that
							the old system of voting, which permitted the richer classes to choose the members of
							the parliament, should be changed so as to allow the great mass of the people to send
							representatives to Vienna.<ref id="ref_196" rend="super" target="note_196">1</ref> At
							last, in 90o6, the suffrage was extended to all males over twenty-four years of age.
							The first election under the new law took place in May, 1907.<ref id="ref_197"
								rend="super" target="note_197">2</ref> The socialists gained over fifty seats, many
							of which they secured at the expense of the Czechs. But, on the other hand, the
							conservative clerical party also gained. It remains to be seen whether the various
							little parties formed on race issues will give way in time to those representing grave
							economic and social problems such as exist in the other European states.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Magyars predominate in Hungary</note>

						<p>The history of Hungary since 1867 has resembled that of Austria in some respects. The

						<note rend="right">The constitution of the German Empire</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">56.</hi> It will be remembered that the constitution of the North German
							Federation had been drawn up in 1866 with the hope that the southern states, Bavaria,
							WÃ¼rtemberg, Baden, and South Hesse, would later join the union; consequently little
							change was necessary when the empire was established four years later. The title of
							German Emperor (<hi rend="i">Deutscher Kaiser</hi>) was bestowed on King William I of
							Prussia and his successors, but it did not carry with it any authority which he had
							not enjoyed as president of the North German Federation. In the empire, as in the
							federation, the sovereignty is not vested in the ruler, but in the <hi rend="i"
								>Bundesrath</hi>, or Federal Council, which is made up of representatives of the
							twenty-two monarchs and the three free cities included in the union.<ref id="ref_199"
								rend="super" target="note_199">1</ref> The emperor does not possess the right to
							veto laws passed by the imperial parliament, but nevertheless he exercises many of the
							powers which would naturally fall to a monarch. He appoints and dismisses the imperial
							chancellor,-- the chief minister of the empire,-- as well as other imperial officials.
							Though he cannot declare an offensive war without the consent of the Bundesrath, he
							commands the unconditional obedience of all German soldiers and sailors, and appoints
							the chief officers in the army and all those in the navy.<ref id="ref_200"
								rend="super" target="note_200">2</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">The Bundesrath, or Federal Council</note>

						<p>The Bundesrath, like the Senate of the United States, represents the various states

							<pb id="VAB8216-391" n="341"/> system, the various states in the German union are not
							given equal representation in the Bundesrath; Prussia, which includes more than one
							half of the territory and population of the empire, sends seventeen delegates, Bavaria
							six, Saxony four, WÃ¼rtemberg four, Baden and Hesse three each, Mecklenburg-Schwerin
							and Brunswick two each, and all the others one each. The free cities and

						<p>The democratic element in the government is the <hi rend="i">Reichstag</hi>, or House

							particular rights, and they were not altogether pleased with the preeminence assumed

							<pb id="VAB8216-393" n="343"/> continued strain of these disruptive tendencies, the
							imperial government undertook to establish stronger national ties through the
							introduction of uniform laws for the whole German people, to supplant the diverse laws
							of the various commonwealths.</p>

						<note rend="right">Powers of the imperial government</note>

						<p>The leadership in this nationalizing movement fell naturally to Bismarck, chancellor
							of the empire and president of the Prussian ministry., Fortunately for him, the
							constitution conferred on the imperial legislature wide powers in regulating matters
							which in the United States are reserved entirely to the states. The imperial
							parliament is authorized to regulate commerce and intercourse between the states and
							with foreign nations, to coin money, fix weights and measures, control the banking
							system, the railways, telegraph, and post office, besides other general powers. But,
							more than this, the federal government in Germany is empowered by the constitution to
							make uniform throughout the empire the criminal and civil law, the organization of the
							courts, and judicial procedure, whereas in the United States each state defines
							crimes, regulates the form of contracts, and so forth.</p>

						<note rend="right">Imperial legislation</note>

						<p>The parliament at once set to work to carry into effect the important powers
							conferred upon it. In 1873 a uniform currency law was passed, and the bewildering
							variety of coins and paper notes of the separate states was replaced by a simple
							system of which the <hi rend="i">mark</hi> (about twenty-five cents) is the basis. The
							new coins bore on one side the effigy of the emperor, and on the other the arms of the
							empire, "to preach to the people the good news of unity." In 1871 a uniform criminal
							code was introduced; in 1877 a law was passed regulating the organization of the
							courts, civil and criminal procedure, bankruptcy, and patents; and from 1874 to 1887 a
							commission was busy drafting the civil code which went into effect in 1900.</p>

						<p>Although the champions of states' rights looked with disfavor upon Bismarck's policy
							of strengthening the imperial government and making uniform laws for the whole empire,
							the most significant opposition came from the Catholics, who feared the <pb
								id="VAB8216-394" n="344"/> growing influence of Protestant Prussia. At the first
							imperial elections in 1871 the Catholics returned sixty-three members to Parliament,
							and in this the chancellor saw, or pretended to see, a conspiracy of clerical forces
							against the state. At all events, he began a war on the Catholics known as the
							Kulturkampf, or "war in defense of civilization," by legislation expelling the Jesuits
							and other religious societies and imposing penalties upon the clergy for any criticism
							of the government.<ref id="ref_204" rend="super" target="note_204">1</ref> This was
							followed by other harsh legislation in Prussia; and the Pope and German clergy in
							general were moved to resist Bismarck's anti-clerical policy. Instead of submitting,
							the Catholics were welded into a strong political party which elected ninety-one
							members to the Reichstag in 1874.</p>

						<p>Finding the Catholic opposition growing stronger, and discovering a new danger to his
							policy in the rapid rise of a socialistic party, Bismarck came to terms with the
							Church, repealed nearly all of the measures directed against the clergy, and
							established cordial relations with the Vatican. The Catholic political party-- whose
							representatives in the Reichstag are called the Center-- was not, however, broken up
							by the reversal of the government policy; and the attempt to destroy the socialist
							party, which Bismarck was now free to make, proved no more successful.</p>

						<p>The socialist view of the labor problems and their solution had been elaborated by a

								rend="super" target="note_205">1</ref> but it was not until nearly twenty years
							later that a party championing his doctrines entered German politics. Under the
							leadership of Lassalle, a radical thinker and a brilliant orator, a General
							Workingmen's Association was formed at a labor congress in Leipzig in 1863. After more
							than a year's vigorous agitation Lassalle had, however, mustered less than five
							thousand members for his association, and he was thoroughly discouraged when he met
							his end in a duel over a love affair in 1864.</p>

						<note rend="right">The social democrats organize in 1869</note>

						<p>Notwithstanding the death of Lassalle, the campaign which he had begun continued to
							be prosecuted with greater vigor than before, although by no means all of the

							influence of the teachings of Marx, founded at Eisenach, in 1869, a new association,
							which bore the name of the Social Democratic Labor Party of Germany. The two groups
							worked side by side until 1875, when, at a general labor congress held at Gotha, they
							combined and issued an important statement of the views and purposes of the party. In
							the elections of that year for the Reichstag the socialists polled three hundred and
							forty thousand votes and began to arouse the apprehension of the government, which was

						<note rend="right">Bismarck determines to crush out socialism, 1878</note>

						<p>Bismarck resented the attitude of the socialists, and after two attempts had been

							tendencies dangerous to the public peace, and authorized the government to proclaim
							martial law in any city threatened by labor disturbances. This repressive <note

							<pb id="VAB8216-398" n="346"/> law remained in force for twelve years and completely
							disorganized the party as far as national politics were concerned. It failed, however,
							in accomplishing its full purpose, for the socialists continued to form local

							secret propaganda in the factories and the army and by means of papers smuggled in
							principally from Switzerland.<ref id="ref_206" rend="super" target="note_206"
							>1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Origin of the "state socialist" party</note>

						<p>While these attempts were being made to suppress the social democrats, there was
							growing up in Germany a new school of political economists known as "state
							socialists," who maintained that the government should adopt a number of the
							socialistic schemes for the benefit of the working classes in order to remove the
							causes of their discontent. The practical proposals of the state socialists were
							exceedingly numerous. They advocated providing steady employment for the working
							classes, reduction of the hours of labor, improvement of the sanitary and moral
							conditions in factories, restriction of the labor of women and children, and adequate
							precautions against accidents and sickness. They proposed to equalize the distribution
							of wealth by taxing those whose incomes were derived from rents, interest, or
							speculation, and favored government ownership of railways, canals, and all means of
							communication and transport, water and gas works, a large portion of the land within
							city limits, markets, and the business of banking and insurance.</p>

						<note rend="right">Attitude of Bismarck toward socialism and the working classes</note>

						<p>Bismarck himself took a deep interest in the theories of the state socialists, and
							from 1878 to the close of his administration he advocated a number of reforms for the
							benefit of the working people and carried out a few of them. In undertaking these
							measures he frankly admitted that he was only renewing the old Brandenburg policy of
							paternal interest in the welfare of the people and in increasing the power and
							prosperity of the State. He accepted the capitalist system of industry and the
							division of society into rich and poor as a natural and permanent arrangement, but
							considered it the duty of the State to <note id="note_206"><hi rend="center"><ref
										target="ref_206" rend="super">1</ref> See <hi rend="i">Readings</hi>, Vol. II,
									pp. 185 <hi rend="i">sqq</hi>.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-399" n="347"/> better the condition of the working people by special
							laws, as well as to encourage industry by protective tariffs.</p>

						<note rend="right">State insurance in the interest of the working classes</note>
						<note rend="right">Accident and sickness insurance</note>

						<p>He looked upon certain reforms in favor of the working classes as the best means of
							undermining the influence of the socialists. In 1882 the government introduced two
							bills providing for accident and sickness insurance, which were given their final form
							after two years of deliberation and went into effect in 1885. According to the
							provisions of the first law, employers are obliged to provide a fund to insure their
							employees against accidents. From this fund the workmen are compensated when partially
							or totally disabled, and in case of death provision is made for the family of the
							deceased. The sickness insurance law compels working men and women to insure
							themselves against sickness, but helps them to bear the burden by requiring the
							employer to pay a portion of the premium and to be responsible for carrying out the
							law.</p>

						<note rend="right">Insurance for the aged and incapacitated</note>

						<p>These measures were supplemented in 1889, after the accession of the present Kaiser,
							by an old-age insurance law which compels every workman with an income under five
							hundred dollars a year to pay a certain proportion into a state fund which provides an
							annual pension for him after he has reached the age of seventy years. In case he is
							incapacitated earlier in life he may begin to draw the pension before he reaches that
							age. As in other forms of workingmen's insurance, the employers pay a portion of the
							premium; and the State also makes a regular contribution to every annuity paid.<ref
								id="ref_207" rend="super" target="note_207">1</ref> In 1909 over twelve million
							persons were insured under these laws.</p>

						<p>These three measures constitute the main results of Bismarck's policy of aiding the
							workingman, for notwithstanding an early promise of the present emperor, no
							substantial addition has been made to imperial labor legislation since 1889. Moreover
							these measures have failed to accomplish the purpose which Bismarck particularly had
							at heart,-- that of checking the socialist influence.</p>

						<note rend="right">Demand for protection of German industries</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">58.</hi> Closely connected with Bismarck's paternal attitude toward the
							working classes was his policy of protecting German industries against foreign
							competition. The successful war with France, the establishment of the empire, and,
							above all, the payment of the French indemnity had created a great "boom" in Germany.
							New enterprises multiplied; in Prussia alone the number of joint-stock companies
							increased from 410 in 1870 to 2267 in 1874; wages rose rapidly and times were "good"
							until the inevitable reaction due to overspeculation set in. Prices and wages then
							began to fall, companies failed, and factories closed. The manufacturers then
							commenced to demand that they be protected from foreign competition, and the farmers
							asked that high duties be placed upon the grain that was being shipped into the
							country from the United States and Russia. It was urged that the German "infant"
							industries (of which we have heard so much in the United States) could not maintain
							themselves without aid when rival nations, especially England, were so much better
							equipped with machinery, experience, and natural resources.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bismarck's views of protection</note>

						<p>Bismarck, who had formerly seemed to favor free trade, declared in the Reichstag that
							he was convinced that it would never be universally adopted by the nations of the
							earth, as some economists hoped. Even England, he argued, could not continue her
							free-trade policy. "Both France and America have completely forsaken free trade;
							Austria, instead of reducing her protective duties, has increased them; Russia has
							done the same. . . . Therefore no one can expect Germany to remain permanently the
							victim of its sincere belief in the theory of free trade. Hitherto we have thrown our
							doors wide open to foreign goods and so have made our country the dumping ground for
							all the overproduction of other countries. . . . Let us close the door and erect the
							somewhat higher barriers that are proposed, <pb id="VAB8216-401" n="[]"/>

							<figure> </figure>
							<pb id="VAB8216-403" n="[]"/>
							<pb id="VAB8216-404" n="349"/> and let us see to it that we secure at any rate the
							German market for the German manufacturers."</p>

						<note rend="right">Germany established a protective system in 1879</note>

						<p>It was under these circumstances that the imperial chancellor presented to the
							Reichstag in 1878 a programme of tariff revision embodying two main points: (1)
							protective duties designed to give German industries the advantage over foreign
							producers; (2) a reduction of duties on raw materials not produced within the empire.
							In the following year the Reichstag adopted the new tariff laws by a large majority
							and thus initiated a system under which Germany has become one of the greatest
							manufacturing countries in the world.</p>

						<note rend="right">African colonization</note>

						<p>German manufacturers were, however, not satisfied with securing preference over
							foreign competitors in their domestic trade; they soon began to demand government aid
							in finding new markets abroad. In spite of many misgivings about the ultimate value of
							distant colonies peopled by barbarous races, Bismarck was induced to take steps toward
							the acquisition of territory in Africa.</p>

						<note rend="right">Togoland and Kamerun</note>

						<p>He sent out Dr. Gustav Nachtigal in 1884 for the purpose of establishing German
							control at certain points along the western coast of Africa. In a short time the
							German agent had induced native chiefs to acknowledge a German protectorate over two
							large provinces, Togoland in Upper Guinea, a region about the size of the state of
							Indiana, and Kamerun, adjoining the French Congo,-- in all an area of over two hundred
							thousand square miles.<ref id="ref_208" rend="super" target="note_208">1</ref> In the
							same year Herr Luederitz, a Bremen merchant, acting under orders from Bismarck, raised
							the German flag at Angra Pequena (a point on the west coast a short distance above the
							English possessions at the Cape), where German merchants and traders had been active
							for some time. Within a few years the German government carved out a block of
							territory estimated at over three hundred and twenty thousand square miles, an area
							far greater than that of the entire German Empire. This colony bears the name of

						<note rend="right">German East Africa</note>

						<p>Even larger territories were secured by Germany in East Africa. In 1884 the Society
							for German Colonization sent Dr. Karl Peters to determine what could be done in that
							region. The sultan of Zanzibar was induced in 1888 to lease a narrow strip of
							territory over six hundred miles long to the Germans, and in two years transferred all
							his rights to the German Empire for a million dollars. The few German settlers then
							established plantations of cocoa palms, coffee, vanilla, tobacco, caoutchouc, sugar,
							tea, etc., and the government founded several experiment stations for determining the
							possibilities of profitable agriculture.<ref id="ref_209" rend="super"

						<p>It is not strange that Bismarck, who, with firm hand, keen vision, and unswerving

							century, should have found it hard to tolerate the intervention of the inexperienced
							young emperor. In March, 1890, he presented his resignation, and, amid a great
							demonstration of popular feeling, the "Iron Chancellor," the most extraordinary
							statesman Germany has ever produced, retired to private life. He had assumed no
							responsibility for the policies of William II, and may have cherished some bitterness
							against him. At any rate, after his death in 1898 these simple words were carved upon
							his tomb, "Here lies Prince Bismarck, a faithful servant of Emperor William I." <note

							remains unchanged. Forward, with full steam!"</p>

						<note rend="right">Attitude of William II toward socialism</note>

						<p>For a time it seemed as if William II proposed to conciliate the socialist party,
							although he could not possibly have had any real sympathy with its aims. The
							legislation against the socialists which Bismarck had inaugurated in 1878 was allowed
							to lapse in 1890, and they now carried on their agitation openly and with vigor and
							success. The emperor pledged himself to continue the social legislation begun by his
							grandfather, since he deemed it one of the duties of the State to relieve poverty; and
							he declared that the welfare of the workingman lay close to his heart. Irritated,
							however, at his failure to check the expression of discontent on the part of the
							working classes, he grew angry and pronounced the social democrat as "nothing better
							than an enemy of the empire and his country." Of late the emperor has had less to say
							about helping the workingman, but he watches with no little uneasiness the steady
							increase of the number of socialist voters.<ref id="ref_214" rend="super"

						<note rend="right">Germany in the Far East</note>

						<p>United Germany, like united Italy, had embarked on a colonial policy, and William II
							has shown himself very ready to participate in world politics. At the close of the war
							between China and Japan, in 1895, he joined with Russia and France in preventing Japan
							from occupying the Liaotung peninsula. Two years later the Germans seized the port of

						<p><hi rend="b">60.</hi> On September 3, 1870, Napoleon III telegraphed from Sedan to
							Paris, "The army is defeated and captured, and I am a prisoner."<ref id="ref_218"
								rend="super" target="note_218">1</ref> This meant an immediate collapse of the
							empire which he had established some twenty years before. The Chamber of Deputies was
							invaded by a mob shouting for the republic, and a motion was made to dethrone Napoleon
							and his dynasty. Next day Gambetta and the deputies representing the city of Paris
							betook themselves to the old revolutionary storm center, the City Hall, and there
							proclaimed the reestablishment of a republic. This was sanctioned by an overwhelming
							majority of the Parisians. Meanwhile other large cities, such as Bordeaux, Marseilles,
							and Lyons, took similar action.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Germans invade France and lay siege to Paris</note>

						<p>The terrible defeat at Sedan and the capture of the emperor did not, as we know,
							bring the war to a close. The German invaders pressed on; city after city was taken;
							the strongly fortified Strassburg fell at the end of September after a terrific
							bombardment, and the fortress of Metz a month later. Paris itself was surrounded by an
							immense German army, and the king of Prussia took up his quarters at Versailles.
							Gambetta, the energetic republican leader, escaping from Paris in a balloon, floated
							safely over the lines of the besieging Germans and reached Tours. Here he invoked the
							memories of 1793 and sought to organize a national army of volunteers; but the raw
							French battalions were easily defeated by the disciplined German <note id="note_218"

							Metz. In January, 1871, the French made their last effort to bring the enemy to terms
							by endeavoring to cut off his communications with Germany, but the attempt failed and
							the remains of the French forces were compelled to take refuge in the neutral
							territory of Switzerland, whither the Germans could not pursue them. Paris, reduced
							after a terrible siege to the point of starvation,<ref id="ref_219" rend="super"
								target="note_219">1</ref> capitulated on January 28, and an armistice was
							concluded.</p>

						<note rend="right">The National Assembly elected February, 1871, proves to be strongly
							monarchical</note>

						<p>Since the dissolution of the government of Napoleon III early in September, France
							had had no opportunity to work out a new constitution, and had drifted on under a
							provisional "Government of the Public Defense" which Gambetta, Favre, and others among
							the former deputies had improvised. It was questionable whether this revolutionary
							body was authorized to conclude a peace, and accordingly it was arranged, upon the
							surrender of Paris, that the French should elect a national assembly which would
							legally represent the nation in dealing with the victorious enemy. The result of the
							elections was surprising, for only two hundred republican candidates were chosen as
							against five hundred monarchists of various kinds, namely, legitimists, Orleanists,
							and a few Bonapartists. This was largely due to the fact that Gambetta and other
							prominent republicans had talked so fervidly of continuing the war at any cost that
							the mass of the people was fearful lest if put in power they might prolong the
							disastrous conflict which was ruining the country. The National Assembly, aware that
							Paris was strongly republican in its sentiments, determined to meet in Bordeaux, where
							it held its first session on February 12.</p>

						<note rend="right">Adolphe Thiers</note>

						<p>Foremost among the brilliant men who composed this body was Adolphe Thiers, the
							historian, journalist, and politician, who for more than forty years had been a
							prominent figure both in literature and in affairs of State. In the grave crisis in
							which France found herself in February, 1871, he appeared, to be the natural leader.
							His popularity was demonstrated by <note id="note_219"><hi rend="center"><ref

							<pb id="VAB8216-413" n="358"/> the fact that in the elections for the National
							Assembly he had received over two million votes. The National Assembly therefore
							appointed him "Head of the Executive Power of the French Republic" and provided that
							he should exercise his authority through ministers of his own choice. This was, of
							course, a temporary arrangement, and the vital question whether France was to remain a
							republic or to be reconverted into a monarchy was deferred until the hated Germans
							should be got rid of. Thiers declared that in the face of the trying situation in
							which France found herself, all enlightened and patriotic citizens, whatever their
							individual views of government, should unite to free their country from the invader
							and restore her to her former prosperity.</p>

						<note rend="right">The conclusion of peace with the Germans. Treaty of Frankfort, May
							10, 1871</note>

						<p>The first step in the realization of this policy was the conclusion of a final peace
							with the Germans, for the armistice which had been agreed upon at the capitulation of
							Paris had almost expired. On February 21 Thiers hurried to Versailles to open
							negotiations with the German emperor and Bismarck, and on the twenty-sixth, after many
							stormy scenes, the terms of the preliminary treaty were formulated. France was to
							renounce Alsace and a part of Lorraine, which together included a population of almost
							1,600,000; pay an enormous indemnity of five billion francs; and submit to the
							presence of German troops until the last payment was made. The Assembly, convinced
							that a renewal of the war would be futile, accepted the terms imposed by the
							victorious Germans, and the peace documents were formally signed at Frankfort on May
								10.<ref id="ref_220" rend="super" target="note_220">1</ref></p>

								patriotism and the credit of the French people. In the autumn of 1873 the amount was
								paid in full and the last German soldier left the soil of France.</note>

							Assembly refused to remove to Paris, the "headquarters of sedition and the center of

							sentiment, so they chose Versailles as their place of meeting.<ref id="ref_221"

							thus neglected the claims of Paris as the seat of government, there might arise "from
							the ashes of a horrible war with the foreigner a still more horrible civil conflict."

							which it regarded as made up of obstinate and benighted "rustics" who still clung to
							monarchy and had no sympathy with the needs of the great cities.</p>

						<note rend="right">Views of the communards</note>

						<p>Trouble had been brewing in Paris for several months. The siege had thrown tens of
							thousands out of work and had produced general demoralization. The revolutionary
							group, which was speedily formed and which now attempted to govern Paris, included
							republicans, socialists, communists, anarchists, and some who could scarcely be said
							to have had much interest in anything except disorder. Many of the leaders were men of
							unquestionable integrity, who were determined to defend the republic, even by the
							sacrifice of their lives, as the "only form of government compatible with the rights
							of the people and the development of a free society." They all agreed in demanding
							that every commune, or municipality, should be left free to manage its own affairs in
							the interests of its own people. France would then become a sort of federation of
							communes, each community electing its own officers and introducing freely such social
							reforms as suited local conditions. It was this exalted confidence in the commune, or
							local government, that gained for the leaders the name of "communards."<ref

						<note rend="right">The commune suppressed with terrible loss of life and property,
							April-May, 1871</note>

						<p>The doctrines of the communards failed, however, to gain any considerable support in
							the other cities of France, and the Assembly at Versailles determined to reduce
							rebellious Paris to subjection. Toward the close of April Thiers ordered a bombardment
							of the fortifications on the outskirts of the city preparatory to its capture. This
							was the beginning of a desperate struggle; the Versailles troops, under orders,
							refused to accord to the communards the rights of soldiers, and shot, as traitors and
							rebels, all who fell into their hands. After three weeks of fighting on the outskirts,
							the forces of the Assembly entered Paris by an unguarded gate on May 21, and then
							began a terrible period of war, murder, and arson in the city itself. For a whole week
							the fratricidal strife raged, until finally, on May 28, Marshal MacMahon, who was in
							command of the troops, was able to announce the close of the conflict and the
							restoration of order. The slaughter, however, was not yet at an end, for the
							monarchists set up courts-martial and, with scarcely the semblance of a trial, shot
							hundreds of the prisoners that had been taken. Unlike the government of the United
							States after the close of the Civil War, that of France under the leadership of
							Thiers-- once a revolutionist himself-- forgave no one. Seventy-five hundred of the
							insurgents were sent to the penal colony in New Caledonia and thirteen thousand were
							condemned to imprisonment at hard labor or sent into exile.</p>

						<note rend="right">Dissensions between legitimists and Orleanists in the National
							Assembly</note>

						<p>The National Assembly was at last free to turn to the vexed question of settling upon
							a permanent form of government for the distracted country. There would have been
							little difficulty in reestablishing the monarchy if the monarchists had not been
							hopelessly divided among themselves. Some of them, known as the "legitimists" because
							they regarded the older Bourbon line as the lawful one, were in favor of bestowing the
							crown on the count -of Chambord, a grandson of Charles X, who had been deposed by the
							Orleanist revolution in 1830. The "Orleanists," who wished to see a restoration of the
							House <pb id="VAB8216-416" n="361"/> of Orleans which had been overthrown in 1848, had
							a strong candidate in the person of the count of Paris, a grandson of Louis Philippe.
							These two groups of monarchists had nothing in common but their opposition to a
							republic; their hatred of each other was bitter and uncompromising.</p>

						<note rend="right">Thiers (elected president of the republic, August, 1871) undertakes

						<p>In view of these divisions all factions were willing to postpone for a time the final
							solution of the problem, each hoping meanwhile to gain strength by delay. This policy
							was sanctioned by Thiers, who urged the assembly to devote its attention to the
							pressing task of strengthening the army and restoring the prosperity of France.
							Smarting under the humiliation of their defeat by the Germans, the Assembly passed a
							new army law modeled upon that of Prussia, which bound every Frenchman to military
							service for five years in the active service and fifteen years in the reserve
								force.<ref id="ref_223" rend="super" target="note_223">1</ref> The frontier defenses

						<note rend="right">Thiers overthrown and MacMahon elected president, 1873</note>

						<p>At last, in December, 1872, Thiers, who had been an Orleanist, declared himself for
							the republic, arguing that its overthrow would mean a new revolution. His conservative
							republicanism, however, did not save him from attacks by Gambetta and the radical
							republicans of the extreme left; while the monarchists, angered by his defection,
							determined on his downfall. In May, 1873, they secured a majority vote in the Assembly
							for a resolution condemning Thiers's policy, and he thereupon resigned, leaving the
							government in the hands of the monarchists, who chose Marshal MacMahon as president
							and formed a coalition ministry representing Orleanists, legitimists, and
							Bonapartists.</p>

						<note rend="right">The legitimists and Orleanists agree on a compromise, 1873</note>

						<p>The various monarchist parties soon saw that they must arrange a compromise if they

							children he should be succeeded by the count of Paris, <note id="note_223"><ref

							be securely established.</p>

						<note rend="right">The count of Chambord refuses to abandon the while flag of the

						<p>In this adjustment of affairs the parties had not reckoned with the character of the
							count of Chambord. He was then over fifty years of age and had spent most of his life
							as an exile in Scotland, Germany, Austria, and Italy. He had been educated by pious
							Catholics and ardent supporters of the legitimist cause, who had imbued him with a
							passionate devotion to the ancient rights of his house and with an equally passionate
							hatred of revolution in every form. Immediately after the suppression of the Paris
							Commune he had issued a manifesto in which he declared, "France will come to me, and I

							standard of his house.</p>

						<note rend="right">MacMahon's term prolonged to seven years</note>

						<p>The Orleanists, enraged by the conduct of the fusion candidate, determined that he
							should not ascend the throne upon his own terms and took measures to prevent his
							coronation, although he had come to Versailles to superintend the preparations. They
							turned to the Bonapartists and republicans with a proposition to prolong the term of
							Marshal MacMahon, as president of the republic, for a period of seven years, in the
							hope that by the time his term expired they could gain sufficient strength to place
							their own candidate on the throne.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Assembly at last agrees to sanction a republican form of

						<p>The Assembly meanwhile continued its confused and heated debates, the republicans
							demanding the establishment without further delay of a republican constitution; the

							the Orleanists, the president's continuance in office until 188o. Finally, at the
							beginning of the year 1875, <pb id="VAB8216-418" n="363"/> four years after the
							election of the Assembly, it at last took up seriously the consideration of a
							permanent form of government, and on January 29 a motion was carried by a majority of
							one, providing that the president of the republic should be elected by the Senate and
							Chamber of Deputies meeting in a joint assembly. Thus the republicans finally carried
							the day by the narrowest possible margin.</p>

						<note rend="right">Peculiar form of the present constitution of France</note>

						<p>The restoration of the monarchy having now become impossible, for the time being at
							least, the Assembly proceeded with the work of completing a form of government, not by
							drafting an elaborate constitution but by passing a series of laws. These separate
							laws, supplemented by later amendments, form the constitution of the Third Republic,
							which consequently differs in many fundamental ways from all the previous French
							constitutions. It contains no reference to the sovereignty of the people; it includes
							no bill of rights enumerating the liberties of French citizens; and it makes no
							definite provision for maintaining a republican form of government. It, in fact, bears
							throughout the marks of hasty compilation, designed as it was to tide the nation over
							a crisis until one of the contending parties in the Assembly could secure a triumphant
							majority. Nevertheless, despite the expectations of many who took part in its making,
							it has lasted longer and provided a more stable government than any of the numerous
							constitutions France has had since 1789.</p>

						<note rend="right">Position of the president of the French republic</note>

						<p>Under this new constitution the president of the French republic occupies a position
							rather more like that of the king of England than that of the president of the United
							States. He is elected for a term of seven years, not by the people at large but by the
							Senate and Chamber of Deputies which meet as one body in Versailles for the purpose.
							There is no vice president, and in case of the death or resignation of the president a
							new one is immediately chosen for the full term of seven years. He selects his cabinet
							principally from among the members of the chambers, and the ministers thus chosen <pb
								id="VAB8216-419" n="364"/> exercise a powerful control over his policy and
							appointments. The real head of the government is the prime minister, as in England.
							The president has no veto, but may return a measure to the Chamber and Senate for
							reconsideration.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Senate and Chamber of Deputies</note>

						<p>The parliament consists of two houses, differing in this respect from the legislative
							bodies established in 1791 and 1848. The members of the Chamber of Deputies (now 597
							in number) are chosen for a term of four years directly by the people, and every man
							over twenty-one years of age-- unless he be in active service in the army-- is
							permitted to vote. The three hundred senators are chosen indirectly for a term of nine
							years by a small group of local government officers in each department.</p>

						<note rend="right">Exceptional powers of the French Parliament</note>

						<p>It will be observed that the French parliament is more powerful than the Congress of
							the United States. It not only elects the president, who is under the control of a
							ministry representing the majority in the chambers, but it may by meeting in joint
							session amend the constitution without the necessity of submitting the changes to the
							people for their ratification. There is no supreme court in France to declare the
							measures of parliament unconstitutional, and the president cannot veto them. Like the
							members of the English cabinet, the French ministers resign when they find their
							policy is no longer supported by a majority in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

						<note rend="right">Strength of the republicans causes MacMahon to resign, 1879</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">61.</hi> The National Assembly, after completing the laws which now
							serve France as a constitution, dissolved on December 31, 1875, and a regular election
							was held throughout France for the purpose of choosing the members of the Senate and
							Chamber of Deputies. This resulted in an overwhelming majority for the republicans in
							the Chamber, and even in the Senate there were enough of them to give them the balance
							of <pb id="VAB8216-420" n="365"/> power among the conflicting royalist factions. The
							Orleanist president, Marshal MacMahon, found himself unable to work in harmony with
							the deputies, and in 1877 he dissolved the Chamber with the hope that by meddling in
							the elections and manipulating the returns he could secure at last a monarchical
							majority. This <hi rend="i">coup d'Ã¨tat</hi> failed. The new election left the
							republicans still in power; they denounced the president's policy and refused to
							approve the budget that he presented. After continuing the struggle until 1879,
							MacMahon resigned and was succeeded by an unmistakable republican, Jules GrÃ©vy, who
							enjoyed the entire confidence of the Chamber.</p>

						<note rend="right">Freedom of the press and of public assemblies</note>

						<p>Still further strengthened by the elections of 1881, the republicans undertook a
							number of urgent reforms. The press had been declared free in 1789 and in 1815, but
							the government had constantly watched the newspapers and punished editors who offended
							it by too frank criticism. At last, in 1881, the licenses previously required of those
							who wished to undertake new publications were abolished, publishers were no longer
							forced to make deposits in order to insure their respectful treatment of the
							government, and the police courts were deprived of their right to try those accused of
							defaming government officials. Akin to this reform was the right extended to any group
							of citizens to hold public meetings, on condition that they should merely announce
							their intention to the authorities. In 1884, after nearly a hundred years of harsh
							repressive legislation directed against all labor associations, a law was passed
							permitting workingmen to form unions. Finally, the government undertook a series of
							measures with a view of freeing the schools from the influence of the clergy, who were
							accused of undermining the loyalty of the children to the republic. These measures
							will be considered presently.</p>

						<note rend="right">Disappearance of the monarchical parties</note>

						<p>Year by year the French republic gained in the number of its adherents and in the
							confidence of the other powers of Europe. The death of the son of Napoleon III in 1879
							was a fatal blow to the already declining hopes of the Bonapartists, <pb
								id="VAB8216-421" n="366"/> and the death of the childless count of Chambord in 1883
							left the legitimist faction without a head. A few Orleanists clung to their candidate,
							the count of Paris, until his death in 1894, but the elections of the preceding year,
							which resulted in the choice of only seventy-three royalist deputies-- legitimists,
							Orleanists, and Bonapartists-- had shown that France was at last irrevocably committed
							to the republic.</p>

						<note rend="right">Boulanger's attempt to overturn the republic</note>

						<p>Only twice since the formation of the republic has it been seriously threatened by
							political disturbances. The death of Gambetta in i881 left the republicans, who
							naturally split up into several factions, without any distinguished leader. Encouraged
							by this situation a popular officer, General Boulanger, began courting the favor of
							the army and the workingmen in somewhat the same way that Napoleon III had done when
							he was planning to make himself master of France. In 1889 he was reflected to the
							Chamber of Deputies by an overwhelming majority, and it seemed for a time that he
							might be able to gain sufficient popularity to enable him to get control of the
								government.<ref id="ref_224" rend="super" target="note_224">1</ref> His enemies
							charged him with threatening the safety of the State, and he was tried and condemned
							to life imprisonment. He escaped from France, however, and in 1891 committed suicide,
							leaving his party to go to pieces. This episode served rather to discredit the
							monarchists than to weaken the republic.</p>

						<note rend="right">The opening of the Dreyfus affair, 1894</note>

						<p>France had scarcely settled down after the Boulanger episode before a singular
							incident rent the country into angry factions and stirred up the most bitter animosity
							which had distracted the nation since the Franco-German War and the suppression of the
							Commune. In 1894 Captain Alfred Dreyfus, an Alsatian Jew in the French artillery
							service, was charged with having delivered to a representative of the German
							government "a certain number of confidential documents relating to national defense,"
							which might enable Germany to undertake war against France. He was secretly tried by a
							military tribunal, <note id="note_224"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_224"
										rend="super">1</ref> For a defense of Boulanger, see <hi rend="i">Readings</hi>,
									Vol. II, pp. 216 <hi rend="i">sqq.</hi></hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-422" n="367"/> condemned to life imprisonment, degraded from his rank,
							and sent into solitary confinement on the lonely Devil's Island off the coast of
							French Guiana.</p>

						<p>Dreyfus had consistently protested that he was entirely innocent of the charge, and
							his friends began to work for a new trial. Prominent military officers, however, were
							determined that the Dreyfus affair should not be reopened for fear, apparently, that
							something discreditable to the army might be unearthed.</p>

						<note rend="right">France roused to frenzy over the affair</note>

						<p>The supporters of Dreyfus charged the army officers with unscrupulousness and
							corruption; his opponents, on the other hand, appealed to the country in the name of
							the honor of the army; churchmen attacked him as a Jew and as an enemy of Christian
							France. Government officials in general maintained his guilt, but many politicians,
							journalists, and prominent radicals declared their belief in his innocence and accused
							those in power of shielding criminal injustice. Monarchists cited the whole scandal as
							conclusive evidence of the failure of republican government. Thus the Dreyfus affair
							became a military, religious, and political question, which created a sort of frenzy
							in France and aroused the interest of the whole civilized world.</p>

						<note rend="right">Dreyfus at last declared innocent, 1906</note>

						<p>The controversy reached a crisis in 1898 when the well-known novelist, Ã‰mile Zola,
							published an article<ref id="ref_225" rend="super" target="note_225">1</ref> accusing
							all officials connected with the trial and conviction of Dreyfus not only of wanton

							defense of Dreyfus. Zola was tried and condemned for his bold indictment,<ref
								id="ref_226" rend="super" target="note_226">2</ref> but the reconsideration of the
							whole case could not be postponed any longer, and a new trial-was ordered, which began
							at Rennes in the summer of 1899. This resulted in the condemnation of Dreyfus to six
							years' imprisonment, but he was immediately pardoned by President Loubet. It was hoped

							Dreyfus might in this way be saved and yet no penalty be imposed on an innocent man.
							Naturally enough, however, this did not satisfy Dreyfus, who wanted not freedom as a
							pardoned criminal but a judicial declaration of his innocence. Consequently his
							numerous sympathizers continued to work for a new trial, and finally, in 1906, the
							highest court in France completely exonerated Dreyfus.</p>

						<p>The affair was thus at an end, but the effects of the controversy on the political

							for the purpose of reducing the political importance of the army and the Church. The

						<note rend="right">Natural hostility of the clergy to the French republic</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">62.</hi> The Catholic clergy had from the first been hostile to the
							republic, for they had every reason to fear that the new government, with its
							confidence in popular sovereignty, freedom of the press, and public schools, would
							sooner or later undermine their authority. The head of the Church, Pius IX, in a
							solemn statement called the Syllabus of 1864, had denounced in no uncertain terms what
							he regarded as the great dangers and errors of the age. Among these were religious
							toleration, liberty of conscience, freedom of the press and of speech, separation of
							Church and State, and secular education. The republicans were therefore pledged to
							just those things which the Pope condemned. It was inevitable, therefore, that the
							clerical party should do all in its power to discredit the republic and bring about a
							restoration of the monarchy. The Jesuits and other religious orders who maintained
							schools roused in the children's minds a distrust of the government, and the <pb
								id="VAB8216-424" n="369"/> clergy actively engaged in electioneering whenever there
							was hope of electing deputies who would favor their cause. The religious newspapers
							represented the republic as an unfortunate accident which had put ungodly men in power
							but which would doubtless speedily give way to a more legitimate form of
							government.</p>

						<note rend="right">The republicans become anticlerical</note>

						<p>This attitude on the part of the clergy naturally made the republicans more strongly
							anticlerical than ever. They came to hate the clergy and all they stood for. Gambetta
							declared that clericalism was "<hi rend="i">the</hi> enemy." Indeed, it was not until
							1892 that Leo XIII admonished the French bishops and priests to "accept the republic,
							that is to say, the established power which exists among you; respect it and submit to
							it as representing the power which comes from God."</p>

						<note rend="right">Main objects of the anticlericals during the past twenty-five
							years</note>

						<p>In spite of this peaceful advice on the part of the head of the Church there has been
							no peace; for during the past twenty-five years an extraordinary struggle between
							Church and State has been in progress in France, in which the republic has proved the
							victor and has succeeded in depriving the Church of a great part of those sources of
							political influence which remained to it after the losses it suffered during the
							French Revolution. The opponents of the Church have had two main objects in view: (1)
							to free the schools from the influence of the clergy and thus prevent the children of
							France from being brought up as monarchists, and (2) to relieve the government from
							the burden of paying the salaries of the clergy and to bring about the complete
							separation of Church and State.</p>

						<note rend="right">Establishment of public schools under purely secular influence</note>

						<p>The first step was to increase the number of public schools which might serve to
							attract pupils away from the convent and other Church schools. Over two hundred
							millions of dollars have been appropriated for this purpose during the past thirty
							years. By laws passed in 1881-1886 instruction was made free in the primary public
							schools, no clergyman was to be employed as a teacher in them, and compulsory
							education for children between six and thirteen years was established. The private
							schools were also placed under strict government supervision.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-425" n="370"/>

						<note rend="right">Opposition in the religious associations</note>

						<p>Many of the monastic orders and various other religious associations which had lost
							their property and then been abolished during the first revolution had been
							reestablished, and new ones had been created. Most of them were devoted to charitable
							work or to education. The Jesuits were accused of working, as always, in the interests
							of the Pope, and the Dominicans of preaching openly against the republic, while the
							innumerable schools in the convents and elsewhere were reproached with instilling
							monarchical and reactionary ideas into the tender minds of the children committed to
							their charge.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Associations Law of 1901</note>

						<p>From time to time some anticlerical deputy would propose the abolition of all the
							religious associations, and finally, in 1900, Waldeck-Rousseau, then prime minister,
							committed himself and his cabinet to a measure for greatly reducing their number,
							declaring that "There are too many monks in politics and too many monks in
								business."<ref id="ref_227" rend="super" target="note_227">1</ref> The following
							year the Associations Law was passed. This provided that no religious order could
							continue to exist in France without a specific authorization from the parliament, and
							that no one belonging to a nonauthorized association should be permitted to teach or
							to conduct a school. At the time of the passage of the law there were about one
							hundred and sixty thousand members (mainly women) in the various religious
							associations, which maintained about twenty thousand establishments. The parliament
							refused to grant most of the applications made by the many unauthorized associations,
							and as a result numerous teaching, preaching, and commercial societies which had been
							organized under the auspices of the Catholic Church were broken up, and within two
							years ten thousand religious schools were closed. In the year 1909-1910 there were
							over five million French children in the public and other secular schools and less
							than one <note id="note_227"><ref target="ref_227" rend="super">1</ref> Sometimes the
								orders carried on a little industry in the interests of their convent. For example,
								the monks of the great Carthusian monastery above Grenoble manufactured the famous
								liqueur known as Chartreuse. The labor parties denounced the monks for thus going
								into business and competing with other manufacturers.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-426" n="371"/> hundred thousand enrolled in those connected with
							religious associations. A law of 1904 provided that within ten years all teaching by
							religious associations shall cease.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Concordat of 1801 established a close relation between Church and
							State</note>

						<p>The attack on the religious orders was only the prelude to the complete separation of
							Church and State which had been advocated for a century by the opponents of the
							Church. It will be remembered that the French Convention proclaimed this separation in
							1795 and refused longer to pay the salaries of the clergy, or in any way to recognize
							the existence of the Church except as a voluntary association which should be
							supported by those who wished to belong to it. Bonaparte, however, partially restored
							the old system in the Concordat which he arranged with the Pope in 1801.<ref
								id="ref_228" rend="super" target="note_228">1</ref> This, with a supplementary act,
							remained the basis of the relations between Church and State in France down to
								1906.<ref id="ref_229" rend="super" target="note_229">2</ref> Bonaparte did not give
							back the property of the Church of which it had been deprived by the first French
							Assembly in 1789, but he agreed that the government should pay the salaries of the
							bishops and priests whose appointment it controlled. Although the Catholic religion
							was recognized as that of the majority of Frenchmen, the State also helped support the
							Reformed and Lutheran churches and the Jewish religious community.</p>

						<note rend="right">Power of the clergy during the nineteenth century</note>

						<p>From the standpoint of the government this was in many ways an excellent arrangement,
							for it was thus enabled profoundly to influence public opinion through its control
							over the clergy. Consequently, amid all the later political changes, the settlement
							reached by Bonaparte was retained essentially unaltered. Louis XVIII, Charles X, Louis
							Philippe, and Napoleon III had no desire to do away with the Concordat which afforded
							them such great political power.</p>

						<note rend="right">Final separation of Church and State in 1905</note>

						<p>But with the establishment of the republic all this was changed, owing to the strong
							monarchical sympathies of the clergy. There were, moreover, large numbers of Frenchmen
							who, if not actively opposed to the Church, had no interest in religion. To this class
							it seemed absurd that the government should be paying forty million francs a year to
							clergymen for teaching the people what seemed to them nonsense and for stirring up
							hostility to the government. Nevertheless, it was no easy task to put asunder Church
							and State, which had been closely associated with one another from the times of
							Constantine and Theodosius the Great. It was not until December, 1905, that the
							Separation Law was promulgated.</p>

						<note rend="right">Main provisions of the Separation Law</note>

						<p>The main provisions of the new law are relatively simple. It suppresses all
							government appropriations for religious purposes, but provides pensions for clergymen
							of long service and the gradual extinction of the salaries of others. It declares that
							cathedrals, churches, the residences of bishops, and other ecclesiastical buildings
							belong to the government, but shall be placed at the disposal of congregations and
							their pastors free of charge. The management of these edifices and the control of
							other property of the Church are vested in Associations for Religious Worship<ref
								id="ref_230" rend="super" target="note_230">1</ref> (<hi rend="i">associations
								cultuelles</hi>) composed of from seven to twenty-five persons according to the size

							abolished.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Pope and clergy oppose the new law</note>

						<p>It soon became evident that the Pope and a large Catholic party were determined not
							to accept these provisions. Crowds collided with the soldiers sent to guard the
							churches while inventories were being made of the property to be handed over to the
							Associations for Public Worship. In February, 1906, the Pope condemned the entire law
							in a long encyclical letter <note id="note_230"><ref target="ref_230" rend="super"
									>1</ref> These closely resemble the various Church associations, both Catholic and
								Protestant, in the United States, which are, from the standpoint of the law, merely

						<note rend="right">National elections uphold the government</note>

						<p>The clergy, obedient to the commands of the head of the Church, refused to
							countenance the formation of associations, and most of them declined the proffered
							pensions. The nation at large, however, evidently supported the government in its
							plans, for the elections held in May, 1906, returned a large majority of radicals,
							socialists, and progressives committed to the full execution of the law.</p>

						<note rend="right">The government permits the continuance of public worship by a new
							law, December, 1906</note>

						<p>When the year allowed for the formation of the religious associations expired in
							December, 1906, the Church property which had no legal claimants passed into the hands
							of the government. However, the minister of public worship, M. Briand, socialist,
							unwilling to stop religious services, took steps to allow the churches to remain open
							in spite of the failure to comply with the law. At his instigation the French
							parliament passed a very important supplementary measure which provides that buildings
							for public worship and their entire furniture shall remain at the disposal of priests
							and their congregations even if the associations required by the original law are not
							formed.</p>

						<p>In January, 1907, the Pope again denounced the government, which, he declared, was
							confiscating Church property and attempting to destroy Christianity in France; and he
							has not yet been reconciled to the policy of the government. Nevertheless, it is quite
							clear that the republic means to render permanent the separation of Church and State.
							Subsidies to the clergy are no longer provided, although the promised pensions are
							paid to such clergymen as apply for them. In the budget of 1912 only about $50,000 was

						<p>The socialistic party, which figured so prominently in the Revolution of 1848 and the

							France. <pb id="VAB8216-432" n="375"/> The following year a general amnesty was
							granted to all who had been connected with the Commune, and a great labor convention
							was immediately held in Paris, where, under the inspiration of Jules Guesde, the
							doctrines of Karl Marx were accepted as the fundamental principles of French
							socialism.</p>

						<note rend="right">Divisions among the socialists,-- Marxians and possibilists</note>

						<p>Notwithstanding their general agreement as to their ends, the French socialists have
							from the very first been divided over the question of the best methods of attaining
							their aims. Broadly speaking, there have been two groups, each with varying shades of
							opinion. In the first place there are the Marxians,-- who are in general strongly
							opposed to voting for candidates of other parties, though willing to wring concessions
							from them in the Chamber of Deputies,-- who expect socialism to be ushered in by a
							crisis in which the workingmen will seize the supreme power and use it for their own
							benefit, as the middle class did in the previous revolutions. The second, and more
							numerous, socialist group goes by the name of the "possibilists," because they do not
							believe that socialistic ideas can be carried into effect as the result of a violent
							revolution, but hope to see them realized by a gradual process in which the government
							will assume control and ownership of one industry after another.</p>

						<note rend="right">The socialists become a political factor</note>

						<p>The various socialistic factions, numbering six or seven at times, united at the
							general election in 1893, and by remarkable energy succeeded in returning about fifty
							members to the Chamber of Deputies, thus inaugurating a new era in French politics.
							The socialist vote steadily increased until in 1899 the prime minister,
							Waldeck-Rousseau, was forced to accept a socialist, M. Millerand, as Minister of
							Commerce in order to control enough votes in the chamber to carry on the government.
							Since then the possibilists have from time to time been represented in the cabinet,
							and they have worked for their ends by combining with other parties.<ref id="ref_232"

						<note rend="right">Contrast between the French parties and those in England and the
							United States</note>

						<p>In England and the United States there are two great parties, one of which is
							ordinarily in unmistakable control. In France there are so many parties that no single
							one can ever long command a majority of votes in the Chamber of Deputies. As a result
							measures cannot be carried simply because the leaders of one party agree on them, but
							they must appeal to a number of groups on their own merits. Minorities, consequently,
							have an opportunity to influence legislation in France, and there is little chance for
							machine politics to develop. It is true that French ministries rise and fall at very
							short intervals, but nevertheless the laws which do pass receive more careful
							attention, perhaps, than they would if pushed through as party measures.<ref

						<note rend="right">"Interpellations"</note>

						<p>The opponents of a ministry in the Chamber of Deputies take advantage of the
							privilege of asking the ministers questions in regard to their policy and thus force
							them to explain their motives. When a deputy formally announces that he is going to
							"interpellate" the ministers, he must be given an opportunity to do so within a
							certain period at a regular session of the Chamber. These "interpellations" are more
							common in France than elsewhere, but are not unknown in other governments.</p>

							French government frankly committed itself to a policy of imperialism.</p>

						<note rend="right">The French annex Algeria</note>

						<p>While the National Assembly was deliberating on the form of government at home, a
							revolt in Algeria, which had been seized in 1830, forced France to formulate a
							colonial policy. This insurrection was not put down until more than two hundred
							battles and skirmishes had been fought. The great province of Algeria is only slightly
							smaller than France itself, and has a population of over five millions, of whom only
							about eight hundred thousand are of European origin.<ref id="ref_234" rend="super"
								target="note_234">1</ref> To the east of Algeria lies the province of Tunis,
							equaling in area the state of New York and having a population akin to that of Algeria
							in race and religion. Tunisian tribes were accused by the French of disturbing the
							peace of the Algerian border, and in 1881 France dispatched troops into Tunis. After
							some serious fighting the province was occupied and the Bey was virtually forced to
							surrender the administration of his possessions to the French government, in whose
							hands it remains.</p>

						<note rend="right">The French in Senegal</note>

						<p>While these enterprises were bringing northern Africa under French dominion, a series
							of daring explorations and conquests in western and central Africa were adding vast
							regions and millions of African natives to the French colonial domain. France had
							taken formal possession of the province of Senegal on the west coast as early as 1637,
							but no serious efforts to extend her control inland were made until the annexation of
							Algeria called attention to the possibility of joining the two provinces. After the
							middle of the nineteenth century steady pressure inland began and Timbuktu was
							conquered in 1894.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Fashoda incident</note>

						<p>Four years later Marchand, a French explorer, pressed eastward across the desert and

							<pb id="VAB8216-435" n="378"/> English. An English force, however, compelled Marchand
							to lower the flag, and for a time it looked as if the two countries might come to
							blows. Fortunately, however, the French withdrew, and the two nations arranged the
							disputed boundaries between them, thus closing the "Fashoda incident," as it was
							called.</p>

						<note rend="right">French Congo</note>

						<p>A post on the equator at the mouth of the Gabun River, bought in 1839, became the
							base for celebrated expeditions headed by du Chaillu and de Brazza, which added a vast
							region north of the Congo River more than twice the size of France and now known as
							French Congo.<ref id="ref_235" rend="super" target="note_235">1</ref> The vast extent

							were preparing the way for the annexation of the island of Madagascar. Using as a
							pretext the murder of some French citizens by the natives, the French waged war on the
							ruler of Madagascar (1882-1885), and succeeded in establishing a protectorate over the
							entire island. Later they accused Queen Ranavalona III of bad faith and of inability
							to suppress brigandage. A second war which broke out in 1895 ended in the deposition
							and expulsion of the queen.</p>

						<note rend="right">Advance of France in Asia</note>

						<p>The Third Republic also has extensive colonial dominions in Asia, where French

							indemnity and the cession of a small portion of his territory. The foothold thus
							obtained formed the basis for rapid expansion in every direction; a protectorate was
							extended over the kingdom of Cambodia in 1864; and in 1867 Cochin China was entirely
							annexed. An attempt in 1873 to force the opening to navigation of the Red River in
							Tonkin led to a war with the ruler of that province which resulted in the extension of
							a protectorate over all of Anam, of which Tonkin was a district. This defiance of the
							Chinese emperor's claims at length stirred him to resistance; but the war of 1884
							which resulted cost him all his rights over Tonkin and the remainder of Anam. In 1893
							France extended her authority over the territory of Laos to the south. The French
							possessions are thus in close contact with the provinces of southern China into which
							French influence is already penetrating in the form of railways and mining
							concessions. France is therefore deeply involved in the rivalry of the powers of the
							world in the Far East, among which the United States must now be reckoned on account
							of its possession of the Philippine Islands lying just eastward from the coast of
							French Indo-China.</p>

						<note rend="right">Backwardness of England at the opening of the nineteenth
							century</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">65.</hi> In the eighteenth century the English government had been
							extolled by Montesquieu and others as by far the most liberal and enlightened in
							Europe. But the reforms of the French Revolution made England appear almost medieval
							in its backwardness. Its Parliament was, after all, only a council of wealthy
							landlords and nobles who often gained their seats by bribery and could not be said to
							represent the nation, which had, indeed, little to do with their election. The English
							law was still shockingly brutal; citizens who did not comply with certain rites of the
							Established Church were excluded from office; and education was far from the reach of
							the masses. When the downfall of Napoleon left the English free to turn their
							attention to the problems which faced them at home, they were forced to undertake a
							thorough modernization of their institutions almost as radical as that which was being
							effected with more turmoil on the continent.<ref id="ref_237" rend="super"
								target="note_237">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Origin of the "rotten boroughs"</note>

						<p>The leading issue was the reform of Parliament,-- a matter which had begun to attract
							the attention of English liberals before the opening of the French Revolution. It is a
							cardinal principle of modern democratic government that at least one <note
								id="note_237"><ref target="ref_237" rend="super">1</ref> The important reforms which
								England carried through during the nineteenth century with little bloodshed or
								disorder are sometimes cited as showing the superior political genius of the
								English. It should be remembered, however, that the supremacy of the Parliament over
								the king had only been established after a bloody civil war, the execution of one
								king, and the expulsion of another. Louis XIV's minister, Torcy, regarded the
								English of his time as fickle and incompetent in governmental matters.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-439" n="382"/> of the houses in the legislative body shall be made up
							of representatives of the people, fairly apportioned among the various election
							districts. In England, however, such towns as had in earlier times been summoned by
							the king to send their two representatives each to Parliament, continued to do so at
							the opening of the nineteenth century, regardless of the number of their inhabitants,
							and no new boroughs had been added to the list since the reign of Charles II. Mere
							villages had grown into great cities, and the newer towns which had developed under
							the influence of the Industrial Revolution, like Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds,
							had no representatives at all. On the other hand, Dunwich, which had been buried under
							the waters of the North Sea for two centuries, was duly represented, as well as the
							famous borough of Old Sarum, which was only a green mound where a town had once stood.
							Moreover it was not only in the towns that representation was wholly unequal. The
							county of Cornwall, with a population of a quarter of a million, had forty-four
							representatives, while all Scotland, with eight times that population, was entitled to
							only one more member.</p>

						<note rend="right">Few persons permitted to vote</note>

						<p>A second cardinal principle of modern democracy was violated by the restrictions on
							the right to vote. In the towns there was no uniform rule. In some boroughs all
							taxpayers had the right to take part in elections, but in one of these-- Gatton--
							there were only seven voters. In other boroughs the right of choosing the members of
							Parliament was exercised by the mayor and town council, who were often not elected by
							the people at all.</p>

						<note rend="right">Many seats controlled by members of the House of Lords</note>

						<p>Many of the boroughs were owned outright by members of the House of Lords or others,
							who easily forced the few voters to choose any candidate they proposed. The duke of
							Norfolk chose eleven members of the House of Commons, Lord Lonsdall, nine, and Lord
							Darlington, seven; while other peers had one or more representatives in the Commons.
							In 1828 the duke of Newcastle evicted over five hundred of his tenants because they
							refused to vote for his candidate, and when this led to a protest <pb id="VAB8216-440"
								n="383"/> in Parliament he replied, "Have I not a right to do as I like with my
							own?" Some of the lords sold the seats they controlled to the highest bidders.</p>

						<note rend="right">Situation in the country districts</note>

						<p>In the country districts matters were no better. It is true that every person owning
							land which brought in forty shillings a year was permitted to vote for members of
							Parliament, but the disappearance of most of the small farmers had reduced the voters
							to the few who owned large estates. In the Scottish county of Bute, with its
							population of fourteen thousand inhabitants, there were twenty-one voters, of whom all
							but one were nonresidents. In 1831 the Lord Advocate declared: "At an election in
							Bute, not beyond the memory of man, only one person attended the meeting except the
							sheriff and the returning officer. He, of course, took the chair, constituted the
							meeting, called over the roll of freeholders, answered to -his own name, took the
							vote, and elected himself."</p>

						<note rend="right">Prevalence of bribery</note>

						<p>Bribery was prevalent and was fostered by the system of public balloting.<ref
								id="ref_238" rend="super" target="note_238">1</ref> By long-established custom the
							price of a vote at Hull was two guineas (something over ten dollars), at Stafford,
							seven.</p>

						<note rend="right">England really governed by an oligarchy</note>

						<p>Thus, through the gross inequalities in apportioning the members, the curious methods
							of balloting, open bribery, and ownership of boroughs, the House of Commons was
							ordinarily under the control of a comparatively few men. It was alleged in 1792 that
							one hundred and fifty-four patrons, forty of whom were peers, returned a majority of
							the house. A very cautious scholar of our own day estimates that not more than one
							third of the representatives in the House of Commons were fairly chosen.</p>

						<note rend="right">Proposals for reform before the nineteenth century</note>

						<p>The whole system was so obviously preposterous that it is not surprising that
							objections to it had long been common. As early as the middle of the eighteenth
							century the abuses were severely attacked, and during the democratic agitation which
							preceded and accompanied the French Revolution several attempts were made to induce
							Parliament to reform itself. The elder Pitt <note id="note_238"><hi rend="center"><ref
										target="ref_238" rend="super">1</ref> Secret ballot was not established until
									1872.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-441" n="384"/> (Lord Chatham), in 1770, and later his distinguished
							son, the younger Pitt, proposed changes which were, however, successfully opposed by
							those who were well content with the existing system.</p>

						<note rend="right">The French revolution puts an end for a time to hopes of reform in
							England</note>

						<p>The excesses of the French Convention during the Reign of Terror put an end to all
							hope of reform for some time. Even the more cool-headed and progressive among the
							English states men were discouraged by the apparently disastrous results in France of
							permitting the people at large to vote. Burke wrote a furious attack upon the
							Revolution, and the English government adopted harsh measures to prevent all agitation
							for reform.</p>

						<note rend="right">The "Peterloo massacre," 1819</note>

						<p>After the overthrow of Napoleon, orators, writers, and agitators redoubled their
							efforts to arouse the working classes to action. Hampden clubs were founded to
							propagate reform doctrines, and monster demonstrations and parades were organized to
							prove to the government the strength of the popular feeling. At one of these meetings
							in Manchester in 1819, the police and soldiers charged the populace without
							provocation and killed and wounded a large number.<ref id="ref_239" rend="super"
								target="note_239">1</ref> The government followed this up by a series of laws known
							as the Six Acts, which restricted the rights of free press, free speech, and public
							meeting.</p>

						<note rend="right">Merchants and manufacturers begin to urge reform</note>

						<p>This attempt at repression proved unavailing, for it was not only the working classes
							but the rich and powerful merchants and manufacturers as well who demanded the
							revision of a system which excluded them from political power. Under the leadership of
							Lord John Russell parliamentary reform was again and again urged in the Commons. The
							revolution of 1830 in France added impetus to the agitation in England, and that
							stanch Tory, the duke of Wellington, was led to resign his premiership under pressure
							of a growing public opinion that seemed verging on open violence.</p>

						<note rend="right">The passage of the Reform Bill of 1832</note>

						<p>A new ministry was organized, and in March, 1831, Lord John Russell introduced a
							reform bill into the House of <note id="note_239"><ref target="ref_239" rend="super"
									>1</ref> This assault, known as the "Peterloo massacre," occurred in St. Peter's
								Field, then on the outskirts, but now in the heart of Manchester.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-442" n="385"/> Commons.<ref id="ref_240" rend="super"
								target="note_240">1</ref> The violent opposition which the measure encountered at
							the outset led to a dissolution of Parliament and to a general election. The result
							was a triumph for the reform party, which then carried the bill through the Commons by
							a substantial majority. It was, however, rejected by the House of Lords. The Commons
							then replied by passing another bill of the same character as the first, and the
							country awaited with breathless anxiety the action of the peers. Finally, King William
							IV granted permission to the prime minister "to create such a number of peers as will
							insure the passage of the reform bill." The lords, realizing that further opposition
							was useless, gave way, and in June, 1832, the long-debated bill became a law.</p>

						<note rend="right">Provisions of the Reform Bill of 1832</note>

						<p>According to its provisions fifty-six "rotten boroughs," each containing less than
							two thousand inhabitants, were entirely deprived of representation; thirty-two more,
							with less than four thousand inhabitants, lost one member each; and forty-three new
							boroughs were created with one or two members each, according to their respective
							populations. The counties were divided into election districts and assigned a
							representation corresponding more nearly than heretofore with the number of their
							inhabitants. The suffrage was given in the towns to all citizens who owned or rented
							houses worth ten pounds a year, and to <hi rend="i">renters</hi> as well as <hi
								rend="i">owners</hi> of lands of a certain value in the country. In this way the
							shopkeepers and manufacturers and some of the more prosperous people in the country
							were given the right to vote, but nearly all workingmen and agricultural laborers were
							still excluded from the franchise.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Reform Bill of 1832 far from a democratic measure</note>

						<p>The great Reform Bill of 1832 was therefore not really a triumph for democracy. It
							was estimated from official returns in 1836 that out of a total number of 6,023,752
							adult males there were only 839,519 voters. The thousands whose parades and
							demonstrations had frightened the duke of Wellington and <note id="note_240"><ref
									target="ref_240" rend="super">1</ref> For Lord John Russell's speech on
								parliamentary reform, see <hi rend="i">Readings</hi>, Vol. II, pp. 239 <hi rend="i"
									>sqq.</hi> A speech in opposition is printed on pp. 242 <hi rend="i"
								>sqq.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-443" n="386"/> the king into yielding were naturally dissatisfied with
							the outcome. The fact that those who came into power under the new bill showed little
							inclination to relieve the condition of the working classes, whose wages were pitiably
							low and whose homes were miserable hovels, added bitterness to their
							disappointment.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Chartist movement</note>

						<p>The Reform Bill had scarcely been signed before a veritable flood of pamphlet
							literature appeared, proposing more radical measures.<ref id="ref_241" rend="super"
								target="note_241">1</ref> Translations of Magna Carta and reprints of the Bill of
							Rights and the acts of the Long Parliament abolishing the House of Lords and the
							kingship were circulated as leaflets among the working classes. The reformers at last
							agreed on pressing six demands, which they embodied in a charter; to wit, universal
							suffrage, vote by secret ballot, annual parliaments, payment of members 'of
							Parliament, abolition of property qualifications for members of Parliament, and equal
							electoral districts. This charter soon won thousands of adherents to whom the name of
							"Chartists" was given. Local Chartist clubs were founded in every manufacturing town,
							and in 1840 a national Charter Association was organized for the purpose of federating
							the various clubs. Leaders of remarkable oratorical ability sprang into prominence;
							papers were established; Chartist songs and poems were composed, and national
							conventions assembled. Great meetings and parades were held all over England; the
							charter was transformed into a petition to which it was claimed that over a million
							signatures were obtained. This petition was presented to Parliament in 1839 only to be
							rejected by a large vote.<ref id="ref_242" rend="super" target="note_242">2</ref></p>

						<note id="note_241"><ref target="ref_241" rend="super">1</ref> For extracts from
							contemporary pamphlets on the extension of the suffrage, see <hi rend="i"
								>Readings</hi>, Vol. II, pp. 245 <hi rend="i">sqq.</hi></note>

						<note id="note_242"><ref target="ref_242" rend="super">2</ref> The Chartists were
							violently attacked by the opponents of their democratic proposals, which seem harmless
							enough to-day. In 1840 the Reverend E. Jenkins issued a book called Chartism Unmasked,
							in which he made the following observations: "What would you gain by universal
							suffrage? I am certain that you would gain nothing but universal confusion, universal
							setting of workmen against each other. .. . All workmen would then become politicians-
							they would neglect their vocations in life - spend their time, their strength their
							talents in what would increase their poverty. Vote by ballot would be nothing but a
							law for rogues and knaves, nothing but a cloak for dishonesty, insincerity, hypocrisy
							and lies. ... With respect to having members of Parliament paid and void of property
							qualifications -really this is too absurd for an idiot to be the author of it. ... The
							famous Chartist doctrine of Equality is diametrically opposed to Nature and the word
							of God; it is a doctrine taught only by lying prophets-- men who are of their father
							the Devil, for his works they do."</note>

						<note rend="right">Some of the Chartists advocate violence</note>

						<p>Despairing of securing reforms by peaceful means, many of the leaders began openly to
							advocate revolutionary violence, and rioting spread to such an extent that the
							government had to resort to extraordinary police measures to suppress it. Birmingham
							was for a time in the hands of revolutionists, and at Newport in 1839 twenty Chartists
							were shot in an attempt to seize the town and start an insurrection. Though the police
							were successful in quelling these armed uprisings, agitation continued, several
							Chartist members were elected to Parliament, and another petition was submitted to
							that body.</p>

						<note rend="right">Fina Chartist petition of 1848</note>

						<p>The revolution of 1848 in France and the establishment of the Second Republic gave
							the signal for the last great outburst of Chartist enthusiasm. Owing to the hard times
							in that year, thousands of workmen were unemployed, and the poor were roused to bitter
							hatred for a government that replied to demands for reform by police measures.
							Preparations were made to present another gigantic petition to the House of Commons,
							to which it was claimed that six million names had been secured, and the Chartist
							leaders determined to overawe Parliament by a march on London. Though this show of
							force was frustrated by Metternich's friend, the duke of Wellington, then commander of
							the troops policing London, the petition was finally presented to the House of
							Commons. It was there referred to a committee, which reported that there were less
							than two million names and that many of these were evident forgeries, such as
							"Victoria Rex," "the Duke of Wellington," "Pugnose," and "Snooks." The petition was
							thereby greatly discredited, and Parliament refused to take any action on it.
							Chartism, as an organized movement, thereupon collapsed.</p>

						<note rend="right">Gladstone espouses the cause of parliamentary reform in 1866</note>

						<p>The cause of parliamentary reform was not, however, lost with the failure of the
							Chartist movement. The doctrines of democracy had been spread among the people by the
							agitation, and from time to time advocates were found to introduce reform measures in
							the House of Commons. Although these proposals were easily defeated, there was a
							steadily growing recognition that some changes were inevitable, and at length, in
							1866, Gladstone, as leader of the House of Commons, made the question an issue of
							practical politics. Mr. Gladstone was then fifty-seven years old. He had entered
							Parliament as a Tory at the first election after the Reform Bill of 1832, and had
							quickly shown himself a commanding orator and a capable politician. At the end of a
							few years his views on public questions began to change, and at length he broke with
							the conservative traditions of his youth. In a debate on parliamentary reform in 1864
							he maintained that the burden of proof rested on those "who would exclude forty-nine
							fiftieths of the working classes from the franchise." The very next year the veteran
							reformer of 1832, Lord Russell, now elevated to the peerage, was called upon to form a
							new ministry, and he selected Gladstone as leader of the lower house.</p>

						<note rend="right">Disraeli succeeds Gladstone as leader of the House of Commons</note>

						<p>At the opening of Parliament in 1866 Gladstone proposed a moderate extension of the

							go far enough. Consequently the cabinet felt compelled to resign, and a Conservative
							ministry was formed under the leadership of Lord Derby, who was represented in the
							House of Commons by Benjamin Disraeli (afterwards created Lord Beaconsfield), one of
							the most striking figures in the political life of England during the nineteenth

						<note rend="right">Parliament really controls the English government</note>

						<p>There was a time, of course, when the highest prerogatives were really exercised by
							the king of England. Henry VIII, for example, appointed his own ministers and
							dismissed them at will. He made war and peace at his pleasure, and exercised such an
							influence on the elections that Parliament was filled with his supporters. The long
							struggle, however, between the king and the Parliament in the seventeenth century, and

								xxiv.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-450" n="391"/> element in the English government. The king is still
							legally empowered to veto any bill passed by Parliament, but he never exercises this
							power. He has in reality only the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and
							the right to warn. He cannot permanently oppose the wishes of the majority in
							Parliament, for should he venture to do so, he could always be brought to terms by
							cutting off the appropriations necessary to conduct his government.</p>

						<note rend="right">The cabinet</note>

						<p>The king of England must now act through a ministry composed of the important
							officers of the government, such as the first lord of the treasury, the foreign
							secretary, the colonial secretary, the secretary of the war department, with the prime
							minister as their head.<ref id="ref_247" rend="super" target="note_247">1</ref> The
							development of this ministry, which is known as the cabinet, has been described in an
							earlier chapter.<ref id="ref_248" rend="super" target="note_248">2</ref> It was pretty
							firmly established under George I and George II, who were glad to let others manage
							the government for them. While the king nominally appoints the members of the cabinet,
							that body is in reality a committee selected from the party which has a majority in
							the House of Commons. The reasons for this were also explained earlier in dealing with
							the English government in the eighteenth century and need not be repeated here.</p>

						<note rend="right">How the members of the cabinet are chosen</note>

						<p>The party which secures the majority in a parliamentary election is entitled to place
							its members in all the important government offices. The party leaders hold an
							informal caucus and agree on a prime minister, who then takes one of the cabinet
							offices. After the party has chosen its leader he is appointed to some high office
							(acceptable to him as prime minister) by the king, who charges him with the task of
							naming, with the advice of his political associates, the other occupants of cabinet
							positions, who may be selected from among the lords as well as the commons, or from
							among distinguished men outside of Parliament. Thus it comes about that, unlike <note

							must communicate with Congress through messages, reports, or other indirect means, the
							prime minister and the heads of departments in England themselves sit in Parliament
							and can therefore present and defend their own proposals.</p>

						<note rend="right">The cabinet acts as a unit</note>

						<p>The body of officials so constituted draft the more important measures to be laid
							before Parliament and decide on the foreign and domestic policy to be pursued by the
							government. At the opening of each session of Parliament the general programme of the
							cabinet is laid before the House of Lords and the House of Commons in the form of the
							"king's speech," which is read by the sovereign or his representative. In its secret
							sessions the head of each department presents to the cabinet the measures which he
							recommends in his particular branch of the government. If, after discussion, these are
							approved by a majority of the other members, they are submitted to the House of
							Commons. In all matters the cabinet acts as a unit, and whenever a member cannot agree
							with the majority on an important point he is bound to resign. The cabinet, therefore,
							presents a united front to Parliament and the country. An interesting illustration of
							this is to be found in the story told of Lord Melbourne when prime minister. His
							cabinet was divided on the question of the duty on grain, and with his back against
							the door, he declared to them: "Now, is it to lower the price of corn, or is n't it?
							It does not matter much what we say, but mind, we must all say the same thing."</p>

						<note rend="right">How ministries rise and fall</note>

						<p>Whenever the House of Commons expresses its disapproval of the policy of the
							ministry, either by defeating an important measure or by a direct vote of censure, the
							cabinet is bound to do one of two things. It may resign in a body and thus give way to
							a new ministry made up from the opposite party. If, however, the ministers feel that
							their policy has popular support outside of Parliament, they may "go to the country";
							that is to say, they may ask the king to dissolve the existing Parliament and order a
							new election in the hope that <pb id="VAB8216-452" n="393"/> the people may indicate
							its approval of their policy by electing their supporters. The further action of the
							ministry is then determined by the outcome of the election. The return of a majority
							of members in favor of the ministerial policy is taken as justification for retaining
							office. On the other hand, a failure to gain a majority is the signal for the
							resignation of the entire ministry and the transference of power to their
							opponents.</p>

						<note rend="right">The English government more under the influence of public opinion
							than that of the United States</note>

						<p>As the members of the House of Commons are not elected for a definite term of years
							(though according to law elections must be held at least every five years), that body
							may be dissolved at any time for the purpose of securing an expression of the popular
							will on any important issue. It is thus clear that the British government is more
							sensitive to public opinion than are governments where the members of the legislatures
							are chosen for a definite term of years. For example, in the United States,
							Congressmen are elected for two years and Senators for six; consequently when a crisis
							arises it usually has to be settled by men who were not chosen according to their
							views on that particular question, while in England a new election can be held with
							direct reference to the special issue at hand.</p>

						<note rend="right">The House of Lords</note>

						<p>Nevertheless, the reader will naturally ask, how is it that the British government
							can be so democratic and yet retain, in its upper house, a body of hereditary peers
							responsible to no constituents? The explanation is that the House of Commons, by
							reason of its ancient and exclusive right of initiating all money bills, can control
							the king and force him, if necessary, to create enough new peers to pass any measure
							blocked by the House of Lords. In practice the king does not have to do more than
							threaten such a measure to bring the House of Lords to terms.</p>

						<note rend="right">Unpopularity of the House of Lords</note>

						<p>Although many bills have been defeated in the House of Lords during the nineteenth
							century, a sort of constitutional understanding has grown up that the upper house must
							yield to an unmistakable and definite expression of public opinion <pb
								id="VAB8216-453" n="394"/> in favor of a measure which it has previously opposed.
							However, the House of Lords is increasingly unpopular with a large class in England.
							Its members for the most part take little or no interest in their duties and rarely
							attend the sessions. The opposition of the peers to the educational bill introduced in
							1906, and also to the budget of i909, again raised the question of the abolition or
							complete reorganization of the upper house, and a compromise was reached in the
							Parliament Act of 1911 by which, under certain circumstances, the House of Commons may
							force a bill through in spite of the Lords.<ref id="ref_249" rend="super"

						<note rend="right">English political parties</note>

						<p>The smooth working of the English cabinet system may be partially attributed to the
							fact that during the nineteenth century there were only two political parties
							represented in Parliament,-- the Conservatives, who dropped the name Tory after the
							first parliamentary reform, and the Liberals, who abandoned the name of Whig about the
							same time. The leaders of the former party came principally from the aristocracy and
							landed proprietors, while the latter found its chiefs among the middle classes. These
							two parties were alternately in power, and it was not until 1906 that their joint
							monopoly of politics was threatened by the election of over fifty labor members, some
							of whom are organized into a solid group acting independently. The Irish party, of
							course, stands firmly for home rule but is willing to cooperate with other parties,
							especially the Liberals, to obtain its ends. At the present juncture it appears
							possible that England may develop a many-party system comparable to that existing in
							the countries of the Continent.</p>

						<note rend="right">Taxes on newspapers and other publications</note>

						<p>Freedom of the press from governmental censorship is commonly regarded as having been
							established in 1695 by the refusal of Parliament to renew an old law providing for
							such control. However, in times of disturbance the government adopted repressive
							measures, as, for instance, during the French Revolution and in 1819, when there was
							extensive popular agitation. Moreover the stamp duties on newspapers and
							advertisements hampered the publication of cheap journals for the diffusion of
							political information among the masses and were systematically used by the government
							for this purpose. In 1819 the tax was extended even to leaflets and tracts which had
							hitherto been allowed free circulation. The necessity of paying an eight-cent tax on
							each copy made the average price of a newspaper fourteen cents, while the price of the
							London <hi rend="i">Times</hi> was eighteen cents. In addition to these stamp duties
							there was a special tax on paper, which increased its cost about fifty per cent.</p>

						<note rend="right">Taxes on the press</note>

						<p>These "taxes on knowledge," as they were called, were attacked by those who advocated
							popular education, and by the political reformers who wanted cheap newspapers through
							which to carry on agitation.<ref id="ref_250" rend="super" target="note_250">1</ref>
							Some opponents of the stamp tax openly violated the law, but the more moderate wing
							set about securing a repeal of the obnoxious taxes by Parliament. At length, in 1833
							the tax on advertisements, and in 1836 the stamp taxes, were reduced, bringing the
							price of most London papers down to ten cents. Twenty years later these taxes were
							swept away altogether, and in 1861 the duty on printing paper was removed, and thus
							England secured a free press. The government, however, does not give low postal rates
							to the newspapers as in the United States.</p>

						<note rend="right">Freedom of the press</note>

						<p>No less important to democracy than freedom of the press is the right to hold public
							meetings and to criticise the government. In common with other European monarchies,
							England, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, imprisoned, and otherwise
							severely punished, those who spoke disrespectfully of the king and Parliament. During
							the eighteenth century, particularly in the period of the French Revolution, the
							English government severely stamped out all open criticism, and again in 1819, owing
							to the violent agitation for parliamentary reform, police surveillance was established
							over public meetings and the press. At length, however, the government, finding its
							efforts futile, gave up altogether attempts to silence the press. Thus by the middle
							of the century freedom of speech was established, and now any one may write or say
							anything "which a jury consisting of twelve shopkeepers think it expedient should be
							said or written."</p>

						<note rend="right">Religious liberty</note>

						<p>It was natural that, in the midst of this general movement for political liberty and
							freedom of the press, the Dissenters and Catholics should have put in a claim for the
							abolition of the laws which placed them under many disabilities. The Dissenters,
							although they enjoyed a certain liberty of religious worship, were excluded from
							municipal offices and from all places of trust, civil and military, in the government,
							although, curiously enough, they were not forbidden to sit in Parliament-- a
							disability imposed on Catholics in addition to exclusion from public offices. The
							rapid increase of the dissenting sects in wealth, numbers, and influence, especially
							after the appearance of the Methodists, at last forced Parliament to respect their
							demand, and in 1828 the old laws against them were repealed, and they were admitted
							freely to public offices on condition that they would take an oath "upon the true
							faith of a Christian" not to use their influence to injure or weaken the Established
							Church. The following year the Catholics secured the passage of the famous
							Emancipation Act, which admitted them to both houses of Parliament and to practically
							all municipal and government <pb id="VAB8216-456" n="397"/> offices, upon condition
							that they would take an oath renouncing the temporal supremacy of the Pope and
							disclaiming any intention of injuring the Protestant religion.<ref id="ref_251"
								rend="super" target="note_251">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Religion and the schools</note>

						<p>These reforms by no means took religious controversies out of politics in England,
							for the religious sects are still at war over the question as to who shall control the
							schools. Anglicans, Catholics, and Dissenters during the nineteenth century built
							schoolhouses and maintained schools of their own, and when the demand for free popular
							education became so strong that in 1870 the government provided for the erection and
							equipment of schools at public expense, religious bodies began to contend among
							themselves for a representation on the school boards having charge of the government
							schools. All of the sects agreed that education without religious instruction was bad,
							but they differed hotly on the particular kind of religious instruction that should be
							given. The problem of how to satisfy the demands of the several bitterly contending
							sects constitutes one of the main issues of English politics at the present time.
							Nevertheless, the efficiency of the schools has steadily increased, and there has been
							a corresponding decline in illiteracy. In 1843 thirty-two per cent of the men and
							forty-nine per cent of the women had to sign their names in the marriage registers
							with a cross. In 1903 only two per cent of the men and three per cent of the women
							were unable to write their own names in the registers.</p>

						<note rend="right">The brutal criminal law</note>

						<p>While some reformers were busy with securing freedom of the press and removing
							religious disabilities, others were attacking the brutal criminal law, which, at the

							for stealing a trifling article, the judge declaring that he wanted to make an example
							of her; and some years later a boy nine years old was sentenced to death for breaking
							a window and stealing four cents' worth of paint from a shop. It is estimated that
							between 1810 and 1845 there were fourteen hundred executions for acts which were not
							regarded as capital offenses after the latter date. The treatment of the prisoners in
							the overcrowded jails, where young and old, hardened criminals and little children,
							and men and women were crowded together, was so atrocious as to be well-nigh
							indescribable.</p>

						<note rend="right">Reform of the criminal law</note>

						<p>It required many years of agitation, however, to move the British Parliament, and it
							was only by the gradual process of abolishing one death sentence after another that
							the long list of capital offenses was at last reduced to three in 1861. For example,
							the act making it a capital offense to steal five shillings or more from a shop was
							repealed in 1820; and in 1823 transportation to a penal colony was substituted for the
							death penalty in cases of making false entries in marriage registers. In 1835, after a
							parliamentary investigation had revealed the horrible conditions of prisons, a law was
							passed providing for government inspection and the improvement of their
							administration, and this marked the beginning of prison reform, which includes
							sanitary buildings, separation of the sexes and of the hardened criminals from the
							younger offenders, and a more enlightened treatment of criminals generally, with a
							view to reform them and protect society rather than to wreak vengeance upon them.</p>

						<note rend="right">Horrors of child labor</note>

						<p>The introduction of steam-driven machinery had made possible the use of child labor

							the manufacturers, brought thousands of other children into industrial life.
							Parliamentary reports tell us of children under five years of age working in the
							mines, of coal drawers but little older crawling on hands and knees through narrow
							subterranean passages, dragging heavy carts of coal, and of mere lads laboring in pin
							mills at high tension for twelve hours a day.</p>

						<note rend="right">General misery of the factory hands and operatives in the
							mines</note>

						<p>The conditions of adult labor, save in the most skilled classes, were almost as
							wretched as those of child labor. Women and girls were employed in great numbers in
							mills and even in the dark and dangerous recesses of the mines, which were badly
							ventilated and perilous to work in; dangerous machinery was not properly safeguarded,
							and the working time was excessively prolonged. The misery of the poor is reflected in
							Mrs. Browning's poem, "The Cry of the Children," in the bitter scorn which Carlyle
							poured out on the heads of the factory owners, in the impassioned pages of Kingsley's
								<hi rend="i">Alton Locke</hi>, and in the vivid word pictures of Dickens.</p>

						<note rend="right">Opposition of economists and statesmen to factory legislation</note>

						<p>The working classes were excluded from representation in Parliament, they were denied
							opportunities for education, and the statesmen of the time refused to take action in
							their behalf until after long and violent agitation. In this refusal Parliament was
							supported by the economic theorists,-- Malthus, Ricardo, and others,-- who defended
							the rights of mill owners as Bossuet had defended the divine right of kings.</p>

						<note rend="right">Parliament at last begins to adopt reforms</note>

						<p>Ardent reformers disregarding the advice of the theorists, and discontented workmen
							filling the country with riot, at last forced Parliament to undertake to improve
							conditions. Indeed, the bad ventilation, scanty food, long hours, and lack of
							sanitation led to the spread of epidemics in the factory districts, and action could
							not longer be delayed without endangering the health of the well-to-do. Parliament,
							however, at first refused to do more than assume some responsibility for the pauper
							apprentices, by passing an act (1802) reducing the hours of labor for such children to
							seventy-two per week, and making some other regulations on their behalf, such as
							compelling employers to furnish at least one suit of clothes a year.</p>

						<note rend="right">Robert Owen</note>

						<p>An unselfish champion of the working class now appeared in the person of Robert Owen,
							a successful manufacturer, who had shown by experiments the advantages of treating
							employees with consideration. Beginning in 1815, he labored for four years to secure
							the passage of an effective measure in the interests of children. His appeal to the
							manufacturers for support of his factory legislation was, however, unavailing, and the
							outcome of his efforts was the mutilation of his original bill beyond recognition in
							an act of 1819, which merely forbade the employment in the cotton mills of children
							under nine, and limited the working time for those between nine and sixteen to twelve
							hours per day.</p>

						<note rend="right">The report of the factory commission appointed by Parliament in
							1832</note>

						<p>New advocates of factory reform continued to urge additional measures on Parliament.
							Among these were Richard Oastler, Thomas Sadler, John Fielden, and Lord Ashley, to
							whose unselfish and untiring labors was largely due the 'creation of the <pb
								id="VAB8216-460" n="401"/> public opinion which induced Parliament in 1832 to
							appoint a select commission for the purpose of investigating the whole question of
							factory legislation. The following year it made an unqualified report in favor of
							interference on behalf of children employed in factories, which resulted in a new bill
							still further reducing the working hours for children and providing for the first time
							for regular factory inspectors. In 1842 Lord Ashley carried through Parliament a
							mining law which forbade the employment of women and children in underground
							occupations.</p>

						<note rend="right">Agitation for a ten-hour day for women and children</note>

						<p>These laws did not satisfy the reformers, and they now began to work for another
							measure, restricting the labor of women and children in mills to ten hours per day
							exclusive of meal times. This proposition gave rise to a heated contest in the House
							of Commons between manufacturers and landed proprietors. In vain did John Bright
							(champion of the abolition of slavery in the United States) denounce the proposition
							as " most injurious and destructive to the best interests of the country," "a delusion
							practiced upon the working classes," and "one of the worst measures ever passed."<ref

						<note rend="right">John Morley's description of England's measure for protecting the

						<p>With this great victory for the reformers the general resistance to state

							than any other European country to protect the factory operatives. In the language of

							special provisions are made for bake houses, for lacemaking, for collieries, and for a
							whole schedule of other special callings; for the due enforcement and vigilant

							that of the woman who plaits straw at her cottage door to the miner who descends into
							the bowels of the earth, and the seaman who conveys the fruits and materials of
							universal industry to and fro between the remotest parts of the globe." Important as
							are the measures thus summarized, far more revolutionary legislation for the working
							class has been enacted during the last decade than during the entire nineteenth
								century.<ref id="ref_256" rend="super" target="note_256">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Policy of protection in England before the nineteenth century</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">68.</hi> From the fourteenth century onward England endeavored, by high
							tariffs, navigation laws, and numerous other measures, to protect her manufacturers,
							farmers, and ship owners against foreign competition. Special tariffs were imposed on
							the manufactured goods of other countries; bounties were paid from the government
							treasury to encourage various forms of commercial enterprise; Englishmen were obliged
							to import their goods from the colonies in English ships, no matter how much cheaper
							they could get them carried by Dutch merchantmen; and high duties were imposed on
							grain.</p>

						<note rend="right">Manufacturers demand a repeal of the duties on grain</note>

						<p>Adam Smith and other economists denounced this system of protection and advocated
							free trade. However, the immediate <note id="note_256"><hi rend="center"><ref
										target="ref_256" rend="super">1</ref> See below, chap. xxiv.<ptr targType="pb"
										target="VAB8216-583"/>
								</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-462" n="403"/> impetus to the movement for abolishing protective
							duties and opening British markets freely to the products of all nations was given by
							the objections of the owners of the new factories to the tariffs on grain, which, they
							argued, made the bread of their workmen dear and prevented undeveloped countries from
							procuring English manufactures in exchange for their bread-stuffs. They contended, for
							example, that Russians and Americans would be happy to buy English cloth, shoes, and
							cutlery, if they could freely send to England, in return, a portion of their great
							crops of wheat, rye, oats, and barley. Having little fear of foreign competition in
							their industries, and owning no land, they wanted no protection for themselves or the
							farmers.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Corn Laws</note>

						<p>The manufacturers began, therefore, to attack the Corn Laws,<ref id="ref_257"
								rend="super" target="note_257">1</ref> as the tariff acts protecting grain were
							called. The duties on grain had been made especially high after 1815, when the fall of
							the inflated war prices threatened to ruin the farmers. One measure even forbade the
							importation of wheat altogether whenever its price in England was below two dollars
							and a half a bushel, and later acts attempted to keep the price high by a sliding
							scale of duties according to which the tariff varied with the price; that is, when the
							price of wheat rose too high in England, the tariff would be lowered to admit foreign
							grain, but when English prices were low the tariff would be raised to check foreign
							competition and so benefit the farmers.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Anti-Corn Law League, 1838</note>

						<p>To secure the repeal of these duties on grain and to propagate the principles of free
							trade generally, the manufacturers founded in 1838 the Anti-Corn Law League, and for
							almost ten years this organization, under the brilliant leadership of Cobden<ref
								id="ref_258" rend="super" target="note_258">2</ref> and Bright, carried on one of
							the most thoroughgoing campaigns of popular education in the history of democracy,
							expending in one year over a million dollars in publications and meetings. The attack
							was concentrated on the Corn Laws <note id="note_257"><ref target="ref_257"
									rend="super">1</ref> The term "corn," usually confined to Indian corn, or maize,
								in the United States, is commonly used in England to mean grain in general.</note>
							<note id="note_258"><ref target="ref_258" rend="super">2</ref> Some of Cobden's
								arguments against the Corn Laws are given in the <hi rend="i">Readings</hi>, Vol.
								II, pp. 287 <hi rend="i">sqq.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-463" n="404"/> because it was easier to rouse feeling against the
							landlords than in favor of any abstract theories of political economy. It was a war on
							the landed aristocracy.</p>

						<note rend="right">Sir Robert Peel carries the repeal of the Corn Law, 1846, and opens
							the way to free trade</note>

						<p>The agitation was brought to a crisis in 1845 by a failure of crops in England and a
							potato famine in Ireland, which raised the price of food stuffs enormously and brought
							thousands to the verge of starvation, especially in Ireland. In the midst of such
							distress it appeared to thinking men nothing short of criminal to maintain high prices
							of grain by law. Consequently Sir Robert Peel, then prime minister, determined that
							the Corn Laws must go, in spite of the fact that he had hitherto defended them, and in
							1846 he succeeded in carrying through Parliament a law which led to their practical
							repeal. Though compelled to resign immediately after the passage of this bill, Peel
							had given the whole protective system in England its death blow, since it was chiefly
							the tariff on grain that could claim any really active defenders.</p>

						<note rend="right">Free trade established, 1852-1867</note>

						<p>Within ten years all of the old navigation laws were abolished and English ports
							opened freely to the ships of other nations. Gladstone, as Chancellor of the Exchequer
							in 1852, removed the duties on one hundred and twenty-three articles entirely, and
							reduced them on one hundred and thirty-three more. On his return to office, some
							fifteen years later, he made a clean sweep of all <hi rend="i">protective</hi> duties,
							retaining, for revenue purposes, those on tea, wines, cocoa, and a few other
							articles.</p>

						<note rend="right">Tendency toward free trade in Europe followed by a reaction in the
							seventies</note>

						<p>The tendency toward free trade was not confined to England. Indeed, until the
							seventies, it looked as if a network of commercial treaties, combined with low
							tariffs, would carry all Europe into a free-trade policy. The liberals in France under
							Napoleon III favored it, and, as we have seen, Germany had accepted it in a modified
							form until Bismarck's tariff law of 1879. At last, however, a reaction set in. The
							protectionists rose to power in the continental countries; the United States converted
							what was once regarded as a temporary policy of encouraging infant industries and of
							increasing the revenue <pb id="VAB8216-464" n="405"/> during the Civil War into a
							permanent policy of high protection; and foreign competitors, having free access to
							England's markets, began to undersell her at home as well as abroad.</p>

						<note rend="right">Growing dissatisfaction with free trade in England</note>

						<p>This radical change in the economic conditions in the continental countries and the
							United States has convinced many Englishmen that some alteration will have to be made
							in England's free-trade policy. In the election of 1906 Mr. Chamberlain sought to make
							the establishment of some form of a protective tariff the leading campaign issue, and
							although the free traders carried the day, the arguments of the protectionists will
							doubtless continue to be urged with ever greater insistence.</p>

								>UESTION</hi></head>

						<p><hi rend="b">69.</hi> In addition to the important problems the English have had to
							solve at home, they have been constantly involved in perplexities in their dealings
							with the Irish, who belong to the Celtic race and differ essentially from their
							English neighbors in sentiments and traditions. The principal troubles with Ireland
							have been over the land question, the disestablishment of the English Church in
							Ireland, and Home Rule.</p>

						<note rend="right">The land question</note>

						<p>The first of these questions, the land question, grew out of the fact that Ireland
							had been frequently invaded by the English, and Irish estates had been handed over to
							English warriors, fortune hunters, and royal favorites. These invasions dated back to
							the twelfth century, when, under Henry II (1154-1189), certain eastern districts,
							known as the "Pale," were wrested from the Irish. In the sixteenth century, during the
							reign of Queen Elizabeth, a revolt of the Irish led to new conquests and the seizure
							of more estates by the English. Half a century later, when the Puritans were
							quarreling with Charles I, the Irish made another attempt to throw off English rule,
							but they were severely punished by Cromwell, who scourged the country with fire and
							sword and made a new and still more extensive confiscation of their lands. Again,
							during <pb id="VAB8216-465" n="406"/> the troubles of the English Revolution of 1688,
							the Irish were severely punished for taking the part of the Catholic king, James II,
							and were again conquered and more lands were taken from them.</p>

						<p>Now the English landlords, to whom these estates were given, and their descendants,
							for the most part, lived in England. In the nineteenth century millions of pounds
							yearly were drained away from Ireland to pay absentee landlords, who rarely set foot
							in that country and took little or no interest in their tenants beyond the collection
							of their rents. If the tenants did not pay or could not pay, they were speedily
							evicted from their cottages and lands. It was estimated in 1847 that about one third
							of the entire rental of Ireland was paid to absentee landlords.</p>

						<note rend="right">The condition of the peasantry</note>

						<p>Throughout large portions of Ireland the peasants were constantly on the verge of
							starvation. They were deprived of nearly all incentive to work at the improvement of
							their little holdings, because they were liable to be evicted and lose the results of
							their own labors. Whenever there was a failure of the potato crop, on which from one
							third to one half the population depended for food, there were scenes of misery in
							Ireland which defy description. This was the case in the "Black Year of Forty-Seven,"
							when the potato crop failed almost entirely and thousands died of starvation in spite
							of the relief afforded by the government.<ref id="ref_259" rend="super"
								target="note_259">1</ref> It was in the midst of this terrible famine that the
							stream of emigration began to flow toward America. Within half a century four million
							emigrants left the shores of Ireland for other countries, principally the United
							States, taking with them their bitter resentment against England.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Protestant Established Church in Ireland</note>

						<p>The second source of trouble in Ireland was the Established Church. When England
							adopted the Protestant faith an attempt was made to force it upon the Irish, who
							however clung <note id="note_259"><ref target="ref_259" rend="super">1</ref> For
								contemporary accounts of suffering during famines in Ireland, see <hi rend="i"
									>Readings</hi>, Vol. II, pp. 297 <hi rend="i">sqq.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-466" n="407"/> steadfastly to the Pope and their ancient Church. The
							monasteries were suppressed, the monks driven out and their lands seized and handed
							over to Protestants. Catholic clergy were expelled from their parishes and Protestant
							priests installed in their places, to be supported by tithes collected from a people
							still loyal to their old faith. Even in the darkest days of the nineteenth century,
							when Irish peasants were starving, the Established Church in Ireland continued to draw
							its ample revenues from the tithes and endowments, although its members numbered but
							one tenth of the population. These tithes, however, were collected from the peasants
							only with the utmost difficulty and pitched battles were often fought between them and
							the police when the latter undertook to drive off the last cow to pay the dues to the
							hated priest of an alien faith.<ref id="ref_260" rend="super" target="note_260"
								>1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Disestablishment of the English Church</note>

						<p>It is small wonder, therefore, that the Irish were deeply embittered on the religious
							question and began a movement to overthrow the Anglican Church in their midst. By the
							Catholic Emancipation Act, mentioned above, Irish Catholics, along with the English
							Catholics, had been admitted to Parliament, as well as to other public offices; and
							they carried on an agitation which ended in 1869 in the passage of an act by
							Parliament which disestablished the English Church in Ireland and abolished its
								tithes.<ref id="ref_261" rend="super" target="note_261">2</ref> The Anglicans,
							however, were allowed to retain the beautiful buildings which had been seized during
							the period of the Reformation, and the clergy were recompensed for the loss of the
							tithes, which they found it difficult to collect, by a large grant of money from the
							government.</p>

						<p>Although the burden of the tithes was thus removed from the peasants, the evils of
							absentee landlordism were not mitigated; and finding themselves victorious in the
							struggle against the Anglican Church they undertook an agitation for a drastic land
							reform.</p>

							parliamentary reports showing the difficulties of collecting tithes, see <hi rend="i"

						<note rend="right">Parnell and the Land League, 1879</note>

						<p>In 1879 a great Land League, with Charles Stewart Parnell, a member of Parliament, at
							its head, was established with the aim of securing three things for the Irish
							peasant,-- fair rent, fixed holding, and fair sale; that is to say, they asked for
							legislation providing that the rent should not be fixed by the landlord at any amount
							he thought he could get, but by a court taking into consideration the fair value of
							the land; that the tenant should hold as long as he paid the rent so fixed; and
							finally that, in case he surrendered his holding, he should be allowed to sell his
							improvements to the tenant who succeeded him.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Irish land acts, 1881-1903</note>

						<p>Parnell, with the support of the Irish members in Parliament, resorted to
							"filibustering" until that body was forced in 1881 to pass a land act granting these
							three demands. This measure has been supplemented by land-purchase acts by which the
							government puts at the disposal of the tenants money to buy their holdings, with the
							privilege of repayment on the installment plan. One of these acts, passed in 1903
							during the administration of Mr. Balfour, appropriates a practically unlimited amount
							for this purpose, and offers a considerable inducement to landlords to sell, so that
							the land question seems in a fair way to be settled to the satisfaction of the
								peasantry.<ref id="ref_262" rend="super" target="note_262">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Home Rule</note>

						<p>The third source of trouble between England and Ireland has been the contest over
							Home Rule. Until 18oi Ireland had maintained a separate parliament of her own; but in
							that year the English government determined to suppress it, because it enjoyed a
							larger degree of independence than was deemed compatible with the security of English
							rule. The Act of Union of 18oi abolished the Irish parliament and provided that
							Ireland should be represented by one hundred members in the House of Commons and, in
							the House of Lords, by twenty-eight peers chosen by the Irish baronage. This Act of
							Union was really forced upon the Irish by gross bribery of members of their <note
								id="note_262"><ref target="ref_262" rend="super">1</ref> The Land-Purchase Act of
								1885, passed by Lord Salisbury, set apart twenty-five million dollars; that of 1888,
								a second sum of the same amount; that of 1891 devoted one hundred and seventy
								million dollars to the purchase of lands, and that of 1903 an almost unlimited
								sum.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-468" n="409"/> parliament, and consequently the Irish patriots
							resented it. Accordingly, they at once began an agitation for Home Rule, that is, for
							a parliament of their own in which they can legislate on their own affairs instead of
							being forced to rely upon the British Parliament, where the English and the Scotch
							have an overwhelming majority.</p>

						<note rend="right">Daniel O'Connell</note>

						<p>The repeal of the Act of Union was warmly urged by Daniel O'Connell after the
							emancipation of 1829, and at the general election of 1834 forty members of Parliament
							favored Home Rule. In 1842 <hi rend="i">The Nation</hi> was founded to champion the
							cause, and a staff of brilliant writers were engaged to voice it. A Repeal Association
							was organized, monster meetings, said to have been attended by half a million people,
							were arranged by O'Connell, and the examples of Belgium and Greece in winning
							independence were cited as indications of what the Irish might do. All Ireland seemed
							on the verge of rebellion, and Irish Americans planned an invasion of Canada. The
							British government met this agitation by stationing thirty-five thousand troops in the
							island, and O'Connell, in spite of his violent and inflammatory speeches, shrank from
							the test of civil war.</p>

						<note rend="right">Gladstone espouses the cause of Irish Home Rule, 1886</note>

						<p>O'Connell died in 1847, but the cause of Home Rule did not perish with him, for it
							was taken up by the Fenians and the Land League and thus kept steadily before the
							people. In 1882 a decided impetus to the movement was given by the shocking murder of
							Lord Frederick Cavendish and Thomas Burke, the undersecretary for Ireland, in Phcenix
							Park, Dublin. This deed aroused the horror of the civilized world and convinced
							Gladstone that nothing short of Home Rule could solve the perennial Irish problem.
							After the parliamentary election of 1886, which gave him a small majority in the
							Commons and made him dependent upon the Irish members for their support, he undertook
							to secure the repeal of the Act of Union.<ref id="ref_263" rend="super"

							<pb id="VAB8216-469" n="410"/> in the policy of Home Rule, broke away from his
							leadership and formed the party of the Liberal Unionists, thus defeating the bill by
							about thirty votes. Seven years later, when Gladstone was again in power, he brought
							forward a new Home Rule bill providing that the Irish should have a parliament of
							their own at Dublin and also retain representation in that of the United Kingdom. This
							bill, though passed by the Commons, was rejected by the House of Lords. For some years
							thereafter the issue almost dropped out of English politics, but the majority of the
							Irish members of Parliament have continued to agitate the question, and Liberal
							victories in the elections of 1906 and 1910 again raised hopes for Irish independence.
							Indeed, it appears that some form of Home Rule will be granted in the immediate
							future, for at the present time (summer of 1912) the proposal is under discussion in
							Parliament.</p>

						<note rend="right">The British extend their empire while making reforms at home</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">70.</hi>The story of the British struggles for colonial dominions and
							world markets-- the rivalry with the Dutch in the Spice Islands, the wars for Spanish
							trade, the struggle with France in India and North America -we have brought down to
							the settlement at Vienna, which left England foremost among the commercial and
							colonial powers of all time. The task of developing the resources acquired in India,
							Africa, Canada, and Australasia, was 6ne of the important problems which the
							eighteenth century bequeathed to the nineteenth.</p>

						<note rend="right">British dominion in India at the opening of the nineteenth
							century</note>

						<p>Turning first to India, the British rule, in the opening years of the nineteenth
							century, extended over the Bengal region and far up the Ganges valley beyond Delhi. A
							narrow strip along the eastern coast, the southern point of the peninsula, and the
							island of Ceylon had also been brought under England's control, and in the west she
							held Bombay and a considerable area north of Surat. In addition to these regions which
							the English administered directly, there were a number of princes, such as the Nizam
							of Hyderabad, over whom they exercised the right of "protection." They had secured a
							foothold which made it evident that the Mogul emperor, who retained but the shadow of
							power at Delhi, could never recover the shattered dominions of the great Aurangzeb.
							The French and Portuguese possessions had declined into mere trading posts, and in the
							heart of India only one power disputed the advance of the English toward the complete
							conquest of the peninsula.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-472" n="413"/>

						<note rend="right">The Mahratta wars</note>

						<p>This one political power was a union of native princes, known as the Mahratta
							Confederacy. The country occupied by this confederation extended inward from the
							Bombay coast and was inclosed on the western border by mountain ranges. The ruling
							princes, however, who had formed the confederation, were usually warring with one
							another, except when dangers from without compelled them to unite. If it had not been
							for the jealousy amongst these princes, they might have checked the growing power of
							the English and seized India for themselves as it fell from the relaxing grasp of the
							great Mogul. But they were generally contending among themselves, and where their
							territory bordered on British dominion the people were kept in constant turmoil by
							their restless and unsettled life. At length the English determined to suppress them
							altogether and in a great war (1816-1818) they were finally conquered, a large part of
							their territories was annexed, and some of the princes were transformed into feudal
							lords under British sovereignty,-- a position which they retain to-day.</p>

						<note rend="right">The British advance to the borders of China</note>

						<p>While pacifying the interior of India the British were also occupied with the defense
							and extension of their frontiers on the north, east, and west. For six hundred miles
							along the northern frontier, where the foothills of the Himalayas gradually sink into
							the valley of the Ganges, there was chronic disorder fomented by the Gurkhas,-- a race
							composed of a mixture of the hill men and the Hindu plain dwellers. Periodically the
							Gurkha chieftains, like the Highlanders of Scotland or the Mahrattas of western India,
							would sweep down into the valley, loot the villages of the defenseless peasants, and
							then retire to their mountain retreats. A few of the most powerful of these chieftains
							succeeded in building up a sort of confederation under a rajah in whose name they
							governed Nepal, as their kingdom was called. They then sought to extend their sway at
							the expense of the British in the Ganges valley, but were badly beaten in a two years'
							war (1814-1816) and compelled to cede to the British Empire a vast northern region,
							which brought the <pb id="VAB8216-473" n="414"/> Anglo-Indian boundary at that point
							to the borders of Tibet, high up in the Himalaya mountains.</p>

						<note rend="right">Annexation in Burma, 1826-1885</note>

						<p>While the British were busy with the Mahrattas and Nepalese, the Burmese were
							pressing into the Bengal districts from the east, and as they had never met the
							disciplined Europeans in armed conflict, they were confident that they would be able
							to expand westward indefinitely. Their ambitions were, however, checked by the British
							(1824-1826), and they were compelled to cede to the victors a considerable strip of
							territory along the east coast of the Bay of Bengal. Having thus made their first
							definite advance beyond the confines of India proper, the British, after twenty-five
							years of peace with the Burmese, engaged in a second war against them in 1852 and made
							themselves masters of the Irawadi valley and a long narrow strip of coast below
								Rangoon.<ref id="ref_264" rend="super" target="note_264">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Conquest of the Sindh and Punjab regions</note>

						<p>After the gains made at the expense of the Burmese, the northwestern frontier next
							attracted the attention of the conquering British. In the valley of the Indus, where
							the soldiers of Alexander the Great had faltered on their eastward march, there was a
							fertile region known as the Sindh, ruled over by an Ameer, who seems to have shown an
							irritating independence in his dealings with the British. On the ground that the
							Ameer's government was inefficient and corrupt, the British invaded .his territory in
							1843, and after some brilliant campaigning they wrested his domain from him and added
							it to their Indian Empire, thus winning a strong western frontier. This enterprise was
							scarcely concluded when a war broke out with the Sikhs in the northwest, which
							resulted in the addition of the great Punjab region farther up the valley of the
							Indus, northeast of Sindh, and the extension of the boundary of the Anglo-Indian
							Empire to the borders of Afghanistan.<ref id="ref_265" rend="super" target="note_265"

						<note rend="right">Causes of discontent in India</note>

						<p>It was inevitable that the conquest and annexation of so many native Indian states
							should stir up intense hatred against the British aggressors. In the provinces which
							were under the direct administration of the British, ruling families and the official
							classes attached to them had been set aside, and in those which were merely under the
							suzerainty of the conquerors as feudal states, the rulers chafed at their vassalage.
							The Mohammedans cherished a religious abhorrence for the Christian intruders in
							addition to their bitterness at the loss of their former power. The native Mahrattas
							had good reason to feel that only the advent of the British had prevented them from
							transforming the peninsula into a Mahratta empire.<ref id="ref_267" rend="super"
								target="note_267">2</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Introduction of greased cartridges causes trouble</note>

						<p>There were embers of discontent everywhere, and they were fanned into a consuming
							flame in 1857 by several military reforms undertaken by the English government. The
							year before, the British had become impressed with the advantages of a new rifle
							invented by a Frenchman. It was loaded with a paper cartridge containing powder and
							ball, which was slipped into the barrel and then rammed down into place. In order to
							slide more easily into the gun the paper was greased, and the soldier had to tear off
							one end of it with his teeth so that the powder would take fire when the cap was
							exploded.</p>

						<note rend="right">The sepoys mutiny in 1857</note>

						<p>The introduction of this new rifle seemed innocent enough, but the government had not
							taken into account certain religious scruples of the sepoys, as the native troops were
							called. The <note id="note_266"><ref target="ref_266" rend="super">1</ref> For

							<pb id="VAB8216-478" n="416"/> Hindu regarded touching the fat of a cow as
							contamination worse than death, and to Mohammedans the fat of swine was almost as
							horrifying. The government soon heard of this grievance and promised not to use the
							objectionable grease. Peace was thus maintained for a time, but in May, 1857, some
							soldiers at Meerut, in the broad plain between the Jumna and the Ganges, refused to
							receive the cartridges served out to them and were thereupon sentenced to prison for
							ten years. Their native companions rallied to their support and rose in rebellion; the
							next day, May 11, the soldiers mutinied at Delhi, massacred the English inhabitants of
							the city and besieged the garrison; in a few days the entire northwest was in full
							revolt. Lucknow, with its population of seven hundred thousand natives, rose against
							the British and besieged them in their fortifications. At Cawnpore, about forty miles
							to the south, a thousand British men, women, and children were cruelly massacred after
							they had surrendered, and by the middle of July all Oudh and the northwest seemed
							lost.</p>

						<note rend="right">The rebellion crushed</note>

						<p>Immediately after the insurrection at Meerut the governor general telegraphed to
							Bombay, Madras, and Ceylon for instant help. Though there were as yet no railroads in
							the rebellious provinces, the telegraph helped to save the empire. Aid was at once
							sent to Lucknow under the command of General Colin Campbell, a hero of the Napoleonic
							and Crimean wars, and in November he succeeded in relieving the brave garrison, which
							had held out for nearly six months. Many of the sepoys remained loyal, and with aid
							from the coast provinces city after city was wrested from the mutineers until by the
							end of November British India was saved, but at a frightful cost. In the punishment of
							the rebels the frenzied English showed themselves as cruel as the natives had been in
							their treatment of English prisoners.</p>

						<note rend="right">Queen Victoria proclaimed Empress of India, 1877</note>

						<p>After the suppression of the sepoy rebellion the Parliament of Great Britain
							revolutionized the government of India. The administration of the peninsula was
							finally taken entirely out <pb id="VAB8216-479" n="417"/> of the hands of the East
							India Company, which had directed it for more than two hundred and fifty years, and
							vested in the British sovereign, to be exercised under parliamentary control. In
							November, 1858, a royal proclamation<ref id="ref_268" rend="super" target="note_268"
								>1</ref> announced to the inhabitants of British India that all treaties made under
							the authority of the East India Company would be maintained, the rights of feudatory
							princes upheld, and religious toleration granted. The governor general of the company
							in India was supplanted by a viceroy, and the company's directors in London
							surrendered their power into the hands of the Secretary of State for India. The Mogul
							of Delhi, successor of the great Aurangzeb, was expelled from his capital, but when,
							nearly twenty years later (on January 1, 1877), Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress
							of India amid an illustrious gathering of Indian princes and British officials, the
							pomp and magnificence of the ancient Moguls were invoked to bind their former subjects
							more closely to their English conquerors. King George V, Emperor of India, now rules
							over about three hundred millions of Indian subjects inhabiting a domain embracing
							1,773,000 square miles.</p>

						<note rend="right">Progress in India since the mutiny</note>
						<note rend="right">Railroads and newspapers</note>

						<p>Since the great mutiny the British government in India has been concerned chiefly
							with problems of internal reform and administration and with the defense of the
							frontiers, especially in the northwest. The proportion of natives to white men in the
							army was greatly reduced and the artillery placed almost entirely in charge of the
							latter. Codes of law and of criminal procedure were introduced in 1860 and 1861. The
							construction of railway lines was pushed forward with great rapidity for military and
							economic purposes, so that the vast interior might be quickly reached by troops, and
							an outlet opened for its crops of cotton, rice, wheat, indigo, and tobacco. Cotton
							mills are rising by the tombs of ancient kings, cities are increasing rapidly in
							population, and the foreign trade by sea has multiplied twenty-fold in the past
							seventy years. About eight <note id="note_268"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_268"

							including Burmese, Sanskrit, and Persian, are published; educational institutions have
							been provided for nearly five million students. In short, an industrial and
							educational revolution is taking place in India, and the Indians are beginning to be
							discontented with a government in which they have little share.</p>

						<note rend="right">The French in Canada obtain a liberal government by the Quebec Act,
							1774</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">71.</hi> When the English government was established in Canada after the
							capture of Montreal in 1760, only about two hundred of the sixty-five thousand
							inhabitants were of English origin; the rest were French. Barriers of race, language,
							laws, and religion separated the conquerors from the conquered. For a few years the
							English administration, not unnaturally, was badly adapted to the needs of its new
							subjects, but in 1774, on the eve of the war with the American colonies, the British
							Parliament, in order to insure the allegiance of the Canadians, passed the famous
							Quebec Act,-- one of the most remarkable enactments in the history of English law. In
							an age of intolerance it recognized the Catholic faith, allowed the clergy to collect
							their tithes, perpetuated the French civil law, and left French customs and traditions
							undisturbed.</p>

						<note rend="right">Loyalists settle in Canada during the American Revolution</note>

						<p>Under this act the new colony stood patriotically by England during the American
							Revolution, and though France was herself allied with the revolting colonies, the
							Canadians repulsed their advances and received fugitive loyalists in great numbers.
							The latter, known as the United Empire Loyalists, settled in what are now the Maritime
							Provinces and also in Upper Canada,-- the region lying along the Great Lakes, which
							was to become the province of Ontario. It is estimated that by 1806 about eighty
							thousand loyalist immigrants had crossed the frontier from the United States,-- the
							British government offering lands and subsidies to encourage their coming.</p>

						<note rend="right">Canada divided in two provinces, Ontario and Quebec</note>

						<p>The influx of an English population necessitated a change in the government, which
							had been designed especially for <pb id="VAB8216-481" n="419"/> the French.
							Consequently, in 1791, representative government was established in Canada by a new
							act of Parliament. The country was divided into two provinces,-- an upper one,
							Ontario, inhabited by the English, and a lower one, Quebec, which had long been the
							home of the French.</p>

						<note rend="right">French Canadians loyal to Britain in the War of 1812</note>

						<p>Under this new government the English and French inhabitants once more showed their
							loyalty to England when the armies of the United States prepared to invade Canada
							during the War of i812; for the old loyalists in Ontario still remembered with
							bitterness their expulsion during the American Revolution. The French Canadians
							likewise flocked to the support of the English cause, and the result of the conflict
							was merely to increase the ill will already felt for the neighboring republic, whose
							designs of annexation were regarded with distrust and aversion.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Canadian rebellion of 1837</note>

						<p>Amicably as the Canadians in the two provinces coÃ¶perated against the United States,
							they were constantly troubled by domestic dissensions. In Quebec the quarrel was
							between the great mass of the French citizens and a small group of English who
							controlled the government.<ref id="ref_269" rend="super" target="note_269">1</ref> In
							Ontario, although there was no question of nationality, there was some bitterness
							between the newcomers in the province and the officials who were nearly all from the
							old loyalist stock. In 1837 this ill feeling led to a revolt which was soon put down
							and followed by a union of the two provinces under one government. In Nova Scotia, New
							Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island there were demands for more local rights, and
							about the middle of the century they were granted self-government through responsible
							ministries.</p>

						<note rend="right">Canadian provinces federated in 1867</note>

						<p>This was an important step in the direction of the Canadian federation which was
							organized a few years later. By the British federated in North America Act of 1867
							Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, 1867 and Nova Scotia were united into the Dominion of
							Canada, with the provision that the remaining provinces and territories <note
								id="note_269"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_269" rend="super">1</ref> See <hi
										rend="i">Readings</hi>, Vol. II, pp. 317 <hi rend="i">sq.</hi></hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-482" n="420"/> might be admitted later. This federation was given a
							constitution providing for a governor general representing the sovereign of England, a
							Senate, the members of which are appointed for life by the governor general, and a
							House of Commons elected by popular vote. The new plan of federation went into effect
							on July i1 1867,-- a day which is celebrated as the Canadian national holiday, like
							the Fourth of July in the United States.</p>

						<note rend="right">New provinces admitted to the federation</note>

						<p>Since the formation of the federation, the history of the dominion has been
							characterized by rapid material development and the growth of a national spirit among
							the Canadian people. The great western regions have been divided into territories and
							provinces, just as the western part of the United States has been organized into
							territories and then into states. In 1869 the extensive rights which the Hudson Bay
							Company had possessed for more than two hundred years over vast regions encircling
							Hudson Bay were purchased. The province of Manitoba was laid out in 1870; in 1871
							British Columbia, which had been occupied after the settlement of the Oregon
							controversy with the United States, was admitted to the federation; Prince Edward
							Island followed two years later; and in 1905 the great provinces of Alberta and
							Saskatchewan came into the union, leaving only Newfoundland outside. The tide of
							immigration has slowly risen, and the population, which was a little over half a
							million in 1820, was more than five millions at the close of the century.</p>

						<note rend="right">Growth of national spirit in Canada</note>

						<p>The development of Canadian industries under the encouragement of protective tariffs
							and government bounties is intimately connected with the growth of a feeling that
							Canada constitutes a nation by herself, in spite of her position as a member of the
							British Empire. The close trading relations which were once fostered between Canada
							and the United States by reciprocity treaties, guaranteeing mutual interests, were
							long hampered by the protective policy which the government at Washington followed
							after the close of the Civil <pb id="VAB8216-483" n="421"/> War. As a result, Canada
							was driven to look more and more to Great Britain as her industrial ally rather than
							to the neighboring republic. In the seventies Sir John MacDonald made the idea of a
							"national policy," or protection for Canadian interests, a current political issue,
							and since that time both the Conservative and Liberal parties have labored to make
							Canada an independent manufacturing nation. In the fostering of this "colonial
							nationalism," as it is aptly called, there has been found no more ardent advocate than
							the former premier, Sir Wilfrid Laurier.<ref id="ref_270" rend="super"
								target="note_270">1</ref> The way in which Canada rejected the plan for trade
							reciprocity with the United States in 1911 shows that there is little support for
							anything that has the faintest resemblance to annexation to the republic.</p>

							country affords gold, silver, coal, tin, copper, and iron. Tasmania and New Zealand
							are more fortunate than Australia in the diversity of their scenery and the general
							fertility of their soil, while their climate is said to possess all the advantages of
							the mother country without her fog and smoke.</p>

						<note rend="right">Early explorations in Australasia,-- Captain Cook's voyages</note>

						<p>The English occupation of Australasia belongs to the nineteenth century. The
							Portuguese, in their eager hunt for the Spice Islands, may perhaps have come upon
							Australia, but it long remained an unknown portion of the globe, as shown by the rude
							outline of <hi rend="i">Terra Australis</hi> (or Southern Land) which appears on the
							maps of the Elizabethan age. In 1642 a Dutch seaman, Tasman, discovered the island
							which now bears his name (originally called Van Dieman's Land). He also sighted in the
							same year the islands to the east, which, in spite of their almost Alpine character,
							were named New Zealand, after the low-lying meadows at the mouth of the Rhine. The
							Dutch did not, however, occupy these lands, which were later brought to the attention
							of the English by the famous voyages of Captain Cook. He skirted around the entire
							coast of New Zealand in 1769-1770, and then sailed westward to Australia, reaching
							land at a point which, owing to its luxuriant foliage, he called Botany Bay. He took
							possession of the continent in the name of the English sovereign, and it was called
							New South Wales, on account of its fancied resemblance to the Welsh shore line.</p>

						<note rend="right">Founding the Australian colonies</note>

						<p>In 1787 England began the colonization of Australia by transporting to Botany Bay a
							number of convicts. The bay formed an excellent harbor, and the town of Sydney, which
							grew up on its shores, became the chief city of New South Wales, the first of six
							sister states, which now form the Australian <pb id="VAB8216-485" n="423"/>
							federation. Tasmania, with the town of Hobart established in 1804, and West Australia
							also began as penal stations. Some settlements which had grown up around the town of
							Melbourne were united in 1851 to form the colony of Victoria. Shortly after, the
							region to the north of Sydney was organized into the colony of Queensland. South
							Australia, with its town of Adelaide, sprang up as an independent settlement of free
							men, never having had the misfortune of being used as a station for criminals. As
							these colonies advanced in wealth and prosperity, protest was made against the
							transportation of criminals, and the British government finally abandoned it. Civil
							government supplanted the military rule which had been exercised over the penal
							stations, and each colony at length secured self-government, that is, a parliament and
							a ministry of its own, under the general sovereignty of the British crown.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Australian Commonwealth formed by union of six colonies</note>

						<p>It was natural that in time the people of these colonies, speaking the same language

							Victoria as their sovereign. The English settlers established the city of Auckland on
							North Island, and twenty-five years later New Zealand became a separate colony, with
							the seat of government at Wellington. Under the auspices of the New Zealand Company
							colonization was actively carried on, and before long the whites began to press in

						<note rend="right">Social reform in New Zealand</note>

						<p>New Zealand has recently become famous for its experiments in social reform.<ref

							nineteenth century the workingmen became very influential, and they have been able to
							carry through a number of measures which they believe to be to their advantage.
							Special courts are established to settle disputes between employers and their workmen;
							a pension law helps the poor in their old age. Various measures have been adopted for
							discouraging the creation of large estates, which are heavily taxed, while small farms
							pay but little. The right to vote is enjoyed by women as well as by men.<ref

						<note rend="right">Victoria attempts to maintain standard wages for workingmen</note>

						<p>The colony of Victoria has vied with New Zealand in respect to social reform. The

							boards composed of employers and workmen have been established for the purpose of
							fixing the minimum wages and standards of work, so that these matters are no longer
							arranged by private bargaining between individuals. The system of secret voting which

							majority of the present white inhabitants are derived, although immigration from
							England set in after the fall of Napoleon. These Dutch settlers were a sturdy,
							resolute people, strongly attached to their customs, including slavery, and though of
							peaceable spirit, they were unwilling to submit to interference. It was just these
							characteristics which the new rulers overlooked. Shortly after their occupation the
							British reconstructed the system of local government and the courts; they insisted on
							the use of the English language; and finally, in 1833, they abolished slavery, setting
							aside a considerable sum of money as compensation to the slave owners, a great deal of
							which, however, was secured by shrewd financiers because it was made payable in

							Accordingly, in 1852, by a treaty known as the Sand River Convention, they recognized
							the independence of the Boers in the Transvaal region, guaranteeing them the right "to
							manage their own affairs and to govern themselves according to their own laws, without
							any interference on the part of the British government." This was followed, two years
							later, by the recognition of the freedom and independence of the Orange River Colony
							under the name of the Orange Free State, which preserved its liberty until the recent
							war, which brought it again under British sovereignty.</p>

						<note rend="right">The British annex the Transvaal Republic, 1877</note>

						<p>In the Transvaal the Dutch lived a rude wild life, having little government and

						<p>At that time Gladstone was in office, and turning a deaf ear to the demands of the

							which they had fought. Consequently he concluded a convention with the Transvaal
							provisional government by which autonomy under the suzerainty of the queen of England
							was granted to the Boers, except that their foreign affairs were to be subject to
							British control. Regarding this measure not as an act of magnanimity on the part of
							the British government but as a concession wrung from it by force of arms, the Boers
							determined to secure complete independence, and succeeded in 1884 in obtaining a new
							convention recognizing the Transvaal as free and independent in all respects except
							the conclusion of treaties with foreign powers. They thus regained, for all practical

						<p>The very next year (1885) gold was discovered in the southern part of the Transvaal,

						<note rend="right">The Jameson raid, 1895</note>

						<p>The conspiracy was encouraged by Cecil Rhodes, prime minister of Cape Colony and head

						<p>During this long struggle between Boer and Briton in the interior, the two races have

							the former colony have been enlarged by many annexations until it now has an area
							about five times that of the state of New York. More than two thirds of the population
							is negro, but the European element is steadily increasing by immigration from the
							British Isles. Cabinet government was established in 1872, and the legislative power
							vested in two houses, both elected by popular vote. The principal towns are Cape Town,
							the capital, and Kimberley, the center of the great diamond fields, from which more
							than half a billion dollars' worth of diamonds have been taken.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Colony of Natal</note>

						<p>The self-governing colony of Natal originated with the expulsion of the Boers in 1842
							and the annexation of the region to Cape Colony. Some years later it was again made a

							the Cape, the negro population predominates, being about five times that of the

						<note rend="right">The South African Union</note>

						<p>In addition to these colonies Great Britain has three enormous provinces in southern

						<note rend="right">Relations between Russia and western Europe becoming more
							intimate</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">74.</hi> During the past century Russia has been coming into ever closer
							relations with western Europe. Although still a backward country in many respects, she
							has been busily engaged for fifty years in modernizing herself ; and shortly after the
							opening of the twentieth century it looked as if a popular government would be
							established by violence. The works of some of her writers are widely read in foreign
							lands, especially those of Turgenief and of Leo Tolstoi. The music of Rubinstein and
							Tschaikovski is as highly esteemed in London or New York as in St. Petersburg or
							Moscow. Even in the field of science such names as that of MendelÃ©ef, the chemist, and
							of Metchnikof, the biologist, are well known to their fellow-workers in Germany,
							France, England, and America. It becomes, therefore, a matter of vital interest to
							follow the changes which are turning the tide of modern civilization into eastern
							Europe.</p>

						<note rend="right">Participation of Alexander I in European affairs</note>

						<p>When, in 1815, Tsar Alexander I returned to St. Petersburg after the close of the
							Congress of Vienna, he could view his position and recent achievements with pride.
							Alexander had participated in Napoleon's overthrow, and had succeeded in uniting the
							rulers of western Europe in that Holy Alliance which he had so much at heart. But his
							chief interests lay, of course, in his own vast empire. He was the undisputed and
							autocratic ruler of more than half of the whole continent of Europe, not to speak of
							the almost interminable reaches of northern Asia which lay beneath his scepter.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-497" n="433"/>

						<note rend="right">Heterogeneous character of the Russian Empire</note>

						<p>Under his dominion there were many races and peoples, differing in customs, language,
							and religion,-- Finns, Germans, Poles, Jews, Tartars, Armenians, Georgians, and
								Mongols.<ref id="ref_280" rend="super" target="note_280">1</ref> The Russians
							themselves, it is true, had colonized the southern plains of European Russia and had
							spread even into Siberia. They made up a large proportion of the population of the
							empire, and their language was everywhere taught in the schools and used by the
							officials. The people of the grand duchy of Finland, speaking Swedish and Finnish, did
							not like their incorporation with Russia; and the Poles, recalling the time when their
							kingdom far outshone the petty duchy of Moscow among the European powers, still hoped
							that the kingdom of Poland might form an independent nation with its own language and
							constitution.</p>


						<p>In the time of Alexander I the Russians had not begun to flock to the cities, which
							were small and ill constructed compared with those of western Europe. The great mass
							of the population still lived in the country and more than half of them were serfs, as
							ignorant and wretched as those of France or England in the twelfth century.</p>

						<note rend="right">Absolute powers of the Tsar</note>

						<p>Alexander I had inherited, as "Autocrat of all the Russias," a despotic power over
							his subjects as absolute as that to which Louis XIV laid claim. He could make war and
							conclude peace at will, freely appoint or dismiss his ministers, order the arrest,
							imprisonment, exile, or execution of any one he chose, without consulting or giving an
							account to any living being. Even the Russian national Church was under his personal
							control. There was no thought of any responsibility to the people, and the tyranny
							which the Tsar's officials have been able to exercise will become apparent as we
							proceed.</p>

						<note rend="right">How Tsar Alexander became the enemy of revolution and of liberal
							ideas</note>

						<p>During his early years Alexander entertained liberal ideas, but after his return from

								Don, near the Black Sea, the Urals, and elsewhere, in return for military
								service.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-498" n="434"/> dismiss his liberal advisers.<ref id="ref_281"
								rend="super" target="note_281">1</ref> He became as apprehensive of revolution as
							his friend Metternich, and threw himself into the arms of the " Old-Russian" party,
							which obstinately opposed the introduction of all western ideas. The Tsar was soon
							denouncing liberalism as a frightful illusion which threatened the whole social order.
							He permitted his officials to do all they could to stamp out the ideas which he had
							himself formerly done so much to encourage. The censorship of the press put an end to
							the liberal periodicals which had sprung up, and professors in the universities were
							dismissed for teaching modern science. The attraction of the new ideas was, however,
							too strong for the Tsar to prevent some of his more enlightened subjects from
							following eagerly the course of the revolutionary movements in western Europe and
							reading the new books dealing with scientific discoveries and questions of political
							and social reform.</p>

						<note rend="right">The "Decembrist" revolt of 1825</note>

						<p>Alexander I died suddenly on December 1, 1825. The revolutionary societies seized
							this opportunity to organize a revolt known as the "December conspiracy." But the
							movement was badly organized; a few charges of grapeshot brought the insurgents to
							terms; and some of the leaders were hanged.</p>

						<note rend="right">Polish rebellion, 1830-1831</note>

						<p>Nicholas I never forgot the rebellion which inaugurated his reign, and he proved one
							of the most despotic of all the long list of autocratic rulers. His arbitrary measures
							speedily produced a revolt in Poland. The constitution which Alexander I had in his
							liberal days granted to the kingdom was violated. Russian troops were stationed there
							in great numbers, Russian officials forced their way into the government offices, and
							the petitions of the Polish diet were contemptuously ignored by the Tsar. Secret
							societies then began to promote a movement for the reestablishment of the ancient
							Polish republic which Catharine II and her fellow-monarchs had destroyed. Late in 1830

							Turkey led to a war with France and England. The Russians were defeated, and their

							and turned over to his serfs barely enough to enable them to keep body and soul
							together. They usually spent three days in the week cultivating their lord's fields.
							He was their judge as well as their master and could flog them at will. The serf was
							viewed as scarcely more than a beast of burden.<ref id="ref_286" rend="super"
								target="note_286">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Peasant revolts</note>

						<p>From time to time the serfs, infuriated by the hard conditions imposed upon them,
							revolted against their lords. During the reign of Catharine the Great a general
							uprising had taken place which grew to the proportions of a civil war and was only put
							down with terrible bloodshed and cruelty. Under Nicholas I over five hundred riots had
							occurred, and these seemed to increase rather than decrease, notwithstanding the
							vigilance of the police and the severity of the government.</p>

						<note rend="right">Emancipation of the serfs, March, 1861</note>
						<note rend="right">The village community or <hi rend="i">Mir</hi></note>

						<p>Alexander II, fearful lest the peasants should again attempt to win their liberty by
							force, decided that the government serfs, must undertake the difficult task of freeing
							forty millions of his subjects from serfdom. After much discussion he issued an
							emancipation proclamation, March 3, 1861,<ref id="ref_287" rend="super"
								target="note_287">2</ref> on the eve of the great Civil War which was to put an end
							to negro slavery in the United States. In his anxiety to prevent any loss to the
							landowners, who constituted the ruling class in the Russian government, the Tsar did
							his work in a very half-hearted manner. It is true the government deprived the former
							lord of his right to force the peasants to work for him and pay him the old dues; he
							could no longer flog them or command them to marry against their will; but the
							peasants still remained bound to the land, for they were not permitted to leave' their
							villages without a government pass. The landlords surrendered a portion of their
							estates to the peasants, but this did not become the property of individual owners,
							but was vested in the <hi rend="i">village <note id="note_286"><ref target="ref_286"

							village was to be periodically redistributed among the various families of the
							community so that, aside from his hut and garden, no peasant could lay claim
							permanently to any particular plot of land as his own.<ref id="ref_288" rend="super"
								target="note_288">1</ref></p>

						<p>The government dealt very generously with the landlords, as might have been
							anticipated. It not only agreed that the peasants should be required to pay for such
							land as their former masters turned over to them, but commonly fixed the price at an
							amount far greater than the real value of the land-- a price which the government paid
							and began to collect from the serfs in installments. His new freedom seemed to the
							peasant little better than that enjoyed by a convict condemned to hard labor in the
							penitentiary. Indeed, he sometimes refused to be "freed" when he learned of the hard
							bargain which the government proposed to drive with him. There were hundreds of riots
							while the readjustments were taking place, which were sternly suppressed by the
							government. The peasants were compelled by force of arms to accept their "liberty" and
							pay the land tax which emancipation imposed upon them.</p>

						<p>Naturally, if the people in a given community increased, the size of the individual
							allotments inevitably decreased and with that the chances of earning a livelihood. At
							present, more than fifty years after the "freeing" of the serfs, the peasant has, on
							the average, scarcely half as much land as that originally assigned to him. Although
							he lived constantly on the verge of starvation, he fell far behind in the payment of
							his taxes, so that in 1904 the Tsar, in a moment of forced generosity, canceled the
							arrears, which the peasants could, in any case, never have paid.</p>

						<note id="note_288"><ref target="ref_288" rend="super">1</ref> These village communities
							had long existed in Russia, since the lords had usually found it convenient to have
							the village redistribute the land from time to time among the serfs as the number of
							inhabitants changed. By a new law of June 27, 1910-- the most important agrarian law
							since the emancipation of the serfs-- provision was made for a dissolution of the
							village communities and private ownership of definite plots of land by the
							peasants.</note>

						<p>The government officials regarded the reformers with the utmost suspicion and began

							on the government as a body of cruel, corrupt tyrants who would keep Russia in
							darkness forever merely in order that they might continue to fill their own pockets by

						<p>In short, the efforts of the Tsar's officials to check the revolutionists proved
							vain, and Melikoff, to whom the Tsar had given almost dictatorial powers to suppress
							the agitation, finally saw that the government must make some concessions in order to
							pacify its enemies; so he advised Alexander II to grant a species of constitution in

						<note rend="right">Railway construction in Russia</note>

						<p>Along with this industrial development has gone the construction of great railway
							lines built largely by the government with money borrowed from capitalists in western

							building was first seriously undertaken in Russia after the disasters of the Crimean
							War, when the soldiers suffered cruel hardships in consequence of the difficulty of
							obtaining supplies. By 1878 upward of eight thousand miles had been built, connecting
							the capital with the frontiers of European Russia. In 1885 the railway advance toward
							the frontiers of India<ref id="ref_294" rend="super" target="note_294">1</ref> was

							Turkestan, Chemkent, and Tashkent, and two years later organized the region into the
							new province of Russian Turkestan. Shortly afterward the Ameer of Bokhara declared war
							on the Tsar only to have the Russians occupy the ancient city of Samarkand (where
							Alexander the Great had halted on his eastward march) and later establish a
							protectorate over Bokhara which brought them to the borders of Afghanistan. In 1872
							the Khan of Khiva was reduced to vassalage. During the following years (1873-1886) the
							regions to the south, about Merv, down to the borders of Persia and Afghanistan, were
							gradually annexed. In 1876 the province of Kokand on the boundary of the Chinese
							Empire was seized and transformed into the province of Ferghana. By securing railway
							concessions and making loans to the Shah, the Russians have become powerful in Persia,

							foreign lands, especially to the United States. There is good reason to believe that
							von Plehve actually arranged these massacres.</p>

						<note rend="right">The liberals, or constitutional democrats</note>

						<p>Von Plehve was mistaken, however, in his belief that all the trouble came from a
							handful of deluded fanatics. Among those who detested the cruel and corrupt government
							which he represented were the professional men, the university professors, the
							enlightened merchants and manufacturers, and the public-spirited nobility. These were
							not at first organized into a distinct party, but in time they came to be known as the
							constitutional democrats. They hoped that a parliament elected by the people <note

							<pb id="VAB8216-513" n="446"/> might be established to coÃ¶perate with the Tsar and his
							ministers in making the laws and imposing the taxes. They demanded freedom of speech
							and of the press, the right to hold public meetings to discuss public questions, the
							abolition of the secret police system, of arbitrary imprisonment and religious
							persecutions, and the gradual improvement of the condition of the peasants and
							workingmen through the passage of wise laws.</p>

						<note rend="right">The social democrats</note>

						<p>In the towns a socialistic party had been growing up which advocated the theories of
							Karl Marx.<ref id="ref_300" rend="super" target="note_300">1</ref> It desired, and
							still desires, all the reforms advocated by the constitutional democrats just
							described, but looks forward to the time when the workingmen will become so numerous
							and powerful that they can seize the government offices and assume the management of
							lands, mines, and industries, which shall thereafter be used for the benefit of all
							rather than for the small class of rich men who now own them. Unlike the reformers
							next to be described, they do not believe in terrorism or in murderous attacks upon
							unpopular government officials.</p>

						<note rend="right">The socialist revolutionary party</note>

						<p>The most conspicuous among the Russian agitators were those who belonged to the
							socialist revolutionary party, which was well organized and was responsible for the
							chief acts of violence during the years of the revolution. They maintained that it was
							right to make war upon the government which was oppressing them and extorting money
							from the people to fill the pockets of dishonest officeholders. Its members selected
							their victims from the most notoriously cruel among the officials, and after a victim
							had been killed they usually published a list of the offenses which cost him his life.
							Lists of those condemned to death were also prepared, after careful consideration, by
							their executive committee. They did not practice, or in any way approve of,
							indiscriminate assassination, as is sometimes supposed.</p>

						<note rend="right">Great unpopularity of the war with Japan which began in February,
							1904</note>

						<p>The more von Plehve sought to stamp out all protest against the autocracy, the more
							its enemies increased, and at last, in <note id="note_300"><hi rend="center"><ref

							<pb id="VAB8216-514" n="447"/> 1904, the open revolution may be said to have begun. On
							February 5 of that year a war commenced with Japan, which was due to Russia's
							encroachments in Korea and her evident intention of permanently depriving China of
							Manchuria. The liberals attributed the conflict to bad management on the part of the
							Tsar's officials, and declared it to be inhuman and contrary to the interests of the
							people. In March revolutionary manifestoes appeared, maintaining that the Japanese
							were quite justified in their claims and urging that no intelligent Russian should
							help on the war in any way, either by contributions or enlistment.</p>

						<note rend="right">Russian reverses</note>

						<p>Meanwhile the Japanese were pressing back the Russians, destroying their vessels, and
							besieging their fortress of Port Arthur, which they had cut off from any aid or
							supplies. The liberal-minded among the Russians regarded these disasters with a
							certain satisfaction. The reverses, they held, were due to the incompetence and
							corruption of the Tsar's officials, and served to make plain how very badly autocracy
							really worked in practice.</p>

						<note rend="right">Assassination of von Plehve, July, 1904</note>

						<p>Von Plehve continued, however, in spite of the rising indignation, to encourage the
							police to break up scientific and literary meetings, in which disapprobation of the
							government was pretty sure to be expressed, and to send men eminent in science and
							literature to prison or to Siberia, until, on July 28, 1904, a bomb was thrown under
							the minister's carriage by a former student in the University of Moscow and his career
							was brought to an abrupt close.</p>

						<note rend="right">General disorder</note>

						<p>Meanwhile disasters and revolt met the government on every hand. The Japanese
							continued to force back the Russians in Manchuria in a series of terrific conflicts
							south of Mukden. In one long battle on the Sha-ho River sixty thousand Russians
							perished. Their fleets in the East were annihilated, and on January 1, 1905, Port
							Arthur fell, after the most terrible siege on record. The crops failed and the
							starving peasants burned and sacked the houses and barns of the nobles, arguing that
							if <pb id="VAB8216-515" n="448"/> the buildings were destroyed, the owners could not
							come back, and the Tsar's police could no longer make them their head-quarters.</p>

						<p>The war had produced a stagnation of commerce and industry, and strikes became
							common. It became known that the government officials had been stealing money that
							should have gone to strengthen and equip the armies; rifles had been paid for that had
							never been delivered, supplies bought which never reached the suffering soldiers,
							and-- most scandalous of all-- high Russian dignitaries had even misappropriated the
							funds of the Red Cross Society for aiding the wounded.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Tsar promises reforms, December, 1904</note>

						<p>On December 26, 1904, the Tsar issued an imperial <hi rend="i">ukase</hi> vaguely
							promising reforms, which he declared were under consideration and would be put into
							effect as soon as possible. But the proclamation failed to stop agitation.</p>

						<note rend="right">"Red Sunday," January 22, 1905</note>

						<p>On Sunday, January 22, a fearful event occurred. The workingmen of St. Petersburg had
							sent a petition to the Tsar and had informed him that on Sunday they would march to
							the palace humbly to pray him in person to consider their sufferings, since they had
							no faith in his officials or ministers. When Sunday morning came, masses of men,
							women, and children, wholly unarmed, attempted to approach the Winter Palace in the
							pathetic hope that the "Little Father," as they called the Tsar, would listen to their
							woes. Instead, the Cossacks tried to disperse them with their whips, and then the
							troops which guarded the palace shot and cut down hundreds, and wounded thousands in a
							conflict which continued all day.<ref id="ref_301" rend="super" target="note_301"
								>1</ref> "Red Sunday" was, however, only the most impressive of many similar
							encounters between citizens and the Tsar's police and guards.</p>

						<note rend="right">Protest of the men of letters</note>

						<p>The day after "Red Sunday" all the leading lawyers and men of letters in St.
							Petersburg joined in the following declaration: "The public should understand that the
							government has declared war on the entire Russian people. There is no further doubt on
							this point. A government which is unable to <note id="note_301"><ref target="ref_301"

							hangmen."</p>

						<note rend="right">The Tsar promises to summon the Duma (August 19, 1905</note>

						<p>Finally, the Tsar so far yielded to the pressure of public opinion that on August 19
							he promised to summon a <hi rend="i">Duma</hi>, or council, which should meet not

						<note rend="right">The great general strikes October and November, 1905</note>

						<p>This was a bitter disappointment to even the most moderate liberals. It was pointed
							out that both the workingmen and the professional men were excluded by the regulations
							from voting. A more effective measure in bringing the Tsar and his advisers to terms
							was a great general strike in the interest of reform which began late in October. All
							the railroads stopped running; in all the great towns the shops, except those that
							dealt in provisions, were closed; gas and electricity were no longer furnished; the
							law courts ceased their duties, and even the apothecaries refused to prepare
							prescriptions until reforms should be granted.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Tsar promises (October 29, 1905) that no law shall go into force

						<p>The situation soon became intolerable, and on October 29 the Tsar announced that he

							association, and to permit the classes which had been excluded in his first edict to
							vote for members of the Duma. Lastly, he agreed "to establish an immutable rule that

							The deputies to the Duma assembled in no humble frame of mind. They came exasperated

							which they held the ministers and the bureaucracy responsible; they were resolved to
							demand an account of the public income and expenditures, to punish fraud, hunt down
							and chastise the guilty, dismiss the corrupt, and purify the whole administration.
							They were determined, in a word, to give Russia an enlightened, liberal, and righteous
							constitutional government. Like the members of the Estates General in 1789, they felt
							that they had the nation behind them. They listened stonily to the Tsar's remarks at
							the opening session, and it was clear from the first that they would not agree any
							better with their monarch than the French deputies had agreed with Louis XVI and his
							courtiers.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Duma freely discusses the vices of the Tsar's government</note>

						<p>The first motion made in the Duma related to the freeing of those who had sacrificed
							their liberty for their country. In its address to the Tsar the assembly laid stress
							on the necessity of universal suffrage, and the abandoning on the part of the
							government of all its tyrannical habits. The Tsar's ministers would not cooperate with
							the Duma in any important measures of reform, and on July 21 Nicholas II declared that
							he was "cruelly disappointed" because the deputies had not confined themselves to
							their proper duties and had commented upon many matters which belonged to him. He
							accordingly dissolved the Duma,<ref id="ref_303" rend="super" target="note_303"
								>1</ref> as he had a perfect right to do, fixed March 5, 1907, as the date for the
							meeting of a new Duma, and appointed Stolypin premier,-- an office which he held until

						<note rend="right">Atrocities and disorder continue</note>

						<p>The revolutionists made an unsuccessful attempt in August to blow up Premier Stolypin
							in his country house and continued to assassinate governors and police officials. The
							"Black Hundreds," on the other hand, went on massacring Jews and liberals while the

							execution of revolutionists. In <note id="note_303"><ref target="ref_303" rend="super"

							<pb id="VAB8216-518" n="451"/> the two months, September and October, 1906, these
							courts summarily condemned three hundred persons to be shot or hanged. During the
							whole year some nine thousand persons were killed or wounded for political
							reasons.</p>

						<note rend="right">Famine added to the other disasters</note>

						<p>A terrible famine was afflicting the land at the end of the year, and it was
							discovered that a member of the Tsar's ministry had been stealing the money
							appropriated to furnish grain to the dying peasants. An observer who had traveled
							eight hundred miles through the famine-stricken district reported that he did not find
							a single village where the peasants had food enough for themselves or their cattle. In
							some places the peasants were reduced to eating bark and the straw used for their
							thatch roofs.</p>

						<note rend="right">Dissolution of the village communities, November, 1906</note>

						<p>In October a ukase permitted the peasants to leave their particular village community
							and join another, or to seek employment elsewhere. On November 25 the peasants were
							empowered to become owners of their allotments, and all redemption dues were remitted.
							This constituted the first step toward a practical abolition of the system of common
							ownership by village communities, which was finally achieved by a law of June 27,
							1910.</p>

						<note rend="right">Second Duma meets March 5, 1907, and is soon dissolved</note>

						<p>In accordance with the Tsar's imperial promise the second Duma met on March 5, 1907.
							The government had declared ineligible a majority of the former Duma. It had excluded
							Milyoukov and all the other constitutional democrats that it could, and its efforts
							resulted in the election of a rather large conservative "right." But many socialists
							were returned, and the opponents of the government still had a large majority. Early
							in June Stolypin ordered the assembly to give up sixteen of its members to the police
							and expel forty others on the ground that they were implicated in a plot to overthrow
							the Tsar. The Duma appointed a committee to consider the merits of the case, but the
							police hastened to arrest the alleged leaders in the conspiracy, and the Tsar
							immediately dissolved the assembly for refusing to surrender its accused members upon
							his demand.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-519" n="452"/>

						<note rend="right">New election regulations</note>

						<p>In order that the third Duma should be more docile than the first two, the Tsar and
							his ministers issued, contrary to his promises, a new set of regulations for the
							coming elections. Poland was deprived of two thirds of its representatives, while
							those from the cities were so greatly reduced that only St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev,
							Odessa, Warsaw, Lodz, and Riga could send any deputies at all. The influence of the
							peasants, whom the government has found almost as radical as the workingmen of the
							towns, was also much diminished.</p>

						<note rend="right">The third Duma, November 26, 1907, proves tractable</note>

						<p>As a result of these unconstitutional measures the third Duma, which met on November
							26, 1907, contained a much larger number of large landowners, retired government
							officials, priests, and other conservative members than the former assemblies. Indeed,
							it has been found so tractable by the Tsar that no new election has been held up to
							the present time (1912). It proposes no radical reforms, and the spirit of revolution
							has almost died out among the people. Parliamentary government is apparently as far
							from establishment as ever. The Tsar still retains the title of Autocrat, and his
							officials continue to violate all the principles of civil and political liberty and
							even the Tsar's own manifestoes, by abusing and oppressing the people and preventing
							them from discussing public questions.</p>

						<note rend="right">European Turkey the source of many dissensions among the
							powers</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">78.</hi> It has been necessary in our narrative to refer now and again
							to the Sultan of Turkey, and especially to his troubles with his neighbors, Russia and
							Austria. In order to understand this "Eastern question,"-- which has involved the
							gradual expulsion of the Turks from Europe, the interminable quarrel over the Sultan's
							government and finances, and the formation of the new states of Servia, Roumania,
							Greece, and Bulgaria,-- it is necessary to turn back, for the moment, to the origin of
							the Turkish Empire in Europe.</p>

						<note rend="right">The advance and decline of Turkish power in Europe</note>

						<p>Although there had been an almost steady conflict between the Cross and the Crescent
							ever since the days of Mohammed, it was not until the fourteenth century that
							southeastern Europe was threatened by a Mohammedan invasion. Under Othman (died 1326)
							a Turkish tribe from western Asia established itself in Asia Minor, across the
							Bosporus from Constantinople. From their leader they derived the name of Ottoman
							Turks, to distinguish them from the Seljuk Turks with whom the Crusaders had in
							earlier centuries come in contact. Under successive sultans the Ottoman Turks extended
							their dominion into Asia Minor, Syria, Arabia, and Egypt, while to the west they
							conquered the Balkan regions and Greece. In 1453 the capital of the Eastern Empire,
							Constantinople, fell into their hands, and for a hundred and fifty years thereafter
							they were a source of serious apprehension to the states of western Europe.</p>

						<p>The Turks pushed up the valley of the Danube almost to the borders of the German
							Empire, and for nearly two centuries the <pb id="VAB8216-522" n="455"/> republic of
							Venice and the House of Hapsburg were engaged in an almost continuous war with them.
							In 1683 they laid siege to Vienna, but were defeated by the Polish king, John
							Sobieski, who came to the relief of the Austrians. The following year, the Emperor,
							Poland, and Venice formed a Holy League, which for fifteen years waged an intermittent
							war against the infidels (in which Peter the Great joined) and which, by 1699,
							succeeded in forcing the Turks out of Hungary.</p>

						<note rend="right">Catharine the Great wins territory on the Black Sea</note>

						<p>While Turkey ceased, thereafter, to be dangerously aggressive, she was able for
							several decades to resist the efforts of Russia and Austria to deprive her of further
							territory. In 1774 Catharine the Great managed to secure the Crimea and the region
							about the Sea of Azof, thus giving Russia a permanent foothold on the Black Sea.
							Moreover the Porte, as the Turkish government is commonly called, conceded to Russia
							the right to protect the Sultan's Christian subjects, most of whom were adherents of
							the Orthodox Greek Church, the State Church of Russia.<ref id="ref_304" rend="super"
								target="note_304">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Russian influence in Turkey</note>

						<p>These and other provisions seemed to give the Russians an excuse for intervening in
							Turkish affairs, and offered an opportunity for fomenting discontent among the
							Sultan's Christian subjects. In 1812, just before Napoleon's march on Moscow,
							Alexander I forced Turkey to cede to him Bessarabia on the Black Sea, which still
							remains the last of Russia's conquests toward the southwest.</p>

						<note rend="right">Servia becomes a tributary principality in 1817</note>

						<p>Shortly after the Congress of Vienna, the Servians, who had for a number of years
							been in revolt against the Turks, were able to establish their practical independence
							(1817), and Servia, with Belgrade as its capital, became a principality tributary to
							Turkey. This was the first of a series of states which have reemerged, during the
							nineteenth century, from beneath the Mohammedan inundation.</p>

						<note rend="right">The national spirit is awakened in Greece</note>

						<p>The next state to gain its independence was Greece, whose long conflict against
							Turkish despotism aroused throughout Europe the sympathy of all who appreciated the
							glories of <note id="note_304"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_304" rend="super"

							<pb id="VAB8216-523" n="456"/> ancient Greece. The inhabitants of the land of Plato,
							Aristotle, and Demosthenes were, it is true, scarcely to be regarded as descendants of
							the Greeks, and the language they spoke bore little resemblance to the ancient tongue.
							At the opening of the nineteenth century, however, the national spirit once more awoke
							in Greece, and able writers made modern Greek a literary language and employed it in
							stirring appeals to the patriotism of their fellow-countrymen.</p>

						<note rend="right">The independence of Greece declared January, 1822</note>

						<p>In 1821 an insurrection broke out in Morea, as the ancient Peloponnesus is now
							called. The revolutionists were supported by the clergy of the Greek Church, who
							proclaimed a savage war of extermination against the infidel. The movement spread
							through the peninsula; the atrocities of the Turk were rivaled by those of the Greeks,
							and thousands of Mohammedans-- men, women, and children-- were slaughtered. On January
							27, 1822, the Greek National Assembly issued a proclamation of independence.<ref

						<note rend="right">Sympathy of western Europe for the cause of Greek independence</note>

						<p>To Metternich this revolt seemed only another illustration of the dangers of
							revolution, but the liberals throughout Europe enthusiastically sympathized with the
							Greek uprising, since it was carried on in the name of national liberty. Intellectual
							men in England, France, Germany, and the United States held meetings to express
							sympathy for the cause, while to the ardent Christian it seemed a righteous war
							against infidels and persecutors. Soldiers and supplies poured into Greece. Indeed,
							the Greeks could scarcely have freed themselves had the European powers refused to
							intervene.</p>

						<p>It is needless to follow the long negotiations between the various European courts in

							the mediation of the allies, their combined fleets destroyed that of the Sultan at
							Navarino in October, 1827. Thereupon the Porte declared a "holy war" on the
							unbelievers, especially the Russians. But the latter were prepared to push the war
							with vigor, and they.not only actively promoted the freedom of Greece, but forced the
							Sultan to grant practical independence to the Danubian principalities of Wallachia and
							Moldavia, which came thereby under Russian influence. Turkey was no longer able to
							oppose the wishes of the allies, and in 1832 Greece became an independent state,
							choosing for its king Prince Otto of Bavaria.</p>

							the Turks (who had long been in possession of the Holy Land and Jerusalem) freely to

							upon Russia in 1854.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Crimean War, 1854</note>

						<p>The Crimean War which followed owes its name to the fact that the operations of the
							allies against Russia culminated in the long and bloody siege of Sebastopol, in the
							southern part of the <pb id="VAB8216-525" n="458"/> Crimean peninsula. Every victory
							won by the allies was dearly bought. The English soldiers suffered at first in
							consequence of the inefficiency of the home government in sending them the necessary
							supplies. The charge of the light brigade at Balaklava, which has been made famous by
							Tennyson's poem, and the engagement at Inkerman were small compensation for the
							immense losses and hardships endured by both the French and the English. Russia was,
							however, disheartened by the sufferings of her own soldiers, the inefficiency and
							corruption of her officials, and the final loss of the mighty fortress of
								Sebastopol.<ref id="ref_306" rend="super" target="note_306">1</ref> She saw,
							moreover, that her near neighbor, Austria, was about to join her enemies. The new
							Tsar, Alexander II, therefore, consented in 1856 to the terms of a treaty drawn up at
								Paris.<ref id="ref_307" rend="super" target="note_307">2</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Terms of the Treaty of Paris, 1856</note>
						<note rend="right">The Black Sea declared neutral</note>

						<p>This treaty recognized the independence of the Ottoman Empire and guaranteed its
							territorial integrity. The "Sublime Porte" was also included within the scope of the
							international law of Europe, from which it had hitherto been excluded as a barbarous
							government, and the other powers agreed not to interfere further with the domestic
							affairs of Turkey. The Sultan drew up a special decree in which he referred to "his
							generous intentions toward his Christian subjects" and promised religious liberty as
							well as reforms in the government. The Black Sea was declared neutral territory and
							its waters were thrown open to merchant ships of all nations, but no war ships were to
							pass through the Bosporus or Dardanelles. In short, Turkey was preserved and
							strengthened by the intervention of the powers as a bulwark against Russian
							encroachment into the Balkan peninsula, but nothing was really done to reform the
							Turkish administration or to make the lot of the Christian subjects more secure.</p>

						<note rend="right">Terrible conditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina under Turkish
							rule</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">80.</hi> Some idea of the situation of the people under the Sultan's
							rule may be derived from the report of an English traveler (Mr. Arthur Evans) in 1875.
							In the Turkish provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina he found that outside the large
							towns, where European consuls were present, neither the honor, property, nor lives of
							the Christians were safe, because the authorities were blind to any outrage committed
							by a Mohammedan. The Sultan's taxes fell principally on the peasants, in the form of a
							tenth of their produce. It was a common custom for the collectors (who were often not
							Mohammedans but brutal Christians) to require the peasant to pay the tax in cash
							before the harvesting of the ripe crop, and if he could not meet the charges, the
							taxgatherer simply said, "Then your harvest shall rot on the ground till you pay it."
							When this oppression was resisted the most cruel punishments were meted out to the
							offenders.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Bulgarian atrocities (1876)</note>

						<p>In 1874 a failure of crops aggravated the intolerable conditions and an insurrection
							broke out in Bosnia and Herzegovina which set the whole Balkan peninsula aflame. The
							Bulgarians around Philippopolis, incited to hopes of independence by the events in the
							states to the west, assassinated some of the Turkish officials and gave the Ottoman
							government a pretext for the most terrible atrocities in the history of Turkish rule
							in Europe.</p>

						<note rend="right">Gladstone pleads with his countrymen to aid the Balkan
							Christians</note>

						<p>While the European powers, in their usual fashion, were exchanging futile diplomatic
							notes on the situation, Servia and Montenegro declared war on the Sultan, and the
							Christians in the Balkan region made a frantic appeal to the West for immediate help.
							A good deal naturally depended on the position taken by England,-- the stanch defender
							of Turkey. Gladstone, then leader of the Liberals, urged his countrymen to break the
							unholy alliance between England and "the unspeakable Turk." But Gladstone's party was
							not in power, and Lord Beaconsfield was fearful that English encouragement to the
							Slavic rebels <pb id="VAB8216-529" n="460"/> in the Sultan's dominions would only
							result in their becoming independent and allying themselves with England's enemy,
							Russia. The English believed that in the interest of their trade they must continue to
							resist any movement which might destroy the power of the Sultan, who was not likely to
							hamper their eastern commerce.</p>

						<note rend="right">Russia overwhelms the Sultan in a short war, 1877-1878</note>

						<p>The negotiations of the powers having come to nothing, Russia determined, in 1877, to
							act alone. Her declaration of war was shortly followed by Russian victories, and in
							1878 a Russian army entered Adrianople,-- which was equivalent to an announcement to
							the world that Ottoman dominion in Europe had come to an end. England protested, but
							the Sultan was forced to sign the Treaty of San Stefano with the Tsar and to recognize

						<note rend="right">Union of Bulgaria and Eastern Roumelia, 1885</note>

						<p>Under the terms of the treaty the inhabitants of the Bulgarian principality proceeded

						<note rend="right">Turkish dominion in Europe now restricted to the Macedonian region

						<p>Thus the Turkish Empire in Europe has shrunk to a narrow strip of territory,-- less

							to which the name Macedonia is generally applied. This area is broken everywhere by
							mountain ranges and is inhabited by such a complicated mixture of races that it has

							predominate. To the north and east, over against Bulgaria and Eastern Roumelia, dwell
							Bulgarians who have not yet been incorporated into the kingdom of Bulgaria. In the

							Bulgarians because the languages of the two peoples, though differing in Servia and
							Bulgaria, are somewhat blended in the Macedonian regions. Scattered through the

						<note rend="right">Disorders in Macedonia</note>

						<p>Clearly a population representing so many races, and varying in stages of culture
							from wild mountain outlaws to orderly industrial communities, would present grave

							Christian bandits carry off other Christians into the mountains and hold them for
							ransom; isolated uprisings often result in the assassination of the Mohammedan
							officials in the district; and constant friction between the two faiths makes orderly
							government impossible. The Turkish administration in Macedonia is bound to excite
							opposition and disorder, in which it cannot be denied that many of the Christians
							delight to share. Lingering only by the sufferance of the powers, it seems inevitably
							doomed to extinction. Even the overthrow of Sultan Abdul-Hamid II in 1909 and the
							establishment of constitutional government in Turkey do not seem to have improved the

						<p>Notwithstanding adverse circumstances, the Greeks are ambitious to become a great and

							George," who in the early part of the nineteenth century had led the struggle for
							independence and become a national hero.</p>

						<note rend="right">Roumania troubles with agrarian disorders</note>

						<p>Although the Roumanian kingdom has undergone no palace revolutions like the
							neighboring Servia, it has suffered from political agitations and agrarian disorders.
							The constitution is so arranged as to vest nearly all political power in the hands of
							those possessing considerable property; and this state of affairs rouses the constant
							protests of a rapidly growing radical party. Even more serious, however, than the
							political agitation is the unrest among the peasants who compose the vast majority of
							the nation. They claim that ever since the emancipation of the serfs, in 1864, they
							have been the victims of grasping money lenders and tyrannical landlords.</p>

						<note rend="right">Bulgaria gaining in prosperity</note>

						<p>The new state, Bulgaria, which secured its independence in 1908, is in many respects

						<p>The petty kingdom of Montenegro, smaller in area than the state of Connecticut and
							with a population of about two hundred and thirty thousand, has caused Europe more
							trouble than its size warrants, but since it became independent in 1878 it has ceased
							to be of any particular interest. Until 1905 it was governed by an absolute prince,
							but he was at last forced to adopt the fashion of western Europe and establish
							constitutional government with a parliament elected by popular vote. In 1910 the
							prince assumed the title of king.</p>

						<note rend="right">England theleading industrial nation of the world in 1815</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">82.</hi> During the first half of the nineteenth century, England stood
							easily at the head of all the nations of the world in the output of her mines and
							factories and the vast extent of her commerce. Napoleon's efforts to render the
							Continent independent of England and her colonies had failed; there was not a single
							steam engine in France in 1812, and it was not until after Napoleon's fall that France
							set herself seriously to compete with England by the introduction of machinery.
							Germany was less favorably situated than France, since it had for years been the main
							theater of long and devastating wars. It was not a united nation, but a collection of
							practically independent states which were divided, previous to the development of the
								<hi rend="i">Zoliverein</hi>, by high tariff duties, and embarrassed by a great
							variety of coinage. Italy and Austria suffered from similar disadvantages.</p>

						<note rend="right">The United States an agricultural country in 1815</note>

						<p>The United States of America, now so formidable in every market of the world, had in
							1815 a small and scattered population. Its interests were almost exclusively
							agricultural, and although its ships enjoyed a considerable carrying trade on the high
							seas, its people lacked the capital necessary to develop the immense natural resources
							of the country and thereby become a serious menace to the manufacturers of the Old
							World.</p>

						<note rend="right">All of the great nations now rivals for foreign trade</note>

						<p>In considering the development of commerce and industry since 1815 it is necessary to
							distinguish between the manufacturing which is carried on within a country to meet its
							own <pb id="VAB8216-536" n="467"/> demands, and the production of commodities destined
							to be sold at a profit to other countries. During the Middle Ages, although there was
							some commerce, production was carried on principally for domestic consumption.
							Gradually, however, international trade has taken on larger and larger proportions and
							has now become one of the most striking characteristics of our present civilization.
							The introduction of machinery in England naturally led her manufacturers to lay more
							and more stress upon foreign trade, since they could readily produce a great deal more
							than they could sell at home. The progress of industry on the Continent and in the
							United States has produced exactly the same result, and the nations of the earth have
							now become rivals in their eagerness to secure as large a share of the world's markets
							as possible.</p>

						<note rend="right">Beginnings of steam navigation</note>

						<p>Closely connected with this prodigious expansion of commerce has been the development
							of the means of transportation and communication. The discovery that steam could be
							used to carry goods cheaply and speedily to all parts of the world has made it
							possible for the manufacturer to widen his market indefinitely, and has, in fact, made
							the world one great market place.</p>

						<p>The problem of applying steam to navigation had long occupied inventors, but the
							honor of making the steamship a success commercially belongs to Robert Fulton. In the
							spring of 1807 he launched his <hi rend="i">Clermont</hi> at New York, and in the
							autumn of that year the "new water monster" made its famous trip to Albany.<ref
								id="ref_315" rend="super" target="note_315">1</ref> Transoceanic navigation began in
							1819 with the voyage of the steamer Savannah from Savannah to St. Petersburg via Great
							Britain. The trip to Liverpool was made in twenty-five days, sails being used to help
							the engine.</p>

						<note rend="right">Steady increase in the size and speed of ocean vessels</note>

						<p>Within a quarter of a century steamships began to replace the old and uncertain
							sailing vessels, and to-day they compose two thirds of the net tonnage of the world's
							merchant marine.<ref id="ref_316" rend="super" target="note_316">2</ref>
							<note id="note_315"><ref target="ref_315" rend="super">1</ref> For Fulton's account of
								the trip, see <hi rend="i">Readings</hi>, Vol. II, pp. 406 <hi rend="i"
								>sq.</hi></note>
							<note id="note_316"><ref target="ref_316" rend="super">2</ref> Yet, contrary to common
								opinion, there is a steady increase in the number of sailing vessels used. They are
								easily manned, require no coal, and, where speed is not important, promise to hold
								their own on the high seas for many generations.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-537" n="468"/> In 1840 the great Cunard Steamship Company inaugurated
							its transatlantic service, and since that time there has been a steady development in
							the number of navigation companies, as well as in the number of steam vessels and in
							their capacity for speed and freight. The <hi rend="i">Great Western</hi>, which
							startled the world in 1838 by steaming from Bristol to New York in fifteen days and
							ten hours, was a ship of 1378 tons, 212 feet long, and had an indicated horse power of
							1260, with a daily consumption of 36 tons of coal. The <hi rend="i">Lusitania</hi>,
							launched in 1907, has a gross tonnage of 32,500 tons, engines of 68,000 horse power,
							is 785 feet long, and carries a supply of over 5000 tons of coal for its journey
							across the Atlantic, which lasts less than five days. A new German vessel, the <hi
								rend="i">Imperator</hi>, launched in 1912, has a tonnage of over 50,000 tons.</p>

						<note rend="right">The oceans now marked with commercial routes</note>

						<p>It is now possible to make the journey from Southampton to New York, three thousand
							miles, in five days or less, with almost the regularity of an express train. A
							commercial map of the world shows that the globe is now crossed in every direction by
							definite routes which are followed by innumerable freight and passenger steamers
							passing regularly from one port to another.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Suez Canal completed in 1869</note>

						<p>The East and the West have been brought much nearer together by the piercing of the
							Isthmus of Suez, which formerly barred the way from the Mediterranean Sea to the
							Indian Ocean. This enterprise was carried out under the direction of the great French
							engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps. After ten years of work the canal was opened to traffic
							in November, 1869. In 1905 over five thousand vessels took advantage of it, thus
							avoiding the detour of thousands of miles involved in rounding the Cape of Good Hope.
							An agreement among all the leading European powers provides that the canal shall be
							open at all times for war ships as well as merchantmen, but no act of war shall be
							permitted in its neighborhood.</p>

						<note rend="right">Proposed Panama Canal</note>

						<p>The Isthmus of Panama offers an obstacle to trade which has for years been the object
							of discussion and negotiations. In 1872 President Grant appointed a commission to
							consider <pb id="VAB8216-538" n="469"/> the construction of a canal, but nothing was
							done until 1881, when de Lesseps, encouraged by the flattering success of his first
							venture, succeeded in organizing the Panama Canal Company in France and work was
							actually begun. But the efforts to obtain the necessary funds for completing the
							costly enterprise led to widespread bribery of members of the French Parliament, which
							was disclosed in 1892. This scandal was followed by the dissolution of the French
							company. In 1902 the Congress of the United States authorized the President to
							purchase for forty million dollars the property in which the French investors had sunk
							so much money. Arrangements with the republic of Colombia for the construction of the
							canal by the United States having come to naught, the state of Panama, through which
							the line of the proposed canal passes, seceded from Colombia in 1903, and its
							independence was immediately recognized by President Roosevelt. A treaty in regard to
							the canal zone was then duly concluded with the new republic, and after some delays
							the work of the French company was resumed by the United States and is now progressing
							rapidly.</p>

						<note rend="right">The beginnings of steam locomotion on land</note>

						<p>Just as the gigantic modern steamship has taken the place of the schooner and clipper
							for the rapid trade of the world, so, on land, the merchandise which used to be
							dragged by means of horses and oxen or carried in slow canal boats is being
							transported in long trains of capacious cars, each of which holds as much as fifteen
							or twenty large wagons. The story of the locomotive, like that of the spinning machine
							or steam engine, is the history of many experiments and their final combination by a
							successful inventor. Scores of inventors were at work on the problem and thus smoothed
							the way for the triumph of George Stephenson.</p>

						<note rend="right">George Stephenson (1781-1848) and the development of railways in
							England</note>

						<p>This distinguished inventor, in 1814, built a small locomotive, known as "Puffing
							Billy," which was used at the mines, and in 1825, with the authorization of
							Parliament, he opened between Stockton and Darlington, in the northern part of
							England, a line <pb id="VAB8216-539" n="470"/> for the conveyance of passengers and
							freight. About this time a road was being projected between Liverpool and Manchester,
							and in an open competition, in which five locomotives were entered, Stephenson's
							"Rocket" was chosen for the new railroad, which was formally opened in 1830.<ref
								id="ref_317" rend="super" target="note_317">1</ref> This famous engine weighed about
							seven tons and ran at an average speed of thirteen miles an hour,-- a small affair
							when compared with the giant locomotive of our day, weighing a hundred tons and
							running fifty miles an hour.<ref id="ref_318" rend="super" target="note_318">2</ref>
							Within fifteen years trains were running regularly between Liverpool, Manchester,
							Birmingham, and London, and at the close of the century Great Britain had twenty-two
							thousand miles of railway carrying over a billion passengers annually.</p>

						<note rend="right">Many German railways owned by the government</note>

						<p>The first railway was opened in Germany in 1835, but the development of the system
							was greatly hindered by the territorial divisions which then existed. It was in the
							great state of Prussia that construction went on with the most rapidity, largely under
							government ownership and control. Some of the lines were built directly by the
							government, and others were later purchased by it. This policy has been continued, and
							at present by far the greater part of the German railways are owned by the imperial or
							by state governments. In Austria-Hungary, also, the majority of the lines are owned or
							operated by the goverment.</p>

						<note rend="right">The French government aids in the construction of railways</note>

						<p>The first railway in France was built in 1828, but owing to the timidity of investors
							the development was slow. Five years later the government took up the project of
							connecting Paris and the principal cities by railway lines, and it guaranteed in 1840
							the interest on the investment required for the construction of a line from the
							capital to Orleans. Two years later the government agreed to furnish about one half of
							the money necessary to build a vast railway system throughout France, leaving the work
							of construction and operation largely in the hands of private <note id="note_317"><ref
									target="ref_317" rend="super">1</ref> For an account of the opening, see <hi

							<note id="note_318"><ref target="ref_318" rend="super">2</ref> It will be noted that
								this is the "average" speed on regular runs. For short distances the "Rocket" made

							<pb id="VAB8216-540" n="471"/> companies. As a result of this intervention on the part
							of the State, there are three types of railways in France: those which have been
							largely financed by the government but are operated by private companies; those which
							are entirely private; and those owned and operated by the State. According to the
							terms of the franchises, however, all the French railways will eventually revert to
							the State.</p>

						<note rend="right">Railway construction in Africa and Asia</note>

						<p>Not only is Europe bound together by a network of nearly two hundred thousand miles
							of railway, but railway construction Africa and is rapidly advancing in Africa and
							Asia, preparing cheap outlets for the products of western mills and mines. As we have
							seen, the Trans-Siberian road has connected Europe overland with the Pacific,<ref
								id="ref_319" rend="super" target="note_319">1</ref> and Russia has also pushed lines
							southward toward Persia and Afghanistan; British India has over thirty thousand miles,
							and China about six thousand miles, of railways. Even Africa has over twenty thousand
							miles, most of which is in Egypt, Algeria, Tunis, and the British possessions. Before
							long, trains from Cairo to the Cape will rush through the jungle lands which were
							first penetrated by the white man in Queen Victoria's reign.</p>

						<note rend="right">Development of rapid means of communication,-- the penny post</note>

						<p>Quite as essential to the world market as railway and steamship lines are the easy
							and inexpensive means of communication afforded by the post, telephone, telegraph, and
							cable. The English "penny post" is now so commonplace as no longer to excite wonder,
							but to men of Frederick the Great's time it would have seemed impossible. Until 1839
							in England the postage on an ordinary letter was a shilling for a short distance. In
							that year a reform measure long advocated by Rowland Hill was carried, establishing a
							uniform penny post throughout Great Britain. The result of reducing the rate of
							postage for letters to this nominal sum exceeded all expectations in vastly increasing
							the frequency with which people wrote to one another. Other European countries have
							followed the example of Great Britain in reducing postage, and now the world is moving
							rapidly in <note id="note_319"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_319" rend="super"
										>1</ref> See above, p. 443.<ptr targType="pb" target="VAB8216-510"/></hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-541" n="472"/> the direction of a universal two-cent rate. Already a
							letter can be carried from Basutoland in South Africa to Montreal, Canada, for two
							cents in less time than it took news to cross the Atlantic when Queen Victoria came to
							the throne.</p>

						<note rend="right">Telegraphs and cables</note>
						<note rend="right">Wireless telegraphy</note>

						<p>No less wonderful is the development of the telegraph system. In 1911 the British
							post office operated over 1,230,000 miles of telegraph and telephone wire and
							transmitted nearly 90,000,000 messages. Moreover distant and obscure places in Africa
							and Asia are being brought into close touch with one another and with Europe. China
							now has lines connecting all the important cities of the republic and affording direct
							overland communication between Peking and Paris. The wonderful network is spreading
							into Africa,-- the French, German, and British possessions being already well
							equipped. In October, 1907, Marconi established regular communication across the
							Atlantic by means of the wireless system of telegraphy discovered some years before;
							and ocean steamships are now equipped with wireless instruments which enable them to
							communicate with the land and other vessels at all times. It was this marvelous
							equipment which brought assistance to the survivors of the Titanic after its wreck in
							1912.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Industrial Revolution favors growth of foreign trade</note>

						<p>The Industrial Revolution which enables Europe to produce far more goods than it can
							sell in its own markets, and the rapid transportation which permits producers to
							distribute their commodities over the whole surface of the globe, have combined to
							produce the modern competition for foreign markets. The European nations have secured
							the control of practically all the territory occupied by defenseless peoples in Africa
							and Asia, and have introduced western ideas of business into China and Japan, where
							steamships now ply the navigable rivers, and railroads are being rapidly built.</p>

						<note rend="right">Necessity for investments stimulates imperialism</note>

						<p>The process of colonization and of westernizing the Oriental peoples has been further
							hastened by the anxiety of capitalists to find advantageous investments for their
							surplus wealth. The profits of industry pile up so rapidly that stock companies are
								<pb id="VAB8216-542" n="473"/> everywhere formed to develop railroads and mines in
							backward countries. Great Britain alone is said to have about ten billion dollars
							invested abroad; one fifth of Russian industrial enterprises are financed by
							foreigners, who are also to a considerable extent constructing the railroads in China.
							The Germans supply the money for large banking concerns in Brazil, Buenos Ayres, and
							Valparaiso, which in turn stimulate industry and the construction of railways.</p>

						<note rend="right">Influence of manufactures and capitalists on foreign policies of
							government</note>
						<note rend="right">Nature of modern imperialism</note>

						<p>These two powerful forces-- factories seeking markets and capital seeking
							investment-- are shaping the foreign and commercial policies of every important
							European country. They alone explain why the great industrial nations are embarking on
							what has been termed a policy of <hi rend="i">imperialism</hi>, which means a policy
							of adding distant territories for the purpose of controlling their products, getting
							the trade with the natives, and investing money in the development of natural
								resources.<ref id="ref_320" rend="super" target="note_320">1</ref> Sometimes this
							imperialism takes the form of outright annexation, such as the acquisition of the
							Philippines by the United States, or of Togoland by Germany. Again, it assumes the
							form of a "protectorate," which is a declaration on the part of a nation to the effect
							that, "This is our particular piece of land; we are not intending to take all the
							responsibility of governing it just now; but we want other nations to keep out, for we
							may annex it sooner or later." Sometimes imperialism goes no farther than the securing
							of concessions in undeveloped countries, such as foreigners have obtained in China or
							citizens of the United States in Mexico; but such concessions are a fruitful source of
							annexations, especially when the interests of investors are not thoroughly protected
							by the government that grants them franchises.</p>

							sooner was a new country brought to the attention of Europeans than missionaries
							flocked thither with the traders and soldiers. When America was discovered and the sea
							route opened to the East, the Franciscan and Dominican friars braved every danger to
							bring the gospel to them that sat in darkness. They were reinforced about 1540 by the
							powerful Jesuit order. Francis Xavier began his famous missionary career in 1542,
							first visiting India, then Japan, and dying within sight of the shores of China,
							yearning to penetrate that mysterious land. The activities of his fellow-Jesuits in
							Canada and the Mississippi Valley and in South America have been mentioned
							earlier.</p>

						<note rend="right">Roman Catholic missions</note>

						<p>In 1622 the great missionary board of the Roman Catholic Church was given its final
							organization and the name it still retains,-- <hi rend="i">Congregatio de propaganda
								Fide</hi>. It has its head-quarters at Rome and is composed of twenty-nine cardinals
							and their assistants. In its colleges and schools missionaries are trained for their
							work and taught the requisite languages. Its printing office issues the necessary
							books and tracts. Of the various Catholic associations which have been formed to
							assist it in its work the most important is the Society for the Propagation of the
							Faith, which, since its formation at Lyons in 1822, has contributed over seventy
							million dollars to the cause. The Roman Catholic Church now reckons millions of
							adherents in Turkey, Persia, Arabia, India, Siam, Indo-China, Malaysia, the Chinese
							Republic, Korea, Japan, Africa, and Polynesia.</p>

						<note rend="right">Protestant missions</note>

						<p>For a long time after the Protestant Revolt the reformed churches showed little ardor
							for foreign missions, although as early as 1556 Calvin's city of Geneva sent men to
							preach the gospel in Brazil. The Dutch undertook to Christianize the East Indies in
							1602, and their rivals, the English, also did something to promote missions. Among the
							earliest Protestant missionary associations was the Society for the Promotion of
							Christian Knowledge, founded in 1695 and conducted under the auspices of the Church of
							England. In the eighteenth century the <pb id="VAB8216-544" n="475"/> Moravians and
							Methodists joined in the efforts to convert the heathen, and in 1792 William Carey, a
							cobbler and Baptist minister, formed the Baptist Missionary Union.</p>

						<p>The United States entered the field in 1810, when the American Board of Foreign
							Missions was organized. As time went on, practically all the Protestant denominations
							established each its board of foreign missions, and the United States has rivaled
							Europe in the distinction and energy of the missionaries it has sent out and in the
							generous support its people have given them. About the middle of the nineteenth
							century the various boards began to hold conferences with the object of rendering
							their work more efficient by cooperation and by dividing up the fields among the
							various boards. Bible societies have been engaged in translating the Scriptures into
							every known language and scattering copies of them broadcast. It is estimated that
							Protestants contribute about twenty million dollars a year to foreign missions. This
							sum serves to support some fourteen or fifteen thousand missionaries, who have
							gathered into their churches a million and a half converts.</p>

						<note rend="right">Important effects of missions spreading European culture</note>

						<p>Missionaries have usually been the first to bring regions remote from Europe into
							contact with western civilization. They have not alone spread the knowledge of the
							Christian religion and its standards of morality, but have carried with them modern
							scientific ideas and modern inventions. They have reduced to writing the languages of
							peoples previously ignorant of the existence of an alphabet. They have conquered cruel
							superstitions, extirpated human sacrifices and cannibalism, and done much to make the
							lot of woman more tolerable. Their physicians have introduced rational methods of
							treating the sick, and their schools have given an education to millions who without
							them would have been left in complete barbarism. Finally, they have encouraged
							thousands of Japanese, Chinese, and representatives of other peoples to visit Europe
							and America. and thus prepare themselves to become apostles of western ideas among
							their fellows. The explorations and investigations carried <pb id="VAB8216-545"
								n="476"/> on by the missionaries have served vastly to increase the general
							knowledge of the world and its inhabitants. Their maps and their scientific reports on
							languages and customs have in many instances proved of the highest value. They have
							also created a demand for western commodities and opened the way for trade.</p>

						<note rend="right">How missions have led to the extension of European control in Asia
							and Africa</note>

						<p>In some instances the missionaries have doubtless shown too little appreciation of
							the ancient culture of India, China, and Japan. They have rudely denounced the
							cherished traditions and the rooted prejudices of the peoples to whom they came. Even
							the most prudent and sagacious among them could hardly have avoided arousing the
							hostility of those whose most revered institutions they felt it their duty to attack.
							So it has come about that the missionaries have often been badly treated, have
							undergone great hardships, and have even been murdered by infuriated mobs. This has
							led to the armed interference of their respective governments, and has more than once,
							as we shall see, served as an excuse for annexations and the formation of
							protectorates and spheres of influence. Some illustrations of the rÃ´le of the
							missionaries will be found in the following sections. We shall turn first to the
							development of Europe's interest in China.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">83.</hi> The relations of Europe to China extend back into ancient

							Chinese monarch, and in the Middle Ages missionaries labored to introduce Christianity
							into China. It was not, however, until after the opening of the water route around the
							Cape of Good Hope that European trade with China became important. Early in the
							sixteenth century the Portuguese merchants appeared in Chinese harbors, offering
							western merchandise in exchange for tea and silks. In 1537 the Portuguese rented a
							trifling bit of land of Macao, off Canton-- a post which they hold to-day.</p>

						<note rend="right">Chinese exclusiveness</note>

						<p>It must be said, however, that the Chinese did not welcome foreign interference.
							Their officials regarded the European merchants as barbarians. When, in 1655, the
							Dutch sent two envoys to the Chinese emperor, they were only received on condition
							that they would prostrate themselves before his throne and strike their heads nine
							times on the earth as evidence of their inferiority. In spite of this treatment Dutch
							and English merchants flocked to Canton, the sole port at which the Chinese emperor
							permitted regular commerce with foreign countries.</p>

						<note rend="right">The "Opium War"</note>

						<p>Repeated efforts were made, particularly by the English, to get into direct
							communication with the government at Peking, but they were steadily rebuffed and were
							only able to establish the commercial relations which they sought by an armed conflict
							in 1840, known as the " Opium War."<ref id="ref_322" rend="super" target="note_322"
								>1</ref> The Chinese had attempted to prevent all traffic in this drug, but the
							English found it so profitable that they were unwilling to give up the trade. When, in
							1839, the Chinese government seized many thousand chests of opium and informed the
							British that the traffic would have to stop, war broke out.</p>

						<note rend="right">Treaty ports opened</note>

						<p>The British, of course, with their modern implements of warfare, were speedily
							victorious, and the Chinese were forced to agree, in the Treaty of Nanking, to pay a
							heavy indemnity, to cede to the British the island of Honkong, which lies at the mouth
							of the Canton River, and to open to foreign commerce the ports of Amoy, Fuchau,
							Ningpo, and Shanghai on the same terms as Canton. The United States, taking advantage
							of this war, secured similar commercial privileges in 1844.</p>

						<p>From the Opium War to the present date China has been troubled with foreign
							invasions. Napoleon III, supported by the English, waged war on China in 1858 and
							forced the emperor to open new ports to European trade, including Tientsin, which was
							dangerously near the imperial city of Peking. Since that time other leading ports have
							been opened, and now there are over forty points where foreign merchants <note

							completely isolated from the rest of the world; but now, through a series of
							extraordinary events, she has become one of the conspicuous members of the family of
							nations. American newspapers deal as fully with her foreign policy as with that of
							France or Germany; we are familiar with the portraits of her statesmen and warriors,
							and her exquisite art has many enthusiastic admirers in England and America. Her
							people, who are somewhat more numerous than the inhabitants of the British Isles,
							resemble the Chinese in appearance and owe to China the beginnings of their culture

						<note rend="right">The feudal period in Japan</note>

						<p>Little is known of the early Mikados (emperors) of Japan, and during the twelfth
							century the <hi rend="i">shogun</hi>, or commander in chief of the empire, was able to
							bring the sovereign powers into his own hands (somewhat as the mayor of the palace had
							done in the Frankish kingdom), while the emperor began to live in retirement in his
							capital of Kyoto. Conditions in Japan resembled those in western Europe during the
							same period. Scattered about the country were the castles of powerful feudal lords
							(the <hi rend="i">daimios</hi>), who continued, until the nineteenth century, to enjoy
							powers similar to the vassals of the mediaeval European kings.</p>

						<note rend="right">Brief period of intercourse with Europeans in the late sixteenth and
							early seventeenth century</note>

						<p>Rumors of the existence of Japan reached Europe through the Venetian traveler, Marco
							Polo, at the end of the thirteenth <pb id="VAB8216-551" n="479"/> century, but the
							Portuguese navigator Pinto appears to have been the first European to reach Japan, in
							the year 1542. Some years later the great Jesuit missionary, Francis Xavier,
							accompanied by some Japanese who had been converted to Christianity a at Goa, made the
							first attempt to preach the Christian faith in the island. Spanish missionaries from
							Manila carried on the work, and it is reported that within thirty years.two hundred
							Christian churches had been erected and fifty thousand converts made.</p>

						<note rend="right">Persecution of Christian missionaries and expulsion of

						<p>The arrogance of the bishops, however, led the Japanese government to issue an edict,
							in 1586, forbidding the Japanese to accept Christianity, and ten years later some
							twenty thousand converts are said to have been put to death. For a time the shoguns
							favored the few Dutch and English merchants who came to their shores and permitted
							factories to be opened at Yedo and elsewhere, but the quarrels between the Dutch and
							English and the constant drain of silver paid out for foreign merchandise led the
							Japanese to impose restrictions on foreigners, so that in the time of Louis XIV all of
							them had departed, except a few Dutch on the island of Deshima. From that time on, for
							nearly two hundred years, Japan remained a nation apart, with practically no
							intercourse with foreigners.</p>

						<p>In 1853 Commodore Perry visited Yokohama with a message from the United States

							were made upon foreigners in the name of the emperor, who disapproved the shogun's
							action. An Englishman by the name of Richardson was killed in 1862 on the great

							whereupon the English bombarded Kagoshima, the stronghold of the Satsuma clan.</p>

						<note rend="right">Two leading clans become convinced that they have much to learn from

						<note rend="right">Revolution in Japan. Disappearance of the shogunate and the

						<p>Meanwhile a great revolution was taking place in Japan; the power of the shogun was
							rapidly declining, and in October, 1867, he was forced to resign his office. This left
							the Mikado not only the nominal but the real ruler of Japan. He emerged from his
							ancient seclusion in the sacred city of Kyoto, and removed the capital to Yedo, which
							was given the new name of Tokyo, or "northern capital." The feudal princes, who had,
							in general, sided with the Mikado against the shogun, now agreed peacefully <pb
								id="VAB8216-553" n="481"/> to surrender their titles and prerogatives in the
							interests of their country, and in July, 1871, feudalism was formally abolished
							throughout the empire. Serfdom was also done away with and the army and navy reformed
							in accordance with western models.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Industrial Revolution in Japan</note>

						<p>Since that date the modernizing of Japan has progressed with incredible rapidity.
							Although the Japanese still continue to carry on their ancient industries, kneeling on
							their straw mats, with a few simple implements and no machinery, western industries
							have been introduced side by side with the older arts. Students were sent abroad to
							investigate the most recent achievements in science, a university was established at
							Tokyo, and the system of education completely revolutionized. There was not a steam
							mill in the islands when Commodore Perry cast anchor there; now there are nearly a
							hundred great cotton factories. Since the railroad between Tokyo and the neighboring
							port of Yokohama was opened in 1872, several thousand miles of railways have been
							constructed, and the Japanese, who are very fond of travel, can go readily from one
							end to the other of their archipelago. Great towns have sprung up. Tokyo has over two
							million inhabitants, and the manufacturing city of Osaka more than a million. The
							total population of the islands is now over fifty-one millions, more than one half
							that of the United States, but crowded into an area of about one hundred and
							seventy-five thousand square miles.</p>

						<note rend="right">Constitutional government established in Japan, 1890</note>

						<note rend="right">Japan seeks an outlet for her products</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">85.</hi> After carrying out the various reforms mentioned above, Japan
							found herself confronted, like the western nations, with the necessity of extending
							her trade and securing foreign markets. Her merchants and her ships became the rivals
							of the Europeans in the neighboring seas, where her commerce has increased far more
							rapidly than that of the western nations.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Chino-Japanese War over Korea, 1894-1895</note>

						<p>On the opposite side of the Sea of Japan lies Korea, a land which has become well
							known throughout the world on account of the two bloody wars to which the question of
							its possession has given rise. For a long time China and Japan were rival claimants to
							the Korean kingdom. When Japanese trade developed, the question of control in Korea
							became an important one, and in 1894 it led to war between the two countries. But the
							Chinese, with their ancient weapons and organization, were no match for the Japanese,
							who had eagerly adopted every device of western warfare, and in a short time the
							Chinese armies had been driven from Korea and the campaign was transferred to the
							neighboring Manchuria, where the Japanese took Port Arthur. China then called upon the
							western powers for assistance, but they did not take action until Japan, in the Treaty
							of Shimonoseki, had forced China's representative, Li Hung Chang, to recognize the
							complete independence of Korea (which practically meant opening it up to the Japanese)
							and to cede to Japan Port Arthur, the Liaotung peninsula on which it lies, and the
							island of Formosa.</p>

						<note rend="right">Russia, France and Germany drive Japan from the mainland</note>

						<p>Russia, France, and Germany had watched the course of events with jealous eyes, and
							now intervened to prevent Japan from securing a foothold on the mainland. Russia was
							the real leader in this intervention, for she coveted just the region which had been
							ceded to Japan. Japan was exhausted by the war with China and at that time had no
							adequate navy. Therefore the Mikado, at the demand of the three powers, withdrew from
							Manchuria.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-555" n="483"/>

						<note rend="right">Russia thereupon gains valuable concessions in China</note>

						<p>The result of this compromise was to throw China into the arms of Russia, which
							proceeded to take every advantage of the situation. China had been forced to pay a
							heavy indemnity to Japan in lieu of the cession of the Liaotung peninsula; and when
							the Chinese government attempted to borrow a large sum from England to meet this
							obligation, Russia interfered and herself loaned China eighty million dollars without
							security. In this way China became dependent upon her as a creditor. The Russians were
							permitted by the Chinese emperor to build a railroad across his territory, which would
							enable them to reach Vladivostok by a direct line from Irkutsk. Moreover, in order to
							guard the railway line, Russian soldiers were to be introduced freely into Manchuria.
							It is clear that these arrangements gave Russia a great advantage over the other
							European powers, since she controlled the Chinese government through its debt and
							occupied Manchuria with her soldiers.</p>

						<note rend="right">Germany seizes territory in the Shantung peninsula</note>

						<p>Meanwhile the Germans found an excuse for strengthening themselves in the same
							region. A German missionary having been murdered in the province of Shantung, which
							lies opposite Korea, a German squadron appeared in Kiauchau Bay, in November, 1897,
							landed a force of marines, and raised the German flag. As a compensation for the
							murder of the missionary, Germany demanded a long lease of Kiauchau, with the right to
							build railways in the region and work mines. Since acquiring Kiauchau the Germans have
							built harbors, constructed forts, military barracks, machine shops, etc. In short, a
							model German town has been constructed on the Chinese coast, which, with its defenses,
							constitutes a fine base for further extension of Germany's sphere of influence.</p>

						<note rend="right">Russia leases Port Arthur</note>

						<p>At first the Tsar hoped to balk the plans of Germany, but decided, instead, to secure
							additional advantages for himself. Accordingly Port Arthur and the waters adjacent to
							the Liaotung peninsula upon which it lies were leased to Russia, in March, 1898, for a
							period of twenty-five years, subject to renewal by mutual consent. Port Arthur was to
							be open only <pb id="VAB8216-556" n="484"/> to Chinese and Russian vessels, and Russia
							immediately began to build fortifications which were believed to render the town
							impregnable. A railway was constructed to Harbin, connecting Port Arthur with
							Vladivostok and the Trans-Siberian Railway. This at last gave Russia a port on the
							Pacific which, unlike Vladivostok, was free from ice the year round.</p>

						<note rend="right">The British lease Weihaiwei and conclude a treaty of alliance with
							Japan</note>

						<p>Great Britain, learning of the negotiations, sent a fleet northward from Hongkong to
							the Gulf of Pechili, and induced China to lease to her Weihaiwei which lay just
							between the recent acquisitions of Germany and Russia. England, morover, believed it
							to be for her interest to be on good terms with Japan, and in 1902 an offensive and
							defensive alliance was concluded between the two powers, binding each to assist the
							other in case a third party joined in a conflict in which either was involved. For
							example, England must, under the provisions, aid Japan in a war with Russia, should
							France or Germany intervene.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Europeans begin to develop the natural resources of China</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">86.</hi> The foreigners were by no means content with establishing
							trading posts in China; they longed to develop the neglected natural resources of the
							empire, to open up communication by railroads and steamships, and to "westernize" the
							Orientals, in order that business might be carried on more easily with them, and new
							opportunities be found for profitable investments.</p>

						<note rend="right">Railroads built in China</note>

						<p>The first railroad in China was built by British promoters in 1876, from Shanghai to
							Wu-Sung, a point some fifteen miles to the north of that city. The Chinese, however,
							were horrified by this innovation, which they felt to be a desecration of the graves
							of their ancestors. Yielding to popular prejudice the government purchased the
							railroad, only to destroy it and throw the locomotives into the river. Nevertheless,
							five years later, the Chinese themselves, with the aid of British capital, began the
							construction of an imperial railroad system which now embraces <pb id="VAB8216-557"
								n="485"/> about six hundred miles. In 1895 other foreigners besides the Russians
							were once more permitted to undertake the construction of railway lines, and there are
							now several thousand miles of road open for traffic. The French and Germans are also
							interested in opening up the regions within their spheres of influence, and the
							British are planning to push into the interior of China a line running northward from
							Rangoon through Mandalay. Thousands of miles of railway are now projected, and
							doubtless within half a century China will be covered with a network of lines which
							cannot fail to do much to revolutionize her ancient habits and civilization.</p>

						<note rend="right">Steamships, post, and telegraph</note>

						<p>In 1898 the internal water ways of China were opened to foreign ships. Several lines
							of well-equipped steamships now ply on the Canton River and follow the waters of the
							Yangtze River for a thousand miles inland. Many thousand miles of telegraph lines are
							in operation, affording overland connection with Europe. The post office, organized in
							1897, has branches throughout the republic.</p>

						<note rend="right">China befins a great series of reforms</note>

						<p>It was inevitable that intercourse with European nations should affect the whole
							policy and ideals of the Chinese government. In 1889 a decree was issued establishing
							an annual audience in which the emperor might show his "desire to treat with honor all
							the foreign ministers resident in Peking." A few years later the cumbersome ancient
							ceremonial was abolished and foreigners were received in a manner which indicated the
							recognition of their equality with Chinese of the same rank. In 1898, when Prince
							Henry of Prussia visited Peking, he was cordially greeted by the emperor, who shook
							hands with him in western fashion and conversed with him on a familiar footing.</p>

						<p>In the same year a series of decrees was issued with the object of reforming the army
							on models offered by those nations that had given so many proofs of their military
							superiority. New schools and colleges were planned with a view of starting the country
							on the road to progress. Chinese students were sent to Europe to study foreign methods
							of government, agricultural <pb id="VAB8216-558" n="486"/> schools were built, patent
							and copyright laws were introduced, and a department of mines and railroads was
							established, in order that China might no longer be obliged to leave these matters
							entirely in the hands of foreigners. Journalists were even encouraged to write on
							political questions.</p>

						<note rend="right">The conservatives oppose reforms in China</note>

						<p>These abrupt reforms aroused the superstitious horror of the conservative party. They
							found a sympathetic leader in the Dowager Empress, who had been regent during the
							early years of the emperor's reign. She succeeded in regaining her influence and in
							putting an end, for the time being, to the distasteful reforms. The Europeans, both
							missionaries and business men, nevertheless continued their activities, and the
							conservatives believed it necessary, therefore, to organize a great movement to drive
							out the "foreign devils," who had been, in their eyes, steadily undermining the
							ancient traditions of China.</p>

						<note rend="right">The "Boxers"</note>

						<p>Among those hostile to the foreigner none were more conspicuous than the secret
							society of the "Boxers," or, as they appear to have called themselves, the "Order of
							the Patriotic Harmonious Fists." They were quite willing to coÃ¶perate with the Dowager
							Empress in carrying out her designs against foreign influence. They proclaimed that
							the western nations were "lacerating China like tigers"; and summoned every patriotic
							Chinaman to rise in defense of his country.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Peking insurrection of 1900</note>

						<p>The party in favor of meeting the "Christian Peril" by violence rapidly increased.
							The Boxers, who were arming and drilling, knew very well that neither the Chinese
							officials nor the imperial troops would interfere with them. Missionaries and traders
							were murdered in the provinces, and although the government at Peking always declared
							that it was doing all it could to suppress disorder, the representatives of foreign
							nations in the capital became thoroughly alarmed. On June 20, 1900, the Boxers,
							supported by the troops, killed the German ambassador, Baron von Ketteler, while on
							his way to the palace to expostulate with the government. The Europeans were then
							besieged in the several legations and in the Catholic cathedral, <pb id="VAB8216-559"
								n="487"/> but, for some reason which is not clear, the Chinese did not murder them
							all, as they might easily have done.<ref id="ref_325" rend="super" target="note_325"

						<note rend="right">The powers intervene and settle affairs in China</note>

						<p>The powers determined upon immediate intervention, and in August a relief expedition,
							made up of Japanese, Russian, British, American, French, and German troops, fought its
							way from Tientsin to Peking, and brought relief to the imprisoned foreigners. The
							Chinese court left Peking, and the royal palace was desecrated and pillaged by the
							European troops, whose scandalous conduct disgraced the western world. Negotiations
							were now opened, and the aged Li Hung Chang rendered his last services by concluding
							an agreement in which China made certain reparations, including the payment of an
							indemnity of three hundred and twenty million dollars, and promised to repress all
							anti-foreign societies.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Chinese reform movement renewed</note>

						<p>Although the Dowager Empress still retained her power, the work of reform was again
							undertaken. The work of reorganizing the army was renewed, and students were again
							sent abroad in large numbers to investigate western methods of industry and
							government. By one of the most momentous decrees in the intellectual history of the
							world, the ancient classical system of education, which had for centuries been deemed
							an essential preparation for public office, was abolished in 1905.<ref id="ref_326"

							as the relation of capital to labor and the methods of stimulating modern industry.
							Even the Dowager Empress was obliged to yield to the progressive party, and in
							September, 1906, she went so far as to announce that China should prepare herself for

							1904</note>

						<p>Scarcely had the troubles due to the Boxer rising been adjusted when a new war cloud
							appeared in the East. The interest of Japan in finding markets has already been
							mentioned. The occupation of Manchuria and Port Arthur by the Russians seriously
							threatened Japanese extension in that direction; and when Russia secured from Korea a
							lumber cession in the Yalu valley and sent Cossacks to build forts in that region,
							Japan, which regarded Korea as lying within her sphere of influence, could hardly fail
							to protest. Russia had agreed repeatedly to withdraw from Manchuria, but had always
							failed to keep her promises when the time came. She had, moreover, guaranteed the
							integrity of Korea, upon whose territory she was now encroaching. Accordingly, in the
							summer of 1903, Japan opened negotiations with the Tsar's government with the object
							of inducing it to explain its purposes in Manchuria and Korea. Russia delayed and
							refused to commit herself. The Japanese, determined to have Korea for themselves,
							broke off diplomatic relations on February 5, 1904, and opened hostilities.</p>

						<note rend="right">Japan far better prepared for war than Russia</note>

						<p>Japan was well prepared for war and was, moreover, within easy reach of the field of

							captured the town of Dalny, which they made their naval headquarters. General Oku then
							began pushing the Russians northward toward Mukden, while General Nogi was left to
							besiege Port Arthur. For months the world watched in suspense the heroic attacks which
							the Japanese, at deadly cost to themselves, made upon the Russian fortress. Meanwhile
							fighting continued to the north along the line of the railroad. In October the
							Japanese were victorious in a fearful battle which raged south of Mukden for days,
							thus putting an end to General Kuropatkin's designs for relieving Port Arthur. As
							winter came on, the Japanese redoubled their efforts and the fortress at last
							surrendered, on January 1, 1905, after a siege of seven months, the horrors of which
							are perhaps without a parallel.</p>

							communication with the war office in Tokyo, and by the strictest discipline they
							checked disease and contagion in the hospitals. The Russian sanitary service was also
							of high order, as compared with previous wars. Late in February fighting again began,
							and for three weeks the Russians struggled against the combined Japanese armies; but

						<p><hi rend="b">87.</hi> The vast continent of Africa, the northeastern corner of which

							the upper reaches of that great river and the main body of the continent to the south
							of the Desert of Sahara, were practically unknown to them, and they had no suspicions
							that the land extended for five thousand miles to the south of Carthage.</p>

						<note rend="right">How the Mohammedans conquered northern Africa</note>

						<p>Shortly after the death of Mohammed in 632, his followers began the conquest of Egypt
							and northern Africa, and in less than a hundred years they had subdued all the region
							which had formerly been ruled from Rome. From Cape Guardafui on the extreme east, to
							Cape Verde, lying on the Atlantic, nearly five thousand miles to the west, they
							introduced their civilization and religion, so that to-day in the towns of Tunis and
							Morocco one sees many things to remind him of the conditions in Palestine or Arabia.,
							The Mohammedans built up a flourishing trade with the interior; they traversed the
							deserts and opened caravan routes through the sandy wastes; they pushed their trading
							settlements down the east coast as far as a point opposite Madagascar; they made maps
							of that portion of the continent with which they had become familiar, and described
							its climate and appearance. The knowledge which the Mohammedans had acquired naturally
							spread into Spain, which long formed a part of their dominions, and it appears
							probable that the Portuguese, who began to explore the west coast of Africa in the
							fifteenth <pb id="VAB8216-564" n="492"/> century, also received such information as
							they possessed from the Moors.</p>

						<note rend="right">Slow advance of the Europeans in Africa</note>

						<p>Europe was, however, a long time taking advantage of such knowledge of Africa as it
							secured through the Mohammedans. Although the Portuguese rounded the Cape of Good Hope
							in 1486, they found traffic in the East Indies too profitable to warrant their
							spending any time exploring and settling the uninviting interior of Africa. The most
							important trade which sprang up with that continent was the slave traffic, which was
							soon undertaken by the English, whose enterprising slavers made enormous fortunes at
							that cruel business. The Europeans generally were too busy settling the more inviting
							portions of the New World to undertake serious colonization in Africa. The Dutch post,
							established at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, did not prove to be very successful and
							had only a population of ten thousand at the opening of the nineteenth century. The
							French station, St. Louis, founded at the mouth of the Senegal River in the
							seventeenth century, was nothing more than a trading station; but it was destined to
							become important in the nineteenth century as a basis for the extension of French
							power in northwest Africa.</p>

						<note rend="right">The situation in 1815</note>

						<p>No serious attempts had been made by any of the European powers to colonize any

						<p>The situation in 1815 may be summed up as follows: In northern Africa the Sultan of
							Turkey was the nominal suzerain of Egypt and the so-called Barbary States, that is,
							Tripoli, Tunis, and Algeria. Morocco was, however, an independent state, as it still
							is nominally, under the Sultan of Morocco. France maintained her foothold at the mouth

						<p>Two years later Lieutenant Cameron, at the head of an English expedition which had
							also been organized with the hope of finding Livingstone, on learning of his death
							started from Zanzibar on the Indian Ocean and struggled through the heart of Africa,
							until he caught sight of the Atlantic Ocean at Benguela, south of the Congo River. The
							same year Stanley set out upon an expedition which is regarded as the most important
							in the annals of African exploration. After visiting Lakes Victoria Nyanza and
							Tanganyika, he journeyed across the country to the river Lualaba, and followed its
							course until he proved that it was only the headwaters of the Congo, down which he
							found his way to the Atlantic. Meanwhile other explorers, French and German, as well
							as English, were constantly adding to the knowledge of a hitherto unknown
							continent.</p>

						<note rend="right">Rapid partition of Africa</note>

						<p>Stanley's famous journey through the heart of "Darkest Africa" naturally aroused the
							intense interest of all the European powers, and within ten years after his triumphant
							return to Marseilles in 1878, the entire surface of Africa had been divided up among
							the powers, or marked out into "spheres of influence." A generation ago a map of
							Africa was for the most part indefinite and conjectural, except along the coast.
							To-day its natural features have been largely determined, and it is traversed by
							boundary lines almost as carefully drawn as those which separate the various European
							countries. The manner in which the English, French, and Germans have asserted their
							claims in Africa has been briefly explained in preceding chapters.</p>

						<note rend="right">French possessions</note>

						<p>The whole of the northwestern shoulder of the continent, from the mouth of the Congo
							to Tunis, belongs, with some exceptions, to France. It must be remembered, however,
							that a very considerable portion of the French claim is nothing but a desert, totally
							useless in its present state. On the east coast <note id="note_337"><ref

						<note rend="right">German possessions</note>

						<p>Between 1884 and 1890 Germany acquired four considerable areas of African territory,
							which include together nearly a million square miles: Togoland, Kamerun, German South-
							west Africa, and German East Africa. The Germans have made heroic efforts to develop
							these regions by building railways and schools, and expending enormous sums in other
							ways, but the wars with the natives and the slight commerce which has been
							established, leave the experiment one of doubtful value.</p>

						<note rend="right">The "Belgian Congo"</note>

						<p>Wedged in between German East Africa and the French Congo is the vast Belgian Congo,
							the history of which began with a conference held in Brussels in 1876 under the
							auspices of the king of Belgium. Representatives of most of the European countries
							were invited to attend, with a view to considering the best methods of opening up the
							region and of stopping the slave trade which was carried on by the Mohammedans in the
							interior. The result was the organization of an international African Association with
							its center at Brussels. The enterprise was, however, in reality the personal affair of
							King Leopold, who supplied from his own purse a large portion of the funds which were
							used by Stanley in exploring the Congo basin, establishing posts, and negotiating
							hundreds of treaties with the petty native chiefs.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Berlin conference on the Congo territory</note>

						<p>The activity of the African Association aroused the apprehensions of the European
							powers interested in Africa, especially England and Portugal, and a congress was
							called at Berlin to consider the situation. This met in November, 1884, and every
							European state except Switzerland sent delegates, as did the United States. The
							congress recognized the right of the African Association to the vast expanse drained
							by the Congo River, and declared the new territory a neutral state, the Congo Free
							State, open to the trade of all nations.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-571" n="496"/>

						<p>The following year King Leopold announced to the world that he had assumed
							sovereignty over the Congo Free State, and that he proposed to unite it in a personal
							union with Belgium. He gradually filled the government offices with Belgians and
							established customs lines with a view to raising revenue.</p>

						<note rend="right">Alleged cruel treatment of the natives in the Congo Free State</note>

						<p>During the opening years of the twentieth century the Belgians were charged with
							practicing atrocious cruelties on the natives.<ref id="ref_338" rend="super"
								target="note_338">1</ref> There is reason to think that the hideous reports
							published in the newspapers were much exaggerated, but there is little doubt that the
							natives, as commonly happens in such cases, have suffered seriously at the hands of
							the European invader. King Leopold claimed ownership over the vacant land, and in this
							way roused the hatred of the peoples who have been used to roaming freely in every
							direction. By a system of "apprenticeship" many of the blacks have been reduced to the
							condition of slaves. Labor is hard to secure, for the natives are accustomed to a free
							life in the jungle, and do not relish driving spikes on railways or draining swamps
							for Belgian capitalists. The government therefore required native chiefs to furnish a
							certain number of workmen, and on their failure to supply the demand it has been
							customary to burn their villages. The government also required the natives to furnish
							a certain quantity of rubber each year; failure to comply with these demands has also
							brought summary punishment upon them.</p>

						<p>The British government took care to report the conduct of the Belgian officials to
							the world, and it aroused loud protests in Europe and America; but those who know most
							about African conditions suspect that the English had a selfish interest in
							exaggerating the horrors of the situation, with the hope of ultimately extending their
							own control over the Congo regions. King Leopold and his agents stoutly maintained
							that they had been misrepresented, and claimed that their rubber business <note

							such an important source of revenue to other nations, especially Great Britain. These

							then took the name of the Belgian Congo.</p>

							contention among them. Its population, which is a curious mixture of Berbers, Tuaregs,
							Arabs, and negroes, has not materially changed its civilization during the past
							thousand years. The fierce tribesmen often defy the rule of their Sultan at Fez. A
							bandit leader, Raisuli, seized an English envoy to the Sultan, Sir Harry McLean,
							during the summer of 1907 and held him a prisoner for several months. This is but one
							of many instances which illustrate the inability of the Sultan of Morocco to control
							his subjects and protect foreigners.</p>

						<p>Europeans, especially the French, have, in spite of many difficulties, gradually been

						<p>In order to complete our survey of Africa, it is necessary to consider the singular
							circumstances which have served to bring Egypt under the control of the British. This
							ancient center of civilization had, as we have seen, been conquered by the Arabs in
							the seventh century. Eight hundred years later it was overrun by the Ottoman Turks,
							and in 1517 was organized as a province of the Turkish Empire. With the decline of the
							Sultan's power the country fell under the domination of the Beys, the leaders of a
							curious military band known as the Mamelukes; and it was against these that Bonaparte
							fought in 1798. Shortly after Nelson and the English had frustrated Bonaparte's
							attempt to bring Egypt under French rule, a military adventurer from Albania, Mehemet
							Ali, compelled the Sultan to recognize him as governor of Egypt in 1805. A few years
							later he brought about a massacre of the Mamelukes and began a series of reforms. He
							created an army and a fleet, and not only brought all Egypt under his sway, but
							established himself at Khartum where he could control the Sudan,<ref id="ref_341"

						<note rend="right">The Spanish-American War, 1898</note>

						<p>The cause of this war was the chronic disturbance which existed in Cuba under Spanish

							the western hemisphere. In 1895 the last of many Cuban insurrections against Spain
							broke out, and sympathy was immediately manifested in the United States. Both
							political parties during the presidential campaign of 1896 declared in favor of the
							Cubans, and with the inauguration of McKinley a policy of intervention was adopted.
							The American government demanded the recall of General Weyler-- whose cruelty had
							become notorious-- and a reform in the treatment of prisoners of war. In February,
							1898, the battle ship <hi rend="i">Maine</hi> was mysteriously blown up in the harbor

						<note rend="right">Necessity of great armies and navies</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">88.</hi> In winning and holding world-wide empires the countries of
							Europe have been compelled to maintain large military and naval forces in addition to
							those necessary for actual national defense. Colonies and protectorates inhabited by
							subject races require the presence of European soldiers, and the protection of
							merchant vessels on the high seas and in foreign ports demands large navies.
							Consequently imperial ambitions and patriotic pride have led to a steady increase in
							the armies and navies of Europe.</p>

						<note rend="right">Enhanced cost of military establishments due to new inventions</note>

						<p>The cost of maintaining these enormous military establishments is greatly enhanced by
							the continued invention of new and ever more formidable instruments of destruction,
							which speedily render old equipment obsolete and compel every country to keep abreast
							of the nation most advanced in the science of warfare. The old flintlock rifle loaded
							at the muzzle gave way to the minie rifle charged with a cartridge and fired by a
							percussion cap; the minie rifle was in turn supplanted by the breechloader; then came
							the rapid-fire repeating rifle, with a range of a mile. The ancient muzzle-loading
							cannon, with its short and uncertain range, has been gradually improved, and in its
							place we now have the enormous breech-loading Krupp guns, carrying balls weighing five
							hundred pounds for ten miles or more with wonderful accuracy. New explosives of
							terrible power-- nitroglycerin, melinite, and lyddite-- make gunpowder seem like a
							child's plaything; and smokeless powder, by keeping the field clear, makes range
							finding more deadly than ever. Moreover new instruments, such as the war balloon,
							armored trains, automobiles, wireless telegraphy, and search lights, greatly
							facilitate military operations.</p>

						<note rend="right">Revolution in maritime warfare</note>

						<p>Sea fighting has undergone a revolution no less complete and rapid. Within fifty
							years the wooden man of war has disappeared before armored vessels, which are rapidly
							developing in speed, tonnage, and fighting capacity. Even the battle ship of fifteen
							years ago is giving way before vessels of the <hi rend="i">Dreadnought</hi> type. <pb
								id="VAB8216-579" n="502"/> The ineffectiveness of the ordinary cannon against the
							steel battle ship has led to the use of torpedoes of terrible explosive power, and
							these in turn to the invention of torpedo destroyers. The new and dangerous factor of
							the submarine mine has been added, while the submarine vessel may soon considerably
							modify the present mode of naval warfare. And the aÃ«roplane promises a complete
							revolution in war on land.</p>

						<note rend="right">Huge modern standing armies</note>

						<p>Indeed, there seems to be no end to the rivalry of nations in the invention of costly
							instruments of war. Millions and billions have been expended in ships and guns which
							have become obsolete without ever being brought into action. France to-day, in time of
							peace, has an army of over seven hundred thousand men and spends over two hundred
							million dollars annually for war purposes,-- an establishment which rivals that
							maintained by Napoleon when at war with all Europe. Germany also supports a standing
							army of over six hundred thousand men. England spends over three hundred and fifty
							million dollars a year for the army and navy -more than twice as much as for
							education.</p>

						<note rend="right">How the preparations for war may favor peace</note>

						<p>Nevertheless, it may be said that this marvelous military development has contributed
							something to the movement toward peace in Europe. The enormous number of men that
							would speedily be called into action and hurried to the front in express trains, the
							countless millions that a general European war with these costly instruments would
							involve, the terrible loss of life and property that it would bring-- all this has
							tended to make statesmen shrink from risking the possibilities of war. Moreover the
							cost of maintaining armies on even a peace footing is so great, the strong protest of
							workingmen and socialists against warfare-- anti-militarism as it is called-- is so
							determined, the financial interests involved are so influential, and the effects of
							international conflicts on industry and trade are so disastrous, that a movement for
							the peaceful settlement of international disputes and the reduction of armaments has
							developed in every civilized nation.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Tsar calls a peace conference in 1898</note>

						<p>For centuries humanitarians have protested against war and the cost of military

							subject of reducing the excessive armaments.<ref id="ref_346" rend="super"
								target="note_346">1</ref> Unlike the Congress of Vienna or Berlin, this Peace

						<p>The Hague Conference did nothing, however, toward diminishing the armaments of the

							was extremely desirable, and recommending the nations to "examine the possibility of
							an agreement as to the limitation of armed forces by land and sea." The powers,
							however, agreed to recognize the right of any nation to offer its services to

							"involving neither honor nor vital interests" to the investigation of an impartial
							International Commission of Inquiry, to be constituted for each case by an arrangement
							between the parties to the controversy.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Permanent Court of Arbitration</note>

						<p>Finally, the powers agreed upon the establishment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration
							to which disputants could submit issues on which they were at variance. This great

							arbitration all questions "which affect neither the national independence nor honor,"
							but it was generally admitted that the conference had done little or nothing toward
							providing a way to settle those vital issues which actually give rise to great
							wars.</p>

						<note rend="right">The second Hague Conference, 1907</note>

						<p>Nevertheless, the outcome of the experiment encouraged the friends of international
							peace to believe that more practical agreements might be reached which would mitigate,
							if not prevent, the evils of war. Accordingly, in 1904, President Roosevelt proposed a
							second conference, but yielded the honor of issuing the call to Nicholas II, who the
							following year again sent invitations to over fifty nations to participate in the
							consideration of certain important questions, including the peaceful settlement of
							international disputes and the regulation of warfare on land and sea. The conference
							opened at The Hague on June 15, 1907, with the representatives of forty-seven states
							in attendance, and adjourned on October 18.<ref id="ref_347" rend="super"
								target="note_347">1</ref> The proposal of the United States for a permanent
							international court to which certain matters must be referred was defeated. The
							pressing question of disarmament was dismissed by a resolution declaring "It is highly
							desirable that the governments should resume the serious study of the question of
							limiting armaments." In fact, the conference confined its attention to drawing up
							treaties regulating the actual conduct of war, the laying of submarine mines, the
							treatment of prisoners, the bombardment of towns, and the rights of neutrals in time
							of war. In other words, no steps were taken to reduce military and naval expenses or
							to advance compulsory arbitration, but a serious effort was made to obtain more
							general agreement on the rules of war itself.</p>

						<note rend="right">A general survey</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">89.</hi> The opening years of the twentieth century have witnessed a
							steady increase in popular control over the aristocratic and royal branches of
							Old-World governments. The House of Lords in England has been forced to admit that the
							final word in lawmaking rests with the House of Commons; the monarchy has been
							overthrown in Portugal; some steps have been taken in Germany toward the establishment
							of ministerial responsibility; Turkey has a constitution and a parliament; Persia has
							experimented with representative government; China having overturned the imperial
							administration has founded a republic.</p>

						<p>These political changes have been accompanied by an increasing interest in
							international peace and social reform. The tremendous burdens of maintaining standing
							armies and building huge navies are no longer borne in silence by taxpayers and
							workingmen. The improvement of the condition of the people is the watchword of
							European ministries. Socialistic parties grow with astounding rapidity, and
							socialistic ideas are no longer confined to a small and discontented minority.</p>

						<note rend="right">England long conservative</note>

						<p>At the close of the nineteenth century England was, to all appearances, as
							conservative as any nation in western Europe. The enthusiasm for the extension of the
							suffrage and for the reform of ancient abuses, which had stirred the country for a
							hundred years, seemed to have died away. Contentment with the existing order, and
							interest in great imperial enterprises in South Africa and other parts of the world,
							characterized English <pb id="VAB8216-584" n="507"/> politics. From 1886 to 1906
							(except for a short period in 1892 -1895) the Conservative party was in control of the
							House of Commons and the government. Liberalism appeared to be dead, and the agitation
							of the socialists apparently made no impression on the workingmen.</p>

						<note rend="right">Growth of socialist parties in England</note>

						<p>Socialistic parties had developed in Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Russia, and
							elsewhere, and were playing a very active part in political campaigns; but in England
							the workingmen showed no signs of deserting the old parties in large numbers and
							establishing a party of their own. In 1883 the Social Democratic Federation had been
							formed to promote the teachings of Marx, but in spite of its activities it only
							secured a small number of members. In 1893 there came into existence, under the
							leadership of Keir Hardie, a more moderate socialistic body, known as the Independent
							Labor party. Its adherents rejected Marx's notion of an inevitable class conflict, but
							its growth was exceedingly slow at first.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Fabian Society</note>

						<p>The well-known Fabian Society,<ref id="ref_348" rend="super" target="note_348"
								>1</ref> of which Sidney and Beatrice Webb, George Bernard Shaw, and H. G. Wells
							have been distinguished members, originated in the early eighties for the purpose of
							spreading socialist doctrines. The Fabians rejected many of the doctrines of Marx, but
							at the same time they advocated the municipal or national ownership of land and
							industrial capital. They did not form a political party, but hoped to bring about
							better conditions by writing and lecturing, thus leading people to realize the
							possibility of reform.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Labor party in Parliament</note>

						<p>At length, in 1901, a Labor Representation Committee was formed in order to secure
							the united action of the many trade unions and the Independent Labor party. In 1905
							this committee pledged itself to work for the chief objects of socialism. When a
							general election to Parliament occurred in 19o6 it was ready to carry on a determined
							campaign, and the committee, with the aid of the Social Democrats and the <note
								id="note_348"><ref target="ref_348" rend="super">1</ref> So called from the policy
								of the Roman dictator Fabius, "who gained his end by going slowly,"-- <hi rend="i"
									>qui cunctando restituit rem.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-585" n="508"/> Independent Labor party, succeeded in returning no less
							than fifty labor representatives to the House of Commons. Several of these were avowed
							socialists.</p>

						<note rend="right">A new period opened in 1906</note>

						<p>When at the same election the Liberal party was restored to power, a new epoch of
							reform activity opened. That party soon carried through Parliament a workingmen's
							compensation act and other labor laws, and gave the Conservatives to understand that
							these measures were only an installment of a long programme of new legislation.</p>

						<note rend="right">The House of Lords blocks reform</note>

						<p>The latter, intrenched in the House of Lords, where they had a large majority, began
							to take up arms against measures which were, in their opinion, nothing short of
							revolutionary. In December, 1906, the Lords mutilated the education bill which Commons
							had passed, and a few days later they threw out a plural-voting bill abolishing the
							ancient practice of allowing a man to vote in all counties in which he had the
							requisite property to entitle him to the ballot. Early in the following year the two
							houses of Parliament began to discuss their grievances against each other, and Sir
							Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the prime minister, took advantage of the occasion to warn
							the peers that the British constitution rested on a representative basis.</p>

						<note rend="right">The "revolutionary" budget of 1909</note>

						<p>The real clash between the Lords and Commons came in 1909 over the budget-- that is,
							over the taxes which the Liberals proposed to lay and the expenses they proposed to
							incur. In April of that year, Mr. Lloyd George, Chancellor of the Exchequer (who had
							succeeded Mr. Asquith when the latter became prime minister on the death of
							Campbell-Bannerman in 1908), laid before the House of Commons a scheme of taxation
							which stirred up a veritable hornets' nest. He proposed a high tax on automobiles, a
							heavy income tax with a special additional tax on incomes over Â£5000,-- heavier on
							unearned than on earned incomes, -and an inheritance tax on a new scale, varying in
							weight according to the amount of the inheritance up to fifteen per cent on estates
							over Â£1,000,000. He also proposed a new land tax distinguishing sharply between
							landowners who <pb id="VAB8216-586" n="[]"/>
							<figure>
								<p>LLOYD GEORGE</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAB8216-587" n="[]"/>
							<pb id="VAB8216-588" n="509"/> actually worked their lands and the owners of mineral
							lands and city lots who exacted royalties and made large profits from growth in land
							values. The budget also included a twenty per cent tax on unearned increment on land,
							payable on its sale or transfer, so that anyone who sold property at a profit would
							have to pay a good share of the gain to the public treasury. The chancellor also
							proposed a special tax on undeveloped and on mineral lands.</p>

						<note rend="right">A budget for war on poverty</note>

						<p>These special taxes, in addition to the other taxes, made a heavy budget; but the
							chancellor defended it on the ground that it was a war budget for "waging implacable
							war against poverty." He concluded his opening speech in defense of his policy by
							expressing the hope "that great advance will be made during this generation toward the
							time when poverty with its wretchedness and squalor will be as remote from the people
							of this country as the wolves which once infested the forests."</p>

						<note rend="right">The Conservatives attack the budget</note>

						<p>The budget was at once hotly attacked by the Conservatives as socialistic and
							revolutionary. They claimed that the distinction between "earned" and "unearned"
							incomes was an unwarranted and invidious attack on the rights of property. "If a man,"
							asked one, "is to be more heavily taxed on an income that he has not earned than on an
							earned income, on the ground that he does not have the same absolute right to both
							incomes, why may not the government advance step by step until it takes away all
							unearned incomes on the theory that their possessors have no right to them at all?"
							Some of the more conservative defenders of the budget shrank from answering this
							question, and contented themselves by replying that it was a matter of degree, not of
							fundamental principles. Other supporters of the budget frankly declared that a man's
							right to his property depended upon the way in which he got it.</p>

						<note rend="right">A new question in taxation</note>

						<p>Speaking. on this point, Mr. Winston Churchill said: "Formerly the question of the
							taxgatherer was, 'How much have you got?' ... Now a new question has arisen. We do not
							only ask to-day, 'How much have you got?' we also ask 'How did <pb id="VAB8216-589"
								n="510"/>Outlines of European History you get it? Did you earn it by yourself, or
							has it been left to you by others? Was it gained by processes which are in themselves
							beneficial to the community in general, or was it gained by processes which have done
							no good to anyone, but only harm? Was it gained by the enterprise and capacity
							necessary to found a business, or merely by squeezing and bleeding the owner and
							founder of the business? Was it gained by supplying the capital which industry needs,
							or by denying, except at extortionate price, the land which industry requires? Was it
							derived by active reproductive processes, or merely by squatting on some piece of
							necessary land till enterprise and labor, national interests and municipal interests,
							had to buy you out at fifty times the agricultural value? Was it gained by opening new
							minerals to the service of man, or by drawing a mining royalty from the toil and
							adventure of others? ... How did you get it?' That is the new question which has been
							postulated, and which is vibrating in penetrating repetition through the land." The
							arguments in favor of the budget convinced the House of Commons, and it was carried by
							a handsome majority.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Lords reject the budget</note>

						<p>The debate on the budget began in the House of Lords on November 23, 1909, and it was
							at once claimed that the upper house had the constitutional right to reject money
							bills passed by Commons in spite of some precedents to the contrary. After a few days
							of debate the Lords defeated the budget by a vote of 350 to 75.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Commons protest</note>

						<p>The Liberals immediately took up the gauge thus thrown down. On December 2, Mr.
							Asquith moved in the House of Commons a resolution "That the action of the House of
							Lords in refusing to pass into law the financial provision made by the House for the
							services of the year is a breach of the Constitution and a usurpation of the rights of
							the House of Commons." This resolution was carried by a vote of 349 to 134, showing
							that there was little hope for a compromise on the issue. The following day Parliament
							was prorogued and an approaching dissolution was announced.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8216-590" n="511"/>

						<note rend="right">The campaign for the election of January, 1910</note>

						<p>The election campaign which followed (December 1909-January 1910) was unusually
							bitter, being marked by open violence in some places. The Socialists, Radicals, and
							Irish demanded the speedy abolition of the House of Lords, but the moderate Liberals
							were content with proposals for reforming and abridging the power of that ancient
							body. The campaign which closed on January 28 gave the Liberals a majority, although
							they lost almost one hundred seats. Their majority was so small, however, that for
							working purposes they had to cultivate friendly relations with the Labor and Irish
							members.</p>

						<p>In fact, neither party was entirely satisfied with the outcome of the election, but
							the Conservatives conceded that some reform of the House of Lords was inevitable. At
							the opening of the new Parliament in February, 1910, Mr. Asquith stated that the
							defeated budget would be brought up again, and that some changes in the House of Lords
							would be proposed. In case of a defeat, he warned the House, another appeal would be
							made to the voters at a general election. The Lords at length yielded on the budget
							and in April, 1910, agreed to its passage.</p>

						<note rend="right">The election (December, 1910) on the House of Lords' issue</note>

						<p>The Liberals, however, continued their war on "the Lords' veto," and in Parliament
							and outside, the issue was hotly discussed. In the midst of this constitutional
							crisis, King Edward VII died (May 6, 1910), and a sort of truce was made between the
							leaders. This was followed by conferences between the representatives of the Liberals
							and Conservatives, at which attempts were made to arrive at a compromise. These
							efforts failed, and at the opening of Parliament in November it was found that the
							deadlock was as fast as ever. Thereupon the Liberals dissolved Parliament and appealed
							to the country in a new election that closed on December 19, 1910. The result of this
							campaign was as unsatisfactory as that of the preceding January, for the Liberals only
							made slight gains in spite of a hard fight.</p>

						<note rend="right">The House of Lords conquered</note>

						<p>Shortly after the opening of the new Parliament in February, 1911, a bill designed to
							check the exercise of the "veto" <pb id="VAB8216-591" n="512"/> power by the Lords was
							introduced in Commons and passed by a good round majority. The measure was then sent
							to the House of Lords, and Mr. Asquith announced that he had received the consent of
							King George V to create enough new peers to insure its passage in case the
							Conservative opponents were. able to defeat it. Thus intimidated, the upper house, on
							August 18, 1911, passed the Parliament Act, or the Lords' Veto Bill as it was called,
							the leading provisions of which follow.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Lords' Veto Bill</note>

						<p>If any money bill-- that is, a bill relative to raising taxes and making
							appropriations-- is passed by Commons and sent up to the Lords at least one month
							before the end of a session, and is not passed by the Lords within one month without
							amendment, the bill may be presented to the king for his signature and, on being
							approved, becomes a law notwithstanding the fact that the Lords have not consented to
							it. Any public bill (other than a money bill, or a bill changing the provision for a
							maximum term of five years for a parliament), passed by the House of Commons at three
							successive sessions and rejected by the Lords at each of the three sessions, may be
							presented to the king and, on receiving his approval, will become a law without the
							consent of the Lords-- provided that two years have elapsed between the date of the
							second reading of the bill in the Commons in the first of those sessions and the date
							on which it passes the Commons in the third of those sessions. The veto bill also
							fixed five years instead of seven years as the time which any parliament may last.
							That is, under the law of August 18, a new parliamentary election must be held at
							least every five years, although of course a dissolution may be ordered at any time by
							the cabinet.<ref id="ref_349" rend="super" target="note_349">1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">The question of ministerial responsibility in Germany</note>

						<p>While the Liberal government in England was busy asserting the rights of the House of
							Commons against the House of Lords, noteworthy attempts were being made in the German
							Reichstag to force the imperial chancellor to recognize <note id="note_349"><ref
									target="ref_349" rend="super">1</ref> Provision was also made in 1911 to pay
								members of the House of Commons Â£400 a year.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-592" n="513"/> his responsibility to the popular representatives
							rather than to the emperor who appoints him. As we have already seen,<ref id="ref_350"
								rend="super" target="note_350">1</ref> the principle that the chief minister, the
							chancellor, should resign on finding a majority against him in the Reichstag was not
							accepted in Germany by Bismarck and the makers of the German constitution. In 1908 and
							1909 two events occurred which showed that, however absolute the Kaiser might regard
							his control over the chancellor, he could not in fact ignore the attitude of the
							parties in the Reichstag toward his representative.</p>

						<note rend="right">The <hi rend="i">Daily Telegraph</hi> affair</note>

						<p>In October, 1908, the London <hi rend="i">Daily Telegraph</hi> published what
							purported to be an interview with the emperor, in which he was quoted as saying that
							it "was one of his dearest wishes to live on the best of terms with England, although
							the prevailing sentiment among large sections of the middle and lower classes of his
							own people was not favorable to England." This and other statements attributed to the
							Kaiser stirred up ill feeling all over Europe, and everyone was astounded to find that
							the article in question had been sent to the German foreign office for approval and
							had been carelessly sanctioned by subordinates, initialed by the Chancellor von
							Billow, and sent to the Kaiser.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Chancellor resigns in response to public criticism</note>

						<p>This revelation of official incompetence and imperial intermeddling in foreign
							affairs profoundly moved the German people, and the chancellor was called upon in the
							Reichstag to answer for his conduct by various party leaders, many of whom definitely
							demanded the establishment of ministerial responsibility. Prince Billow at once sent
							in his resignation but the Kaiser refused to accept it, leaving to him the thankless
							task of explaining the emperor's indiscretion and his own carelessness. At the close
							of his defense, von Billow substantially promised the Reichstag that the emperor would
							abstain from such political utterances in the future, and added that only on such an
							understanding as to imperial practices could any <note id="note_350"><hi rend="center"
										><ref target="ref_350" rend="super">1</ref> See above, p. 342<ptr targType="pb"
										target="VAB8216-392"/>.</hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-593" n="514"/> minister continue in office. This statement was
							afterwards officially approved by the Kaiser, and the incident closed with a decided
							gain in the movement to subject the monarch to a sense of responsibility to the
							legislature.</p>

						<note rend="right">The chancellor defeated in the Reichstag, resigns</note>

						<p>The second event which revealed still more clearly the dependence of the chancellor
							upon parliamentary support occurred in 1909 in connection with the plans of Prince
							BÃ¼low for increasing imperial revenues by extending the system of inheritance taxes to
							some classes previously exempt. The proposal was obnoxious to the Conservatives who
							joined with the Center, or Catholic, party and thus were able to defeat the
							chancellor's measure. Von Billow at once resigned, but the emperor persuaded him to
							remain in office long enough to secure a temporary adjustment of the budget. Shortly
							afterward, in July, 1909, the chancellor gave up his office and retired. In explaining
							his conduct, he said: "Of course, no party can overthrow a minister. The appointment
							as well as the dismissal of a minister depends constitutionally and entirely upon the
							crown. There can arise, however, situations in which a minister who has convictions
							and takes them seriously cannot remain in office. That such a situation could arise
							for me I showed the Conservatives at the proper time, in the Reichstag and privately,
							openly and honorably, and in a way that left no doubt. In fact, no doubt as to this
							has existed in the minds of the Conservatives. They were entirely aware of the
							character of my warnings. They knew that their tactics must force me to resign. Yet
							they took no account of my warnings; they consciously created a situation in which I
							could not remain."</p>

						<note rend="right">The sentiment in favor of popular government grows</note>

						<p>In short, the chancellor is not dependent upon the Reichstag, but he cannot remain in
							office if he does not have the proper support there. Of course, this does not mean
							that ministerial government has been attained in Germany, but it seems that events are
							rapidly tending in that direction. Moreover the socialists have been making an open
							fight in the Reichstag to secure a constitutional amendment making the executive <pb
								id="VAB8216-594" n="515"/> department subservient to the legislative branch of the
							imperial government. The heavy gains made by the socialists in the election in
							January, 1912-- from 3,251,009 to 4,250,300 votes-- and the increase of their
							membership in the Reichstag from 43 to 110 also indicates that the element of
							absolutism in the German government is a diminishing force. In general, the results of
							that election were favorable to the radicals and progressives, as the votes for the
							more important parties show.<ref id="ref_351" rend="super" target="note_351"
							>1</ref></p>

						<note rend="right">Discontent with the monarchy in Portugal</note>

						<p>The popular movements in England and Germany were not accompanied by much criticism
							of the idea of a limited monarchy; and, in fact, at the opening of the new century it
							looked as if republican agitation against royalty as such had entirely disappeared in
							Europe. In Portugal, however, the attempt of the king to establish a dictatorship and
							squander the revenues without accountability raised up a party determined upon his
							overthrow, and on February 1, 1908, King Carlos and the Crown Prince, while riding in
							the streets of Lisbon, were assassinated. The late king's eighteen-year-old son was at
							once proclaimed as Manuel II, but he found that he had received a troublesome
							heritage. The little realm was disturbed by party dissensions; finances were in a bad
							way; workingmen were discontented; the radicals were waging war against the cleygy and
							the monks; and the republicans daily gained in strength in spite of the promises of
							reform made by the young ruler.</p>

							<pb id="VAB8216-595" n="516"/> revolt broke out at the capital. After some serious
							street fighting and the bombardment of the royal palace, the king fled to England,
							protesting that his hasty flight did not mean abdication. The republicans at once set
							up a provisional government and began the expulsion of the monks and nuns and the
							confiscation of their property. In May, 1911, elections were held for a constitutional
							convention which met in June. This convention drafted a constitution providing for a
							legislative body of two chambers, one elected directly by universal manhood suffrage
							and the other indirectly by the municipalities; for a president to be elected for four
							years by the legislature; and for a ministry responsible to Parliament.</p>

						<note rend="right">Troublesome times for the new republic</note>

						<p>The government under the new constitution was set up in August and September, 1911,
							and began the difficult task of conciliating the factions which the revolution had
							left behind. The Catholic priests and bishops were offered pensions but they declined
							to receive them, demanding the same privileges which their church enjoyed in the
							United States. On May 1 the Pope issued an encyclical condemning the anticlerical
							measures of the republic, and the republic replied by confiscating the government
							securities held by the clergy to the amount of $25,000,000. The finances of the
							government are in critical shape; there is a profound unrest among the workingmen of
							the industrial centers; but the young republic seems to be gaining in stability in
							spite of the continued efforts of the monarchists to overturn it.</p>

						<note rend="right">The constitutional revolution in Turkey (1908)</note>

						<p>The unrest which had been stirring western Europe for more than a hundred years--
							which had made Metternich and Wellington tremble for the safety of the throne and
							altar-- reached Turkey in the opening days of the new century. For some time, the
							Young Turk party had been busy spreading ideas of parliamentary government and
							national independence from foreign tutelage. Early in the year 1908 a Committee of
							Union and Progress, composed largely of army officers, was formed at Salonika, and
							soon enlisted support among the soldiers and the <pb id="VAB8216-596" n="517"/>
							people. In July, 1908, a revolt broke out, and the Salonika Committee proclaimed a
							constitution, at the same time announcing its intention to march upon Constantinople
							if the Sultan did not come to terms. The Sultan at once yielded and restored the
							constitution which he had granted in 1876 and then suspended in 1878. One or two of
							his notorious advisers were assassinated, but, on the whole, the revolution was
							comparatively peaceful. In October and November, the elections to the new Parliament
							were held, and in December, 1908, the Sultan opened the assembly with great pomp.</p>

						<note rend="right">The deposition of the Sultan</note>

						<p>The new government very soon found its hands full. There were disorders in various
							parts of the empire, particularly in Macedonia. On October 5, 1908, Prince Ferdinand
							of Bulgaria declared his country forever independent of Turkey. At the same time the
							Emperor Francis Joseph formally annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, which had been under
							Austro-Hungarian suzerainty since the settlement of 1878. To cap the climax, the
							Conservatives and opponents of the constitution stirred up a revolt in Constantinople
							in which several soldiers and civilians were killed. The aged Sultan Abdul Hamid was
							thought to have aided, or at all events to have sympathized with, the reaction; and
							both houses of the Turkish Parliament, sitting as a national assembly, voted on April,
							1909, to depose him and proclaim his brother Sultan under the title of Mohammed V.</p>

						<note rend="right">Discontent with the results of the revolution</note>

						<p>The new Sultan's reign, auspiciously begun, has been full of troubles. Revolts and
							quarrels in all parts of the patchwork empire have been almost constant. The members
							of his cabinet have been regularly at loggerheads, and the government is beset with
							all the financial and political difficulties which accompany a revolutionary change in
							an old and corrupt form of government. In the midst of these domestic difficulties
							came a war with Italy, which gave the reactionary party an opportunity to denounce the

						<note rend="right">The advisers of the emperor of China forced to grant a constitution

						<p>More astounding than the revolution in Turkey has been the establishment of a

								>2</ref> the Dowager Empress in the autumn of 19o6 issued a decree announcing that a
							constitution would be granted at an early date, "solely dependent upon the progress of
							the people in education." That progress was amazingly rapid, for the advocates of
							popular government began to urge immediate action on the part of the government and
							soon forced it to fix the date of the new system at 1913. Meanwhile a national
							council, consisting of representatives of certain privileged classes and the
							provinces, met in October, 1911, and it speedily came into collision with the throne
							and the imperial advisers. About the same time revolutionary outbreaks occurred at
							many points, particularly in southern and central China. The government troops were
							overcome in city after city,-- though not without desperate and bloody fighting,-- and
							the national assembly finally forced the imperial administration to grant a liberal
							constitution and guarantee the election of a parliament with full power.</p>

						<note rend="right">The establishment of the Chinese Republic</note>

						<p>The radicals grew bolder. During the closing days of December a provisional
							republican assembly at Nanking proclaimed a republic and elected Dr. Sun Yat Sen
							president. Seeing that resistance was futile, the advisers of the boy emperor<ref

							(February, 1912). At the same time the revolutionists drew together and chose as

						<note id="note_352"><ref target="ref_352" rend="super">1</ref> Even Persia has recently

						<note rend="right">Conservative reaction in Russia</note>

						<p>Only in Russia has the movement for a more democratic government received a serious

							such bitterness and sacrifice of life during the years 1904-1907,<ref id="ref_355"
								rend="super" target="note_355">1</ref> has died down into a scarcely audible
							protest. The third Duma, which the Tsar had made very much to his own liking by
							excluding from the elections practically every one except conservative property
							owners, has proved so tractable that no new election has been called since 1907. It
							has been busy chiefly with making large appropriations for naval and military
							expenditures designed to put the army and navy on a sound footing again after the
							disasters suffered in the war with Japan. There seems to be no indication that the
							"gradual establishment of representative government" which the calling of the Duma
							promised will be realized. Indeed, revolutionary fever seems to have disappeared as
							completely as it did more than thirty years ago after the death of Alexander III. The
							only political assassination which has occurred recently was the murder of the Premier
							Stolypin in September, 1911. The successor of the dead minister, however, announced a
							practical continuation of the former policy of the government.</p>

						<note rend="right">The awakening of women</note>

						<p>In the midst of the general political movement which has been extending the suffrage
							to men and widening the control of the voters over the government, women have not been
							indifferent spectators. Indeed, it would have been impossible for them to escape the
							general awakening of the common people, which has been one of the most striking
							features of the past hundred years; for the Industrial Revolution and education have
							changed the life and labor of women as well as of men.</p>

						<note rend="right">Former subjugation of women</note>

						<p>The first French constitution, which had so much to say of the rights of man, said
							nothing of the rights of woman. In the eighteenth century she was still regarded in
							the eyes of the law as in every way inferior to man. Nature had destined her to the
							bearing and the care of children, and to the conduct of the <note id="note_355"><hi
									rend="center"><ref target="ref_355" rend="super">1</ref> See above, pp. 445<ptr
										targType="pb" target="VAB8216-522"/><hi rend="i">sqq.</hi></hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-602" n="520"/> household. In England, down to the year 1870, the law
							fulfilled to the letter the command of the apostle Peter, "Ye wives, be in subjection
							to your husbands." A married woman could enjoy no property rights; her personal
							possessions-- clothes, jewels, and the like-- belonged to her husband; and her lands
							were administered by him. Indeed, a wife was, in a sense, her husband's serf; she
							could not make a valid contract, she could not sue or be sued, her husband could
							lawfully beat her for disobedience, and if she injured another person or his property,
							her husband was held for damages, just as if his ox had escaped and committed a
							depredation. In other countries the conditions were similar.</p>

						<note rend="right">Rights granted to women during the nineteenth century</note>

						<p>It was left for the nineteenth century gradually to free women from a great part of
							these disabilities, so that they may now make contracts, hold property, and engage in
							business on their own account. The Industrial Revolution, by opening up new
							employments to them, has given them a certain kind of independence of man which they
							never before enjoyed. They now often hold public positions, such as those of sanitary
							officers, factory inspectors, government clerks, and especially teachers. During the
							last twenty-five years the universities of Switzerland, Germany, and France have been
							gradually opened to women as well as to men, while special colleges and technical
							schools established for their particular benefit are becoming more and more common. It
							is this change of course which is leading to the gradual granting to women of the
							right to vote.</p>

						<note rend="right">Steady extension of the suffrage to women</note>

						<p>As early as 1870 the women of England were given the right to vote for members of the
							newly created school boards, and in 1888 and 1894 they were admitted to the franchise
							in certain local government matters. In 1893 women were enfranchised in New Zealand
							and a year later in South Australia. Shortly after the establishment of the new
							Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 full parliamentary suffrage was granted to women. In
							1906 the women of Finland, and <pb id="VAB8216-603" n="521"/> in 1907 and 1912 the
							women of Norway and Sweden respectively, were given the vote on the same terms as
							men.</p>

						<note rend="right">The beginning of the militant suffragist movement in England</note>

						<p>A new and striking interest was given to the whole subject of woman suffrage,
							however, in 1905, when some of the leaders among the English women, particularly Mrs.
							Pankhurst and her daughters, abandoned their peaceful methods of agitation and
							resorted to demonstrations of violence, which they knew had been so effective in the
							movement for manhood suffrage. These tactics were begun by Miss Christobel Pankhurst
							in defending a working girl who was being roughly treated by the police for an attempt
							to ask questions at a political meeting-- a privilege which had been fully accorded to
							men. In the winter of 1907-1908, the women suffragists organized demonstrations before
							the houses of cabinet officers and raided the House of Commons; and many of them on
							being arrested, refused to pay their fines and were sent to jail.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Woman Suffrage Bill in the House of Commons</note>

						<p>The disorders proved effective in centering the attention of the world on the demands
							of the women; and at length the House of Commons, in the summer of 1910, passed the
							Woman Suffrage Bill on its second reading by a vote of 299 to 190, and then killed it
							by referring it to the committee of the whole. This measure proposed to give women the
							vote on the same terms as men, and as there were property qualifications for male
							voters, the number of women enfranchised under it would be small. Suffragists,
							however, regarded it as an "opening wedge," and on securing Premier Asquith's promise
							to give the bill a fair chance to pass, they desisted from their violent tactics.</p>

						<note rend="right">Agitation renewed</note>

						<p>At length, however, in December, 1911, when the prime minister announced the
							intention of the cabinet to introduce a straight manhood suffrage bill and give the
							friends of woman suffrage a chance to amend it, the suffragists resumed rioting. Some
							of the leaders disapprove violence and urge that it is the better part of wisdom to
							await the action of Parliament on the whole question of universal suffrage.</p>

						<note rend="right">Social reform now the issue in England</note>

						<p><hi rend="b">90.</hi> We have already seen how Germany, under the leadership of
							Bismarck, undertook a great scheme of legislation designed to benefit the working
								classes.<ref id="ref_356" rend="super" target="note_356">1</ref> It was many years,
							however, before the principles embodied in this legislation found any considerable
							support in either France or England; but during the past ten years there has been
							going on in these two countries, particularly the latter, a revolution in the public
							attitude toward labor questions and poverty. This change in English sentiment was
							clearly expressed by a Liberal, Mr. Winston Churchill, in a political speech at
							Nottingham, on January 30, 1909: "The main aspirations of the British people are at
							the present time social rather than political. They see around them on every side, and
							almost every day, spectacles of confusion and misery which they cannot reconcile with
							any conception of humanity or justice. They see that there are in the modern state a
							score of misfortunes that can happen to a man without his being at fault in any way.
							They see, on the other hand, the mighty power of science, backed by wealth and power,
							to introduce order, to provide safeguards, to prevent accidents, or at least mitigate
							their consequences. They know that this country is the richest in the world; and in my
							sincere judgment the British democracy will not give their hearts to any party that is
							not able and willing to set up that larger, fuller, more elaborate, more thorough
							social organization, without which our country and its people will inevitably sink
							through sorrow to disaster and our name and fame fade upon the pages of history."</p>

						<note rend="right">Recent English labor laws</note>

						<p>In this spirit the Liberal government began, shortly after its accession to power in
							1906, a series of laws designed to mitigate, at least, if not to abolish, the evils of
							poverty, sweating, unemployment, and industrial accidents. The provisions of the
							Workmen's Compensation Act of 1897 were extended <note id="note_356"><hi rend="center"
										><ref target="ref_356" rend="super">1</ref> See above, pp. 344<ptr targType="pb"
										target="VAB8216-394"/><hi rend="i">sqq.</hi></hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-605" n="523"/> to agricultural laborers and domestic servants. Under
							this law employers in the industries covered are required to pay compensation to
							workmen injured in their employ, except when the accident is due to the "serious and
							willful misconduct of the injured workman himself." At the same time (1906) a law was
							passed exempting the funds of trade unions from the liability of being attached for
							damages caused by their officials in strikes and industrial conflicts generally. Two
							years later (1908) Parliament passed an act providing that, subject to certain
							incidental reservations, "a workman shall not be below ground in a mine for the
							purpose of his work and of going to and from his work, for more than eight hours
							during any consecutive twenty-four hours."</p>

						<note rend="right">Booth's survey of London poverty</note>

						<p>Measures for the benefit of trade unionists, miners, and injured workmen, however
							important they may be, do not solve the problem of poverty, due to low wages,
							uncertain employment, illness, and causes other than those which may be ascribed to
							individual faults. Undoubtedly poverty on a large scale has been one of the inevitable
							accompaniments of the Industrial Revolution, and in England the amount of depressing,
							hopeless poverty is enormous. Several years ago Mr. Charles Booth, a wealthy member of
							a steamship corporation, feeling that there was no accurate information available in
							regard to the condition of the working people of London, undertook a house-to-house
							canvass at his own expense. With a large corps of helpers he set about ascertaining
							the "numerical relations which poverty, misery, and depravity bear to regular earnings
							and comparative comfort," and in 1889 he published the first two volumes of his work
							entitled <hi rend="i">The Life and Labor of the People of London</hi>, of which
							sixteen volumes have now appeared. In the district of East London, embracing a
							population of nearly a million, he found that more than one third of the people
							belonged to families with incomes of a guinea (about $5.15) or less a week; that
							forty-two per cent of the families earned from about $5.50 to $7.50 a week; and that
							only about thirteen per <pb id="VAB8216-606" n="524"/> cent had more than $7.50 a week
							to live on. His studies further revealed terrible overcrowding in squalid tenements
							which were badly lighted, poorly equipped with water and sanitary arrangements, and
							reeking with disease. He reached the startling conclusion that throughout the vast
							city of London nearly one third of the people were in poverty; that is, lived on wages
							too low to provide the necessaries for a decent physical existence, to say nothing of
							comforts or luxuries.</p>

						<note rend="right">Indications that the poverty in London is not exceptional</note>

						<p>It might at first sight seem that the poverty of London is exceptionally great, but
							Mr. Rowntree, in an equally careful survey, has proved that in the city of York, with
							its population of less than eighty thousand inhabitants, toward one third of the
							people are also, as in London, in dire poverty.<ref id="ref_357" rend="super"
								target="note_357">1</ref> He has shown, too, that the physical development of the
							children,, the prevalence of disease, and the death rate corresponded with the rate of
							wages; in short, that health, happiness, and well-being increased as wages increased.
							There is reason to believe that conditions are essentially the same in many other
							English towns as well as on the Continent, although this has not as yet been
							demonstrated by scientific investigations.</p>

						<note rend="right">Possibility of abolishing poverty</note>

						<p>Formerly it was generally assumed that poverty was inevitable and that little could
							be done to remedy it, since there was not enough wealth in any given community to make
							everybody comfortable; but the progress of practical inventions and of scientific
							discovery has roused the hope in the minds of many that if industries were reorganized
							in a way to avoid waste and to promote efficiency, if the idle were set to work and
							precautions taken to distribute the wealth in such a way that a few could not, as now,
							appropriate vast fortunes, there might sometime be a sufficiency for all who were
							willing to do their part, so that all could live in comfort and bring up their
							children in healthful surroundings, thus greatly reducing vice and disease. As the
							kindly Pope Leo XIII well said, "There can be no question that some remedy must be
							found, and that quickly, for the <note id="note_357"><hi rend="center"><ref

							<pb id="VAB8216-607" n="525"/> misery and wretchedness which press so heavily at this
							moment on a large majority of the very poor."</p>

						<note rend="right">The English government declares war on poverty</note>

						<p>The English government has made "war on poverty" a part of its official programme and
							has already begun some important experiments designed to lessen the terrors of the
							struggle for existence which is waged especially by the poor of the great
							manufacturing centers. On August 1, 1908, it passed an old-age pension law, the
							leading provisions of which follow: Any person to be a recipient of a government
							pension must be seventy years of age, a British subject, and in receipt of a private
							income of less than Â£31 10s. Persons disqualified for receiving pensions are, under
							certain restrictions, those who are in receipt of poor relief, those who have failed
							to work according to their ability, opportunity, and need for the benefit of
							themselves and those dependent upon them, those who are detained in lunatic asylums,
							and convicted criminals. The maximum pension allowed is 5s., or about $1.25 per week,
							to those having incomes not exceeding Â£21 4s. a year, and the minimum pension is 1s. a
							week for those having incomes between Â£28 17s. 6d. per annum and Â£31 10s. Between
							these limits the amount of the pension is graded at 4s., 3s., or 2s. a week, according
							to the income of the recipient.</p>

						<note rend="right">Government employment bureaus</note>

						<p>To help in reducing the large amount of unemployment, Parliament passed an act in
							1909 authorizing the Board of Trade-- a branch of the national administration-- to
							establish labor exchanges throughout the country and collect information as to
							employers requiring working people and as to laborers seeking employment. Provisions
							were also made whereby the government may advance loans to laborers to pay their
							traveling expenses to the places where employment may be found for them by the labor
							exchanges.</p>

						<note rend="right">Regulation of wages in "sweated" trades</note>

						<p>Parliament has sought to raise the level of wages in some industries which do not pay
							the employees enough to uphold a fairly decent standard of life. By an act passed in
							1909, <pb id="VAB8216-608" n="526"/> provision is made for the establishment of trade
							boards in certain of the "sweated" trades, such as tailoring, machine lace-making, and
							box-making industries. These trade boards consist of representatives of the working
							people and the employers and also persons appointed by the government, and are
							empowered to fix minimum rates of wages for time work and general minimum rates for
							piece work in their respective trades. Agreements for wages lower than those fixed by
							the board are forbidden, and employers paying under the minimum are liable to heavy
							fines. The Board of Trade may extend the provision of this act "to any specified trade
							to which it does not at the time apply, if they are satisfied that the rate of wages
							prevailing in any branch of the trade is exceptionally low as compared with that in
							other employments, and that other circumstances of the trade are such as to render the
							application of this act to the trade expedient."</p>

						<note rend="right">Churchill's defense of government interference with wages</note>

						<p>Speaking in the House of Commons in support of this antisweating measure, Mr. Winston
							Churchill defended what might be regarded by the old-fashioned economists as an
							interference with "the natural law of wages." He said: <q>"It was formerly supposed
								that the workings of the laws of supply and demand would in the regular and natural
								course of events, and by a steady progression, eliminate the evil and achieve
								adequate minimum standards. Modern opinion has found it necessary to refine upon
								these broad generalizations of the truth, and the first clear division that we make
								to-day in the question of wages is that between a healthy and an unhealthy condition
								of bargaining. ... Where, as in what we call 'sweated trades,' you have no
								organization at all on either side, no parity of bargaining between employers and
								employed; where the good employer is continually undercut by the bad, and the bad
								again by the worse; where the worker whose whole livelihood depends on the trade is
								undercut by the worker to whom it is a second string; where the feebleness and
								ignorance of the workers and their isolation from each other render them an easy
								prey to the <pb id="VAB8216-609" n="527"/> tyranny of bad masters and middlemen one
								step above them upon the lowest rung of the ladder and themselves held in the grip
								of the same relentless forces - there you have not a condition of progress but of
								progressive degeneration. ... We have seen from the investigations of the last
								twenty years, when the phenomena of sweating have been under close and scientific
								review, that there is no power of self-cure within the area of that evil."</q></p>

						<note rend="right">National insurance against ill-health and unemployment</note>

						<p>The most comprehensive of all the recent English social measures is the National
							Insurance Act of 1911, which went into effect in July, 1912. One part of this law
							requires the compulsory insurance of nearly all employees (except those not engaged in
							manual labor and enjoying an income of more than Â£160 a year) against ill-health of
							every kind. The insured persons, the employers, and the government are all
							contributors to the fund. Among the benefits for the insured are medical treatment and
							attendance, sanatorium treatment for tuberculosis, payments during sickness,
							disablement allowances, and the payment of 30s. to each mother on the birth of a
							child. A second portion of the act requires employers and employees in certain trades
							to contribute a small sum weekly to a fund for insurance against unemployment, and
							provides government assistance as well.</p>

						<note rend="right">France follows the example of England and Germany</note>

						<p>In 1910 France followed the example set by Germany and England and, building upon
							earlier laws, established a thorough-going system of old-age and disability pensions.
							The law requires all wage workers and salaried employees to be insured, and permits
							certain other workers to take advantage of the law if they wish. Employers and
							employees make equal contributions to the fund, and the government also lends its aid.
							The pension begins at the age of sixty-five-- five years earlier than in Germany-- and
							will normally amount to about $75 per annum for men and $60 per annum for women.
							Provisions are also made for those disabled through sickness or accident; and widows
							and orphans receive certain death benefits.</p>

						<p>Although Germany has made no important additions to the social legislation described

							forging rapidly forward in their efforts to improve the lot of city dwellers
							generally. A number of municipalities, like Berlin, Munich, Leipzig, and Hanover, have
							purchased enormous areas of land so as to gain the profit arising from the increase in
							value and make it easier to prevent congestion. Several cities are laid out into
							zones, and the building in each zone is restricted by law to stop overcrowding. Some
							of the more progressive towns own their street-car lines, gas works, and
							electric-light plants, manage theaters, operate pawn shops, build houses for
							workingmen, and attempt to plan their growth in such a way as to obviate the hideous
							and unsanitary features which are supposed to be inevitable in industrial centers.</p>

						<note rend="right">Social reform does not check the growth of socialism</note>

						<p>All these measures of social reform in England, Germany, and France have not
							succeeded in checking the growth of socialism, although many of them have been
							advocated by socialists for a long time. Some serious changes in socialistic policies
							and tactics, however, have been proposed recently, and the socialists, roughly
							speaking, are divided into three groups, although generally they succeed in presenting
							a rather solid front to the other parties at elections.</p>

						<note rend="right">The "revisionist" wing of the Socialist party</note>

						<p>In the first place there has been a revolt (particularly in Germany) against the
							doctrines of the Marxian school on the part of a "revisionist" wing of the socialists,
							who hold that there will be no social "revolution" at all, but merely a succession of
							reform measures which will gradually establish the main features of the socialist
							system. Although the German revisionists have not been able to carry the party with
							them, they constitute a very powerful body within the organization.</p>

						<note rend="right">The "direct action" labor movement</note>

						<p>On the other extreme, the more radical socialists have become discontented with the
							meager results of peaceful political agitation and are advocating "direct action"
							instead-- that is, strikes and violent methods of bringing employers to terms, with
								<note id="note_358"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_358" rend="super">1</ref> See
									above, pp. 344<ptr targType="pb" target="VAB8216-394"/>

							<pb id="VAB8216-611" n="529"/> a view ultimately of securing working-class control
							over industries of all kinds, with or without government intervention. For example,
							the English railway employees struck in August, 1911, and began rioting in the large
							railway centers. They were thus able to bring about the interference of the government
							and to make decided gains in wages. As one of the leaders put it, they were able by
							throwing a few bricks to make more substantial gains in their incomes than had been
							secured by all the laborious legislation of Parliament on their behalf in many years.
							In France, also, direct action has been gaining in favor, and recent labor troubles
							have been accompanied by a great deal of violence-- "sabotage," as it is called there.
							The "direct actionists," or "syndicalists," as they are called in France, would
							organize the workingmen of all grades and crafts into one grand consolidated union for
							the purpose of dominating the whole field of industry by the sheer strength of their
							numbers and solidarity.</p>

						<note rend="right">The "middle of the road" socialists</note>

						<p>The rank and file of the socialists, however, repudiate the doctrines of the "
							moderate reformers " and the "direct actionists." They denounce the former as playing
							into capitalist hands, and the latter as introducing anarchistic methods. The
							socialist parties in nearly all European countries choose to rely on peaceful methods
							of agitation and expect to carry out their programme when they have secured control of
							their governments at the ballot boxes.</p>

						<note rend="right">Growth of enlightenment may hasten the solution of the labor

						<p>Whether the mutual hostility of poor and rich will deepen in Europe and bring on a

							revolution, the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the general undoing of the
							settlement of the Balkan situation which had been reached at the Conference of Berlin
							in 1878. Some of the papers at the time clamored for armed intervention, but the whole
							affair passed off peaceably-- no European power being willing to take the first step
							that might have precipitated a second Crimean War.</p>

						<note rend="right">France and Germany prepare for war but come to terms (1911)</note>

						<p>The Moroccan question, which, as we have seen, the interested powers attempted to
							settle at Algeciras,<ref id="ref_400" rend="super" target="note_400">1</ref> was
							reopened in 1911 by a controversy between France and Germany which for a few months
							threatened to loose the dogs of war. In the summer of that year, when France and Spain
							were engaged in executing the terms of the Algeciras settlement, French troops took
							possession of Fez. France assured Germany that the military expeditions in Morocco
							were only temporary and were not designed to advance French interests particularly.
							However, Germany did not accept the explanation and sent a gunboat to Agadir, a
							southern port on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, and hinted that German marines would
							remain there until France was ready to withdraw from Fez. The war spirit flamed up in
							both countries, and extensive military preparations were made. Mr. Asquith, prime
							minister of Great Britain, significantly warned Germany that English relations to
							France and Morocco made his country a party to any settlement of the dispute. Shortly
							afterward France and Germany came to terms-- the former securing large rights in
							Morocco and the latter "colonial compensations" in the Kamerun and French Congo. The
							war scare thereupon disappeared.</p>

						<note rend="right">Rumors of war between England and Germany</note>

						<p>A third disturbing feature of recent European politics has been the persistent growth
							of ill-will between England and Germany. This ill-will has sprung out of the trade
							rivalry of the two countries. As we have pointed out,<ref id="ref_401" rend="super"
								target="note_401">2</ref> Germany was industrially and commercially backward before
							the consolidation of 1867-1871, and then suddenly became a powerful competitor of
							Great Britain for colonial possessions and new markets in all parts of the world.
							Relatively, German trade has been increasing more rapidly than British trade, and the
							German navy has been greatly enlarged in order to protect the growing maritime
							interests of the empire. English manufacturers and merchants have begun to chafe under
							the competition of Germans, and belligerent English publicists insist that the German
							navy is not <note id="note_400"><ref target="ref_400" rend="super">1</ref> See above,

							<pb id="VAB8216-614" n="532"/> only a menace to British supremacy on the high seas,
							but is constructed with ulterior designs on Great Britain. War parties in both
							countries have clamored for a feverish rivalry in ship construction and have made all
							possible capital out of the strained relations. However, there are strong peace
							parties in both countries, and valiant efforts are being made, officially and
							privately, to put a stop to the war hysteria.</p>

						<note rend="right">The Turko-Italian War</note>

						<p>The most recent affair of international significance has been the war between Italy
							and Turkey. As has been mentioned,<ref id="ref_402" rend="super" target="note_402"
								>1</ref> Italy, shortly after the establishment of unity, began to have territorial
							ambitions in Africa and actually acquired some colonies. This growth of Italian
							influence was from the first looked upon with distrust by the Sultan of Turkey, who
							began to fear for his remaining possessions in Northern Africa. Turkish opposition to
							the pretensions of Italy increased after the revolution of 1908, and this incensed the
							Italians, who declared that their merchants and citizens, in Tripoli especially, were
							constantly being mistreated by the Turks. In September, 1911, Italy sent an ultimatum
							to Turkey, enumerating her complaints against Turkish neglect and disorders, informing
							the Sultan that military occupation had been decided upon, and requesting him to
							permit this to be done peaceably, on pain of war. Turkey appealed to the powers of
							Europe, and on September 29, 1911, Italy proclaimed war. Tripoli was bombarded and on
							October 4 that city was occupied by Italian troops. The war, however, did not come to
							an end at once, as the Italians expected, but dragged along for many months. All
							Europe protested against this "high-handed" action by Italy; but Italy replied that
							she was merely following the example set by other countries-- protecting the lives and
							property of her citizens by annexing a country beset by chronic disorders.</p>

						<note rend="right">The growth of the peace movement</note>

						<p>In the face of all these disturbing events, the movement for international peace has
							been growing apace. Peace societies, national and international, have been increasing
							in number and <note id="note_402"><hi rend="center"><ref target="ref_402" rend="super"
										>1</ref> See above, p. 319.<ptr targType="pb" target="VAB8216-364"/></hi></note>
							<pb id="VAB8216-615" n="533"/>\ in membership, and world congresses of every kind--
							scientific, political, and literary-- are yearly multiplying. A special impetus was
							given to peace propaganda in December, 1910, when Mr. Carnegie transferred $10,000,000
							to a board of trustees to be devoted to the spread of the doctrine of universal peace.
							The interest of the public in the subject is reflected in the large amount of
							attention given to it in the daily and periodical press. It may be truly said that the
							idea of world pacification has passed from the stage of theory into the field of
							practical politics.</p>

						<note rend="right">Peace treaties between nations</note>

						<p>Since the first Hague Conference more than one hundred and thirty treaties have been
							made between nations, pledging them to submit to arbitration all disputes which "do
							not affect the vital interests, the independence, or the honor of the contracting
							parties, and do not concern the interests of third parties." Recently some nations
							have gone further and proposed treaties binding themselves to submit to arbitration
							"all questions. which are in their nature justiciable in character." Treaties of this
							character were signed by the United States with France and with Great Britain in
							August, 1911, and this was hailed by the peace advocates as the most substantial gain
							made for years. The Senate of the United States, however, refused to ratify the
							treaties in this form.</p>

						<note rend="right">Limitation of armaments and a league of peace</note>

						<p>No temporary setback, however, can check the movement against war. As Mr. Roosevelt
							said at Christiania in an address acknowledging the Nobel peace prize of 1910:
								<q>"Something should be done as soon as possible to check the growth of armaments,
								especially naval armaments, by international agreement. ...Granted sincerity of
								purpose, the great powers of the world should find no insurmountable difficulty in
								reaching an agreement which would put an end to the present costly and growing
								extravagance of expenditure on naval armaments. ... Finally, it would be a master
								stroke if those great powers honestly bent on peace would form a league of peace,
								not only to keep peace among themselves, but to prevent by force, if <pb
									id="VAB8216-616" n="534"/> necessary, its being broken by others. The ruler or
								statesman who should bring about such a combination would have earned his place in
								history for all time and his title to the gratitude of mankind."</q></p>

				<p>One of the chief conclusions reached in these volumes is that kings have, during the

					that their names are now of relatively slight importance. Nevertheless they are often
					referred to in historical works, and we may atone for some seeming slights to royalty in

				<p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> new series of textbooks offers the most noteworthy solution of
					the present-day high-school history problem yet attempted. With the two volumes of "
					Outlines of European History" in hand the teacher can cover general European history,
					beginning with ancient history, satisfactorily in two years, leaving the third year for
					American history. Moreover, the series is fully in accord with the new spirit in the
					teaching of history. Emphasis throughout is placed on conditions and institutions rather
					than on unrelated events, while by devoting Part II to the history of the last two hundred
					years, the course directs the pupil's attention especially to the problems and
					developments that are of present-day import. In short, both volumes of "Outlines of
					European History" are designed primarily to furnish the pupil the needed background for
					the intelligent interpretation of contemporary events.</p>

				<p>The authors' reputation for sound scholarship and historical insight is
					international,while their style has an incisiveness and an imaginative freshness that make
					as attractive reading for the high-school pupil as any romance. The success of previous
					textbooks by the same authors is guaranty of the teachability of these new texts and of
					their entire fitness at every point for class use.</p>

						rend="sc">REASTED</hi></p>

				<p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> volume covers oriental, classical, and medieval history to the
					beginning of the eighteenth century, setting forth vividly those fundamental notions most
					essential to an understanding of subsequent developments. In style, in illustration, in
					organization, this book sets a new standard of achievement for high-school histories. The
					abundance and excellence of the illustrations are particularly notable. These, with their
					detailed legends, form a sort of parallel narrative of immense value to a proper
					understanding of the text. Several full-page illustrations in color and a number of "pen
					etchings," designed especially for this volume, add to the artistic excellence.</p>

				<p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> volume offers an illuminating treatment of European history from
					the eighteenth century to the present time. It includes the best and most comprehensive
					treatment of European developments of the first decade of the twentieth century available
					in any high-school history. The text is a rewriting and condensation for high schools of
					the authors' two-volume "Development of Modern Europe," the standard college text in the
					subject.</p>

				<p>T<hi rend="sc">HESE</hi> volumes will meet the demand for a history of recent times which
					shall explain the social and economic as well as the political development of our own age,
					and shall also prepare the student to understand the great problems of the world in which
					he finds himself.</p>

				<p>Their aim is to correct the general disregard of recent history,-- to enable the student
					to catch up with his own times so that he may peruse with intelligence the news given in
					the morning paper.</p>

				<p>Much less space is devoted to purely political and military events than has been commonly
					assigned to them in histories of the nineteenth century. On the other hand, the more
					fundamental economic matters-- the Industrial Revolution, commerce and the colonies, the
					internal reforms of the European states, etc.-- have been generously treated.</p>

				<p>The necessarily succinct outline of events which fills the books can be considerably
					amplified and enlivened by "Readings in Modern European History" from the same authors,
					which follows the narrative chapter by chapter, and furnishes examples of the stuff of
					which history is made.</p>

				<p>"<hi rend="b">R</hi>EADINGS IN MODERN EUROPEAN HISTORY" aims to stimulate the student to
					real thought and interest in his work by bringing him right to the sources of historical

					present, can carry him back to themselves and make their times his own. In this way the
					book offers the proper background and atmosphere for " The Development of Modern Europe,"
					by the same authors, which it accompanies chapter by chapter and section by section.</p>

				<p>Bibliographies provided in the Appendix start the student on the path to a really
					thorough study of the field.</p>

				<p><q>A goodly number of the readings in this volume are of the constitutional kind which
						merit and richly reward careful study. A still larger number are of the interesting and

						an excellent critical classification which guides the student quickly on to the
