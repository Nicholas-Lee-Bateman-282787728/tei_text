				<p>Hendricks county will celebrate its ninety-first birthday on December 20, 1914. The
					eighth General Assembly of Indiana met at Corydon on the first day of December, 1823, and
					created three counties before the close of the session, among them being Hendricks, the
					fifty-first county to be organized in the state. The bill creating the county was
					introduced in the Senate on December 9th and, after passing both houses of the
					Legislature, was signed on December 20th by Governor William Hendricks, in whose honor the
					new county was named. The county had been a part of the so-called New Purchase which was
					secured from the Indians in the fall of 1818, and, previous to its organization, had been
					under the civil and criminal jurisdiction of contiguous counties.</p>

				<p>It is difficult for the people of Hendricks county today to realize the wonderful changes
					which have come about since the organization of the county. In 1823, Indianapolis was a
					mere village, with a few log cabins and a population not to exceed two hundred. In fact,
					the whole population of the state did not exceed one hundred and fifty thousand and
					practically all of this was south of the present National Road. Not a railroad, canal or
					improved road of any kind was to be found within the limits of the state and all
					transportation was confined to the trails through the dense woods and to the streams and
					rivers flowing into the Ohio and Wabash. The farmer had only two implements, the plow and
					harrow, which were not operated by hand; he planted and harvested all his crops by hand
					and frequently had to grind his corn and wheat in the same way. He sheared his sheep and
					cut his flax, while his good wife took the raw product and made the family clothing. The
					farmer was his own blacksmith, shoemaker, mason, carpenter and clothing manufacturer and
					frequently was his own doctor, dentist and lawyer. The division of labor as we know it now
					was practically unknown to the early settlers of this county.</p>

				<p>From a trackless wilderness Hendricks county has come to be a center of prosperity and
					civilization with millions of wealth, systems of railways and interurbans, schools and
					colleges, marvelous industries and immense agricultural productions. Conditions have
					changed so much since those early <pb id="VAC1000-004" n="[9]"/> days that the pioneer of
					ninety years ago would hardly recognize his own farm today if it were possible for him to
					see it. The children of these sturdy pioneers cannot realize the hardships which
					surrounded their forefathers on every hand and the fact that this history of the county
					records the lives of many of these pioneers gives the volume a value which is hard to
					estimate. As the years roll by it becomes increasingly difficult to write the early
					history of the county. The pioneers are nearly all gone; old newspapers, records and
					valuable historical material are being destroyed each year, and, for these reasons, the
					task of writing an accurate history of the county becomes more difficult as time passes.
					It is to be regretted that the facts of our early history have been so meagerly preserved,
					and, indeed, so carelessly lost, that it is hard to present important features in a
					satisfactory manner. Hendricks county has suffered in the loss of much valuable data which
					might throw an interesting light on its early history, a fact which the editor has had
					forcibly impressed on him several times in the preparation of this volume. To perpetuate
					the history of this county and to trace and record the social, political and industrial
					progress of the county from its first inception has been the purpose of the editor.</p>

				<p>In covering ninety-one years of history, as this volume tries to do, it is impossible to
					do full justice to every phase of the county's growth, but it is believed that much
					valuable data is here preserved which would otherwise have been lost. The personal
					sketches appearing in the book are full of interesting details which throw a flood of
					light on the pioneer history of the county. It is our duty to gather in good and enduring
					form all the stories of our forefathers and portray as truthfully as possible the
					struggles through which they passed and in this way give credit to the courageous men and
					women who started this county in such a strong and vigorous manner. The editor and
					publishers wish to thank the citizens of Hendricks county who have helped in various ways
					to make this volume possible, not only in the way of contributing historical material, but
					also because of their financial support without which it would have been impossible to
					issue the volume.</p>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">GEOLOGY AND TOPOGRAPHY OF HENDRICKS COUNTY.</hi></head>

							<p>Hendricks county has a central position in the state, the county seat being nearly
								in the exact center from north to south and twenty miles west of the center on an
								east and west line. Its geographical position is between parallels 39 and 40 degrees
								north latitude and meridians 86 and 87 west longitude. The exact position of
								Danville is 39 degrees 40 minutes north latitude and 86 degrees 30 minutes west
								longitude. In extent, the county was intended to be twenty miles square, but the
								surveyors' correction line, which passes through the northern part of the county,
								destroys its quadrilateral shape, and makes it more than half a mile wider at the
								north than the south. However, owing to irregularities in the surveys, which were
								caused by the passage through the county of both the second principal meridian and a
								correction line of the government surveys, the county averaged just twenty miles
								square until the year 1868, when a strip two miles in width, extending from the
								meridian line west to Mill creek and containing twenty square miles, was added to
								the county from Morgan county, which makes the area of the county four hundred and
								twenty square miles. The county is bounded on the north by Boone county, on the east
								by Marion county, on the south by Morgan county and on the west by the counties of
								Putnam and Montgomery.</p>

							<p>The general elevation of the surface of Hendricks county is much higher than the
								surrounding country, except portions of Boone and Putnam counties. Passing through
								the county from south to north, from near Clayton to Lebanon, in Boone county, is a
								natural water-shed, which divides the waters of Eel river and Sugar creek from the
								waters of White river, and at a point three miles northwest of Danville, at Mount
								Pleasant church, it attains an elevation of more than one thousand feet.</p>

							<p>The general surface of the county is level or gently undulating. Though the streams
								in many places have eroded deep, narrow valleys, there are but few acres in the
								county which, on this account, cannot be cultivated and not one which cannot be made
								useful for grazing purposes.</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-022" n="26"/>

							<p>The streams which make the natural drainage of Hendricks county are the White
								Licks, Big, Little, East and West forks, Abner's creek, Mill creek, School branch
								and Eel river. The east and north parts of the county are drained by the White
								Licks, the southwest by Mill creek and the northwest by Eel river. Owing to the
								elevation of the land, but few springs are found in the county, thought pure water
								in great abundance is obtained at no great depth by digging through sand and clay.
								Originally the county was covered by a dense forest, composed of every variety of
								timber, trees and under-growth found in this latitude, with an extraordinary amount
								of the more valuable kinds, popular, walnut and the oaks. After the Indians were
								gone and the annual burning of the woods ceased, there grew up a dense under-growth,
								and the highways of the early settlers consisted of narrow trails through the woods,
								the thickness of which may be illustrated by the statement of a pioneer that when
								driving cattle from place to place they often tied handspikes across their
								foreheads, which prevented them from leaving the trail.</p>

							<p>In all parts of the county the soil is productive for cereals, grasses and
								fruits.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">GEOLOGY.</hi></head>

							<p>No official survey has ever been made of Hendricks county until the spring of 1914,
								but the publication of this report, having been delayed by the United States
								government printing department, will not be issued in time for this work. However,
								good information is at hand.</p>

							<p>The entire county is covered by a glacial drift formation from ten to three hundred
								feet in depth. This formation is composed of sand, clay and calcareous substances,
								boulders, fragments of crystalline rocks, remains of ancient animals and vegetable
								life and extensive moraines of gravel.</p>

							<p>The drift in Hendricks county rests upon a stratum of Devonian sandstone, known to
								geologists as the Marshall or knob sandstone. It is soft, brittle and shaly and
								unfit for economic uses. This sandstone ceases to appear near the eastern line of
								the county and it is probable that in the southeast corner of the county, the black
								slate of the Hamilton group, which underlies the Marshall sandstone, may be found.
								Near the western border of the county sub-carboniferous limestone overlaps the
								sandstone. The drift formation is composed of a disintegration and decomposition of
								almost every variety of rocks, soils, the remains of animal and vegetable life and
								various mineral elements.</p>

							<p>As an introduction to the history of Hendricks county it is fitting that a brief
								survey of the history of the state of Indiana should be given, not for the purpose
								of teaching the reader the course of events which make up Hoosier history, but for
								the subordinate purpose of building a foundation for the county history, a
								preparatory word to lead the reader to a better understanding of this work.</p>

							<p>Not until the years 1670-2 did the first white travelers venture so far into the
								great Northwest as Indiana or Lake Michigan. Claude Dablon and Claude Allouez, two
								intrepid Frenchmen, then visited what is now the eastern part of Wisconsin, the
								northeastern portion of Illinois, and probably the portion of this state north of
								the Kankakee river. In the year following M. Joliet, an agent of the French colonial
								government, and James Marquette, a missionary stationed at Mackinaw, explored the
								country around Green bay, and along Fox and Wisconsin rivers as far westward as the
								Mississippi river, the banks of which they reached on June 17, 1673. They descended
								this river a short distance and returned by way of the Illinois river. At a village
								among the Illinois Indians, Marquette and his followers were received with friendly
								hospitality and made guests at a great feast of hominy, fish, dog meat and roast
								buffalo. In 1682 LaSalle explored the West, but it is not known certainly whether or
								not he entered the territory now embraced in Indiana. He took possession, however,
								of the whole Mississippi region in the name of France, and, in honor of the king, he
								named it Louisiana. Spain at the same time claimed the region around the Gulf of
								Mexico. Consequently the two nations clashed.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">FIRST INDIAN INHABITANTS.</hi></head>

							<p>At this time the country now comprising the state of Indiana was held by the Miami
								confederacy of Indians, the Miamis proper, originally the <pb id="VAC1000-024"
									n="28"/> Twightwees, being the eastern and most powerful tribe. Their villages
								were few and scattering. These Indian settlements were occasionally visited by
								Christian missionaries, fur traders and adventurers, but no permanent settlement was
								risked by the whites. The Five Nations farther to the east, in the New England
								states, comprised the Mohawks, Oneidas, Cayugas, Onondagas and Senecas. In 1677 the
								number of warriors in this confederation was two thousand one hundred and fifty.
								About 1711 the Tuscaroras retired from Carolina and joined the Iroquois, and the
								organization then became known as the Six Nations. In 1689 hostilities broke out
								between the Indian tribes and the French colonists of Canada, and the following
								series of wars served to check the purpose of Louis XIV and to retard the planting
								of French colonies in the Mississippi valley. Missionary efforts, however, continued
								with more failure than success, the Jesuits allying themselves with the Indians in
								habits and customs, even encouraging inter-marriage between them and their white
								followers.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">NATIONAL POLICIES.</hi></head>

							<p>The English, who were envious of the French, resorted to every method to extend
								their territory westward. Both nations secured aid from various Indian tribes, and a
								bloody and merciless warfare continued for many years. France continued in her
								effort to connect the Canadian country with the gulf of Mexico by a chain of trading
								posts and colonies, which further increased the jealousy of England and really laid
								the foundation for the French and Indian war, which terminated in the treaty of 1763
								at Paris, and by which France ceded to Great Britain all of North America east of
								the Mississippi river, except New Orleans and some contiguous territory. The British
								policy, after getting control of the Indian territory, was still unfavorable to its
								growth in population. In 1765 the number of French families within the limits of the
								Northwestern territory did not exceed six hundred. These were in settlements around
								Detroit, along the Wabash river, and in the neighbor, hood of Fort Chartres, Cahokia
								and Kaskaskia on the Mississippi river. Of these families, eighty-five resided at
								Post Vincennes, fourteen at Fort Ouiatenon on the Wabash and in the neighborhood of
								the confluence of the St. Mary and St. Joseph rivers. The colonial policy of the
								British government opposed any measures which might strengthen the settlements in
								the interior of this country, lest they become self-supporting and independent of
								the mother country. Thomas Jefferson, the wise statesman and governor of Virginia,,
								saw from the first that actual occupation of western lands was the only way to keep
								them out of the hands of foreigners and Indians. Accordingly he <pb id="VAC1000-025"
									n="29"/> engaged a corps of scientific men and sent them to the Mississippi river
								to ascertain the point on that stream intersected by latitude thirty-six degrees
								thirty minutes and to measure its distance north to the Ohio. In that quarter he
								intrusted the military operations to General Clark, with instructions to select a
								strong position near the named point and erect a fort and garrison the same for
								protecting the settlers, and then to extend his conquest toward the great lakes on
								the north. Conforming to his instructions, General Clark erected Fort Jefferson on
								the Mississippi, a few miles above the southern limit. The result of these
								operations was the addition to Virginia of the vast Northwest territory. The fact
								that a chain of forts was established by the Americans in this region convinced the
								British commissioners that we had entitled ourselves to the land. During this time
								minor events were transpiring outside the territory in question which later promoted
								the settlement in what is now known as Indiana.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">THE GEORGE ROGERS CLARK EXPEDITION.</hi></head>

							<p>George Rogers Clark, a resident of Kentucky, but a native of Virginia, some time in
								the spring of 1776 formulated a scheme of more rapid settlement in the Northwest
								territory. That part of Kentucky was occupied by Henderson and Company, who
								pretended to own the land and set a high price on the same. Clark doubted the
								validity of their claim, and wished to make a test of it, and adjust the control of
								the country so that settlements might be fostered. He called a meeting of the
								citizens at Harrodstown, to assemble June 6, 1776, and consider the claims of the
								company, and consult with reference to the interests of the country.</p>

							<p>This meeting was held on the day appointed and delegates elected to confer with the
								state of Virginia as to the propriety of attaching the new country as a county to
								that state. Many causes prevented a consummation of this object until the year 1778.
								Virginia was favorable to the enterprise, but would not take action as a state.
								Governor Henry and a few others, however, assisted Colonel Clark all they could.
								Clark organized an expedition and took in stores at Pittsburgh and Wheeling, and
								proceeded down the Ohio to the falls, where he built some light fortifications.</p>

							<p>Clark's original plan was to take Vincennes, but he changed it on account of an
								erroneous idea as to the strength of the garrison at that place. He left the Falls
								of the Ohio on June 24, 1878, and, with one hundred and fifty-three men, floated
								down the Ohio, reaching the mouth of the Tennessee river four days later. He then
								landed his men and marched them to Kaskaskia, <pb id="VAC1000-026" n="30"/> reaching
								the quaint little French village on the night of July 4th. Clark had no difficulty
								in winning the French inhabitants to the American cause and a few days later the
								people of Cahokia also took the oath of allegiance to the Americans. Clark now had
								Kaskaskia and Cahokia and only Vincennes remained to be secured. Clark wanted some
								of the people of Kaskaskia to go to Vincennes and win over the inhabitants of the
								village and finally Doctor Lafont and Father Gibault, a Catholic priest who had
								charge of the Wabash mission, undertook the task. On July 14, 1778, these two
								emissaries left Kaskaskia with a small retinue and within a few days were at
								Vincennes. Two days after their arrival they had won the people to the American
								cause and had the deep satisfaction of gathering all of the French inhabitants in
								the church, where they took the oath of allegiance. An officer was elected; the fort
								was garrisoned; and for the first time an American flag was raised on Indiana
								soil.</p>

							<p>Father Gibault returned to Kaskaskia about the first of August and brought the glad
								news to Clark. but just at this time a new trouble was threatening Clark. His men
								were leaving him because their enlistment had expired and, since he had no authority
								to extend it, he was in grave danger of losing the larger part of his force. But
								Clark was not to be dismayed. He made some liberal promises and finally succeeded in
								getting one hundred of them to re-enlist, filling the vacancies with French
								volunteers. Clark now placed Capt. Leonard Helmn in command of Vincennes and made
								him superintendent of Indian affairs on the Wabash. As the summer and fall of 1778
								wore away the British were planning to capture Vincennes and late in the fall Gen.
								Henry Hamilton moved down the Wabash with a force of thirty regulars, fifty Canadian
								volunteers and four hundred Indians. He reached Vincennes December 15th and found
								Captain Helm and one other man in the fort. Captain Helm stood by a loaded cannon
								with a lighted match in his hand as the envoys of General Hamilton approached the
								fort and shouted out that no one should enter the fort until he knew what terms
								would be given. General Hamilton assured him that he could march out with all the
								honors of war-- and Vincennes became a British post.</p>

							<p>On January 29, 1779, Clark, who was still at Kaskaskia, heard of the fall of
								Vincennes and determined to retake the place. He gathered together about one hundred
								and seventy men, and on February 5th started from Kaskaskia, crossing the stream of
								the same name. The weather was wet and the low-lands covered with water. He had to
								subsist on such game as he could kill en route. The men underwent great privations,
								wading through acres of water to their hips, and suffering intensely with the cold.
								However, Colonel <pb id="VAC1000-027" n="31"/> Clark shared all of the hardships of
								the men and asked nothing of them which he would not undergo himself. They reached
								the little Wabash on the 13th, and two days were occupied in crossing the swollen
								stream. They found the roads no better, but marched down and reached the Embarrass
								on the 17th of the month. The next two days were consumed in attempting to cross the
								angry stream. Finally canoes were constructed and the entire force crossed the main
								stream, and then found the lowlands entirely under water and ice which had formed
								recently. His men refused to proceed. All of Clark's persuasions had no effect upon
								the half starved men. In one company was a small drummer-boy and also a sergeant who
								stood six feet and two inches high. Clark ordered him, the sergeant, to mount the
								boy on his shoulders and plunge into the water. He did so, and the small drummer
								beat the charge from his position, while Clark, sword in hand, followed. This
								maneuver was electrical, and the men, with a cheer, followed their leader. On
								arriving within two miles of the fort Clark halted his men and sent in a letter
								demanding surrender, to which he received no reply. He next ordered Lieutenant
								Bayley, with fourteen men, to advance and fire on the fort, while the main body of
								men moved in another direction and took posession of the strongest portion of the
								town. Clark then demanded Hamilton's immediate surrender, on penalty of being
								treated as a murderer. Hamilton refused indignantly. Fighting began and continued
								for over an hour, when Hamilton proposed a three days' truce. Clark,
								characteristically, sent word that nothing but unconditional surrender was
								satisfactory. In less than an hour the surrender was dictated by General Clark. This
								was on February 24, 1779.</p>

							<p>Of this expedition, of its results, of its importance, as well as of the skill and
								bravery of those engaged, a volume could well be written. The expedition has never
								been surpassed in modern warfare, when we consider that by it the whole territory
								now included in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and a part of Minnesota
								was added to the Union, and so admitted by the British commissioners in the treaty
								of peace in 1783. Clark reinstated Captain Helm in command at Vincennes, with
								instruction to subdue the marauding Indians, which he did, and soon comparative
								quiet prevailed on Indiana soil. The whole credit of this conquest belongs to
								Colonel Clark and Francis Vigo.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">NORTHWEST GOVERNMENT.</hi></head>

							<p>By the conquest of Colonel Clark, Indiana came within the territory belonging to
								Virginia. In January, 1783, the General Assembly of the Old Dominion resolved to
								cede this territory to the general government of the United States. The proposition
								made by Virginia was accepted by the government and the transfer made early in 1784.
								The terms were that Virginia was to be reimbursed for all expenses incurred in
								exploring and protecting settlers in the territory; also that one hundred and fifty
								thousand acres of land should be granted to the soldiers who, with Colonel Clark,
								had made the famous expedition. After all these matters had been attended to, in the
								spring of 1784, the matter of governing this section of the west was referred to a
								committee of Messrs. Jefferson, of Virginia, Chase, of Maryland, and Howell, of
								Rhode Island, which committee, among other things, reported an ordinance prohibiting
								slavery in the territory after 1800, but this article of the ordinance was rejected.
								The Ordinance of 1784 was passed April 23d and remained the fundamental law of the
								Northwest territory until July 13, 1787. The ordinance of 1787 has an interesting
								history. Much controversy has been indulged in as to who is really entitled to the
								credit of framing it. The honor was held by several men jointly, among them being
								Nathan Dane, Rufus King, Timothy Pickering, Thomas Jefferson and Manasseh Cutler.
								Mr. Jefferson had vainly tried to secure a system of government for the Northwest
								territory excluding slavery therefrom. The South, however, invariably voted him
								down.</p>

							<p>In July, 1787, an organizing act without the slavery clause was pending, which was
								supposed to secure its passage. Congress went into session in New York City. July
								5th, Dr. Manasseh Cutler, of Massachusetts, came to New York in the interests of
								some land or speculators in the Northwest territory. He was a courtly gentleman of
								the old-school type and had won the confidence of the Southern leaders. He wished to
								purchase five million, five hundred thousand acres of land in the new territory.
								Jefferson and his administration desired to make a record on the reduction of the
								public debt, and this was a rare opportunity. Massachusetts' representatives could
								not vote against Cutler's scheme, as many of their constituents were interested in
								the measure personally; Southern members were almost committed. Thus, Cutler held
								the key to the situation, and dictated terms, which were as follows: <list
									type="ordered">
									<item n="1.">The exclusion of slavery from the territory forever.</item>

									<pb id="VAC1000-029" n="33"/>

									<item n="2."> Providing one thirty-sixth of all lands for public schools.</item>

							<p>Dr. Cutler planted himself on this platform and would not yield, stating that
								unless they could procure these lands under desirable conditions and surroundings,
								that they did not care to purchase. On July 13, 1787, the bill became a law. Thus
								the great states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin were consecrated
								to freedom, intelligence and morality. On October 5, 1787, Congress elected General
								Arthur St. Clair governor of the Northwest territory. He assumed his official duties
								at Marietta and at once proceeded to treat with the Indians and organize a
								territorial government. He first organized a court at Marietta, consisting of three
								judges appointed by Congress, himself being president of the court.</p>

							<p>The Governor, with his judges, then visited Kaskaskia for the purpose of organizing
								a civil government, having previously instructed Major Hamtramck at Vincennes to
								present the policy of the new administration to the several Indian tribes and learn
								their feelings. They received the messenger with a cool indifference, which, when
								reported to the governor, convinced him that nothing short of military force would
								command compliance with the civil government. He at once proceeded to Fort
								Washington to consult with General Harmar as to future action. In the meantime he
								intrusted to the secretary of the territory, Winthrop Sargent, the settlement of the
								disputed land claims, who found it a hard task, and in his reports states that he
								found the records so falsified, vouchers destroyed, and other crookedness as to make
								it impossible to get at a just settlement, which but again proves that the "graft"
								of the twentieth century existed decades before this word had been coined.</p>

							<p>The general court in 1790 passed stringent laws against the sale of intoxicating
								liquors to Indians and also to soldiers within ten miles of any military post; also
								prohibiting any games of chance within the territory.</p>

							<p>The consultation between St. Clair and General Harmar ended by a decision to raise
								a large military force and thoroughly chastise the Indians. about the head of the
								Wabash river. Accordingly, Virginia and Pennsylvania were called upon to muster
								eighteen hundred men at Fort Steuben, and, with the garrison of that fort, join the
								forces at Vincennes under Major Hamtramck, who proceeded up the Wabash as far as the
								Vermillion river, <pb id="VAC1000-030" n="34"/> destroying villages, but without
								finding an enemy to oppose him. General Harmar, with one thousand four hundred and
								fifty men, marched from Fort Washington to the Maumee, and began punishing the
								Indians, but with little success. The expedition left Fort Washington September
								30th, and returned to that place November 4th, having lost during that period one
								hundred and eighty-three men killed and thirty-one wounded. General Harmar's defeat
								alarmed as well as aroused the citizens in the frontier counties of Virginia,
								thinking the Indians might invade that state.</p>

							<p>The governor of Virginia called out the militia along the upper borders of that
								state; at the same time Charles Scott was appointed brigadier-general of the
								Kentucky militia now preparing to defend the frontiers of that state. This excited
								Congress and a war board was appointed, consisting of five members. On March 9,
								1971, General Knox, secretary of war, wrote to General Scott recommending an
								expedition against the Indians on the Wabash. On March 3, 1791, Congress invested
								Governor St. Clair with the command of three thousand troops, and he was instructed
								by the secretary of war to march to the Miami village and establish a strong and
								permanent military post. After that was accomplished he was to seek the enemy with
								all his available forces and make them feel the effect of the superiority of the
								whites.</p>

							<p>Although seriously damaged, the Indians were far from subdued. The Canadians and
								English along the border gave them much encouragement. In September, 1791, St. Clair
								moved from Fort Washington with a force of two thousand men and a number of pieces
								of artillery. November 3d he reached the headwaters of the Wabash, where Fort
								Recovery was later built, and here the army camped, consisting of one thousand four
								hundred effective men. The following morning the army advanced and engaged a force
								of twelve hundred Indians. Here the American army was disastrously defeated, having
								thirty-nine officers and five hundred and thirty-nine men killed and missing,
								twenty-two officers and two hundred and thirty-two men wounded. Several pieces of
								artillery and all their provisions were taken from them. The property loss was
								estimated at thirty-two thousand dollars. There has always been some disposition to
								blame General St. Clair for this awful defeat, but his recent biographer, John
								Newton Boucher, of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, proves conclusively that he was not to
								blame. Be that as it may, he resigned his commission after that battle and the work
								was taken up by General Anthony Wayne, of Revolutionary fame, who organized his
								forces <pb id="VAC1000-031" n="35"/> at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and in October,
								1793, moved westward at the head of an army of three thousand six hundred men. He
								proposed an offensive campaign. The Indians still held that the Ohio river should be
								the boundary line between the United States and their lands.</p>

							<p>Major-General Scott, with about sixteen hundred volunteers from Kentucky, joined
								the regular troops under General Wayne on July 26, 1794, and on the 28th the united
								force began their march for the Indian towns on the Maumee river. Arriving at the
								mouth of the Auglaize, they erected Fort Defiance and on August 15th the army
								advanced toward the British fort at the foot of the rapids of the Maumee, where, on
								the 20th, almost within reach of the British, the American army gained a decisive
								victory over the combined forces of the hostile Indians and a considerable number of
								Detroit militia at the battle of Fallen Timbers. The number of the enemy was
								estimated at two thousand, against about nine hundred American troops actually
								engaged. As soon as the action began this horde of savages abandoned themselves to
								flight and dispersed with terror and dismay, leaving Wayne's victorious army in full
								possession of the field. The Americans lost thirty-three killed and one hundred
								wounded; the loss of the enemy more than doubled this number.</p>

							<p>The army remained three days and nights on the banks of the Maumee, in front of the
								field of battle, during which time all the houses and cornfields were consumed and
								destroyed for a considerable distance both above and below Fort Miami, as well as
								within pistol shot of the British garrison, who were compelled to remain idle
								spectators to this general devastation and conflagration among which were the
								houses, stores and property of Colonel McKee, the British Indian agent, and general
								stimulator of the war then existing between the United States and the savages. On
								the return march to Fort Defiance the villages and corn fields for about fifty miles
								on each side of the Maumee were destroyed as well as those for a considerable
								distance around the post.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">ORIGIN OF FORT WAYNE.</hi></head>

							<p>On September 14, 1794, the army under General Wayne commenced its march toward the
								deserted Miami villages at the confluence of St. Joseph and St. Mary's rivers,
								arriving October 17th, and on the following day the site of Fort Wayne was selected.
								The fort was completed November 22d and garrisoned by a strong detachment of
								infantry and artillery under the command of Colonel John F. Hamtramck, who gave to
								the new fort the name of "Fort Wayne." The Kentucky volunteers now returned to Fort
								Washington, <pb id="VAC1000-032" n="36"/> and were mustered out of service. General
								Wayne, with the federal troops, marched to Greenville and took up his headquarters
								for the winter. Here, on August 5, 1795, after several months of active negotiation,
								this gallant officer succeeded in concluding a general treaty of peace with all the
								hostile tribes of the Northwest territory. This treaty opened the way for the flood
								of immigration for many years, and ultimately made the states and territories now
								constituting the mighty Northwest.</p>

							<p>Up to the organization of the Indiana territory there is but little history to
								record aside from those events connected with military affairs. In July, 1796, after
								a treaty was concluded between the United States and Spain, the British garrison,
								with their arms, artillery and stores, were withdrawn from the posts within the
								boundaries of the United States northwest of the Ohio river, and a detachment of
								American troops consisting of sixty-five men under the command of Captain Moses
								Porter took possession of the evacuated post of Detroit in the same month.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">ORGANIZATION OF INDIANA TERRITORY, JULY 4,
								1800.</hi></head>

							<p>On the final victory of the American army in 1796 the principal town within what is
								now the state of Indiana was Vincennes, which comprised only fifty houses, but
								presented a thrifty appearance. There was also a small settlement where Lawrenceburg
								now stands, and several smaller settlements around trading posts, and the total
								number of civilized inhabitants in the territory was estimated at four thousand
								eight hundred seventy-five.</p>

							<p>Indiana territory was organized by act of Congress May 7, 1800, the material
								features of the Ordinance of 1787 remaining in force and the people being invested
								with all the rights and advantages granted and secured by that ordinance.</p>

							<p>The seat of government was fixed at Vincennes. On May 13, 1800, William Henry
								Harrison, a native of Virginia, was appointed governor. John Gibson, of
								Pennsylvania, was made secretary of the territory. The government for Indiana
								territory went into active operation on July 4, 1800, and General Harrison called
								together the first territorial Legislature or Council January 12, 180l. From this
								time to 1810 the chief questions under discussion were land speculators, African
								slavery and the hostile views of the Shawnee chief, Tecumseh, and his brother, the
								wily Prophet.</p>

							<p>Up to this time the sixth article of the Ordinance of 1787, prohibiting slavery,
								had been somewhat neglected and many French settlers held slaves; many slaves had
								been removed to slave-holding states. A session of <pb id="VAC1000-033" n="37"/>
								delegates elected by popular vote in the new territory met December 20, 1802, and
								petitioned Congress to revoke the sixth article of the old ordinance. Congress
								failed to grant this, as well as many other similar petitions. When it appeared from
								a popular vote in the territory that a majority of one hundred and thirty-eight were
								in favor of organizing a General Assembly, Governor Harrison, on September 11, 1804,
								issued a proclamation, and called for an election to be held in the several counties
								of the territory January 3, 1805, to choose members of the House of Representatives,
								who should meet at Vincennes, February 1st. The delegates were duly elected and
								assembled as ordered, and they perfected plans for territorial organization and
								selected ten men whose names were sent to President Jefferson and the President
								chose five of the number to act as members of the Council. The first General
								Assembly or Legislature of the territory met at Vincennes July 29, 1805.</p>

							<p>On July 30th the Governor delivered his first message to the Council and House of
								Representatives. Benjamin Parke, who came from New Jersey in 1801, was the first
								delegate elected to Congress.</p>

							<p>The first newspaper published within the territory of Indiana was the <hi rend="i"
									>Western Sun</hi>, first issued at Vincennes in 1803, by Elihu Stout, of Kentucky,
								and first named the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi>, but changed to the <hi
									rend="i">Sun</hi> July 4, 1804.</p>

							<p>In 1810 the total population of Indiana was 24,520. There were then reported 33
								grist mills, 14 saw mills, 3 horse mills, 18 tanneries, 28 distilleries, 3 powder
								mills, 1,256 looms, 1,300 spinning wheels; value of woolen, cotton, hemp and flax
								cloth, $150,059; of nails, 30,000 pounds; of wine from grapes, 96 barrels, and
								50,000 pounds of maple sugar.</p>

							<p>The territory of Indiana was divided in 1805, when the territory of Michigan was
								established to comprise practically the same territory which it has today. In 1809
								Illinois was set off and Indiana was left with practically its present limits. For
								the first half century after the settlement Vincennes grew slowly.</p>

							<p>The commandants and priests governed with absolute power; the whites lived in peace
								with the Indians. The necessaries of life were easily procured; there was nothing to
								stimulate energy or progress. In such a state of society there was no demand for
								learning and science. Few could read and fewer still could write their own names;
								they were void of public spirit, enterprise or ingenuity. Not until the close of the
								war of 1812 and 1814 did Indiana take on her vigorous growth, and since then she has
								kept pace with her sister states. In 1815 the total white population was sixty-three
								thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven. On February 13, 1813, the;= Legislature in
								session at Vincennes changed the seat of government to Corydon. <pb id="VAC1000-034"
									n="38"/> Governor Posey took Governor Harrison's place May 25, 1813, for the
								latter was engaged in subduing the enemies of this country.</p>

							<p>Up to 1811 a man must own at least fifty acres of land before he was entitled to
								cast his vote. To become a member of the Council he must possess five hundred acres
								of land, and each member of the Legislature must needs own two hundred acres.</p>

							<p>In 1814 the territory was divided into three judicial districts. The Governor
								appointed the judges and the compensation was fixed at seven hundred dollars per
								annum. The same year two banks were authorized, the Mechanics Bank of Madison, with
								seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and the Bank of Vincennes, with a capital
								of five hundred thousand dollars.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">STATE ORGANIZATION IN 1816.</hi></head>

							<p>The last territorial Legislature convened at Corydon December 14, 1815, and
								petitioned Congress for authority to adopt a state constitution and maintain a state
								government. Congress enacted the proper legislation and Indiana was made a state. On
								May 13, 1816, an election was held for forty-three delegates to a constitutional
								convention. That body met at Corydon, June 10th to 29th, Jonathan Jennings
								presiding, and William Hendricks acting as secretary.</p>

							<p>The representatives in the constitutional convention were able men. The
								constitution they there formed for Indiana in 1816 was in no wise inferior to that
								of any other commonwealth in the Union at that date.</p>

							<p>The first state election was held the first Monday in August, 1816, and Jonathan
								Jennings was elected governor, Christopher Harrison, lieutenant governor, and
								William Hendricks, representative to Congress.</p>

							<p>The close of the war of 1812 and 1814 was followed by a great rush of immigrants to
								the new state and in 1820 the state had more than doubled its population, having at
								this time one hundred and forty-seven thousand one hundred and seventy-eight
								inhabitants. This date was the beginning of prosperity for Indiana, and at this time
								begins our history of the county of Hendricks.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">EARLY SETTLEMENT AND ORGANIZATION.</hi></head>

							<p>The history of the early settlement of Hendricks county would be worthy of
								treatment in a separate volume were the records and other sources of information in
								regard to those days in existence. At that time the importance of keeping such
								things was not realized, and consequently few can be obtained. The settlement of
								Hendricks county occurred early in 1820, within six years of one hundred years ago.
								Many of the people in the county today remember of hearing their fathers and mothers
								recount the thrilling tales of pioneer life in the early period of log rollings,
								husking bees, barbecues, cabin raisings, hunts and the thousand and one other
								incidents which were a part of the early life. Settlements were miles apart and
								social intercourse was difficult, so these entertainments afforded the only
								opportunities for the people to congregate, and these periods were generally months
								apart. So the pioneer lived alone with his family in the silent and mighty forest,
								sallying out before dawn to shoot the game or to cast a line in the stream nearby
								for the day's food supply. The meat of the wild game and the rough cereals raised in
								the patch of cleared ground provided the principal sustenance for the family; the
								clothes were manufactured by the women, who sat for days before the loom;
								linsey-woolsey and homespun, adorned with the skins of small animals, were the
								popular weaves. The good mother was the teacher of the children also; meager
								teaching it was, but thorough.</p>

							<p>Relative to the early settlement, it is well to quote a few paragraphs from the
								writings of Logan Esarey, an authority on Indiana history. He writes: <q><p>"The
										attempt to better their economic condition was no doubt the cause that led a
										great majority of the immigrants to come to Indiana in the early period of its
										statehood. They were encouraged and many of them grossly deceived by the
										advertisements in the Indiana papers. The <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi> and the
											<hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> of Vincennes, the <hi rend="i">Indiana
											Republican</hi> of Madison, the <hi rend="i">Intelligencer</hi> and the <hi
											rend="i">Ledger</hi> of Richmond, from which the following data has been
										collected, are full of the most glowing accounts of the prosperity of this
										western world. Judged from these papers, there was bustle and activity
										everywhere. Cotton gins, ox mills, grist mills, salt wells, rich mines of silver
										and <pb id="VAC1000-036" n="40"/> gold, steam saw mills, card mills, breweries
										were in need of laborers everywhere. Dozens of towns, each sure to be a
										metropolis, were springing up and in which lots could be bought for a trifle and
										on credit. A steamer one hundred and sixty-six feet long was on the ways at
										Jeffersonville. Another would soon be launched at Bono to ply on the branches of
										White river. Indiana seemed to be a bee-hive of industry, glowing with
										opportunity for the poor and industrious.</p>
									<p>"The period from 1816 to 1825, while the capital was at Corydon, was one of
										unprecedented immigration into Indiana. The settlers crowded up the waterways
										beyond the middle of the state. The number of counties in the state rose from
										thirteen to fifty-two. Almost all of the territory south of White river was
										organized and the line of settlement was pushed well to the north of the
										National road. The latter had not yet been opened and practically all of the
										settlers came by way of or across the Ohio river."</p></q></p>

							<p>The long, weary journey in a covered wagon, over rough hills, through tangled
								valleys, fording streams, slow, tortuous miles traveled, made the final stopping
								point inviting to the settler, even if it consisted of but a convenient nook in the
								forest or a sequestered spot on the banks of a stream, for it meant home wherever it
								was. The first nights were spent under the wagon-canopy or in a lean-to hastily
								erected of branches and grasses. The pioneer immediately began the erection of his
								cabin, hewing the logs and notching them into place. A fireplace was constructed in
								one end of the small hut, made of sticks and mud, and the fire therein afterward
								served the purpose of light, heat and as a cook-stove. The furniture of the interior
								was as rough as the cabin itself; three-legged stools, puncheon floor, a bed built
								against the wall, and a small table generally comprised the interior of the shack.
								The walls, through which numerous breezes penetrated, were hung on the inside with
								animal skins, that is, if such skins were procurable. However crude these homes
								might have been, the health and sturdiness of the occupants was mighty, and many of
								those who live today in luxury and idleness would swap their all for this strength
								of body and mind.</p>

							<p>A great part of the land in central Indiana in those days was swampy. Sloughs were
								scattered through the forests and were far from healthy. Ague among the settlers was
								an established illness, and the best remedy was quinine and whiskey, the latter in
								quantities. Fevers, the intermittent kind which attend malaria, were frequent too.
								The people believed many peculiar things about these ailments and the fear of miasma
								and germ-laden atmosphere was wholesome.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">SURVEYS AND INDIAN TREATIES.</hi></head>

							<p>At St. Mary's, Ohio, in 1818, a treaty was negotiated by Governor Jennings, General
								Cass and Judge Benjamin Parke, men who acted as government commissioners, with the
								Indians. The red men gave up all title to their unceded land south of the Wabash
								river, except reservations, which included the territory in central Indiana, out of
								which thirty counties have been laid off, among them Hendricks county. This was the
								largest of the fifty-two purchases which were required to obtain from the Indians
								all of the land in the state of Indiana. In the terms of this treaty it was stated
								that the Indians should have possession of their improvements and reside in the
								country for a period of three years, after which time a portion of them would have
								to go upon reservations, but the majority of them were to be transported beyond the
								great Mississippi river. The government surveys were stipulated to begin
								immediately, and the ceded lands to be opened to settlers. Prior to this time the
								land now forming Hendricks county had been occupied by the tribe of Delaware
								Indians, but, not being located on any of the great war trails or fighting grounds,
								there were no large Indian villages or Indian improvements in this district.
								Hendricks county land was used principally as a hunting ground.</p>

							<p>The government plans were carried out and the survey started at once. Hendricks
								county was on the meridian line from which the beginning was made, and accordingly
								it was surveyed first in 1819. This survey started a great flood of immigration to
								every corner of the new purchase. In wagons, on foot, horseback, the sturdy men came
								to build their homes here. Locations were indefinite and the settlers merely
								contented themselves with finding a convenient spot and then starting a clearing
								wherein to build their log homes. The Indians were not hostile; in fact, they were
								very friendly and assisted the home-seeker in many ways. Their knowledge of the
								hunting and fishing grounds was often a great help to the stranger.</p>

							<p>Although the year specified for the removal of the Indians beyond the Mississippi
								was 1821, it was not until 1826 that the last of them departed. When the first white
								men came to this county a large band of Indians was found camping on White Lick and
								Eel rivers. The former they called <pb id="VAC1000-039" n="42"/> Wape-ke-way,
								meaning "white salt;" and the latter they termed Sho-a-mack, which meant "slippery
								fish."</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">THE FIRST SETTLEMENT.</hi></head>

							<p>In the territory now known and designated as Hendricks county the first settlement
								was made in the spring of the year 1820 on White Lick creek. The band of settlers
								who made this initial location, a few miles south of Plainfield, was composed of
								Bartholomew Ramsey, Samuel Herriman, Harris Bray, John W. Bryant, James Dunn, George
								Dunn and Ezekiel Moore.</p>

							<p>The nearest settlements to this location were along the Wabash river, and in order
								to establish communication and a road for the transportation of supplies, these men
								cut a trail through the woods and bushes, and gave it the name of the Terre Haute
								trail. It passed through Hendricks county about a mile south of what was later the
								National road, and in this same year of 1820 Nathan Kirk, one of the settlers,
								afterwards one of the associate judges of the county, located on this trail in the
								southwest corner of the county and kept a public tavern. He later transported his
								goods to Clinton county and became the founder of the town of Kirklin. Kirk's
								prairie was also named after this man.</p>

							<p>In the spring months of 1821 Thomas Lockhart, Noah Kellum and Felix Belzer made
								settlement on the East fork of White Lick, in the southeast corner of what is now
								Guilford township. Belzer was the most notable of these three men, due to his
								reputation as a hunter. The tradition is that he killed one hundred and twenty-five
								deer within a year after he settled in this county. It was in this year, 1821, that
								the first death occurred in the county, that of Uriah Carson, who had come from Ohio
								and entered land from the government. He died at the home of Felix Belzer. In the
								autumn of 1821 William and Thomas Hinton, James Thompson and Robert McCrackin
								settled on the West fork of White Lick, in the territory now comprising Liberty
								township. Quite a number of other families settled in the territory now comprising
								Guilford and Washington townships in the following year of 1822, among them being
								Jeremiah Hadley, David Carter and Jonathan Hadley, who took the three adjoining
								farms on the hill immediately east of Plainfield.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">SETTLEMENT IN 1824.</hi></head>

							<p>In the year 1824 the population of the county was estimated to be one thousand
								people, settled mostly in the regions in the southeast, with a few settlers near the
								present site of Danville, Nathan Kirk and Jere Stiles in the southwest corner, and
								Noah Bateman and a few others along Eel river. The portion of the county now
								occupied by Union, Middle, Brown and Lincoln townships was then a mosquito-infested
								swamp, and no settler had the boldness to risk his health by settling there. As late
								as 1830 there were not more than thirty settlers within this locality. The more
								rapid and thicker settlement of the other portions of the county was due in a large
								measure to the better drainage facilities. The northeastern portion of the county
								was also settled slowly. The building of the Cumberland or National road through the
								south part of the county in 1830 gave a great advantage to the southern part, this
								road being a highway for the tide of immigration to the far West. Many of these
								transcontinental travelers found reason to stop in this locality and remained and
								became permanent residents. Practically every farmer kept open house; every home was
								a hotel, and many of the settlers became moderately wealthy by their
								hospitality.</p>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">FIRST IMPROVEMENTS.</hi></head>

							<p>The first mill constructed in the county was a horse-mill on East fork of White
								Lick. It was built and owned by James Tomlinson. The first water-mill was built by
								John P. Benson on Rock branch in Eel River township in 1826. The first merchandise
								was sold in Danville by James L. Given. The first resident attorneys were Judge
								Marvin and Colonel Nave, the latter locating in Danville in 1832, where he was
								engaged in the practice of law for more than fifty years, until his death, in 1884.
								In the summer of 1823 the two first school houses were built in the county, one in
								Liberty township, below Cartersburg, and the other on Thomas Lockhart's land in
								Guilford township, and in them W. H. Hinton and Abijah Pierson taught the first
								schools in the county. In this paragraph it is well to mention that the first birth
								in the county was that of Silas J. Bryant, who was born in Guilford township in
								1820, the son of J. W. Bryant.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">SELECTION OF COUNTY SEAT.</hi></head>

							<p>According to the provisions of this act, the men selected began to investigate
								several claims made for the location of the county seat. Many <pb id="VAC1000-043"
									n="46"/> localities were at work striving for the honor, among them the community
								near George Mattock's tavern, two miles east of Belleville, where a town had been
								laid out named Hillsboro. This site was discarded in favor of a location as near as
								possible to the geographical center of the county, and on the second Monday in July,
								1824, the site of Danville was chosen. Four men, Daniel Beals, George Matlock,
								Robert Wilson and James Downard, being the owners of land in four sections having a
								common corner, each donated twenty acres touching the common corner for the benefit
								of the county seat, all of which was laid out into public square and town lots.</p>

							<p>Thomas Hinton was appointed agent of the county, and on October 20, 1824, he placed
								on file a plat of the town of Danville. The lots were immediately put up at a public
								sale, and this continued for three days. An order was made by the commissioners for
								fifteen gallons of whiskey to assist the purchasers in making their selection.
								Samuel Herriman, the coroner, was the distributor on this occasion. The price paid
								for the lots ranged from three to one hundred and fifteen dollars. The latter price
								was given by Mr. Hulse for the lot on the northeast corner of Main and Washington
								streets. The lot on the southwest corner brought the next highest price.</p>

							<p>The court house was completed and the first term of court held in Danville in April
								of the year 1826. The building was constructed of peeled hickory logs and cost one
								hundred and forty-seven dollars. The jail was of the same material.</p>

							<p>The first county commissioners were Thomas Lockhart, Gideon Wilson and Littlebury
								Blakely. They divided the county into nine townships, of nearly equal area, and
								there was sufficient population in but four of the townships at that time to give
								them a civil organization. The first representative of the county in the General
								Assembly was Lewis Mastin.</p>

							<p>In the extreme northeast corner of Hendricks county lies Brown township, comprising
								about twenty-five square miles of land in townships 16 and 17 north, ranges 1 and 2
								east. On the north the township is bounded by Boone county, on the east by Marion
								county, on the south by Lincoln township and on the west by Middle township. White
								Lick creek, passing through the western side of the township, drains the largest
								portion of the land, although Eagle creek carries a large quantity of water from the
								high country along the eastern border. The soil of Brown township is rich and
								productive, the nature of the ground being rolling. The central portion is for the
								most part very level and, before the excellent system of drainage used today, was
								swampy and of little value. The clay and alluvial soil found in Brown township is
								without a superior in the county or middle Indiana and is now worth a high price per
								acre. Practically every acre is under cultivation and made to yield to the utmost of
								its productiveness without impoverishing the soil.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">EARLY SETTLEMENT.</hi></head>

							<p>Until the year 1863 Brown township included what is now Lincoln township. Brown
								township was named after James Brown, who was the first settler within its boundary.
								David Sparks, however, was the first white man in this territory; he came in the
								year 1827, three years before any definite settlement had been made in this portion
								of the county. Owing to the unfortunate location of the township it has no railroad
								or interurban line, but the general fertility of its soil largely makes up for this
								deficiency.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">FIRST ELECTION.</hi></head>

							<p>The first general election in Brown township was in 1828. From the poll book and
								tally sheet the following is taken: "At an Election held at <pb id="VAC1000-045"
									n="48"/> the hous of James Brown on the 4th day of August 1828 for the purpos of
								Electing one Govinor one Lieutenant Govinor one Representator to Congress one
								Sinitor one representative to State Legislater one Coriner the following is a list
								of the number of votes taken and also the number Each Candidate receivs." There were
								twelve voters at this election, namely: James Brown, Joseph Runion, Joshua Newham,
								William Harris, Thomas Nash, Daniel Newham, George Tyler, James R. Smith, Shannon
								Foster, Edward Railsback, Jesse Smith and Nathaniel W. Hults. Politically, the
								township has been strongly Democratic from the beginning.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">BROWN TOWNSHIP IN 1914.</hi></head>

							<p>The statement has been made that Brown township holds a singular place among the
								other townships, by not having the usual transportation facilities and the lack of
								towns. This fact by no means is evidence that the township is behind the others. The
								farmers are intelligent and capable and the farms they manage are modern and well
								kept. The science of agriculture has not been a neglected art in this locality, in
								fact it has been much encouraged, and the tiller of the soil embraces every
								opportunity to improve his knowledge of the best methods of cultivation.</p>

							<p>Roads in this township are excellent, of macadam and gravel and in a high state of
								improvement. This lends quick access to the railroads and other points in the
								county. Telephones, both local and long distance, have enabled the people to come
								into closer communication with their fellows. Schools are now set to a standard of
								high efficiency, the consolidated school system rapidly coming into effect.</p>

							<p>Not only has the farmer paid attention to his farm land, but he has built his
								residence and his buildings in the most up-to-date fashion. All conveniences are
								found in the present farm home the same as in the city. Electric lights, telephones,
								steam heat, water power and sewerage systems are but a few of these.</p>

							<p>In the center of Hendricks county is located the township of Center. It is in
								townships 15 and 16 north, ranges 1 east and 2 west, comprising about forty-six
								square miles. It is bounded on the north by Union and Middle townships, on the east
								by Middle and Washington, on the south by Liberty and Clay, and on the west by Clay,
								Marion and Eel River townships. The west fork of White Lick creek, its tributaries,
								and Mill creek drain the land within the bounds of this township, supplemented today
								by a very efficient system of artificial drainage. With the exception of the deep,
								precipitous valley worn through the center of the township by White Lick, the nature
								of the land is undulating and level. The highest elevation of land in the county is
								in Center township, gradually sloping away to the border. Woodland once covered this
								territory, but it has now been reduced to a minimum. It embraces a body of land
								unexcelled for grazing and of very high rank for fruit and grain production.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">EARLY SETTLEMENT AND ELECTION.</hi></head>

							<p>It is recorded that the earliest settlement was made in Center township in the year
								1823. Very few people ever lived in this portion of the county until after the
								platting of the town of Danville, from which time it began to grow.</p>

							<p>There was a general election held in Center township on August 7, 1826, votes being
								cast for congressman, senator, representative, sheriff and coroner. There were about
								two hundred people in the township at that time and sixty-six persons voted. The
								list of voters was as follows: Francis Barbee, Thomas Hinten, Richard Christie,
								Elijah Thompson, Dickison Thompson, James Thompson, Jeremiah Cutbirth, Thomas
								Nichols, William Moore, George Moore, Thomas Shelton, Jonathan Wyatt, Nathaniel

							<head><hi rend="center sc">CENTER TOWNSHIP TODAY.</hi></head>

							<p>Because of the location of Danville, the county seat, Center township today occupys
								in some respects the foremost place among the twelve townships of the county. In
								richness, in agriculture and kindred vocation, she is not superior to all of the
								townships, but holds a high position and is deserving of much credit. The taxpayers
								are loyal and willing to support any movement for the good of the township and
								consequently civic pride and intelligent interest in the country has gained a
								prominent place. The land surrounding Danville is very good farming ground and a
								visit to the numerous estates will convince the critic that the most modern and
								efficient methods are used by the farmer in the cultivation of his soil. The homes
								dotting the broad farms are attractive and equal to the home of the man with urban
								advantages, something which twenty years ago would have been believed impossible.
								Telephones, excellent roads, railroads and interurban lines, all contribute to the
								easy communication with all parts of the county and the state capital. Distance has
								ceased to be a factor in present-day life. The schools of Center township are of the
								first class, the religious life is pronounced, and behind all there is a spirit of
								goodfellowship, progress and industry which prophesies greater and greater things to
								come.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">DANVILLE.</hi></head>

							<p>In the year 1824 the first dwelling was constructed on the site of Danville by
								Daniel Clark. This structure was a log cabin. Immediately after the location of
								Clark's cabin several other settlers came to the immediate vicinity and made their
								homes. By the following winter there were quite a number <pb id="VAC1000-049" n="51"
								/> of people living in the neighborhood-- in fact, sufficient in number to start a
								school. The first man to teach here was Wesley McKinley. Doctor Garrett was the
								first physician to administer to the ill. A hotel, or rather, a log tavern, was
								opened to the public by Levi Jessup, the first county clerk. He was succeeded in
								this business in 1828 by Col. Thomas Nichols, who came to Danville in that year and
								became sheriff of the county. Nichols also interested himself in building houses. In
								1829, he constructed, at Danville, the first brick school house in Hendricks
								county.</p>

							<p>In another chapter it is stated that the town of Danville was officially laid out
								by Thomas Hinton on October 20, 1824.</p>

							<p>Immediately after this, cabins began to spring up and with the first one erected by
								Clark were many, just as unpretentious, but inviting. James L. Givin set up a small
								store on the north side of the square and there the first merchandise was sold.
								Flour was not among his stock, however, and people were compelled to go to
								Indianapolis after that product. The first court house, constructed of peeled
								hickory logs, cost one hundred and forty-seven dollars. The jail, made of the same
								material, was back of the building recently occupied by the Thompson jewelry store.
								It was considered impregnable, with its thick walls, small, high windows, puncheon
								floors and dungeon The first hotel, then called a tavern, was a large, rambling
								two-story building situated on the lot now occupied by Beck's restaurant. With its
								square and multipaned windows, massive door and large chimney, it was a picturesque
								building. Along the alley was a long, mossy trough, hollowed from a log, from which
								horses were watered from the tavern well. This tavern was a busy place, especially
								when court was in session. Those who attended court had to travel over many miles on
								horseback, through sloughs and forests, over fallen trees, across streams and every
								other obstacle which impeded the journey of the early traveler. Arriving at the
								tavern door, cold, tired and hungry, they found rest and food in plenty. The food
								was not served by courses, or miniature quantities in side dishes, but was literally
								piled upon the table, the chief dish often being a whole roast pig.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">TOWN BEGINNINGS.</hi></head>

							<p>About the time of the incorporation of Danville the young town was becoming a
								centering place for the farmers of the county and was regarded as a particularly
								beautiful place. At that, the appearance of the village was far from what the
								present dweller would call attractive. The street at the northeast corner of the
								square was almost a marsh, although steps had been taken to fill it in. The present
								hollow, a square south of the college, now being filled and a street put through,
								then extended westward to the McCurdy block and on Tennessee street there was a
								bridge across it. At the west end of the hollow was a spring of pure water, as there
								was also in the court house yard. When an election was held in the town some of the
								voters would get thirsty and depart for the spring in the hollow to get a drink.
								However, their source of supply was a keg hidden in the bushes alongside the
								spring.</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-051" n="53"/>

							<p>The main business portion of the town was on the north side of the square. The
								first brick business room was constructed by Colonel Nave in 1832. It was a square
								law office, almost comparable in size to a piano box, but was considered elegant
								then. The second brick building was located on the spot now occupied by Darnell's
								"Yaller Front." Before it was erected the first postoffice stood there. The
								postmaster, who was a saddler, plied his trade in the front room. All the stores at
								this time were general stores, that is, they kept every article of merchandise
								desired by the settler from dry goods and groceries to plows.</p>

							<p>This, in a measure, supplies the reader with a picture of the early Danville. The
								town has never grown to city proportions, but the improvement since those early
								times have been timely, and as thorough as if the town had enlarged to ten thousand
								population.</p>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">NAMING OF COUNTY SEAT.</hi></head>

							<p>The man directly responsible for the naming of the county seat of Hendricks county
								was Judge William Watson Wick, one of the pioneer jurists of Indiana. He was judge
								of the fifth circuit, composed of Lawrence, Monroe, Morgan, Greene, Owen, Marion,
								Hendricks, Rush, Decatur, Bartholomew, Shelby, Jennings and Johnson counties. Judge
								Wick was holding court in Hendricks county when the commissioners were discussing
								what to name the county seat. The Judge had a brother named Dan and in honor of him
								he urged the commissioners to adopt the name Danville, which was done.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">AN OLD RESIDENT'S IDEA OF EARLY DANVILLE.</hi></head>

							<p>From the manuscript of H. Henry, one of the first men in Danville, the following is
								taken:</p>

							<p>"I came to Danville in August, 1858. That year was, in the language of the farmers,
								a wet year. The train upon which we came waded through what Major Verbrike would
								have called 'a wilderness of mud and water' and it made the trip from Cincinnati to
								Cartersburg in eight hours, which was considered fast time in those days. Coming up
								to town from Cartersburg in Keeney's hack, I had for fellow passengers Professor
								Tarr and Clint Petty. The Professor was on his first trip to town to make
								arrangements to organize the Danville Academy. He was dressed as a minister and was
								full of missionary zeal. I was loaded for Indians and wild game, and carried a
								double-barreled shot-gun. Petty was armed with a stone pipe, loaded with <pb
									id="VAC1000-052" n="54"/> long-range tobacco, and, being on his own native soil,
								he 'got the drop' on the bear hunter and the missionary at once. The Professor
								looked at my gun and turned up his nose at Petty's pipe, which had made him
								sea-sick, while he said, 'Please, sir, do not smoke the pipe in this hack.' Petty
								answered, 'Stranger, I will compromise with you. I will hold my head outside of the
								window.' The Professor looked at me and my gun as if he wished to shoot the pipe,
								but I never said a word. I became a silent partner in the compromise with the ways
								of the wild and woolly west.</p>

							<p>"On our arrival in town we were met by the immortal Boone O'Haver, who was the
								self-appointed keeper of the gates of the city. Boone directed Professor Tarr to the
								home of a good Methodist brother. Then he took my gun in his hands and escorted me
								and the oil-cloth carpet sack over to Henry Howell's grocery on the east side of the
								square, where he introduced me to the 'boys.' Boone gave me a hearty reception. He
								went in the grocery and brought out a mammoth watermelon and cut it and made the
								usual mistake of quoting Scripture and crediting it to Shakespeare, by saying to the
								crowd: 'Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and I will give you
								rest.'</p>

							<p>"The first thing I remember concerning politics after coming to Danville was a
								joint discussion between Martin M. Ray and Albert G. Porter. The slavery question
								was, of course, the bone of contention. The orators talked much about 'border
								ruffians' and 'bleeding Kansas' and had much to say about 'squatter sovereignty.'
								After the speaking, a tramp shoemaker named Cary Maul, who had gathered the
								impression that 'squatter sovereignty' was an individual, a bully who had set down
								on all the government lands in the West and had caused all the political troubles,
								declared that he would go to Kansas and 'put a hole through Old Squatter
								Sovereignty.' He added that if Nebraska Bill did not look out he would get shot,
								too.</p>

							<p>"James Peters, a journeyman musical instrument maker, who made dulcimers for Vinson
								Hamblin in Samuel Hawkins' chair shop, was a genius that only a Charles Dickens
								could describe properly. He resembled Julius Caesar. He was a college graduate and
								had, before coming to Danville, been a clerk of a court in Ohio. Peters had met a
								disappointment in love and had made an unsuccessful effort to drown his sorrows in
								opium and liquor. One day, while under the influence of liquor, he threw a bucket
								and a bundle of ax-handles through the show-window of a drug store and would have
								painted the town red if it had not been for the officers of the law. When the
								marshal and his deputies arrived at Squire Singer's office with Peters there was a
								large crowd there to see the fun. The Squire was scared and his hand <pb
									id="VAC1000-053" n="55"/> trembled so that he was unable to write. Peters stood
								before the court with the skirt of his blue cloth coat, which the officers had torn
								while making the arrest, dragging on the floor. He said in a voice which would have
								done credit to Edwin Forrest, addressing the crowd, 'We did not come here to praise
								Caesar, but to bury him.' Then he walked around the railing and took the pen out of
								the trembling hand of the justice and made the necessary entries on the docket,
								instructed the prosecutor as to his duties, worked in the capacity of attorney for
								both sides of the case and so expedited the business of the court that the trial
								lasted only a few minutes. He paid his fine and went to Armstrong's tailoring shop
								for repairs. Peters and Judge Marvin used to discuss for hours the subject of
								astronomy. They had, according to Welshans, completely covered the walls and floor
								of the room with diagrams of the heavens and the earth, drawn in chalk. Peters had
								taken the contrary side in the argument in order to draw the Judge out. The debate
								closed by the Judge calling Peters a blank fool. Peters was living in Springfield,
								Illinois, when Lincoln was nominated and he wrote to Alf. Welshans a nice letter
								describing the jollification held at Lincoln's home.</p>

							<p>"Warner Vestal, editor of the <hi rend="i">Hendricks County Ledger</hi>, requested
								Peters to read the proof of a long article he had written for that paper. Peters
								took the proof slips to his room and in about two hours he came back with the slips
								together with an exhaustive criticism on the article longer than the original.
								Vestal said, 'I can not make the corrections on your article in time to go to
								press.' Peters said, 'My article? I have written nothing that needs correcting.'
								'You wrote the whole business,' said the editor. Peters had written the first
								article when intoxicated and did not remember it. He was at himself when he read the
								proof. The article was put on the dead galley rack, but the proof slips and the
								criticisms were kept as object lessons by the editor and printers for many a day.
								Peters met his fate in Libby prison near the close of the war.</p>

							<p>"Thomas N. Jones was a many-sided character and a good citizen. He was fond of all
								kinds of innocent amusements and at almost every entertainment he was a star
								performer, always appearing in a comedy of blunders. Whether it was the mind-reading
								phrenologist or the gag of the circus clown or the mystifying ventriloquist or the
								simple twist of the wrist of the street fakir, Tom always took the cake as the
								victim of every trick and joke. During the years that the 'Sons of Temperance' wave
								swept over the country, that society held a temperance celebration at Indianapolis.
								On the day of the grand parade, Tom was in command of the Hendricks county division.
								The weather was very hot, the people in the parade were very thirsty and a <pb
									id="VAC1000-054" n="56"/> committee was supplying drinking water, which they
								carried in buckets. Tom's division had been served with a drink, but it did not
								satisfy Tom and he arose in his regalia and 'fuss and feathers' to the attitude of a
								magazine picture of 'Washington crossing the Delaware,' and yelled at the top of his
								voice, 'More water for the Danville delegation.' The grotesqueness of the
								commander's efforts to get drinks for the banner temperance delegation was too much
								for the spectators and they responded with laughter and applause. And Tom's words
								were passed along the line and were the toast of the day to which tin cups rattled
								and beer glasses clinked. To the day of Jones' death, he never heard the last of
								'More water for the Danville delegation.'</p>

							<p>"One day at a circus he assisted Richard Hemming, the celebrated rope-walker, in a
								tight rope act. Hemming carried Mr. Jones under the rope by straps looped to his
								feet. When the walker arrived over the dustiest spot in the ring he let Mr. Jones
								fall in the dirt to the infinite delight of the audience, who greeted him with the
								usual encore. To this day tight rope and Tom Jones are twin geraniums. The secret
								order known as the Sons of Malta did not have a lodge in Danville, but Jones never
								missed anything. He went to Indianapolis and joined and very nearly met his death
								during his initiation into the order. The practical jokers worked him up to a fever
								heat until he almost sweat blood, then let him fall from a great height into a tank
								of ice water. He admitted that this experience took the conceit out of him, but
								don't you believe it."</p>

								Curtis, W. L. Holman, Simon Hadley, trustees; Charles T. Clark, clerk; James V.
								Cook, treasurer; Thomas R. Harney, engineer; John Hume and C. W. Gaston, attorneys,
								and W. T. Lawson, health officer.</p>

							<p>In eleven blocks in Danville the streets are paved with brick and there is in
								addition twelve miles of macadam streets and many miles of cement sidewalks.</p>

							<p>An extensive sewerage system is now being placed in Danville, the cost of which is
								to be close to twenty thousand dollars. A septic tank for the purification of the
								sewage is constructed east of town.</p>

							<p>The Danville water works, a municipal plant, supplies the town with pure water from
								artesian wells.</p>

							<p>The water used in Danville is without a superior in the United States. It comes
								from flowing wells and is almost entirely pure. It is also of high <pb
									id="VAC1000-055" n="57"/> medicinal value. The formal analysis follows: Solids,
								33.9; chlorein, faint trace; ammonia, none; nitrates, nitrites, none; total
								hardness, 8.65. It is medicinal in quality. Not a case of typhoid fever has been
								contracted in the town since this water has been used.</p>

							<p>The Danville Light, Heat and Power Company, a corporation owned by Indianapolis
								capital, is the largest of its kind in the county and one of the largest in the
								state. It is considered a model plant. It is worth about one hundred thousand
								dollars. This company supplies power not only for Danville, but also for Plainfield,
								Clayton, Pittsboro and Brownsburg, also many farm houses. It is the ambition of this
								concern to supply the power for every factory in Hendricks county. The power house
								is fitted with all the modern machinery to be found in plants of its kind. The town
								of Danville is considering a new system of street lighting, to replace the old style
								now in use.</p>

								numerous committees, among which are the executive committee of seven members,
								boosting committee of ten members, an advertising committee of five members, and
								from time to time special committees are appointed to carry out worthy projects.</p>

							<p>Early in its career the club organized a boys' band, which has continued to be a
								success to the present time. The club has, among its many aims, the following: to
								secure more factories, better mail and transportation facilities, to decrease danger
								at car crossings by reducing speed limit and to urge the installation of proper
								signals, to 'create a suburban residence city, to keep the town clean and the
								atmosphere pure, to create better business conditions by securing better markets for

							<head><hi rend="center sc">SOCIAL CLUBS.</hi></head>

							<p>In harmony with the cultured life of Danville, there are several social clubs,
								which, in themselves, form an important part of the town. Charity, high moral
								standards, patriotism, civic honor, education, purity of life, honorable ambition,
								are sentiments that mark the right growth of a city and these sentiments have been
								promoted by the noble women of Danville, individually and in club life and organized
								concert of action. All these clubs do their <pb id="VAC1000-056" n="58"/> part to
								lighten burdens, .to broaden education, and to promote the graces of true

							<p>In February, 1902, the president of the Commercial Club, Mord Carter, wrote a
								letter to Andrew Carnegie, explaining the needs of the town for funds to build a
								library building, which resulted in an offer from Mr. Carnegie to donate ten
								thousand dollars for the erection of the building, provided that the town would make
								a levy that would raise on thousand dollars per year and provide a suitable site for
								the building. The Commercial Club, ladies' clubs, college faculty, town trustees,
								school board and citizens came forward with aid and a literary board was organized
								under the acts of 1901. A lot was purchased by popular subscription and the plans
								submitted by S. C. Dark, of Indianapolis, Indiana, were accepted. A contract was let
								to W. C. Halstead &amp; Company of Franklin, Indiana, for the erection of the
								building. The township afterward came in under the provisions of the law and made a
								levy of one-tenth of a mill on each dollar and the town a levy of one cent on the
								dollar, the two levies raising about one thousand five hundred dollars annually for
								the support and building up of the library.</p>

							<p>The building was dedicated on September 5, 1903. The ladies' clubs raised about
								three hundred dollars for books and many other volumes were donated, making in all
								about one thousand volumes. The number of volumes in the library in May, 1914, is
								about five thousand. Most of the leading magazines of the country are taken. There
								are enrolled upon the books of the library at this latter date nineteen hundred and
								sixty readers. The present board consists of the following: Dr. Joel T. Barker,
								Henry C. Hadley, Mrs. Mattie A. Keeney, Mrs. Josephine K. Thomas, Mrs. J. D. Hogate,

								enacted a few months before and entitled an "Act to provide a national currency
								secured by a pledge of United States stocks, and to provide for the circulation and

								and was the one hundred and fifty-second chartered bank in the United States. The
								bank opened its doors in a building a few doors south of its present site. At a

							<head><hi rend="center sc">PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF DANVILLE.</hi></head>

							<p>The Danville public schools graduated the first class in the year 1880. This class
								consisted of but one member, Belle Kennedy. Since that time there have been nearly
								three hundred and fifty graduated. The largest class was graduated in 1910,
								consisting of twenty-three members. Many of the graduates have continued their
								studies in higher institutions of learning, but a majority have entered upon their
								life work without any other training than that given in the high school. The people
								of Danville have spared no expense in giving the young people of the community the
								advantages enjoyed by the most favored in the state.</p>

							<p>The first brick school house in the county was built at Danville in 1829. The
								second free school, as it was called, was a two-story frame, situated on the lot
								across the street south from the old college building. This burned in the fall of
								1872. The following year another school building was constructed, but in 1878 fire
								destroyed it to such an extent that it had to be nearly entirely rebuilt. The
								present high school building was completed in 1900.</p>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center">COURT HOUSE HISTORY.</hi></head>

							<p>The first court house in Danville was constructed of peeled hickory logs and the
								jail, back of the present location of Thompson's jewelry store, was of the same
								material. In the year 1830 a second court house was built and was a square, brick
								building. The third court house was completed in the year 1862 and cost sixty
								thousand dollars. The building was considered a substantial one and of elegant
								architecture for the time. The first floor was taken up mainly by the county offices
								and on the second floor was the court room, considered one of the best in the state.
								The building was surmounted by two towers, upon one of which was an observatory.
								This court house performed good service for many years or until eight-thirty o'clock
								on the night of January 9, 1912, when the whole roof collapsed, completely wrecking
								the upper floor of the building. Fortunately, it was an hour when the place was <pb
									id="VAC1000-061" n="62"/> deserted or there would have been fatalities. Court had
								been held that very day; also for many weeks noises of cracking had been heard, but
								unheeded.</p>

							<p>The county council held a meeting on Monday, January 22, 1912, for the purpose of
								discussing the building of a new court house. There was no definite action taken,
								due to two factions in the council and much difference of opinion. On February 3d,
								however, they met again and appropriated two hundred and twenty-five thousand
								dollars for the erection of a new court house. Bonds were ordered issued. The work
								of advertising for bids, etc., went on and the contract was awarded. Clarence
								Martindale is the architect of the new court house structure. The first thing done
								was the razing of the ruins of the old court house. This was done, most of the
								bricks being deposited in the fill at the east end of Marion street. The corner
								stone for the new court house was laid on May 29, 1913, with fitting ceremonies.</p>

							<p>The new court house, now well along in the process of construction, is to be one of
								the most efficient and beautiful in the state of Indiana. The house is constructed
								of Bedford oolitic stone and the best steel. The inside wainscoting and corridor
								floors are to be of marble. The court room is to have monolithic floors, art glass
								sky-light and ornamental plaster ceiling. The dimensions of the court house are one
								hundred and eleven by one hundred and forty-two by one hundred and thirteen feet and
								forty-eight feet in height. The two court rooms, the grand jury room and the county
								surveyor's office are on the third floor, the principal county offices are on the
								second floor, and on the first floor are the minor offices, the county
								superintendent's office, rest rooms, Grand Army of the Republic room. The building
								is to be heated by steam and lighted by electricity. A modern ventilating system is
								installed and a vacuum cleaning apparatus. An electric elevator will run the entire
								height of the building. This building has a copper roof and is considered absolutely
								fire-proof. The architecture is of the Renaissance style mainly, with features of
								other architectural designs. The natural lighting of the building is an important
								asset. P. H. McCormack Company, of Columbus, Indiana, are the contractors.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">THE JAIL.</hi></head>

							<p>The present jail building in Danville was erected in the year 1869. In January,
								1865, the county board of commissioners ordered the sheriff "to sell at public
								outcry to the highest bidder the old county jail, reserving all the iron and stone
								in said building to the county, also to sell the old fence around said house." This
								was done and it was ordered that Martin Gregg <pb id="VAC1000-062" n="63"/> be
								appointed to examine jails in other counties and employ an architect to give a draft
								and estimated cost of such a building and report on the same. Pending the erection
								of the new jail the jury room in the north side of the old court house served the
								purpose of a bastile. The cost of the jail was approximately thirty thousand
								dollars. In 1914 a new heating plant is being installed.</p>

							<p>The land surface of Clay township is in most respects similar to the rest of the
								county. The township is one of the smaller ones and is drained by the three forks of
								Mill creek. The land is practically level, with slight valleys made by the streams,
								and the drainage, now aided by artificial means, is adequate. The quality of the
								land in this township is good. The farmers have managed, by skillful cultivation and
								intelligent study, to derive large profits from the soil and are to be commended,
								especially for this work and progress. The St. Louis division of the Big Four
								railroad, the Vandalia, and the Terre Haute, Indianapolis &amp; Eastern interurban
								line traverse the township and, supplemented with an excellent system of gravel and
								macadam roads, make the township strictly a modern one and a pleasurable location in
								which to live.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">ORGANIZATION.</hi></head>

							<p>The township was formed by separating from the north end of Franklin township three
								tiers of sections of land and taking three sections off the southeast corner of
								Marion township, thereby giving Clay township an area of twenty-four square miles.
								This organization was executed by the board of county commissioners in the year
								1845.</p>

							<p>The poll book of the first election, held at Springfield, in Clay township, August
								3, 1846, gives the names of one hundred and one voters. They were Peter Long, Wesley

							<p>The village of Pecksburg was named in honor of the first president of the Vandalia

								The plat of Pecksburg was officially recorded on May 24, 1853. Some of the earliest
								settlers in the neighborhood of Pecksburg were David Wreitzel, John Sheerer and
								Daniel Wreitzel. They settled two miles south of the present village in a very early
								day and constructed a log church of the Lutheran denomination. This afterwards was
								abandoned and a frame built in Pecksburg, which still stands, about sixty years old.
								It is not used at present, however. Abraham West had a grist mill near here in the
								early days, but sold out to John Sheerer. When the Vandalia was built, through the

							<p>Two miles west of Pecksburg, on sections 2, 3, 34 and 35, is the town of Amo, one
								of the voting places of the township. This village was laid out in 1850 by Joseph
								Morris and was originally Morristown. The first house in this village was

							<p>The business houses and residences of the town of Coatesville are attractive and
								orderly, in fact, to the visitor the town presents an aspect of civic pride and a

							<p>Eel River township is in the extreme northwest corner of Hendricks county. It is
								bounded on the north by Boone county, on the east by Union and Center townships, on
								the south by Marion township, on the west by Putnam and Montgomery counties. The
								natural drainage of the most of this township is excellent; the east and west sides
								are rather flat and not adequately drained by the streams, although the farmers have
								at this time provided artificial means which remedy this deficiency. In the
								southwest corner of this township are found many high elevations, some of the hills
								below the juncture of Rock Branch and Eel River rising one hundred feet above the
								bed of the stream and now covered with a luxuriant second growth of timber. Five
								good-sized streams enter the township near the southwest corner, merging into Eel
								river. The picturesqueness of these stream valleys, the rich, wooded banks rising
								from them and the well-arranged farm lands lying behind, supplies beauty of
								landscape unequaled in the county. It is the garden sport of Hendricks. The land in
								this locality is uniformly good and is well adapted to any kind of cultivation.</p>

							<p>The Ben-Hur division of the Terre Haute, Indianapolis &amp; Eastern line crosses
								the northeast corner of this township.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">EARLY SETTLEMENT.</hi></head>

							<p>In the spring of 1824 the first white settlers came to Eel River township. They
								were Noah Bateman and Reuben Claypool and they located a mile south of North Salem.
								They were followed in the fall of that year by John Claypool and John S. Woodward.
								Among the others who located in this township, previous to 1830, were James Trotter,
								Henry Bales, J. and Martha Page, John P. Benson, Robert Covey, Enoch Davis and his
								sons, William, Frank and Jesse, William Dewitt, Dr. Collins, Andrew Clifton, <pb
									id="VAC1000-070" n="70"/> James Campbell, Mr. Crum and the Penningtons. John
								Benson built the first mill in the county on Rock Branch in the year 1826. This
								structure lasted but a few years when Mr. Crum built a mill on Eel River, not far
								from the site of the former mill. About the year 1830 a distillery was started near
								Crum's mill. This was the first in the county.</p>

							<p>The date of the organization was somewhere near the year 1828, four years after the
								organization of the county.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">THE BOULDER CLUB.</hi></head>

							<p>The citizens of Eel River, at an early date, passed what was known as a "stay law,"
								in defense of their property, which was often taken and sold by the constable.
								Whenever the constable advertised any property for sale the club would meet on the
								night before and carry a number of boulders which they piled on the ground as a
								notice to the constable not to offer the property for sale.</p>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">THE TOWNSHIP TODAY.</hi></head>

							<p>To describe Eel River township of today the same words used in the account of the
								other civil divisions might be used. The township has no large settlements, but has
								developed in agricultural lines during the past score of years until now it occupies
								a marked position in the county. The Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton railroad
								traverses the township, east and west, near the center and the Peoria division of
								the Big Four and the Ben-Hur interurban line cross near the north part of the
								township, providing direct intercourse with the chief markets of the state. The
								schools have grown and become modern in every respect, following the new thought of
								consolidation. The people of the township have directed a large part of their
								efforts to the betterment of the roads. The old dirt road, with its sloughs and
								dangerous <pb id="VAC1000-071" n="71"/> holes, has been replaced by excellent gravel
								and macadam highways. The farms are cultivated according to the latest practices
								employed over the country and along with care for proper cultivation has become a
								pride in the appearance of the field, the equipment and the residence. Many a farm
								home viewed by the traveler in Eel River township is impressive and suitable for the
								largest cities.</p>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">NORTH SALEM.</hi></head>

							<p>North Salem is the only village in Eel River township. It was laid out in 1835 by
								John and David Claypool and John S. Woodward. The town has always been a prosperous
								one, even from the beginning, a new life having been given by the building of the
								railroad, now the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton railroad. The United States
								census report for 1910 gives the population of North Salem as five hundred and
								sixty-nine, which number had grown proportionately larger in the past five
								years.</p>

							<p>The place was incorporated as a town in May, 1899, and town officers elected. The
								offices in 1914 are filled as follows: Trustees, J. H. Page, Harry Seaton and Harry
								Dean; clerk, Smith Davis; marshal, Virgil Robbins. About ten years ago the town
								installed an acetylene plant, for residence and street lighting. This public utility
								was recently improved and enlarged and is now worth four thousand dollars.</p>

							<p>The North Salem Bank was organized in 1891 by Pritchard &amp; Son, of Illinois, and
								in 1893 the business was purchased by the present owners and has since been
								controlled by home people. C. W. Davis is president of the bank, G. B. Davis,
								cashier, and J. B. Fleece, assistant cashier. The average deposits amount to one
								hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</p>

							<p>North Salem Lodge No. 142, Free and Accepted Masons, was chartered on May 25, 1853,
								and was the first secret order in the town. This lodge is in good condition now and
								has a membership of ninety.</p>

							<p>In the extreme southwest corner of the county is located Franklin township,
								containing parts of township 14 north, ranges 1 and 2 west. It is bounded on the
								north by Clay township, on the east by Liberty, on the south by Morgan and Putnam
								counties, and on the west by Putnam county. The soil level is comparatively flat in
								the northwestern and southeastern portions but in the central part it assumes a
								rolling character. Mill creek and its tributaries drain the township in the central
								and west and Mud creek drains the southeastern part. These streams are small but of
								great value to the land. For cultivation the soil of Franklin township is
								unsurpassed in Hendricks county, especially for corn. It has a rich, alluvial
								quality, free from sand and alkali, and is of high productiveness.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">EARLY SETTLEMENT AND EVENTS.</hi></head>

							<p>Judge Nathan Kirk was the first settler in the township of Franklin. In 1820 he
								located on Mill creek, where it was crossed by the old Terre Haute trail, and in
								this place he kept a sort of tavern, a resting place for the weary traveler.
								Jeremiah Stiles, the founder of Stilesville, was the next settler of whom there is
								any account. He came in 1823. He was followed shortly by the following: John Swart,
								John and Isaac Wilcox, John Eslinger, David Orsborn and Jacob Reese.</p>

							<p>The date of the organization of the township is in doubt, but it is certain that it
								was very shortly after the organization of the county. Jere Stiles was the first
								justice of the peace. Samuel Wicks was the first merchant in the township, in
								Stilesville, which had been laid off in 1830, and Doctor Mahan was the first
								physician.</p>
						</div4>

						<pb id="VAC1000-073" n="73"/>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">FIRST ELECTION.</hi></head>

							<p>At Stilesville, on August 1, 1831, was held the first general election of the
								township. Forty voters were registered on the poll books. Their names follow:
								William Shipley, Jonathan Sparks, Joseph Petty, Jacob Reese, Jeremiah Stiles, James
								Kelly, John Brown, George H. Keller, George Morris, George Hancock, Henry Reese,
								William Thomas, Peter Pearson, Thomas Wood, Edward Shipley, Samuel Wick, Daniel
								Austin, Lorenzo D. Cleghorn, James Walls, Isaac Odle, William Scott, Charles Smith,
								Silas Rustin, William Wilcox, Absalom Snoddy, Samuel Gerber, Monroe Cleghorn, Joseph
								Cleghorn, William Snoddy, James Pritchett, Eli Lee, Frederick Cosner, William
								Becknell, Joshua Rustin, James Bray, James Wiece, John Hancock, Silas Bryant,
								Nicholas Osborn and Garry Morris.</p>

							<p>The vote at this election was counted by James Walls and Silas Bryant, as judges,
								with Thomas Wood and John Hancock as clerks, and Jeremiah Stiles as inspector.</p>

							<p>Until the election of 1856 Franklin township was very strongly Whig in sentiment,
								then became Republican. The Democrats have recently become the strongest party in
								the township.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">THE TOWNSHIP IN 1914.</hi></head>

							<p>To give a proper description of the present Franklin township would require much
								more space than is available here. In a word, the township has become one of the
								best in the county and her institutions, schools, churches, commercial activities,
								etc., have grown rapidly in the past twenty years or so. Railroad facilities are
								poor in this township and the chief town, Stilesville, is entirely removed from the
								steel lines of transit. Nothwithstanding this deficiency, the excellent roads and
								the automobile have enabled the farmer and business man to maintain adequate
								communication with the rest of the county. And, too, the telephone, both local and
								long distance, have been a great factor in the growth of Franklin township.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">STILESVILLE.</hi></head>

							<p>Stilesville was laid off as a village in 1828 and a small settlement started. The
								opening of the national road through this county, in 1830, passing directly through
								Stilesville, made the town of some importance in the early day, but now the place
								has been forced to the rear by the absence of either <pb id="VAC1000-074" n="74"/>
								railroad or interurban line. Passengers are transferred to Amo, four miles
								northeast, in order to reach the steel lines.</p>

							<p>At first, Stilesville was a stopping place for emigrants bound for the West and it
								became quite popular. The town has since kept pace with modern progress and now
								presents a neat and attractive appearance. It is not an incorporated town. Among the
								new features of the town is the new high school building, constructed in 1912 at a
								cost of twenty thousand dollars. Good accommodations may be secured in Stilesville;
								in fact, in most respects it has overcome the handicap of being without railroad
								facilities.</p>

							<p>The Citizens State Bank was organized in the year 1913 by a stock company. It
								succeeded the bank owned by E. R. Robards. The first officers were John E. Hicks,
								president; B. W. Anderson, vice-president; Chester G. Pike, cashier. These officers
								are the same now, except the office of vice-president, which is filled by Charles W.
								Robards. The bank was chartered May 27, 1913. The capital stock is $25,000; the
								deposits, $65,000 and surplus,. $2,200.</p>

							<p>Larabee Lodge No. 131, Free and Accepted Masons, was organized at Stilesville in
								May, 1852. This lodge is still in existence and has good support, having sixty-five
								members.</p>

							<p>Stilesville Lodge No. 538, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, was organized fifteen
								years ago, and now has one hundred and twenty-five members.</p>

							<p>Enoch Alexander Post No. 265, Grand Army of the Republic, at Stilesville, was
								mustered in the fall of 1833 with thirteen charter members. This post is not active

							<p>Guilford township is situated in the southeast corner of Hendricks county; is
								bounded on the north by Washington township, on the east by Marion county, on the
								south by Morgan county and on the west by Liberty township. White Lick creek flows
								through the central portion, the East fork thereof and Clark's creek through the
								east side, and the West fork of White Lick, with a small tributary, across the west
								side. This network of streams supplies perhaps the best natural drainage system of
								any township in the county. The water adds greatly to the value of the land also;
								the uplands are rolling and the stream valleys are fertile and of high productive
								quality. Walnut, poplar and maple timber was at one time thick over this township,
								but this has been reduced by the encroachments of agriculture to a very small per
								cent. of the original.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">SETTLEMENT.</hi></head>

							<p>Guilford township was the first in the county to be entered by white settlers. This
								was in the year 1820. In that year Samuel Herriman, James Dunn, Bat Ramsey, Harris
								Bay, John W. Bryant and George Moore settled on White Lick, south of Plainfield.
								near the Morgan county line. Here they set up their cabins, cleared ground and
								raised a few small crops of corn and potatoes. In the spring of 1821 Noah Kellum,
								Thomas Lockhart, Mr. Plummer and Felix Balzer settled on the East fork, and Matthew
								Lowder, Jesse Hockett and Robert Tomlinson on White Lick, south of Plainfield. In
								the spring of 1822 Jeremiah Hadley, Jonathan Hadley and David Carter settled on
								adjoining lands on the hills immediately east of the present town of Plainfield and
								were the first to locate in that neighborhood. In the same year James Downard
								settled on the state farm. In 1824 Guilford township contained more people than all
								the other townships combined. The Friends were the majority of the early settlers
								and to this day this religious <pb id="VAC1000-076" n="76"/> denomination is strong
								in the township. The civil division was named in honor of Guilford county, North
								Carolina, by Samuel Jessup, due to the fact, doubtless, that a large number of the
								emigrants came from that place.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">FIRST ELECTIONS.</hi></head>

							<p>Samuel Jessup was the first justice of the peace in Guilford township and in
								Hendricks county. He was elected in the autumn of 1822, under the jurisdiction of
								Morgan county, to which Hendricks county was attached for two years for judicial
								purposes before its organization. Mr. Jessup was elected by the first political
								campaign in the county. John and Samuel Jessup, on East fork, were also candidates,
								and Gideon Wilson, near Shiloh. There were fifteen voters below and eight in
								Wilson's vicinity. A caucus was held in the Fairfield neighborhood, and it was found
								that there would be no election if all the candidates remained in the field, and as
								Samuel had the most votes it was decided that John should withdraw from the race,
								which he did, and Samuel was chosen.</p>

							<p>The poll book of the first general election held in Guilford township, on August 7,
								1826, at the house of John Jessup, gives a list of forty-two voters, which is
								manifestly incomplete, namely: Timothy Jessup, Thomas Lockhart, James McClure, John
								White, Noah Kellum, Isaac Sanders, Harmon Hiatt, Adin Ballard, Benjamin Sanders,
								Henry Bland, Robert Tomlinson, Joseph Chandler, John Hiatt, Elihu Jackson, Joseph
								Ballard, Charles Reynolds, Pratt W. Jessup, Joseph Jessup, Joel Jessup, John
								Hawkins, Lee Jessup, Abijah Pinson, John Jessup, Joseph P. Jessup, Levi Cook, Henry
								Reynolds, Timothy H. Jessup, James C. Tomlinson, Joseph Cloud, John Lemon, John
								Carson, . David Stutesman, James Ritter, William Merritt, Solomon Edmundson, John
								Ballard, David Ballard, Robert Lemon, Joseph Hiatt, Jesse Kellum, Thomas R. Ballard
								and John Harris. Guilford township has always been Republican in politics, following
								from the support of the Whig party.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">GUILFORD IN 1914.</hi></head>

							<p>Because of the location of Plainfield, the second town in the county, Guilford
								township is perhaps next to the leading, if not the leading, civil division in the
								county. It has the advantage in not only having a good population, but in having
								exceptional land, rich and fertile, and capable of producing record crops. The
								farmers are of the best class in the state and are all in a prosperous condition.
								The appearance of the farms, the buildings <pb id="VAC1000-077" n="77"/> and the
								residences is the strongest testimony to this fact. Much attention has been given to
								the roads of the township. Gravel highways, and many macadamized, form a network
								over the division. Two railroads and two interurban lines cross the county, all
								going into Indianapolis.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">PLAINFIELD PUBLIC LIBRARY.</hi></head>

							<p>The Plainfield library is a partial realization of the dreams and desires oaf some
								of the women of Plainfield. Feeling the need of such an institution in the town and
								believing an honest effort to establish such a means of directing and cultivating
								the literary tastes of the young and satisfying the demands of the old would be
								rewarded by success, the Woman's Reading Club asked the local Woman's Christian
								Temperance Union and the Friday Club to enter into an association for the above
								purpose. A corporation was formed and a board of trustees appointed. With these
								organizations as charter members, the association membership was increased by adding
								the name of any person in the township who gave a dollar or more in money or books.
								Donations in both were solicited, with the result that in a short time the library
								opened with about four hundred volumes and money to buy more.</p>

							<p>The opening took place in June, 1901, and work began in a front room of a private
								residence on Main street, with Mrs. Edward Lawrence as librarian. She served until
								the fall of 1903, when failing health compelled her to resign, and she was succeeded
								by Miss Melissa Carter.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center">THE INDIANA BOYS' SCHOOL.</hi></head>

							<p>Just a mile from Plainfield is located the Indiana Boys' School. It is a beautiful
								place, well kept, and an admirable home for the class of boys sent within its
								grounds. This school was established by the Legislature of Indiana in 1867, under
								the name of "The House of Refuge for Juvenile Offenders." In 1883 this name was
								changed to "The Indiana Reform School for Boys," and in 1903 to the present title,
								"The Indiana Boys' School." The institution is governed by a bi-partisan board of
								control of four members appointed by the governor for a term of four years. The
								present board is: Harry T. Schloss, president; Joseph B. Homan, of Danville,
								vice-president; Guy H. Humphreys, treasurer, and George Webster, Jr., secretary. Guy
								C. Hanna is superintendent of the institution.</p>

							<p>Boys are received on commitments from the courts of the state between <pb
									id="VAC1000-080" n="80"/> the ages of eight and seventeen. On a general charge of
								incorrigibility or delinquency, boys are received between ten and seventeen and on a
								criminal charge between eight and sixteen. All boys are retained here until they
								reach the age of twenty-one years, unless sooner released by the board of control
								under general rules. At present these rules are such that with good conduct a boy
								may gain his release on parole in eighteen months. The average time is a little
								under two years. Boys may be returned to the institution at any time for the
								violation of their parole while under twenty-one years of age. A statute proposed by
								the executive officers of the institution was enacted by the Legislature of 1913,
								giving the board of control the right to finally discharge any boy over the age of
								eighteen years. Under this law six hundred and one boys already on parole have been
								discharged.</p>

							<p>The present number of inmates, which has remained nearly stationary for the past
								year, is about five hundred and sixty. One hundred of these are colored boys. The
								institution had, four years ago, six hundred and ninety-nine boys. The falling off
								has been due to the overcrowded condition of the school and the pressure exerted on
								the courts to hold boys out as long as possible.</p>

							<p>The ordinary capacity of the institution is four hundred and twenty-six. A new
								building for housing purposes, Washington Barracks, is now under construction and
								will accommodate eighty boys. It will replace an old building. A new school house is
								being constructed also, named Charlton school, in honor of Major T. J. Charlton,
								superintendent of the school for twenty-one years. The institution is supported
								entirely by direct appropriation from the Legislature. In 1910 the total maintenance
								co:t was $113,284.74; in 1911, $107,164.81; in 1912, $102,224.63; in 1913,
								$100,583.66.</p>

							<p>The purpose of the institution is the reformation of criminal and incorrigible
								boys. School is maintained the year round. The course covers the eight grades of the
								common school system. Two graduations are held each year, spring and fall. Sixteen
								boys were graduated in September, 1913. During the twelve months each grade is given
								a two-weeks vacation out of doors. A director of music and a physical director are
								included in the teaching force. The schools are in charge of a school principal, who
								is an experienced school man.</p>

							<p>The institution maintains the following shops and trades: Manual training,
								printing, carpenter, blacksmith, shoe shop, plumbing, tinshop, bakery, laundry,
								barber, tailor, paint shop, florist, farm and garden and telegraphy. All the
								furniture of the institution is built at the manual training <pb id="VAC1000-081"
									n="81"/> shop. The printing office does all of the job work for the institution
								and issues monthly and weekly-publications. The ordinary repairs of the institution
								are kept up by the carpenter, painting, plumbing, blacksmith and tin-smith forces.
								The garden produces a large variety of vegetables for the institution's use. An
								orchard of twenty-five acres produces five thousand bushels of apples yearly. These
								are all consumed by the boys. The farm, of three hundred acres, produces all the
								feed used by the institution and a large quantity of wheat per year, which is milled
								into flour. This year's crop of wheat amounted to over eighteen hundred bushels and
								last year's corn crop to five thousand bushels.</p>

							<p>The institution owns five hundred and twenty-seven acres of land and has fifty-four
								buildings. The place is heated by steam and is lighted by electricity produced at
								the institution's central power plant. It has its own water works system, equipped
								with fine, pure water wells pumped by electric pumps. The power plant also supplies
								steam for cooking and for the steam laundry. It has a capacity for nine hundred
								horse power.</p>

							<p>The officers, including everybody employed, number sixty. These are all appointed
								by the superintendent and are subject to dismissal at his pleasure. The present
								board of control started two years ago, with the erection of the new chapel, to
								gradually rebuild the entire institution. The plan of housing in the future will
								include barracks, cottages and buildings, with single rooms for the boys.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">CENTRAL ACADEMY.</hi></head>

							<p>The first school taught in the Central Academy at Plainfield was in 1881-2. This
								school was originated and supported by four quarterly meetings of the Friends'
								church, Plainfield, Fairfield, White Lick and Danville, until the year 1912, when
								the support of the school was transferred to the Plainfield quarterly meeting alone.
								It is a commissioned high school with a four-year course, having now thirty pupils
								and three teachers, including Simon N. Hester, the principal. The old building was
								burned in 1905 and in the next year a new one was constructed at a cost of ten
								thousand dollars. The first building was a two-story brick, with four rooms above
								and one below; the new one is the same, with the addition of a basement.</p>

							<p>Liberty township is the middle division of the three southern townships, being

								the south by Morgan county and on the west by Franklin and Clay. There are nearly
								forty-nine square miles within the area, in townships 14 and 15 north, range 1 east
								and 1 west. It is the largest of the twelve townships in the county.</p>

							<p>The ground level in the north and east parts is high and rolling, while the
								southwestern part at one time was low and swamp, but is now made into valuable land
								by the judicious system of drainage established. West fork of White Lick crosses the

							<head><hi rend="center sc">EARLY LIFE.</hi></head>

							<p>About two miles east of the present town of Belleville, on the West fork of White
								Lick, in October, 1822, the first settlement was made in the township by William and
								Thomas Hinton, James Thompson and Robert McCracken. William Pope and his son, James
								N., who was then sixteen years old, came in the spring of 1823, which year also
								brought into the township George Matlock, James R. Barlow, Samuel Hopkins, William
								Brown, William Ballard, David Demoss, John Cook, Moses Crawford, John Hanna, Thomas
								Cooper, George Coble and Jonathan Pitts. William Hinton was the first teacher in the
								township and county, in the fall of 1823, in a school house which had been built
								that fall, one-half mile south of Cartersburg. Thomas Hinton was the first justice
								of the peace and William Pope, a Baptist minister, did the first preaching. He
								organized the first Baptist church in Hendricks county, in his own home, in the late
								months of the year 1823.</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-083" n="83"/>

							<p>The first brick dwelling house in the county was built in 1830 for Jesse Cook, just
								south of Belleville, by Joseph V. Pope and William Hinton. The act authorizing the
								organization of Hendricks county designated the house of William Ballard, which was
								on the old Terre Haute trail, south of Belleville, as the place of holding the
								courts, but William Ballard died before the county was formally organized and George
								Matlock, who kept tavern on this trail a mile east of Ballard's, laid off a town
								which he called Hillsboro, and made a strong effort to get the county seat located
								there. He failed in this and met his death in 1825 as the result of a combat with
								his brother-in-law. Consequently, the Hillsboro project was a failure.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">A PIONEER'S VIEW.</hi></head>

							<p>Joshua Marshall, one of the earlier settlers of Liberty township, wrote the
								following prior to his death, of his experience in coming to this new country:</p>

							<p>"In the autumn of 1826 my father, William Marshall, of Surrey county, North
								Carolina, emigrated to Indiana and settled in the south part of Hendricks county, I
								being then in my nineteenth year. Evan. Davis, my brother-in-law, with his family,
								came at the same time and settled nearby. At that time most of the land belonged to
								the government and settlements were scattering. We frequently went as far as five
								miles to help each other raise our log cabins and stables. A few settlers had
								preceded us, Edward and Joseph Hobson, William Rushton, John Cook, and sons, Levi,
								Jesse and Stephen, with their families, Edmond Cooper, Jefferson Matlock, Rev.
								William Pope, Thomas Irons, Judge Little, William Herron, William Townsend, Joshua
								Hadley, Bowater Bales and others.</p>

							<p>"Not having saw mills, we felled a tall gray ash and cut it into four by six
								lengths, split out puncheons, dressed the ends to a uniform thickness and then laid
								them on sleepers. They were jointed with saw and ax and made a good floor. We split
								out clapboards for roofing and door shutters. We had plenty of elbow room and were
								anxious for our neighbors to help. build our cabins and roll logs so as to get them
								out of the way, in order to raise a little corn for our bread and to feed our stock.
								We were mostly poor, yet contented, and looked forward to better days and more
								conveniences. We were all neighborly and kind to each other.</p>

							<p>"Danville had been laid out into lots and a few cabins were being built. David
								Matlock and others had settled nearby and were opening farms. Religious privileges
								were scarce, not a church or school house, to my knowledge, <pb id="VAC1000-084"
									n="84"/> being then in the county. The Friends had formed a society and worshipped
								in a log house near Mooresville, in Morgan county. Rev. Pope, a Baptist minister,
								then living near where Cartersburg now is, preached frequently in his own house to
								attentive, though small, audiences; and we were glad thus to meet, hear preaching,
								and form each other's acquaintance. In the spring of 1829 Joseph Tarkington, a
								Methodist minister, established a preaching place at the house of Edmond Cooper,
								then residing on Mud creek, at the crossing of the Indianapolis and Terre Haute road
								(Terre Haute trail), and there a class was formed of six members, Evan and Rebecca
								Davis, Mother Cooper and two daughters and Hannah Snodgrass. Shortly after this, in
								June, 1829, at a two-days' meeting held in Putnam county, I joined the church and
								invited Rev. John Murser to come to Hendricks county and preach at my house. At the
								appointed time he came, and seven joined the church. Three weeks later he came
								again, and seven more joined. Thus a society was formed in the settlement where
								Salem church now stands. In August of the same year Evan Davis, Father Crutchfield,
								Bowater Bales, myself and others commenced work on a hewed-log church, which was
								raised in the presence of an 'assembled multitude.' About this time Evan Davis built
								a saw mill on White Lick and there we had our lumber sawed out for flooring and
								seating. Evan Davis was class leader and I was assistant. By Christmas there were
								seventy-five members. In the summer of 1884 I visited Salem church and found the old
								log church had been removed and in its stead was a beautiful frame building, nicely
								painted and finished inside and out. Nearby stood a handsome brick school house.
								Surely this wilderness has. 'budded and blossomed like the rose.'"</p>

							<p>Could Mr. Marshall view the Liberty township of today, thirty years after his
								visit, he would learn that this was but the beginning of the prosperity and beauty
								of the community.</p>

								of the town was Claysville, in honor of Henry Clay, the Kentucky statesman. However,
								the name was changed to Clayton because there was another town in Indiana having the
								former name.</p>

							<p>The first house in Clayton was constructed by Thomas Potts and the second by Lewis

								after whom it was named. The first lots were sold on January 1, 1850. Van Matlock
								and Simon Hornaday started the first store and soon established Cartersburg as a
								good trading point for produce. John Biddle later bought land and set up a store. In
								1854 William H. Oliver bought land of Biddle, which lay north of the railroad, and
								laid the tract out in lots, which he offered for sale. He donated certain lots to
								the Methodist Episcopal church. Land was also bought on the south of the railroad in

								is now the main street of Cartersburg.</p>

							<p>The village of Cartersburg is perhaps one of the most beautiful spots in Hendricks

							<p>Lincoln township is located on the eastern boundary of Hendricks county, bounded on
								the north by Brown and Middle townships, on the east by Marion county, on the south
								by Washington township and on the west by Middle township. The township was
								organized in 1863, by a division of Brown township into two parts. White Lick,
								flowing through the western part, breaks the otherwise almost level ground of the
								township. The land along this stream valley is rolling and very fertile. The level
								portion of the area is of rich, alluvial quality in most places, but in spots is
								composed of clay, which is not highly productive. Plenty of timber once covered the
								land in this township, but, as in other parts of Hendricks, this has been removed
								from the path of cultivation.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">EARLY HISTORY.</hi></head>

							<p>In the autumn of 1824 James Brown made the first settlement in the territory
								destined to become Lincoln township. After him and previous to the year 1830 came G.
								W. Tyler, William Harris, Daniel and Thomas Newman, Daniel Brown, William Merritt,
								Robison Turpin, Caleb Shirley, John Given, Larkin Dollahite, James Shirley, Thomas
								Nash, Harvey and T. H. Barlow, the latter settling with their father, Enoch, in
								1828, just outside the limits of Brownsburg. In 1830 and immediate years Asa
								McDaniel and sons, Joel Smith and sons and Peter Metsker located in the vicinity of
								Brownsburg.</p>

							<p>The first justice of the peace in Lincoln township was Edward Railsback. Swain's
								tavern, on the road two miles east of Brownsburg, was one of the noted spots of the
								early day. This inn was a gathering place for the settlers and a very popular
								one.</p>

							<p>Politically, Lincoln township has been very changeable, Republicans and Democrats
								having at different times controlled the township vote.</p>

							<p>Although one of the smallest townships in the county, Lincoln is important.
								Agriculture is the main industry and in the town of Brownsburg there is strong
								evidence of civic and commercial pride. Two railroads and one interurban line
								increase the value of the township land, together with the good roads, the latter an
								universal feature of the entire county. The country bears the mark of improvement
								and modern life and is an example of the qualities which have made Indiana one of

							<p>The town of Brownsburg is located on section 11, in the northern part of Lincoln
								township. The town was laid out by William Harris in 1835 and first named
								Harrisburg, but upon the establishment of the postoffice was changed to the present
								name. B. M. Logan was the first merchant in the town.</p>

							<p>Brownsburg was incorporated in the year 1848, in which year the board of
								commissioners ordered a chairman, clerk and five trustees elected. The election was
								held on June 24, 1848, and resulted in the choice of the following: Chairman, Henry
								H. Moore; clerk, T. J. White; trustees, William M. Dinwiddie, T. J. White, Sam
								Betts, Gaten Menifee, James Davidson. Ten votes only were cast at this first
								election. This corporation did not last long, however. In 1870 it was revived and
								has continued ever since. The present officers are: Trustees, I. N. Mugg, R. A.
								Fuson and Elza Henson; clerk, Harry H. Hughes; treasurer, Harry Johnson; marshal,
								John T. Ellis.</p>

							<p>The present population of Brownsburg is about nine hundred, the official census in
								1910 having been eight hundred seventy-six. The only public utility at present in
								the town is that of electricity, which service is supplied by the Danville Light,
								Heat and Power Company. There is a branch factory of the Ladoga Canning Company, a
								tile factory, grist mill and saw mill in the list of industries. Brownsburg is the
								only town in Hendricks county at this date which allows licensed sale of liquor.</p>

							<p>Brownsburg, both in the business and residential part of town, is neat and
								attractive. It is a substantially built town. Business conditions are reported as
								being excellent. Social life also plays a prominent role in the community. </p>

							<p>The boundaries of Marion township are as follows: On the north by Eel River
								township, on the east by Center and Clay, on the south by Clay and on the west by
								Putnam county. The surface in most places is undulating and in some spots flat.
								There is a clayey subsoil throughout the entire township, making the ground more
								productive for the raising of grasses and thus making the business of stock raising
								equal to crop cultivation as the principal industry. There are no large streams, but
								several small ones flowing toward the two creeks, Mill and Eel river.</p>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">EARLY SETTLEMENT.</hi></head>

							<p>Marion township was settled later than most of the other townships, due to its
								position in the middle west of the county. Naturally the tide of immigration first
								touched the southern parts of the county, along the main stream channels, and Marion
								township was then considered a remote district. It was not until two years after the
								organization of the county, which was in 1824, that permanent settlements were made
								here. The first settlers were Thomas Samuels, Xury West, John and Isaac Hays,
								Daniel, Thomas and David Higgins, who settled in the township from 1826 to 1827.
								From 1828 to 1832 Paul Faught, Moses Cavett, William Blackketter, William and Harvey
								Buntain, G. W. Turner, Wesley Morgan, Peter Vannice, Thomas Chadd, John Hancock,
								James McCown and William Hays settled in different portions of the township.</p>

							<p>The intelligent cultivation of the soil, the pride in home, and the striving for

								done in the last score of years. Roads have been built up, new farming methods have
								been adopted, schools have been improved, elegant residences have been constructed,

							<p>Middle township is located in the north tier of townships, being bounded on the
								north by Boone county, on the east by Brown and Lincoln townships, on the south by
								Lincoln, Washington and Center townships and on the west by Center and Union. The
								township was originally located in what was known as the "black swamps," the greater
								part of it being deficient in natural drainage. Artificial drainage has, however,
								largely remedied this defect in the last ten years. The intense growth of deciduous
								trees, oak, poplar, walnut, maple, ash and many other species, were evidence of a
								rich virgin soil. There are no large streams; the soil surface is nearly level;
								wheat and oats and corn are the main crops.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">SETTLEMENT.</hi></head>

							<p>In the first organization of Hendricks county, Middle township, as it is now, was
								geographically located in the north central portion of the county and was one of the
								nine civil divisions. It included not only its present area, but also all of what
								was afterward known as Union township. Its location and physical condition had much
								to do in determining its settlement and progress. Some physical defects in the land
								above mentioned had the tendency to make settlement here slower than in other parts
								of Hendricks. The first settlement made in the township was in the year 1830 by
								Lemuel McBee. His cabin and first clearing were in the western part of what is now
								Pittsboro.</p>

							<p>Richard Richardson was next, whose cabin, in section 6, township 16, was on the
								spot where Miles Hession recently resided. In three years' time other settlements
								were formed by the following families: The Spicklemires, Samuel Hill, the Hales,
								Thompsons, Wells, Holtsclaws, Jonas Lipe, Hezekiah Dunick, Philip Waters and Jack
								Parker. This group of early pioneers erected the first cabins and formed the nucleus
								of community life. At this time no roads were known except neighborhood trails,
								marked by blazing the <pb id="VAC1000-094" n="94"/> trees, the one leading through
								the township from Indianapolis to Crawfordsville being the most prominent and
								bisecting the township. The herculean task of the pioneers was now begun. The
								rearing of cabins, rolling logs, cutting out highways and constructing bridges was
								begun. A great percentage of the pioneers came from Mason, Fleming and Bourbon
								counties, Kentucky, and from Ohio, the Carolinas and Virginia, a splendid stock. The
								Watsons, Dillons, Weavers, Reynolds, Walters, Philips, Moneys, Smiths, Crabbs,
								Veaches, Kennedys, Craggs, Touts, Jones,. Caywoods, Hughes, Herods in the succeeding
								decade came and entered or bought land.</p>

							<p>The township was organized in 1833 and James Parks was the first justice of the
								peace.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">DEVELOPMENT OF TOWNSHIP.</hi></head>

							<p>Since the beginning of the seventies improvements have steadily advanced in Middle
								township. The sickle, scythe and cradle, used by the pioneers and wielded by
								muscular power, were relegated to the past when the reaper, mower, binder and other
								modern implements came into operation. The description of the other townships of the
								county apply equally well to this township, for the development has been the same.
								The farms, rich in alluvial soil, are well drained and cleared of stumps and rocks.
								Miles of wire fencing have taken the place of the old rail fence. Farm houses and
								barns, many of them spacious and modern, contribute largely to the wealth of the
								community. Twenty-two miles of gravel road and twelve miles of rock road have been
								constructed in the township and turned over to the county to keep in repair.
								Seventy-five miles of post roads make possible the excellent system of rural free
								mail delivery.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">PITTSBORO.</hi></head>

							<p>The town of Pittsboro was originally platted by Simon T. Hadley and William
								Matlock. It was first called by Mr. Hadley Pittsburg, and afterward changed to the
								present name in order to have the name of the town and postoffice agree.</p>

							<p>Pittsboro's first store was in a small log room and kept by Basil Tout. It was
								located on the corner lot now owned by the bank. He was succeeded by James Hoadley
								and James Barker. John Vaughn built a frame building on the lot where the Sawyer
								block now stands in 1844. He kept a general store, with plenty of whiskey for sale.
								Vaughn sold out to John C. Parker, <pb id="VAC1000-095" n="95"/> who, early in the
								fifties, erected a brick store on the corner where the Hayworth block now stands. It
								burned in 1884. Thomas Hoadley, one of the first physicians, built a two-story frame
								where A. C. Dunn's property is now located.</p>

							<p>Aaron Keith was the first man in the town who made furniture. Elias Leach and Isaac
								B. Waters were other early craftsmen.</p>

							<p>In 1867 the Big Four railroad was built through Pittsboro and then began a new era
								of prosperity. Business became better and the town grew. In 1873 Daniel Feely
								established a stave factory and operated it until 1886. Thousands of cords of oak,
								elm and ash were brought from the sloughs, cut into staves and shipped to outside
								markets. Many farmers paid off mortgages by disposing of surplus timber.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">THE PRESENT PITTSBORO.</hi></head>

							<p>Pittsboro is now a thrifty and well-ordered town of about five hundred inhabitants.
								The social and commercial, as well as religious, tone of the town is excellent. The
								community is advantageously located on the Ben-Hur interurban line and the Big Four
								railroad, and consequently much business is transacted with other markets.</p>

							<p>The Pittsboro Bank was organized in 1897 by Isaac Palmer, Jesse Smith and Steve
								Cline, the two latter acting as president and cashier, respectively. The present
								officers of the bank are: E. W. Sawyer, president; C. G. Olsen, vice-president; Glen
								C. Tolin, cashier; Miss Alcie Ridgway, assistant cashier. The capital stock is
								$10,000; the deposits amount to $84,000; and the surplus is $4,000. The bank was
								chartered in the year 1905 under the new banking laws.</p>

							<p>Pittsboro Lodge No. 342, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, was organized on January
								22, 1870. John N. Shirley, William N. Crabb, Lewis Watts, James Adams, Amos Hoak and
								J. M. McLean were the charter members. It was the outgrowth of the Brownsburg lodge.
								The lodge erected its present home in 1874. The lodge is now in good condition,
								having a membership of over one hundred.</p>

							<p>Pittsboro Lodge No. 428, Free and Accepted Masons, was instituted in 1871 by John
								Burton, deputy grand master. Its home was in the second story of E. A. Parker's
								store building, then occupied by A. C. Weaver. This lodge did not last long. It
								became defunct in 1882, when the grand lodge called in its charter. The present
								lodge, No. 620, was instituted by Jacob <pb id="VAC1000-096" n="96"/> Smith with
								thirteen charter members. Beginning under dispensation in 1893, it was chartered in
								due and ancient form May 25, 1899. Its first officers were: Sabert S. Offutt,
								worshipful master; Chester H. Weaver, senior warden; W. D. Lewis, junior warden;
								George D. Junken, secretary. Its present membership is seventy-one. The stated
								communications are the first and third Tuesday evenings of each month at their hall
								in the Sawyer block.</p>

							<p>Thomas Ashby Post No. 451, Grand Army of the Republic, was organized in the old
								school building September 8, 1886, with the following charter members: A. C. Weaver,
								W. D. Lewis, R. T. Dorman, H. T. Kirk, E. M. Weaver, J. M. Wills, S. S. Wills, W. H.
								Milam, George W. Tidrick, W. B. McClung, Jacob C. Waters, Lewis Buergelin, Thomas
								Brooks, Charles P. Cox, Joe Williamson and Samuel James. At eight P. M., April 8,
								1886, a delegation of comrades came up from Danville and assisted in the
								organization. The first officers of the post were: A. C. Weaver, post commander;
								William D. Lewis, senior vice-commander; Richard T. Droman, junior vice-commander;
								Henry T. Kirk, officer of the day; Ellis M. Weaver, officer of the guard; James M.
								Wills, adjutant; S. S. Wills, quartermaster; George W. Tisrick, sergeant major;
								William B. McClung, quartermaster sergeant.</p>

							<p>Thomas Ashby Woman's Relief Corps No. 231 was organized March 25, 1899, with

							<p>Union township is located in the northern tier of the county, bounded on the north
								by Boone county, on the east by Middle township, on the south by Center, and on the
								west by Eel river. The land surface is generally level, with rolling land in the
								southwest and northwest corners. Like Middle township, the natural drainage is very
								poor, but has been aided considerably by artificial tiling. The land in this
								township is valuable today and it is easy of cultivation.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">EARLY SETTLEMENT.</hi></head>

							<p>The first white settlement was made in Union township in the year 1828 by John
								Matlock and John Fowler. Isaac Veiley entered the land where Lizton is now located,
								in 1828, but did not move to his holdings until 1831. Prior to 1835 the following
								located in this township: Archibald Alexander, James and William Leak, their sons,
								William Montgomery, John Pritchett, Claiborne Davis and the Plummers. The bad
								drainage of the township hindered the rapid growth of the colony, the same as in
								Middle, and it was not until 1840 that the settlement assumed any size whatever. The
								cabins were small and far apart and the clearings were mostly unproductive. One of
								the advantages of the pioneer was that the stock brought with them would live in the
								woods all winter and usually do well. This was especially so with swine, and soon
								after the arrival of the first settlers wild hogs became very abundant in the woods
								and all those who had ever had a hog go astray had a lawful claim upon the common
								herd. In the autumn of the year, after the acorns and the other mast began falling,
								these hogs became fat and were hunted down by the settlers with dog and gun, the
								same as the bear and deer. The settlers often caught them in traps. When desirable
								to catch them alive, this was always necessary and was accomplished by making a log
								pen so high that they could not jump over and arranging a trap door <pb
									id="VAC1000-098" n="98"/> to which a string was fastened. Corn was then scattered
								in trails in different directions through the woods to entice the swine into the
								pen, when a man secreted high in a tree top would spring the trap.</p>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">FIRST ELECTIONS.</hi></head>

							<p>The poll book for the presidential election results in this township in the year

							<p>The growth and progress of Union township has kept pace with the development of the
								neighboring townships. The class of people are generally the same and the

								value increasing by the knowledge of proper cultivation and care which has in recent
								years come to the entire county of Hendricks.</p>
						</div4>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">LIZTON.</hi></head>

							<p>Lizton is the only town in Union township. It was laid out by Jesse Veiley in 1837
								and named by him New Elizabeth, in honor of Mrs. Veiley. The name was contracted to
								Lizton when the postoffice was first established.</p>

							<p>Lizton never assumed a forward place in Hendricks county, although it has always
								been a substantial town, with good business and prosperous and public-spirited
								citizens. The population now is about two hundred and fifty. The town was
								incorporated in 1909. The present officers are: George <pb id="VAC1000-099" n="99"/>
								Thompson, Clarence Storms and A. Gibson, trustees; I. E. Voris, clerk; Jesse Tharpe,
								treasurer.</p>

							<p>The Bank of Lizton, organized by Marion Bailey and others, commenced business on
								December I, 1910. Mr. Bailey was the first president; W. E. Leachman,
								vice-president; James T. Leak, cashier, and George Huber, assistant cashier. The
								same officers are now active. The capital stock is $10,000; deposits, $85,000, and

							<p>On the east line of Hendricks county is located Washington township, bounded on its
								north side by Lincoln and Middle townships, on the east by Marion county, on the
								south side by Guilford and Liberty, and on the west by Center township. White Lick
								creek flows across the west side of this township and the East fork of this same
								creek touches the southeast corner. Along the creek valley the land is rolling and
								fertile; the central and eastern portion of the civil division is very level and,
								before the day of artificial drainage, was rather swampy. It was not, however, equal
								to other townships in this respect. The early growth of timber, now gone, was
								largely composed of beech, but embraced many valuable varieties. The soil is clay
								and alluvial, being well adapted to grasses and grain.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">EARLY DAYS.</hi></head>

							<p>The first settlement in Washington township was made in the northeast corner, near
								the site of Shiloh church, by Robert Wilson, Gideon Wilson and Elisha Kise in the
								year 1822. The next year Daniel Tryer, Aaron Homan, the Griggs family, Joseph
								Fausett and others came into the same neighborhood in the same year, 1823, James
								Dunn, John Givens, Abner Dunn, for whom Abner's creek was named, and others, settled
								on the west side of the township on the above named creek. James Dunn settled on the
								Rockville road. Among those who came into the township within the next few years
								were David Cox, Alexander McCammock, Enoch Barlow and his sons Harvey and Harrison,
								the Thornbroughs, Hurons, Huffords and Gossetts.</p>

							<p>This township was one of the four which were organized at the same time as the
								organization of Hendricks county and received its name from George Washington at the
								suggestion of Aaron Homan, who was the first justice of the peace and married the
								second couple to be wedded in the county.</p>

								Daniel C. Hults, James Merritt, Joseph Runyan, Isaac Williamson, Daniel B. Tryer,
								James Higgenbotham, Joseph Phillips, William S. Merrill, Robert Wilson and John

						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">AVON.</hi></head>

							<p>Avon, the capital of Washington township, is at a point very near the center of the
								township. The first settlement of the neighborhood was about the year 1830. Among
								the first settlers were the Hurons, the Rosses, the Gossetts, the McClains, the
								Jenkinses, Abram Harding, Absalom Payne, Dr. Malone, R. J. Barker, G. W. Merritt and
								James Siggurson. It was dense forest everywhere; deer and wolves were a common
								sight; but in small clearings little cabins of round logs sprang up and in a very
								short time this became a "neighborhood." The whole settlement was made up of people
								of energy and enterprise who came here to make a home that was to be their home, so
								their plans took in the question of church and school and roads and a postoffice. In
								1833 Absalom Payne, who entered the land and lived where J. H. Wear now lives, was
								commissioned postmaster of Hampton postoffice, with a weekly mail carried on
								horseback from the east to the west, but no one remembers where from or where to. In
								a few years Mr. Payne tired of the empty honor and the office passed to Dr. Malone,
								where J. H. Winings lives, and a little later to W. T. Ross, where E. E. Blair now
								lives. Mr. Ross also tired of the office and, no one else wanting it, is was allowed
								to die, and Hampton was no more. In 1852 O. J. Huron, newly married, was persuaded
								to accept a commission as postmaster, naming the office White Lick and locating it
								in his log cabin, one-fourth mile west of present Avon. Just three months satisfied
								Mr. Huron and White Lick died and was laid away, in memory, besides Hampton. Along
								in the fifties John Smoot began making visits here as a pack-peddler; soon he added
								a horse and wagon and came weekly, and, after a time, about 1858, leased ground and
								built a small room in the corner of J. H. Ross's yard, where William Shipman now
								lives: Smoot emptied his pack and put a few more items on a few shelves, <pb
									id="VAC1000-102" n="102"/> and this was the beginning of the town. But Mr. Ross
								was a strong Republican and Mr. Smoot an ardent Democrat, and it was not long until
								Smoot moved his store to Democratic ground, across the road, on the land of John
								Dickerson, and thus, at the very first the town began to move. Mr. Dickerson not
								being willing to sell a lot to Mr. Smoot, the latter sought one elsewhere and,
								November 1, 1862, R. J. Barker deeded Smoot a half acre a mile farther west and the
								following winter he moved his store on a couple of log-sleds to his own lot; this
								was the third town-site. Mr. Smoot prospered and enlarged his store and added more
								goods, and in 1867 he headed a petition to Washington for a postoffice, and for R.
								M. Bartley to be made postmaster, but no name was suggested for the new office, and
								the authorities used the first name on the petition; when Mr. Bartley's commission,
								dated April 28, 1868, reached him it gave the office the picturesque name,
								Smootsdell, located it in Smoot's store and gave us two mails a week, carried
								horseback from Plainfield by D. S. Barker. When the I. &amp; St. L. railroad was
								being surveyed, the man who, with a blue pencil, marked the stakes, made fun of the
								name of our postoffice, and said, "I'll name the town." Artistically he pencilled
								"New Philadelphia" on a stake and drove it down. When the road was completed the
								company drove another stake, with "Avon" painted on it. The people liked the name
								and petitioned to have the postoffice name changed to Avon. This was done and
								Smootsdell was laid away beside Hampton and White Lick. In May, 1871, Mr. Smoot sold
								all his property, building, lot and goods to Mr. Bartley and moved to Kansas. A
								little later the Barker brothers erected a building at the railroad crossing, put a
								stock of goods in one room, the other being used by the company. The Barkers soon
								tired of the store and quit, then J. L. Middleton, in 1875, added a general store to
								his shoe shop south of the railroad. In 1889 E. T. Huron was made postmaster and
								purchased the Middleton store. In 1893 William Taylor became postmaster. Mr. Taylor
								was full of enterprise and built a new postoffice building and put in a stock of
								goods, and Avon, for the first time, had three stores at one time. From the very
								first there was a rivalry among the people as to the location of the postoffice and
								the future town; the east side wanted it and the west side wanted it more. The Big
								Four folks soon learned of this feeling and sought to use it in securing bonuses.
								The station was at first a half mile west of the Plainfield road, then on the road,
								then three-fourths of a mile east, where trains stopped at an old box-car in the
								middle of a farm for passengers, and patrons carried trunks down the tracktill they
								were tired, then changed hands and carried again. The west side <pb id="VAC1000-103"
									n="103"/> complained and grumbled, than begged and finally won the station, and
								thought themselves secure; but in 1891 private citizens bought a little yellow
								dwelling and moved it to the crossing a mile east, and the company slid its
								telegraph office into it. The old sad look came again to the west-sider's face; the
								company saw the look and smiled, then moved their station also to the yellow
								dwelling, using it for all purposes until 1894, when, with generous help of
								east-side citizens, the company erected a neat three-room building. The east-side
								countenance broadened; the little yellow building was moved back and a stock of
								goods put in and, for a little while, Avon had four stores, three at the west side
								and one at the east, a mile away, but trade was backward and the new store soon
								closed, the yellow dwelling was sold again and this time was moved three miles away,
								when it ceased to worry the west side, with her three stores and the postoffice
								left. In 1900 the first rural free delivery in the county, and among the first in
								the state, was established in Danville, route No. 1, and its first delivery was made
								April 2d, of that year. While this has proven one of the greatest blessings ever
								bestowed on the common people, it crippled the Avon postoffice, reducing the salary
								from thirty-five dollars to six dollars per quarter, and when, on November 1, 1902,
								the first Plainfield route was opened and passed the Avon postoffice door, the
								office was discontinued, and now Hampton, White Lick, Smootsdell and Avon all lie
								buried side by side. But the town survived, holding its own till the Terre Haute,
								Indianapolis &amp; Eastern traction line was opened, September 1, 1906, when it
								began to improve and has continued to do so, until today its two general stores sell
								several times the amount of goods sold then, and property values have about
								trebled.</p>

							<p>The year 1824 is the first year in Hendricks county in which politics entered, and
								thirty-seven votes were cast for President, as follows: Jackson, 6; J. Q. Adams, 1;
								Clay, 30. At that time there were no party alliances; personal popularity, ability
								and influence were the main factors determining the failure or success of a
								candidate. Jackson carried the county in the campaigns of 1828 and 1832, the first
								time by a majority of forty over John Quincy Adams and the second time by one
								hundred and nine over Henry Clay. In the year 1836 the Whigs were victorious. Martin
								Van Buren was the Democratic candidate for President and William Henry Harrison, the
								Whig. There were one thousand one hundred and twenty-one votes cast in Hendricks
								county that year, and of this number the Whigs received seven hundred and
								thirty-one, a majority of three hundred and forty-two.</p>

							<p>The campaign of 1860, just prior to the opening of the Civil war, was a hot one in
								this county. Abraham Lincoln was the nominee of the Republican party, Stephen A.
								Douglas of the Northern Democrats, John C. Breckenridge of the Southern Democrats,
								and John Bell of the Constitutional Union party. The campaign was an exciting one
								and, as history records, Lincoln was the victor, although he received only
								two-fifths of the popular vote in the United States. The split in the Democratic
								party made this result possible. A heavy vote was polled in this county, Lincoln
								receiving two thousand fifty votes; Douglas, one thousand eighty-three;
								Breckinridge, two hundred forty-four, and Bell, forty-one. Eight of the townships
								voted for Lincoln; Eel River, Middle and Union townships gave their pluralities to
								Douglas.</p>

							<p>In the presidential election of 1864 George B. McClellan, the first commander of
								the Army of the Potomac, was placed in the field against Lincoln. McClellan received
								in Hendricks county but eight hundred thirty-two votes, against two thousand six
								hundred and twenty-two for Lincoln. Much excitement <pb id="VAC1000-105" n="105"/>
								and bitter feeling existed in Hendricks county during this election. Many threats
								were made by ardent supporters of the war and it was deemed necessary for the polls
								to be guarded to prevent violence against some voters supposed to belong to a
								treasonable order. Two townships, Brown and Union, gave a majority for
								McClellan.</p>

							<p>In an uninterrupted series the elections proceeded every four years until 1912 with
								the Republicans in the lead. The campaign of 1912 and the split in the Republican
								ranks is fresh in the mind of the reader. In this year Woodrow Wilson, the
								Democratic nominee, received the plurality of votes cast in Hendricks county.</p>

							<p>Following is a summary giving the vote in the different Presidential elections from
								1828, also a roster of the county officials from the date of the organization of the
								county:</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">MILITARY HISTORY.</hi></head>

							<p>The county of Hendricks is jurly proud of the heroic part played by her sons in the
								great drama of the sixties. The news of Lincoln's nomination by the Republican party
								for the Presidency of the United States was received with great rejoicing in
								Hendricks county and particularly in Danville, the county seat. Early the following
								spring their rejoicings were changed to great nervous excitement.</p>

							<p>The following notice appeared in the newspapers:</p>

							<p rend="center">WAR! WAR!</p>

							<p>"All persons within, the county of Hendricks who are subject to military duty are
								hereby requested and notified to be and appear in Danville on Saturday the 20th day
								of April, 1861. War is on hand and our whole safety depends on thorough military
								organization.</p>

							<p rend="center">J. M. G<hi rend="sc">REGG,</hi></p>
							<p rend="right">"Colonel 6th Military Dist."</p>

							<p>Hendricks county had at this time less than seventeen thousand inhabitants. Under
								the call for seventy-five thousand volunteers the quota of Indiana was fixed at six
								regiments. The response was hearty from all parts of the state and from none more so
								than in Hendricks. Being but an hour's travel by rail from Indianapolis, the first
								company raised in this county was one of the first to be accepted by the United
								Sates. From that time on the county sent enlisted men into the field, until a total
								of approximately two thousand had been enrolled, sixty-five per cent. of the voting
								strength.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">PRESS COMMENTS.</hi></head>

							<p>Scores of men and women are yet living who remember that awful April day when the
								news came that Sumter had fallen, that Lincoln had called for troops, and that, be
								it long or short, the most terrible of all wars, a civil war, was upon the
								people.</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-115" n="115"/>

							<p>The issue of the <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi> of Saturday, April 20, 1861, told the
								story locally and generally. Fort Sumter surrendered on the afternoon of April 13th
								and this was the first issue after that event. And it appears that so great was the
								excitement that this issue was not printed until Monday, the 22nd. The news of the
								attack and fall of Sumter is given in a series of official communications showing
								the progress of the fight from day to day, the last dispatch from Charleston
								reading: "Fort Sumter has been unconditionally surrendered. The fort was taken
								possession of tonight."</p>

							<p>When the news reached Danville all business was suspended and men stood about the
								streets discussing, almost in a whisper, the future of the land. Men doubted if a
								company could be organized in Danville. Joseph S. Miller thought it worth while to
								try and, going to his law office, he drew up a muster roll, signing it himself
								first. Then he went out on the street and name after name was added and public
								enthusiasm increased with each signature.</p>

							<p>Under the, heading, "War Spirit of Old Hendricks," the <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi>
								tells of this as follows:</p>

							<p>"The President's call for men was received here on Monday last. On Tuesday Joseph
								S. Miller headed a list of volunteers. On Wednesday the Governor was petitioned to
								appoint Hon. James M. Gregg colonel of the county militia. On Thursday his
								commission came and he gave notice to all liable to do military duty to meet him for
								immediate service and organize the militia in every township. On Saturday morning
								the town was alive with people from all parts of the country. The volunteers,
								numbering over fifty, were formed into line before the Odd Fellows' hall and a
								national flag was raised from the roof of the building amid the shouts of the people
								and the roar of musketry. Colonel Gregg then responded to a call for a speech.
								Messrs. Campbell, Colonel Nave, W. L. Gregg, S. A. Russell and V. Lingenfelter also
								spoke and one hundred and eight men enrolled themselves. Their captain, James
								Burgess, was offered and accepted by the governor and they leave this evening. In
								the meanwhile, L. S. Shuler commenced another company, continued all day Sunday and
								this evening will tender a second full company to the governor."</p>

							<p>Among those who signed was Warner L. Vestal, editor of the <hi rend="i"
								>Ledger</hi>, and his enlistment caused the following to appear in the paper:</p>

							<p>"The editor and proprietor, W. L. Vestal, having volunteered in the service of the
								United States, has put in John Irons as editor and agent during his absence. Four of
								our compositors, W. P. and George Gregg, J. N. <pb id="VAC1000-116" n="116"/> Vestal
								and B. B. Freeman, having also volunteered and the Devil, W. H. Carnes, having gone
								with the captain of the company, the news room is left with no other force than the
								old stand-by, the former foreman, T. O. Thompson. The paper will probably be behind
								for an issue or so. But unless another call is made by the government the <hi
									rend="i">Ledger</hi> will be on hands as usual after all hands have got the hang
								of the new arrangement."</p>

							<p>That the paper was late in being published is evident, for, although it was dated
								April 20th, the following item concerning the departure of the Hendricks county
								volunteers tells of an event which happened on the 22nd as follows:</p>

							<p>"One hundred and eight of as gallant fellows as ever dared to meet a foe left our
								town Monday evening, April 22nd. Hon. James Burgett, captain; P. S. Kennedy, Esq.,
								first; Joseph S. Miller, Esq., second; and W. P. Gregg, Esq., third lieutenants.
								Such unanimity of purpose was never witnessed among our people before. Parties now
								date this back no further than Monday the 15th inst. The bombardment of Fort Sumter
								proved to be a great uniter of parties in this county. In fact, there is but one
								party, that of the Stars and Stripes, in old Hendricks and it is dangerous to avow
								any other principles. So hot have matters become that one fellow here had nearly
								been slaughtered at the meeting here on the 20th inst. by mistake. Swords and
								bayonets flashed around him like lightning and but for prompt assistance his life
								would have been out of him in twenty seconds."</p>

							<p>It is unfortunate for this generation that more of the local scenes are not
								described in the issue of the <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi>, but the excitement was too
								great, the tension too strong to write. Editorially, the Ledger said:</p>

							<p>"It becomes our duty this week to announce the lamentable fact that war has been
								inaugurated in our own country by the rebels of the Confederate states. The attack
								made on Fort Sumter by the rebels was successful. Major Anderson has been compelled
								to surrender and, however humiliating it may seem to others, we can not but regard
								it as a point gained. We will now find out whether we have a government or not, and
								if we have, woe be unto those who have for years been plotting its ruin. The people
								in this part of the country are a unit for the Union. We know no man as a
								Republican, a Douglas or a Breckinridge Democrat. Party lines have been abandoned
								and, although it has been predicted that in case of an attack upon the government
								the North would be divided and the rebels receive the support of a strong party
								here, we are of the opinion that not one company can be found north of Mason and
								Dixon's line who are willing to assist the traitors. <pb id="VAC1000-117" n="117"/>
								The present state of affairs is much to be regretted, but we of the North can not
								help it. For four months every act of aggression, of insult, and insolence has been
								done in the secession states against the government and people of the American
								nation, which can possible be conceived except the actual conflict of arms. This has
								come and henceforth we have to hear the sound of war and the combat of battles. The
								record is made up. The position admits of but two sides. He who is not for his
								country is against it. Let every loyal heart now rally to the country. Let the flag
								be borne aloft and the battle will end with a victory for the Union, for humanity
								and the world."</p>

							<p>Elsewhere the <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi> says: "Hon. J. M. Gregg has been
								commissioned by the governor as colonel of the sixth military district of Indiana.
								Mr. Gregg is a Democrat and was delegate to the Charleston convention. In this hour

							<p>The <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi> also says: "On Tuesday (the 16th) an effort was made
								to organize a company of militia here to be tendered to the governor for the
								maintenance of the government and the enforcement of the laws. Before night
								twenty-six men were enrolled. At the meeting Tusday night several more signified
								their willingness to serve their country and the company will soon be made up.
								Wednesday morning another meeting was held and the company proceeded to the election
								of temporary officers. The band played martial music and everything was astir. After
								marching around to the commons east of town Captain Kennedy proceeded to drill the
								new company. Colonal Nave's hall was secured and there in the evening the company
								drilled again. The greatest excitement and enthusiasm prevails and all men of all
								parties are determined the government shall be sustained at all hazards. The stars

							<p>Local mention is made of the marriage on Sunday, April 21st, of George Gregg and

								INFANTRY</hi></head>

							<p>On July 8, 1863, news came to Indiana that a large rebel force under command of
								Gen. John H. Morgan had crossed the Ohio river near Mauck port and was moving on
								Corydon, Indiana. Governor Morton at once issued a call and within forty-eight hours
								sixty-five thousand men had tendered their services. Thirteen regiments and one
								battalion were organized for the emergency. In the second of these, known as the One
								Hundred and Third, were seven companies from Hendricks county. The regiment left
								Indianapolis by rail on the evening of July 11th and reached Vernon the next morning
								at three o'clock. Here Colonel Shuler impressed a number of horses and, mounting one
								hundred and forty-six men from his own command and that of Colonel Gregory's, moved
								in pursuit of Morgan. These troops came in sight of Morgan's rear guard on the
								afternoon of the I3th, captured several stragglers, skirmished with detachments of
								the enemy near Harrison, Ohio, and entered that town shortly after Morgan's rear
								guard had departed. Next morning the pursuit was resumed and continued as far as
								Batavia, Ohio, <pb id="VAC1000-119" n="119"/> when, upon learning of Morgan's
								capture, the command returned to Indianapolis and was mustered out July 16th.</p>

							<p>Lawrence S. Shuler was a colonel; Virgil H. Lyon, lieutenant-colonel; Samuel J.
								Banta, major; and Frank Coons, adjutant, were the higher officers in this regiment.
								Other officers were William H. Calvert, Richard Duddy, Tyra Montgomery, John
								Franklin, William M. Brown, William Little, Aquilla S. McCormick, Joseph Wood, Jesse
								S. Ogden, Joseph O'Haver, Robert Curry, William F. Parker, Joseph Allison, James L.

							<p>The county gave bounties to volunteers during the war amounting in all to $27,750,
								while the several townships paid the following amounts: Center, $16,000; Washington,
								$30,000; Liberty, $35,000; Franklin, $10,000; Clay, $20,000; Marion, $36,000; Eel

								of $266,250.</p>

							<p>Not content with this, the local authorities also resolved to care for the needy
								families of volunteers and for this purpose the county appropriated at various times
								amounts aggregating $50,200. Each of ten townships contributed $1,000.</p>

							<p>The relief work at home was energetic and prompt. Whenever money could not be
								obtained by asking, it was appropriated.</p>

							<p>A draft became necessary in Indiana in the fall of 1862, and the enrolling

								total volunteers, 1,352; total exempts, 506; total conscientiously opposed to
								bearing arms, 150; total volunteers in service, 1,271; total subject to draft,

								draft.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR.</hi></head>

							<p>Hendricks county did not supply a full company to the Indiana militia during the
								Spanish-American war. The declaration of war by Congress and President McKinley's
								call for troops in the month of April, 1898, brought great excitement to the county
								and many recollections of the days of 61.</p>

							<p>On Friday night, April 22, 1898, an immense crowd gathered in the court room at
								Danville. The college band played lively airs and a Cuban flag waved from the
								gallery. Solon Enloe called the mass meeting to order <pb id="VAC1000-123" n="123"/>
								and Judge John V. Hadley was elected chairman, following which election the latter
								made an address. Enloe followed, then George C. Harvey, C. W. Stewart, Thad S.
								Adams, O. E. Gulley and Messrs. Hack, Lane and Young of the Central Normal College.
								Solon Enloe then moved that a roll be prepared for those who were prepared and
								willing to go the front. While the band played patriotic airs and Judge Hadley waved
								the flag, one hundred names were affixed to the roll. A committee was appointed
								consisting of Enloe, Harvey and Julian D. Hogate, and these men went to Indianapolis
								to inform the Governor that they were ready.</p>

							<p>Some disagreement in the election of officers resulted in the disbanding of the
								company. The men most eager to serve their country and flag, however, were not to be
								thwarted, so they went to Indianapolis and enlisted. They were sworn in on Tuesday
								night, May 10th, and that night returned home to say good-bye. The public responded
								and accorded them a reception and banquet. A list of the men, most of them in the
								Second Regiment, who went from Hendricks county to the war follows: E. M. Swindler,
								O. O. Marshall, Charles Sims, J. M. Gregg, R. D. Warner, Oliver Sears, Walter
								Thomas, Aquilla Miles, Rome Phillips, Frank H. King, Albert Ayres, David Stutesman,
								Claude Adams, Herschell Hall, Solon Enloe, Guy Roach, Edgar Pennington, Fitz

							<head><hi rend="center sc">THE EARLY NEWSPAPER.</hi></head>

							<p>In this day of huge metropolitan newspapers and up-to-the-minute news stories, it
								is hard to realize the handicap under which the newspaper of fifty, or even thirty,
								years ago labored. Facilities for receiving and publishing news had not reached the
								point of perfection attained today. The editor of today is a business man, a
								manager, a news medium; years ago he was a moulder of public opinion, a controller
								of local politics. The paper was known by the editor, but now the editor is known by
								the paper. Crude hand presses, meager supply of type and other simple paraphernalia
								of the early printing shops have given way to the linotype, power presses which turn
								out over a hundred papers a minute ready for the subscriber, and other wonderful
								inventions and methods used in modern newspaper production.</p>

							<p>In Hendricks county the growth of the newspaper has been very substantial, although
								it has been retarded by the close proximity of Indianapolis and the large dailies
								there. The resident of Danville and other larger townships is enabled to receive the
								city paper almost as soon as a local edition. The papers in Hendricks county have
								been restricted to weekly editions due to this fact alone, for otherwise the
								population and interest of the county would warrant more frequent issues.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">BEGINNINGS IN HENDRICKS COUNTY.</hi></head>

							<p>The year 1846 saw the beginning of journalism in Hendricks county. In the spring of
								that year the <hi rend="i">Danville Advertiser</hi> was established, with Joseph
								Graham as publisher and Dr. H. G. Todd as editor. Doctor Todd and several other
								enterprising citizens bought the press and gave it to Mr. Graham for the sole
								purpose of giving the town of Danville a newspaper. In size, the <hi rend="i"
									>Advertiser</hi> was a six-column folio, composed almost exclusively of reading
								matter. Very little advertising matter found its way into the <pb id="VAC1000-125"
									n="125"/> sheet. Politically, the paper was Whig. The paper was established to
								promote the interests of this party and it continued so during the period of it
								existence. After a few years, the paper changed hands and from then on had a varied
								career, having several owners, appearing under several names, until 1856, when it
								came out as the <hi rend="i">Danville Republican</hi>. Under this title it was
								issued until the spring of 1864.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">HENDRICKS COUNTY UNION.</hi></head>

							<p>On the day of April 23, 1856, the first issue of the <hi rend="i">Hendricks County
									Union</hi> was published by W. P. Gregg &amp; Company. The paper was decidedly in
								favor of war. At the top of its first page it printed each day, "To preserve the
								Union, soldiers must fight at elections as well as fight in the field." The name <hi
									rend="i">Union</hi> was selected instead of Republican in order to gain the
								support of the war Democrats, which in large measure it accomplished. The paper was
								under splendid editorial management and met success from the very start. The above
								mentioned firm continued to publish this paper until July 14, 1856, when Col.
								Lawrence S. Shuler, a soldier, became sole proprietor, with Col. James M. Gregg as
								editor and Gideon B. Thompson in charge of the local department and assistant in the
								management of the business. Colonel Shuler continued to publish the paper until
								April 20, 1865, when he sold it to James L. Singer, who became editor and publisher
								and remained as proprietor of the newspaper until March 15, 1866, at which time John
								N. Scearce bought the office. Mr. Scearce continued in charge for over thirteen
								years and changed the name of the paper to the</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">DANVILLE UNION.</hi></head>

							<p>Under Scearce's management the paper had a very prosperous career. During a part of
								this time Dr. A. Furnas was agricultural editor and contributed largely to the value
								and interest of the paper. In 1866 O. H. Smith was educational editor. On the 2nd of
								January, 1879, Mr. Scearce sold the <hi rend="i">Union</hi> to J. E. Sherrill, who
								had begun the publication of the <hi rend="i">Danville Republican</hi>. Sherrill
								merged the <hi rend="i">Union</hi> into the <hi rend="i">Republican</hi>, but the
								new paper was of short life. On January 30, 1879, less than one month after the
								suspension of the <hi rend="i">Danville Union</hi>, another <hi rend="i">Hendricks
									County Union</hi> came into existence.</p>

							<p>The new firm was South, Hathaway &amp; Company, and the paper at once struck the
								public favorably, there being something of advantage in the old name <hi rend="i"
									>Union</hi>. In a few weeks Mr. Sherrill sold his <hi rend="i">Republican</hi>
								office and <pb id="VAC1000-126" n="126"/> business to the new Union firm, S. F.
								Wishard and James B. Greene being added to the proprietors. A. G. South soon left
								the company and in a few months Mr. Greene also retired, the paper being continued
								by Hathaway and Wishard. On August 4th of the same year Mr. Wishard sold his share
								to John R. Rankin and Hathaway and Rankin were proprietors until November 7th, when
								O. H. Smith bought out the interest of Mr. Rankin. Smith became editor and in
								December, 1880, bought out Robert F. Hathaway's share of the paper, thus becoming
								sole editor and proprietor. On February 11, 1882, he sold to Parker &amp; Bowen of
								the <hi rend="i">Republican</hi>, who continued to issue the <hi rend="i">Union</hi>
								from their office for about two months on account of certain advertising
								contracts.</p>

							<p>Mr. Bowen and J. O. Parker had established the paper known as the <hi rend="i"
									>Hendricks County Republican</hi> on the 13th day of October, 1881. This paper is
								now, after an existence of over thirty-three years, the leading paper of Danville.
								On February 10, 1883, Mr. Bowen sold his interest in the office to William N. Crabb
								and the paper was published by Crabb and Parker, with Mr. Parker as editor and
								manager until the month of April, 1883. After Mr. Bowen's departure Samuel F.
								Wishard was local editor for one year. In March, 1884, Mr. Bowen returned to the
								paper, with which he was connected as local editor until April, 1885. In this month
								Crabb and Parker sold to Moffett and Riddle, who continued the publication to good
								advantage. John C. Ochiltree was the next proprietor, followed in the year 1890 by
								Julian D. Hogate, who, in 1914, is still successfully publishing the <hi rend="i"
									>Republican</hi>. It is the leading newspaper in the county, having a circulation
								of about eighteen hundred. It is a six-column quarto, issued Thursday of each week.

							<p>Two newspapers were at one time moved to Danville from the town of Plainfield. Both
								papers bore the name Progress. The first was in 1877 by John N. Vestal, who
								suspended after six months, and the second occasion was in May, 1883, when George V.
								Mechler made a like venture. He, too, found the venture unsuccessful.</p>

							<p>The Democratic party has been represented editorially in Danville. <pb
									id="VAC1000-127" n="127"/> The first newspaper of that political faith bore the
								sanguinary title of <hi rend="i">The Butcher Knife</hi>. It was founded in 1856 by
								George Gregg. Four years completed the life of this sheet and it died amidst the
								strong Union sentiment at the opening of the Civil war.</p>

							<p><hi rend="i">The Danville Indianian</hi> was established in 1870 by a group of men
								from Greensburg. Soon after it became the property of a stock company and afterward,
								for a time, it was in charge of Doctor Haggart, who was followed by two brothers
								named Ray. In 1872 the office was purchased by C. N. Walls, who remained in control
								until the fall of 1875, when the office and material were sold and transported into
								Illinois.</p>

							<p>In February of the year 1878 E. D. King established the <hi rend="i">Democrat</hi>
								and remained as its editor and publisher until August, 1879, building up a strong
								and influential paper. At the latter date mentioned he sold the office to M. A.
								Barnett, who, in turn, closed out the office in October, 1881, to James O. Parker of
								the <hi rend="i">Republican</hi>. Just prior to this, E. D. King returned from a
								year's trip in Colorado and founded, on September 15, 1880, the</p>

							<p rend="center sc">HENDRICKS COUNTY GAZETTE.</p>

							<p>which is now the leading Democratic paper of the county. The paper was started
								during a presidential campaign and found a fertile field in which to grow. It at
								once assumed an important position and today (1914) it still holds that reputation.
								At one time its editor was indicted for libel under the Grubbs law, but so obviously
								unfair was the action of the partisan grand jury that Mr. King was never brought to
								trial, the judge of the court quashing the indictment and throwing the case out. In
								August, 1882, E. D. King retired from the managerial helm of the <hi rend="i"
									>Gazette</hi> and from then until August 1, 1884, it passed through the hands of
								several proprietors. At that date it came into possession of William A. King and
								John W. Cravens. Cravens disposed of his interest in a few months and Mr. King
								became sole proprietor. He holds this position today, after thirty years of valiant
								service for the Democratic party. Just at present he holds the office of postmaster
								of Danville, in connection with his editorial duties. The paper is a weekly,
								published on Thursday, being a six-column quarto and with eleven hundred
								subscribers. The paper has been uniformly successful throughout the many years of
								its existence. High class job printing is also made a specialty at the <hi rend="i"

						<head><hi rend="center sc">THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.</hi></head>

						<p>The medical profession in Hendricks county had its beginning before the organization
							of the county, for of all the professions in which man is engaged that of medicine is
							the first demanded. True it is that great progress has been made in the science since
							its introduction into Hendricks county, but nevertheless, the early patient probably
							had as much confidence in the methods of the pioneer physician as the present-day
							patient has in the most advanced methods. Trust and dread did occasionally go hand in
							hand in administration of the first doctor's treatment. There was the lancet, to take
							from the patient all the blood he could spare and still live, hoping thereby to
							destroy the tenement of the demon disease and force him to seek some other abode.
							Another indispensable remedy was, "the Spanish-fly blister," which was applied on the
							same theory, indiscriminately upon adult and child. Calomel and blue-pills were common
							remedies for most diseases determined by the doctor's diagnosis, and a sure remedy
							when the doctor's diagnosis left uncertainty in his mind. To work out of the human
							system the calomel and blue-pills, after they had done their savage work, gamboge,
							castor-oil and senna, one or all of them, were freely administered. The accepted
							theory of the profession at that early day was if the patient survived the first
							course, it was soon repeated until the patient, in the opinion of the doctor, was only
							suffering from the remedies. The surgeon in those early days of frontier life ranked
							with the skilled carpenter and blacksmith. In fact, the former made the doctor's
							splints and other appliances of wood, and the latter made his operative cutlery,
							forceps and other implements of steel.</p>

						<p>If the physician in those early days, with his multiplied trials to contend with and
							groping in the darkness, could become enthusiastic in his efforts to carry conviction
							to others, what might be his exulting joy now, since the light of intervening years of
							scientific progress and investigation has so changed the theory of disease and
							remedies. Both medicine and surgery have made greater progress in harmony with
							scientic truth in the last half century than during all previous history. Medicine,
							however, with its component sciences and surgery, is not alone in this rapid and
							wonderful progress, which <pb id="VAC1000-132" n="132"/> is world wide, but there has
							been a general awakening in the world of thought during this recent period,
							discovering and inventing the most wonderful aids to modern life. We can but marvel
							when we endeavor to tabulate the innumerable lists. This revolution has placed
							medicine, as a profession, a long way on the road of science. As nature, with its most
							intricate vital forces, is the superior physician and first in charge of every case of
							human disability, the present doctor is now on such friendly terms with nature that he
							lends rational assistance to his superior and thereby gives most welcome aid to the
							afflicted.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">HENDRICKS COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY.</hi></head>

							<p>On the 29th day of April, 1854, the medical society of Hendricks. county was
								organized at Danville. The doctors signing the constitution were Henry G. Todd, D.
								J. Depew, J. A. Comingor, David Todd, Risdon C. Moore, Henry H. Moore, Thomas P.
								Seller, Wilson Lockhart, J. Joel Wright, Leroy H. Kennedy, Thomas B. Harvey, Henry
								Cox, B. Bartholomew and V. F. Harvey. Henry G. Todd was elected the first president;
								Wilson Lockhart, vice-president; J. Joel Wright, secretary; Leroy H. Kennedy,
								corresponding secretary; Henry Cox, treasurer; Thomas B. Harvey, Bradley
								Bartholomew, Henry H. Moore, censors.</p>

							<p>The constitution was as follows: "We, the undersigned practitioners of medicine and
								surgery in the county of Hendricks and vicinity, for the purpose of promoting
								harmony and good fellowship, and of elevating the cause of medical and collateral
								science, associate ourselves under the following constitution: <list type="simple">
									<item>"Article 1. This association shall be denominated the Hendricks County

									<item>"Art. 2. The officers of this society shall consist of a president,

										officer shall serve until his successor is duly installed into office.</item>

									<item>"Art. 3. Any regular and reputable practitioner of medicine may become a
										member of this society, by signing the constitution, paying into the treasury
										two dollars, and complying with such other regulations as may be hereafter
										provided by law.</item>

									<item>"Art. 4. Any distinguished literary gentleman may become an honorary member
										of this society, by a vote of two-thirds of the members present at any regular
										meeting; provided that notice to that effect had been given at any previous
										meeting of the society.</item>

									<pb id="VAC1000-133" n="133"/>

									<item>"Art. 5. The society shall have power to form a library and a cabinet of
										specimens, in the various departments of natural science, and pathological
										specimens and illustrations, both from the donations of individuals and other
										societies, and by levying taxes and fines, agreeable to the regulations which
										may be hereafter provided by law.</item>

									<item>"Art. 6. This society may open a correspondence with similar associations in
										this state and such others as it may from time to time direct.</item>

									<item>"Art. 7. This society shall meet at such times and places and engage in such
										deliberations as may from time to time be agreed upon, and may enact by-laws for
										its government, not inconsistent with this constitution.</item>

									<item>"Art. 8. The society may admit honorary members upon compliance of the
										applicant with the same forms as are prescribed for the admission of bona fide
										members, except that no initiatory fee shall be required. He shall not be
										permitted to vote, nor shall he participate in any of the proceedings except by
										express permission of the society.</item>

									<item>"Art. 9. One-third of all the members shall constitute a quorum for the
										transaction of business, but on all subjects involving the rights, interests or
										standing of any member, a majority of all the members shall be present.</item>

									<item>"Art. 10. This constitution may be amended at any stated meeting of the
										society, by a vote of two-thirds of the members present; provided, the amendment
										has been prosposed, in writing, at a previous meeting."</item>
								</list>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">PROGRESS OF SOCIETY.</hi></head>

							<p>The society continued from year to year until the opening of the Civil War, when,
								most of the members having enlisted, so few were left to hold meetings that they
								were discontinued until the year 1866, when the times for its regular meetings,
								specified in its by-laws, were observed, and have been ever since.</p>

							<p>At the annual meeting of the State Medical Society, in 1872, as a basis on which to
								organize this society under the statute relating to voluntary associations, passed
								resolutions providing for the incorporation of county medical societies. It was not,
								however, until the annual meeting of 1875 that the requisite number, twelve
								counties, reported to the secretary of the state society. The state society, now
								having adopted the delegate system of representation from incorporated auxiliary
								county societies, the Hendricks County Medical Society, at one of its regular
								meetings, in the year 1875, changed its constitution, as was thought, to comply with
								the state society. The delegates from the Hendricks county society were admitted at
								the <pb id="VAC1000-134" n="134"/> annual state meeting in 1876. However, the
								constitution of the Hendricks society was defective in regard to its seal. When this
								fact became known, most of the physicians of the county who were not members of this
								society organized a new society, and, as a result, at the annual state meeting in
								1877 there were two sets of delegates, each claiming to represent the Hendricks
								County Medical Society. The committee appointed to straighten out the matter took
								cognizance of the fact that the old society in Hendricks had acted on good faith and
								the mistakes in the constitution were not voluntary; therefore they allowed the old
								society to continue, after that trouble had been remedied and the constitution
								rewritten.</p>

							<p>Before 1890 the physicians who had been enrolled upon the books of the society were
								T. J. Adams, B. Bartholomew, J. T. Barker, J. H. Brill, J. A. Comingor, Henry Cox,
								Amos Carter, D. J. Depew, A. Davidson, T. F. Dryden, M. F. Depew, C. R. Dixon, J. A.

							<head><hi rend="center sc">METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCHES.</hi></head>

							<p>The first Methodist Episcopal class that was organized in Hendricks county was at
								the home of Robert Wilson, near the present Shiloh church, in the winter of 1828 and
								1829. Soon afterwards classes were established at North Salem, Danville,
								Stilesville, Wesley Chapel and near Lizton. At the first quarterly meeting for the
								White Lick circuit, held at Robert Wilson's on October 25, 1828, there were present
								John Strange, Joseph Tarkington, Peter Monicle, Robert Wilson and Wesley Monicle;
								Aaron Homan, Gideon Wilson and Elisha Kise were appointed a committee to make an
								estimate of the amount necessary to build a meeting house near Robert Wilson's.
								Early the next season plans were made and the house constructed, and it was the
								first Methodist meeting house in the county. There was not much money available at
								that time and the sums given by the different classes would seem pitifully small
								today, but they were given with a generous spirit and undoubtedly went much farther
								than they would now.</p>

							<p>At the quarterly conference held in Danville, August 4, 1838, it was ordered that
								P. S. Dickens, Daniel McCreary, Hezekiah Smith, Asa Beck and Elijah M. Crawford be
								appointed a committee to divide the Danville circuit into two separate circuits;
								also at the same time it was ordered that S. B. Caywood, R. C. Russell and H. Rammel
								be appointed a committee to form an estimate of the probable cost of building a
								church in Danville. At a subsequent conference William Henton, R. C. Russell,
								William C. Cline, James Logan and Samuel Brenton were elected trustees for the
								Danville church, which was erected in 1840 on the same lot upon which is located the
								present church. This church was occupied for public worship until 1865, when it was
								converted into a parsonage and the chapel of the Danville Academy was fitted up and
								used for church purposes.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">THE DANVILLE ACADEMY.</hi></head>

							<p>Before this time the church society in the town of Danville had taken the lead in
								educational matters by organizing and building up the Danville Academy, which was
								operated under the management of the quarterly conference. This enterprise commenced
								in 1858 and lasted until 1868. Among the prominent educators who, at different
								times, had charge of this school were Professors Tarr, Lummis, O. H. Smith, J. L.
								Rippetoe and James Scull. About eighteen thousand dollars were spent by the
								Methodists of Danville in this undertaking. In the spring of 1878, twenty years
								after the beginning, the society transferred, for a small sum, all of the school
								property to the Central Normal College.</p>

							<p>In that year the present Methodist church was begun in Danville and finished at a
								cost of ten thousand dollars. It was dedicated on the 26th of January, 1879. Milton
								Henton, Moses Keeney, Bloomfield White, B. N. Beale and N. T. Hadley were trustees
								during the erection of the present church building.</p>

							<p>Danville was organized into a station in 1853. Before that among the preachers who
								had preached in the circuit were J. Tarkington, Joseph White. Asa Beck, Israel
								Lewis, D. F. Streight, Hezekiah Smith, Frank Richmond, J. B. Demotte. After that
								came C. S. Burgner, N. L. Brakeman, Samuel Godfrey, Allen Gurney, George Warner,
								Luther Taylor, D. F. Barnes, T. C. Workman, F. Taylor, Nelson Green, Thomas S. Webb,
								Francis M. Pavey, Samuel P. Colvin, George W. Bower, James H. Claypool, Joseph C.
								Reed, R. D. Utter, J. H. Hull.</p>

							<p>The first Sunday school organized by the Methodists in Danville was opened in the
								old brick school house located on lot 1, block 23, with Henry Rammel as leader.
								After this organization had continued for one year it disbanded and then there was a
								union Sunday school, with John Baker as superintendent. This school met in the old
								Presbyterian church on lot 1, block 15. This continued for one year, when the
								Methodists withdrew and, as a society, were interested in no school until 1840. At
								this date they organized again into a Sunday school with John Green as
								superintendent. The school lived two years. At a political meeting in the old court
								house on Saturday night, in the latter part of October, 1844, there happened to be
								in attendance Hezekiah S. McCormick, Milton Henriton and William V. Bishop. In a
								conversation held at that time they resolved that a Methodist Sunday school should
								be started the next day week. Notice was accordingly given <pb id="VAC1000-138"
									n="138"/> and on the set date the school started with a membership of fifty. The
								Sunday school is still in existence and has an excellent membership.</p>

							<p>The Methodist Episcopal church, at Stilesville, has been organized about
								seventy-five years. Services were held for many years in the old school house and in
								1850 the society built a new church which cost them about sixteen hundred dollars.
								Among the early members were Isaac Smart, William Cline, John Clark, John
								Richardson, James Borders, Joseph Bishop, Edward Jackson, Elijah McAnich and their
								wives. Some of the early ministers were James Williams, Joseph Woods, J. F.
								Woodruff, Silas Gaskin, Bridges, Miles, Woods, W. W. Pewett, William Ginnis, Asa
								Beck and J. V. R. Miller. The present church at Stilesville is in charge of Rev.
								Ramsay. A brick church was built in the nineties, costing three thousand dollars.
								There is a good membership of over a hundred.</p>

							<p>The Methodist Episcopal church at Cartersburg was formed in the winter of 1856-7 by
								Rev. Jesse Woodward, with John Biddle, William Little, Richard Poe and their wives,
								Mrs. Brady and others as the first members. Their first house of worship was built
								in 1857 at a cost of seven hundred and fifty dollars. It was of frame and located in
								the northwest part of the village. A brick church was erected in 1897. Rev. Eckhart
								is the present pastor, having charge of a congregation of one hundred people.</p>

							<p>The Methodist Episcopal church at Coatesville was organized in the thirties. Their
								first house of worship was destroyed by fire about 1860 and a new one was built the
								same year at a cost of two thousand dollars. Revs. J. B. Combs, Jesse Hill, D. W.
								Risher, Nelson Green, John McDaniel, W. D. Davidson, B. H. Bradbury, E. Mason were a
								few of the earlier pastors. Rev. Smock is in charge at present. The church has a
								substantial house of worship and the membership is about eighty-five.</p>

							<p>The Methodist Episcopal church at Plainfield has been an organization nearly
								seventy years. Among the early members of this church were O. H. Dennis, Riley
								Taylor and wife, Alexander Worth (founder of the society) and wife, William Owens,
								Sebastian Hiss, Fred Trucks and Mrs. Higgins. Revs. Dunlavy, Switzer, Green,
								Johnson, Beard and Siddell were among the early pastors of the Plainfield church.
								Rev. Williams is the present pastor. There are about one hundred and fifty
								members.</p>

							<p>The Methodist Episcopal church at Brownsburg was the second to be organized in the
								town. Some of the early pastors were I. P. Patch, T. M. Webb and John B. Demott.
								Rev. Weidman is the pastor in charge at this date, and has succeeded in maintaining
								the high standard of the church. There is a good membership and a new brick house of
								worship.</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-139" n="139"/>

							<p>The Methodist Episcopal church at Amo was organized in the year 1867. The first
								church house was completed in that same year at a cost of two thousand dollars.
								Among the first members were William H. Tush, Winfield Hines, John McAninch, Wesley
								Johnson, M. W. Cosner, John M. Champion, Herbert Fencer, John Gaspar, S. F. Tincher,
								James E. Ralston, with their wives, Mrs. Lucinda Stanley and Mrs. Nancy Newman. The

								Davidson, Nelson Green, B. W. Risher, Nelson Green, Jesse Hill, J. B. Combs, Elihu
								Mason, Rev. Smock is the present pastor of the Amo church. The church has a good
								membership and is prosperous.</p>

							<p>The first house of worship in Pittsboro was erected in 1836 by the Methodist
								Episcopal society. Simon T. Hadley offered to donate lot 2, block 2, to any
								congregation which would build a church. Arch and John Alexander, William Tincher,
								Nathaniel Helton and their families were the charter members. The elder Alexander
								sawed lumber in his water mill on his farm below town, and a house was built a short
								distance west of the present building. Rev. Enoch Wood was the first minister. Park
								Poynter and Nathaniel Gossett were its local preachers for years.</p>

							<p>The Methodist Episcopal church at the town of North Salem was organized over eighty
								years age. Reuben Claypool was a Methodist minister and preached to his neighbors in
								their private cabins from the earliest date, and about 1833 a class was formed.
								Among the prominent early members were John S. and Charity Woodward, John Claypool,
								wife and children, Chester and Martha Page, Mrs. Jerusha Covey, and William and
								Eleanor Jones and family. A church was built by the society before the war, costing
								twelve hundred dollars. J. L. Smith, T. F. Drake, W. Fletcher Clark, David Hadley
								and D. P. McLain were among the early ministers. The church is now in good
								condition, with a membership of one hundred and fifty.</p>

							<p>Before any church organization existed, in Washington township, the Methodists held
								religious services regularly at the home of John and Dorcas Gossett. Then a class of
								ten or twelve charter members was organized, a yearly camp meeting was established
								on the land of Seth Hurin, one-fourth mile west of present Avon. In 1842 a frame
								church was erected just south of the camp ground. The labor on this building was
								almost entirely performed by the membership. Rev. Joseph Marsee was pastor as well
								as one of the chief carpenters, and each day at the noon hour he preached a short
								sermon to the men and to their wives who came bringing them dinner. In 1875 a second
								church was built on this same lot and was dedicated October <pb id="VAC1000-140"
									n="140"/> 10th. This building, thirty-two by forty-six feet in size, cost complete
								six-teen hundred dollars. T. C. Webster was pastor during the building. The building
								was still in good condition when the grade for the traction line was made in the
								winter of 1903, and it was found that the church was so cut off from the road by the
								grade that the building must be moved or a new one erected. The latter course was
								chosen. The entire membership, and members of other churches, as well as those with
								no church relation, contributed generously. The building was completed at a total
								cost of five thousand dollars, and, on October 2, 1904, was dedicated, without a
								cent of debt and without a collection. Rev. H. C. Riley was pastor during the time
								of building. The size of the building is forty-two feet in the extreme, with a
								square tower, with entrance through its vestibule to both the main and Sunday school
								rooms. The building is of Poston paving brick, rock faced, and with stone trimming,
								and is a neat and substantial structure. In addition to this church there are in the
								township two other Methodist churches, Shiloh, three miles east, and Bartlett's,
								three miles west.</p>

							<p>The Methodist Episcopal society dates from 1833 in Union township. At this date a
								class was formed at the house of William Montgomery, who was leader. Among the early
								members were Mr. Plummer, Sally Bargan, Claiborne Davis and John Pritchett. The
								church building was located one half mile south of Lizton.</p>

							<p>The first church organized in Washington township was at the house of Robert Wilson
								in 1823. This is now the Shiloh church. It was the first Methodist Episcopal church
								organization in the county and the fourth one of any denomination. There were
								afterwards three other churches in the township of the Methodist Episcopal faith,
								namely: Shiloh, Wesley and Bartlett's Chapel. Regular Baptist churches were located
								at Abner's creek and Salem.</p>

							<p>The African Methodist Episcopal church at Plainfield was organized about forty-five
								years ago. It met for a long time at the Morgan school house, two and a half miles
								from Plainfield, and in 1879 commenced holding its services in the village. The
								church erected in that year cost about six hundred dollars.</p>

								and Asa S. White, elders; Wesley Bell and James Odell, deacons. The organization was
								effected at the home of Asa S. White and for years afterwards the society met to
								worship in private homes and in the old court house. In the year of 1852 the
								congregation was sufficiently large to build a frame church, in which it worshipped
								for more than twenty years. The church had no resident ministry for many years, but
								was periodically visited by such men as L. H. Jameson, Thomas Lockhart, N. Waters,
								William Jarrett, John O'Kane, O. P. Badger, A. I. Hobbs and others. After the Civil
								War William R. Jewell settled with them as the regular and only pastor. He was
								followed by U. C. Brewer, W.. H. Blanks, W. S. Tingley, George G. Peale, Ira J.
								Chase, A. J. Frank, S. O. Conner, A. L. Orcut, A. L. Conner, U. G. Martin, E. E.
								Daugherty, E. E. Moorman, Charles Goodnight, A. Leech and the present pastor, W. E.
								Anderson.</p>

							<p>A handsome brick house of worship was erected in 1874 at a cost of sixteen thousand
								dollars. It has, however, recently been demolished and a more pretentious building
								is now in process of construction on the same spot on greatly enlarged grounds at a
								cost of fifty thousand dollars. The new structure was induced by the munificent gift
								of thirty-five thousand dollars, by Edgar E. Shirley, as a memorial to his father
								and mother. The new building will be institutional in character. It will embrace not
								only an auditorium for worship, but an assembly room for the Sunday school, divers
								class rooms, a kitchen, a banqueting hall and a gymnasium. The latter will be
								equipped with appliances for all modern physical exercises, such as swings, bars,
								in-door ball games, etc. It will be supplied with about one hundred lockers,
								lavatories, etc., and will be set apart on certain evenings of the week for the use
								of the girls and certain evenings for the boys of the town, without reference to
								church affiliations. A governor or governess to attend each open evening.</p>

							<p>The church membership, at the time of organization in 1840, numbered thirty. In
								1884 it had increased to two hundred and sixty and now has an enrollment of four
								hundred and four.</p>

							<p>The Sunday school was organized in 1852, Moses Cavitt being the first
								superintendent. The present average attendance is two hundred and twenty and James
								P. Snodgrass is the superintendent. The church has also been efficient in religious
								and social activities usual to church work. The Christian church, at Clayton, was
								organized December 7, 1863, by Rev. Thomas Lockhart and O. P. Badger. Samuel B. Hall
								and John R. Ballard <pb id="VAC1000-142" n="142"/> were chosen as the first elders
								and George Acton and James Ferguson, deacons. The charter members were sixty-three
								in number. The church built in 1865 cost over twenty-six hundred dollars. Among the
								early pastors were Thomas Lockhart, O. P. Badger, Jameson, Sherman, Canfield,
								Miller, Jewell, Frank and Brewer. Rev. Scofield is the present pastor and the
								membership is one hundred and twenty-five.</p>

							<p>The Christian church at Stilesville was organized and their first house of worship
								erected in 1842. This building was of frame and cost one thousand dollars. Among the
								first members were Daniel Osborne, John W. Bryant, John R. Robards, George W.
								Snoddy, James Snoddy and their families. After using their first church over thirty
								years, a brick edifice was erected, costing twenty-five hundred dollars. George W.
								Snoddy was a preacher in this church over forty years, dying in April, 1882. A. J.
								Frank, of Greencastle, took charge after his death, then A. M. Connor, Gilchrist.
								Rev. Beard is the present pastor. The membership numbers seventy-five.</p>

							<p>The Christian church at Plainfield was organized in March, 1830, with the following
								as the first members: David Cox and wife, John Hadley, Jonathan Hadley, David
								Carter, Ezekiel Hornaday, Hiram Hornaday, Hiram Green, Abijah Cox, with their wives,
								and Alexander Shover, seventeen in all. They soon built a hewed-log church and in
								that primitive structure, half a mile north of the present site of Plainfield, they
								worshipped for five or six years. They then erected a frame church in the village,
								using the same for twenty years, when it was succeeded by a brick structure, built
								on the site of the frame, at a cost of three thousand dollars. Among the first
								ministers were Revs. Michael and Job Combs, Lewis Comer, John Secrest, Oatman, and
								John O'Kane. Rev. Shields is now in charge. There are two hundred members
								enrolled.</p>

							<p>The Christian church at Pittsboro was organized February 25, 1854. A church was
								built in the same year at a cost of two thousand dollars. It was later used as a
								residence. This first church was located on ground now owned by the Pierson sisters.
								It was erected by James Cundiff, an uncle of Mrs. E. W. Sawyer. This membership was
								organized by the venerable Thomas Lockhart. He ministered to the spiritual needs of
								this congregation for years and was succeeded by Elders Luke Warren and James
								Canfield. Its charter members were from the families of the Wells, Parkers and
								Hills, who were before that members at Brownsburg. This house served for the triple
								purpose of sanctuary, school and dwelling until 1889, when it was purchased and
								razed by Douglas Baker and the site occupied with a dwelling. <pb id="VAC1000-143"
									n="143"/> The second church was built in 1873. It has since been remodeled and
								made more modern. Frank Sumner is the present pastor. The membership is one hundred
								and ninety.</p>

							<p>The Christian church at North Salem was organized in 1837, with Charles Fleece and
								Thompson Farmer as elders. O. P. Badger, D. Collins, W. B. F. Treat, A. J. Frank,
								William Holt and A. Plunkett were among the early pastors. In recent years this
								church divided over a controversy in regard to an organ and now there are two
								Christian churches in Salem. Rev. H. E. Kelsey is in charge of the larger and the
								smaller obtains supply.</p>

							<p>The Christian church, in Brownsburg, is the oldest in that town and the second to
								be organized in the township of Lincoln. It was organized in 1835 by Thomas
								Lockhart, with seventeen members. John L. Parker and V. Cress were the elders. The
								society constructed a brick church in 1859, at a cost of fifteen hundred dollars.
								Rev. William L. Newlin is the pastor now. The church has a strong membership.</p>

							<p>In Union township the first preaching was done by Gilbert Harney, of the Christian
								denomination. In 1837 Gilbert Harney organized at the house of Archibald Alexander,
								a church, with Mr. Alexander, Joseph P. Lewis, Samuel C. Carrington and their wives,
								with a few others, as members. A church was built about 1875 and has been prosperous
								since.</p>

							<p>In Middle township the Christian church was the first to be organized. The Baptist

							<head><hi rend="center sc">PRESBYTERIAN SOCIETIES.</hi></head>

							<p>The Presbyterian church at Danville was organized in 1832. Among the leading early
								members were Daniel McAuley and wife, Jacob K. Moore and wife, Alexander Morris and
								family, Henry G. Todd, Samuel King and Eliza McPheeters. Among the pastors who have
								served this congregation have been Revs. Samuel G. Lowry, Hill, Moody, Chase,
								Theophilus Lowry, Henry Hammer, Samuel Wishard, Henry L. Dickerson, G. D. Parker, N.
								S. Dickey.</p>

							<p>The first house of worship was erected on the corner lot north of the present
								standpipe. It was frame, substantially built, the sleepers of whole logs, slightly
								flattened on one side, on which rested the floor. This building was used for public
								worship on the Sabbath and a subscription school was taught by the old-time
								pedagogues during the week. Some of the charter members of the congregation walked
								to church from what is now a part of the "Abe Eastes farm," a distance of nearly
								four miles, and had to cross the <pb id="VAC1000-144" n="144"/> creek northeast of
								town on a foot log. Henry Ward Beecher attended and preached here during meetings of
								the presbytery. It is reported that a Sabbath school was conducted at which "Uncle
								George Rich" led the singing with a violin.</p>

							<p>At the building of the next church, now the Knights of Pythias hall, about 1850,
								the old building was purchased by George Wayland, who put in a ceiling and converted
								it into a carpenter shop and later into a residence, and as such it served until
								leveled in 1891, when the heavy timbers made fuel for a family for more than two
								years. The new church was not fully completed and dedicated until December 29, 1858,
								when Amos Jones, one of the early ministers, came and assisted in the dedication.
								Rev. H. L. Dickerson came in the spring of 1858. Ministers who had previously served
								the church were Revs. Cole, Post and Lee. Rev. Dickerson came direct from Lane
								Seminary, with his bride, who had been a teacher in a female seminary on Walnut
								Hills, and they at once began to plan better things for this church. He resigned
								after twenty years of faithful service. During the pastorate of Rev. Dickerson he
								had organized White Lick church. During his absence the pulpit was supplied by Dr.
								Fisk, of Greencastle, and Rev. R. B. Herron On June 1, 1877, Rev. Dickerson returned
								and again took up the work here and at White Lick, but deaths and removals had so
								depleted the membership that it was found impossible to sustain a regular pastor, so
								Rev. Dickerson removed to Indianapolis, from which point he supplied vacant churches
								in every direction from that city.</p>

							<p>On July 30, 1882, the Danville congregation decided to organize as a Cumberland
								Presbyterian church, with a large majority of the working members as charter members
								of the new organization. Among them were J. O. Wishard and wife, Isaac Piersol and
								wife, W. T. Lawson and wife, James Reed and wife, Asa Martin and wife, Charles R.
								Rose, Emma Piersol Barnett, Mary E. Warner, Elizabeth Scearce, Mary Cooper, J. B.
								Harlan, Ruth Cash and Ella Nave, together with Charles Hadley and wife, Stanley Hall
								and wife, Asa Black and wife, and Lawrence Vannice, who had removed to this vicinity
								from the New Winchester and Groveland Cumberland congregations. This new
								organization proceeded to erect a new building, in which they now worship. Work on
								the church was begun in the spring of 1884 and completed in November of the same
								year and dedicated November 30th. It cost sixty-two hundred dollars.</p>

							<p>In April, 1883, the Indianapolis presbytery, on petition of the members of the old
								church who did not see fit to go into the Cumberland organization, <pb
									id="VAC1000-145" n="145"/> reorganized the church, with Henry G. Todd, Robert R.
								Downard and Isaac R. Lawson as elders, and Marshall Todd and Frank J. Christie,
								deacons. Dr. H. G. Todd was afterward elected clerk of the session. Rev. G. D.
								Parker was secured as a supply until February, 1885, when Rev. N. S. Dickey came and
								labored faithfully, but the field was small and the church grew weaker until, in
								April, 1890, by resolution of presbytery, the church was dissolved at the request of
								the home mission committee.</p>

							<p>On May 25, 1906, the reunion of the Cumberland Presbyterian and the Presbyterian
								churches of the United States was consummated at Decatur, Illinois, and is now known
								as the Presbyterian church of the United States of America. The Danville church, by
								a vote, concurred in this action of the general assembly.</p>

							<p>This church has had as pastors and supplies Revs. Witherspoon, Whatley, Penick,
								Halsell, Hudgins, Rogers, McKnight, Prather, Yokely, Mahr, Danley, Giuchard,
								Christensen and W. H. Gray.</p>

							<p>In the early thirties the Cumberland Presbyterians of Liberty township were
								perfected into an organization by Rev. Alexander C. Downey at Belleville. They, in
								common with other religious organizations in our early days, had no stated house of
								worship, but met from house to house or held services in some school house, mostly,
								however, in what was known as the Mitchell school house, situated on the west side
								of the road leading south from Clayton and at the short bend just south of the
								national road.</p>

							<p>The minutes of the sessions having become lost, Wabash presbytery authorized the
								elders to procure a new book and enter therein the names of such members as were
								known to be in good standing. This was accomplished in January, 1841, when
								thirty-eight names were enrolled. Of these, Samuel Little, of Plainfield, now
								nearing the ninety-second anniversary of his birth, was a charter member and his
								niece, Rebecca Harden, of Indianapolis, some eighty years of age, are the only ones
								known to be among the living.</p>

							<p>In 1851, upon a lot donated by Richard Worrell, and a short distance south of the
								present location, was erected a house for worship. The contractor was Ferdinand
								Hopwood, who was assisted by D. N. Hopwood, Frank W. Beckwith, William A. Ragan and
								Moses Kebner.</p>

							<p>Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Ragan were the first to be received into membership in the
								Clayton church. This was on March 27, 1853.</p>

							<p>The first Christmas tree in Clayton was held in this church on Christmas eve, 1866.
								In 1869 the first church organ was purchased by Taylor Wills, who acted as organist
								for eight years.</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-146" n="146"/>

							<p>In 1872, not liking the location, a lot was bought of Joseph L. Rhoades and Messrs.
								Dr. C. T. Lawrence, Henry Lincoln and William A. Ragan were appointed a committee to
								remove the church and refit it for use. This building having been occupied something
								over half a century as place for worship and also showing the marks of time, in May,
								1901, it was decided that a more suitable location and a building adequate for the
								needs of the times were absolutely necessary, The church appointed Messrs. Columbus
								F. Edmondson, Thomas Edmondson and Howard Mitchell, who performed their duties by
								selecting a site more centrally located and erecting thereon a building forty-nine
								by fifty-eight from out to out, having an auditorium and two Sunday school rooms,
								all of which may be easily thrown together as occasion demands. The seating capacity
								is about four hundred and may be increased to five hundred by crowding. The building
								is heated by a hot air furnace, lighted by a gasoline plant and seated with chairs.
								A new three-hundred-dollar vocalion organ was secured. The cost of the location,
								building and furnishings footed up about five thousand dollars. Samuel Little,
								before mentioned, is supposed to be the oldest living elder, having been ordained in
								1832.</p>

							<p>W. A. Ragan was Sunday school superintendent for over thirty years. For twenty
								years John Cornett led in the singing and Amos S. Wills was secretary of the Sunday
								school.</p>

							<p>Much of the credit for the structure was due to the untiring zeal of the pastor,
								Rev. Elmer J. Bouher.</p>

							<p>The following pastors have been in charge here at various times: Alexander Downey,
								Samuel C. Mitchell, James Ritchey, Joseph Hannah, W. T. Ferguson, D. D., Elam
								McCord, H. D. Onyett, D. D., A. Randolph, W. D. Hawkins, B. F. Ivy, L. P.
								Witherspoon, A. H. Whatley, Thomas Penick, J. P. Halsell, Charles Wilson, J. L.
								Hudgins, J. L. McKnight, Josephus Latham, A. T. Carr, Elmer J. Bouher, and Rev.
								Frank, the present incumbent.</p>

							<p>The Presbyterian church at Brownsburg was organized by George Long in 1865. He
								raised the sum of twenty-three hundred dollars to be used for the construction of a
								church building. Revs. Beach, McKee, Mayo and H. L. Dickerson were a few of the
								first to occupy the pulpit. Rev. Beeson is the present pastor. The church has a
								membership of one hundred and is prosperous.</p>

							<p>The Regular Baptist church at Danville was organized in the year 1823, having the
								distinction of being the first religious organization in the county and also of
								having been organized before the county. Some of the early members were William
								Faught and wife, Thomas Flathers and wife, Joel Jelf and L. T. Pounds. Elder J. W.
								Thomas preached for some time prior to the year 1836. Elders William Hardin and
								Thomas Hooten each served for a number of years. The latter's back was broken by a
								falling shed and he died a year after the accident. Elder Erasmus D. Thomas
								commenced his labors here before the war.</p>

							<p>The church has had three houses of worship. The first, a log structure, was used
								until 1852, when a new frame building was constructed. This house was used until
								1903, when the present building was built. The regular services of the church are
								held monthly on the second Saturday and Sunday following in each month. Elder E. W.
								Thomas, the son of Erasmus D. Thomas, has served the church continuously.</p>

							<p>The Missionary Baptist church was organized November 9, 1850, by members from the
								Belleville church. Prominent in this movement were Moses Cavett and wife, Rufus
								Tharpe, Richard Christie and David Downs. A house of worship was built, which cost
								about twelve hundred dollars. The money for this building was raised chiefly through
								the efforts of the wife of the first pastor. This church society is now discontinued
								in the town of Danville.</p>

							<p>The Baptist church at Cartersburg was constituted March 21, 1864, with Rev. R. M.

									n="148"/> William Pope, with the following members: Thomas Hinton and wife, James
								Thompson and wife and Chris. Pope. This little band met at the house of Elder Pope
								for several years and in 1831 built a church at Belleville, a frame building. After
								a number of years the church was divided, a portion going to Clayton and organizing
								the Missionary Baptist church. Many of the first members having died, the Belleville
								church went down, and finally became defunct and the church building torn down. This
								church was moved to Pittsboro in 1887. Elder E. A. Williams has been preacher for
								several years. The membership is about fifty.</p>

							<p>The Baptist church at North Salem was organized before the Civil War and a building
								erected during the war at a cost of one thousand dollars. Among the first members

								Thomas, Susan and George Barber, John N. and Mary V. Clemens and Eaton Bales. Rev.
								Fuson is the present pastor.</p>

							<p>The Baptist church at Amo was organized near the time of the opening of the Civil
								War in 1861. A year or two after the organization a frame church was constructed,
								costing two thousand dollars. Among the early members were Elijah Wheeler, Harding
								Tincher, Milton Bland, Hiram Bland, Samuel Hubbard, and their wives. The first

							<p>The Missionary Baptist church at Clayton was founded March 11, 1854, by John
								Vawter, Jacob Rynearson, M. Elliott, Davis Boswell and Moses Crawford, who held
								letters of dismissal from the Belleville church, and a number of others, fifty-eight
								in all. The first trustees elected were Richard Worrell, Francis Edmondson and John

								time the society purchased the church which had been occupied by the Friends and
								used the same for a number of years. In August, 1884, they dedicated a fine brick
								church, which cost about three thousand dollars. Rev. Bell is the pastor today.</p>

							<p>The Regular Baptist church was the first to be organized in Middle township. The
								Spicklemires, Keeneys and Newman families were among the charter members. Their
								church building was erected on grounds now comprising the old White Lick cemetery
								east of Pittsboro, about the year 1837. The earliest preachers were Harrison
								Darnell, Thomas Hooten, William Hardie and Peter Keeney. Its membership increased
								with succeeding years until it was one of the strongest associations in the
								county.</p>

							<p>The first church organization in Eel River township was that of the Regular
								Baptists, which was organized at Round Town by the Penningtons and others, at an
								unknown date.</p>

							<p>William Pope, a Baptist minister, did the first preaching and organized the first
								Baptist church in Hendricks county, in his own house, in the autumn of 1823.</p>

							<p>The Center Valley Baptists have a church building, dedicated in October, 1906.</p>

							<p>The Western yearly meeting of Friends was organized in September, 1858, the first
								members being Eleazer Bales, Charles Moore, Matthew Stanley and Robert W. Hodson,
								with their families. At the time of the organization the large new building could
								not accommodate the crowd. Barnabas C. Hobbs, of Bloomingdale, Indiana, was the
								first presiding clerk and Shiles Moore, of Plainfield, the first treasurer. The
								women members organized a separate meeting, with Drusilla Wilson, of Indianapolis,
								the first clerk. Separate sessions of the men and women were continued until 1893,
								since which time the whole body has met together. The yearly meeting has enjoyed
								nearly a half century of prosperity. She experienced one schism in 1877, but
								fortunately this was scarcely felt in any of its limits except Plainfield.</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-150" n="150"/>

							<p>On March 28, 1913, the splendid church building of the Friends yearly meeting
								burned. Experts came to contract for the building of a new structure and upon
								examining the walls of the old church, found that they were eighteen inches thick
								and sunk ten feet to hard-pan. This wall could not be duplicated without great cost,
								so the new structure was built upon the foundations of the old. It was opened on
								March 8, 1914, having cost nearly seventeen thousand dollars. One-third of the
								building is for the local society and the rest for the yearly meeting. The local
								society has a membership of five hundred. E. J. Carter is pastor. The Western yearly
								meeting is composed of one hundred and ten churches and the meeting is held on the
								Tuesday before the third Sunday in September.</p>

							<p>The Friends church at the town of Amo was organized about the year of 1840. A log
								church was constructed as the first house of worship, but this was quickly succeeded
								by a frame structure, which was used for forty years and then gave way to the new
								structure, which was completed in the fall of 1883, at a cost of fifteen hundred
								dollars. Among the early members of this society were Philip Johnson, John Cosner,
								Annuel Edwards and Asael Hunt.</p>

							<p>The Friends church in Danville was organized in the year 1874 with about forty
								charter members, among them Henry and B. F. Howell, Wyatt Osborn, William F.
								Hamrick, William Cox, John Warnock, John McPheters and their wives, Mrs. J. W. Estep
								and E. L. Smith. Within a year steps were taken toward building a church, which was
								completed in 1876 at a cost of four thousand dollars, located on the corner of Cross
								and South streets. There were but few resident members of the church when the first
								effort was made to enter this field. John K. Howell, Anna Mills and William S.
								Wooton were the first ministers in the early organization of this church. John Henry
								Douglas dedicated the house of worship; David and Sarah Hadley were the first
								pastors, being in charge at the time the church building was erected. The parsonage
								was built in 1885. Since the organization of the church evangelistic services of
								more than passing interest have been held by John Henry Douglas, Nathan and Esther
								Frame, George Willis and Mary Moon. The following persons have been pastors of the
								church: William S. Wooton, Caleb Johnson, Mahlon Perry, Abbie Trueblood, Orvil
								Jones, Howard Brown, Thomas Brown, Robert Pretlow, Sarah M. Hadley, Hannah Pratt
								Jessup, Zeno Doane, Fred Smith, David Hadley, Willis Bond. The church has never
								failed to sustain a regular means of grace, and has always maintained a good Sunday
								school. The present membership is considerably over one hundred.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">CATHOLIC CHURCH.</hi></head>

							<p>St. Malachy's Catholic church at Brownsburg is first written upon the records under
								the date of August 26, 1867, and this was made by Rev. D. J. McMullen, through whose
								efforts the church building was constructed. Very Rev. Aug. Bessonies was there
								February 20, 1869, and the first resident priest began his work there on October 2d
								of that same year. He was succeeded after a time by Rev. Dennis O'Donavan. The
								latter served some years at this point and then exchanged with Rev. Thomas Logan, of
								Greencastle, where he remained a year or two. Returning in 1877, he found the parish
								in debt for certain improvements made by Father Logan and O'Donavan denied the
								validity of the debt. Bishop Chatard took the opposite view and to secure the
								creditors gave a mortgage on the church property. Father O'Donovan contested the
								right of the Bishop to do this and the court decided for the latter. The Bishop then
								asked and obtained from the supreme court a writ of ejectment against the priest,
								who also lost a subsequent suit for fifty thousand dollars damages for loss of
								employment, etc. During these troubles mass was regularly held at private houses or
								in a rented hall by Revs. Patrick Shepherd, Casper Seiler, Charles Curran and E. J.
								Spelman. The first church was built in 1900, at a cost of twenty-five hundred
								dollars. The fine new structure recently completed has cost thirteen thousand
								dollars. Father John A. Walsh is the pastor and the congregation numbers eighty

							<head><hi rend="center sc">THE FIRST CIRCUIT COURT.</hi></head>

							<p>At the house of William Ballard, on October 25, 1824, was held the first term of
								the circuit court. Then the county was in the fifth judicial circuit. The presiding
								judge was William W. Wick, commissioned by Jonathan Jennings on January 2, 1822. The
								associate judges at the same time were Nathan Kirk and James Downard, whose
								commissions were-issued by Governor William Hendricks on July 26, 1824. Levi Jessup
								was clerk of the court.</p>

							<p>The men who acted as grand jurors this first session were Thomas R. Ballard,
								foreman, Daniel B. Tryer, Jesse Kellum, Pollard Baldwin, John Hawkins, David Demoss,
								Noah Bateman, John Fowler, John Ballard, James Thompson, Abijah Bray, Adin Ballard,
								Moses Alderson, Thomas Gilbert, David Ross and Samuel Jones. Jonathan Jessup was
								selected to attend to the grand jury. Hervey Gregg was the prosecuting attorney.</p>

							<p>In this session of court Calvin Fletcher, Gabriel Jones, Mr. Johnson and Daniel B.
								Wick were admitted to the bar. On the following day Craven P. Heister was also
								admitted to practice as an attorney.</p>

							<p>On this day the first case came up for trial. It was that of Joshua W. Redman vs.
								Benjamin Benson, for debt. This case was continued. James Brown vs. William H.
								Henton was then called and tried. This closed the October term, the next beginning
								in the following April.</p>

							<p>On April 25th the first case was tried before a jury, being the case of Brown vs.
								Hinton, for debt. The men who composed the jury were James McClure, Abijah Pinson,
								Ezekiel Hornaday, John Leaman, John W. Bryant, James Dunn, Samuel Woodward, Stephen
								Cook, Thomas Lockhart, David Demoss, David Ballard and Robert Cooper. The result of
								the trial was a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for thirty dollars.</p>

							<p>So ran the trials for a number of years after the establishment of the court. The
								first really important case was in February, 1827, against Samuel <pb
									id="VAC1000-153" n="153"/> K. Barlow for killing George Matlock-charged with
								manslaughter. He was tried in August and sentenced to one year in the penitentiary,

							<head><hi rend="center sc">THE BAR.</hi></head>

							<p>James M. Gregg was one of the first active attorneys in Hendricks county. He was
								born in 1806 in Patrick county, Virginia, and came to Hendricks in 1830. After being
								employed as dry goods clerk by James J. Given in Danville for a season, he became a
								deputy in the county clerk's office. In 1834 he was made county surveyor, and was
								later elected to the office of county clerk. At the close of his term of office as
								clerk he began the practice of law which he followed exclusively until his death
								with good success. He served one term in Congress, also one in the Legislature, and
								died in June, 1860.</p>

							<p>Simon T. Hadley was another of the early attorneys in the county. He was born in
								North Carolina in 1801, taught school for a time, and in 1826 came to Hendricks
								county and settled in Danville. He filled the offices of clerk and recorder in this
								county, serving as both for seven years and as recorder alone for twenty-two years.
								He was president of the First National Bank in Danville for many years. Mr. Hadley
								never studied law as a profession, his practice being confined almost exclusively to
								probate matters, conveyancing and the writing of contracts. He was so reasonable in
								his charge, and possessed so fully the confidence of the people of the county that
								it was not at all infrequent for a citizen and his wife to drive over muddy roads in
								a two-horse wagon fifteen or twenty miles to get Uncle Simon to write a deed or
								other simple contract.</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-154" n="154"/>

							<p>Christian C. Nave was also among the first and also among the most prominent of the
								Hendricks county lawyers. He was born in eastern Tennessee in 1803. He was educated
								for the legal profession and in the fall of 1831, at the age of twenty-eight years,
								left his native state for Indiana on horseback and after some investigation and
								inspection, arrived and settled in Danville, December 17, 1831. He had traveled all
								the way from his eastern Tennessee home to Danville through the woods on horseback,
								and when he arrived his total belongings was his mount, a few articles of wearing
								apparel in his saddle bags, a copy of Blackstone's Commentaries, a pistol, and five
								dollars in money.</p>

							<p>Before he had permanently located himself in the county seat of Danville, he was
								called upon to defend, for a nominal fee, a citizen for the murder of his neighbor.
								It was Nave's opportunity and right well he recognized it. Being naturally of great
								energy and shrewdness, he at once set about the construction of a defense, in what
								was generally thought to be a desperate case, which resulted not only in his
								client's acquittal, but also in extending Mr. Nave's reputation as an able advocate
								throughout central Indiana and which served him well and brought him many good fees
								throughout his subsequent action and eventful career. He was the subject of many
								amusing anecdotes, never accused of wrong or unprofessional conduct. He led the
								Third Indiana Regiment into Mexico as colonel, was liberal and public spirited and
								died in Danville in 1884. He was unfaltering in the study and practice of his
								profession up to the hour of his death, in his eighty-second year, and in his last
								sickness had his daughter sit by his bedside and read to him all the current
								opinions of the supreme court as they appeared.</p>

							<p>Leander M. Campbell, a Kentuckian, was admitted to the Hendricks county bar in
								1854. He was an educated man, had been a previous school teacher. He had a
								remarkable memory and seemed always to have at hand, ready for immediate use, any
								legal principle or ruling that had ever before attracted his attention. His social
								qualities were of the very best and his acquaintance with the people of the county
								was so thorough that he used to say there was not a family living in the county for
								a period of five years that he could not tell its blood and marriage relations with
								all other families in the county.</p>

							<p>In making up of juries and in the examination of witnesses this thorough
								acquaintance with the people was a great advantage he had over his opponents in a
								trial.</p>

							<p>He was a forceful and lucid speaker, carrying always the air of sincerity <pb
									id="VAC1000-155" n="155"/> and always put forth his best endeavor to win his cases
								in the circuit court. He disliked the supreme court and seldom appealed a case--
								seldom had an occasion to appeal, for he was renowned as a "verdict getter." He
								enjoyed up to the time of his death, in 1890, a large and lucrative practice in
								central Indiana and in his prime was generally regarded as the Napoleon of the
								Hendricks county bar.</p>

							<p>Peter S. Kennedy, another Kentuckian, was contemporaneous with Mr. Campbell and was
								generally regarded as his yoke-fellow. He was a ripe lawyer, a good writer and
								really enjoyed presenting his argument to the supreme court better than to the
								circuit court or jury. In 1865 he moved with his family to Crawfordsville, where he
								spent the balance of his days.</p>

							<p>In 1866 there came to the Hendricks county bar Jesse S. Ogden, a Virginian, who,
								for brilliancy in letters, eloquence in speech and loveableness in social
								intercourse, never had a superior, and perhaps never an equal, at this bar. Mr.
								Ogden left his mountain home in 1858 to seek his fortune in the West. He arrived in
								Danville in November, impecunious, but full of ambition. His first job of work was
								to undertake, with a negro, to cut ten cords of wood for Levi Ritter for ten
								dollars. He entered the Danville Academy as janitor in 1859 and thus, in services,
								he paid his tuition for two school years and until August, 1861, when he left his
								school and enlisted in the Seventh Indiana Infantry. On the 22d of March, 1862, at
								the battle of Winchester, Virginia, he received a severe wound in the right hand-in
								fact, three of his fingers were literally carried away with a minie ball and thus he
								was disqualified for further army service. He returned to Danville, was elected
								recorder of the county and while serving in that capacity spent his idle hours in
								reading law. He subsequently attended law school at Indianapolis and was admitted to
								the bar in 1866 and took up the practice of law as his life work. He at once took
								high rank at the bar and was elected prosecuting attorney in 1870. He was a hard
								worker and a close thinker and seldom went before court or jury without having the
								merits of his case and the law well in hand and also his course of procedure and the
								points in his argument fully determined. His eloquence was not excelled in central
								Indiana. Its excellence consisted chiefly in its grace of delivery, sweet musical
								voice and superb selection of his words. He spoke with ease and energy, without
								being boisterous, and never put himself forward or overtaxed his audience. In 1869
								he formed a partnership for the practice of his profession, with his friend and
								comrade in the army, John V. Hadley, which partnership continued happily and
								profitably until Mr. Ogden's death, on February 20, 1897, in the thirty-eighth year
								of his age.</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-156" n="156"/>

							<p>Many other members of the local bar deserve special mention, but space forbids. The
								bar from the beginning has always maintained, for strength and character, a high
								place among the bars of the state. It has been uniformly composed of citizens of
								high character-enterprising, moral, debt paying, temperate, with a very rare
								exception and strictly honorable with the court and with each other professionally.
								It has always been held that a promise or statement of fact to an opposing attorney
								relative to a pending cause was as binding as an order of the court. Except in cases
								where opposing counsel desires the facts relied on in the record preparatory to an
								appeal, an affidavit for a continuance or other matter is unknown to the Danville
								bar. If delay is desired the counsel desiring appears before the court in the
								presence of his opponent and states his reasons for the request. The request is
								often resisted, but the facts as stated upon which it rests are never called in
								question. The effect is that the bar is always on the most friendly terms.</p>

							<p>Quite a number who had their early and first training at the Danville bar
								afterwards became eminent lawyers and jurists elsewhere. Solomon Blair, William
								Irvin, Joshua G. Adams and Newton M. Taylor were afterward elected to the bench in
								Indianapolis. Richard B. Blake was the first judge elected to the superior bench in
								the city of Spokane under the organization of the state of Washington and continued
								thereon for years and until he voluntarily resigned to take up in the city a general
								practice more lucrative. Enoch G. Hogate was called years ago to become dean of the
								law school of the State University where he still presides with great credit to
								himself and profit to the young men under his instructions.</p>

							<p>John V. Hadley was the first member of the local bar elected to the circuit bench,
								then composed of Marion and Hendricks counties. He was first elected in the fall of
								1886, re-elected in 1892, elected to the state supreme bench in 1898 and re-elected
								to the latter in 1904, and voluntarily retired therefrom January 2, 1911.</p>

							<p>Thomas J. Cofer, by appointment and election, occupied the local circuit bench from
								the fall of 1898 to the fall of 1906.</p>

							<p>James L. Clark was elected in 1906 to succeed Judge Cofer and in January, 1913, was
								appointed by the governor to the public utilities commission and is now serving
								thereon with much credit for fairness and commercial comprehension.</p>

							<p>George W. Brill was elected in 1912 to succeed Judge Clark and is now occupying the
								bench with ability and general satisfaction.</p>

							<p>The Hendricks County Bar Association is now composed of the following <pb

						<head><hi rend="center sc">EDUCATION.</hi></head>

						<p>The growth of education in Hendricks county has been very rapid. From the very
							beginning of the county until the present day the thought of education has been a
							predominate one. The first settler thought of the learning which should be imparted to
							his child and until the day of school houses, or the teacher who "boarded around," the
							child drew his letters at his mother's knee. Of the early schools and school houses
							there are many interesting things which have been written. The sturdy beech trees for
							the most part supplied the material from which the first school houses were
							constructed. The walls were built of the trunks, the puncheon floors, log seats and
							desks arranged around the wall were likewise split from the trunk of forest trees.
							Heat was forthcoming from a huge fireplace at one end of the cabin; windows were
							opened by sawing out sections of logs and placing in the opening a rude sash, with
							oiled paper in place of glass.</p>

						<p>The course of study provided by the stern pedagogue was nearly as crude as the house
							in which he taught. Geography, reading, spelling and arithmetic and writing were the
							standard subjects and whenever a pupil exhibited a dislike to them he was often helped
							over the difficulty by the beech rod, which reposed on two pegs above the master's
							desk. It is told that many of the early masters were possessed of very little more
							knowledge of their subjects than the pupils. Many a bright youngster came to grief
							because he took exceptions to assertions of his teacher.</p>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">FIRST SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTY.</hi></head>

							<p>In the summer of 1823 two school houses had been built, one of them in Liberty
								township, half a mile south of Cartersburg, and the other on Thomas Lockhart's land
								in Guilford township. William Hinton and Abijah Pinson were engaged as teachers. In
								1824 a school was taught in Danville by Wesley McKinley. The first school in Eel
								River township was taught about 1829 in a house a half mile southeast of North
								Salem, by William Dewitt. It was said this man had fled from New Orleans for some
								crime, joined a <pb id="VAC1000-159" n="159"/> pirate vessel, and with it sailed
								more than once around the world, finally leaving the vessel to seek a new life in
								the North. He was a man of intelligence and one of the best of the pioneer
								instructors. He died in North Salem, it is said, at the unusual age of one hundred
								and fifteen years. The first school in Franklin township was taught in 1831 by
								Judiah White, one mile south of Stilesville. The district consisted of two
								townships. Thomas Barker was successor to White in this school. He was a good
								teacher, but somewhat fond of "red-eye." Often, at noon recess, he would go to the
								village and return in an intoxicated condition and then would devote the afternoon
								to amusing the scholars by his antics. In 1831 Eli Lee taught the first school in
								Stilesville, in connection with his trade of shoemaker. Alfred Lineberry taught the
								first school in Middle township in 1835 on Samuel Hill's farm, for ten dollars per
								month.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA.</hi></head>

							<p>Much progress had been made in the schools of the county at the beginning of the
								seventies. Then was the beginning of definite organization. The log school house had
								long disappeared from the county. By the year 1884 there was even a vaster
								improvement. At this date there were 108 school buildings. 54 of these were brick
								and the rest of frame. There were 4,000 pupils in attendance at the brick schools,
								out of 7,082 in the county. There were 147 teachers, 85 of them male. The total
								school enrollment of this year was but 5,836. The total expenditures for school
								purposes in 1884. amounted to $94,303.86.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">THE COMMON SCHOOLS</hi></head>

							<p>The common schools were first provided for by the constitution of 1816. The
								Legislature of 1837 provided that land sold for taxes and escheated estates should
								be used for public school purposes. The law provided that any public school district
								might draw fifty dollars from such fund for the erection of a school house. This was
								for the encouragement of the common schools. In 1848 the people of a district could
								vote for or against a tax to maintain schools from three to six months. In 1850 a
								special tax was authorized. The greatest impetus given the common schools came from
								the constitution of 1851. "Knowledge and learning generally diffused throughout a
								community, being essential to the preservation of a free government, it shall be the
								duty of the General Assembly to encourage, by all equitable <pb id="VAC1000-160"
									n="160"/> means, moral, intellectual, scientific and agricultural improvement, and
								to provide, by law, for a general and uniform system of common schools, wherein
								tuition shall be without charge and equally open to all." Section 2 of article 8
								provides for the common school fund, the principal of which can never be
								reduced.</p>

							<p>In 1855 free schools were authorized in cities and towns. The grade schools and the
								high schools have grown up since 1873. The academies were converted into public
								schools and high schools in most cases.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">TEACHERS' INSTITUTES.</hi></head>

							<p>The county institute was established in the year 1865. In 1901 the act of 1865 was
								amended so that if twenty-five teachers were in attendance, thirty-five dollars
								could be drawn from the county treasury; if forty were in attendance, fifty dollars;
								if seventy-five, one hundred dollars. In 1907 the auditor was given power by the
								Legislature to draw his warrant upon the treasurer for one hundred dollars for the
								purpose of defraying the expenses of the county institute regardless of the number
								of teachers in attendance.</p>

							<p>In some instances the efficiency of the township institute has been impaired
								through the indifference of a few teachers. For the purpose of eliminating this
								handicap it has become necessary to create conditions unfavorable to the development
								of this indifference, so that the responsibility may be fixed and co-operation
								attained. To this end a monthly report has to be made to the county superintendent
								by each institute. This report will show the enrollment, explain the cause of
								tardiness, absence and other irregularities, and will show in per cent. the
								chairman's estimate of each teacher's preparation for the day. If each teacher makes
								careful preparation of all the Reading Circle work and any special topic that may be
								required individually, the chairman reports the work well done.</p>

							<p>Approximately three thousand dollars were spent in Hendricks county in 1913 for the
								support of the township institutes.</p>

							<p>The county agriculture agent will soon be at the service of the teachers in
								township institute work. Joint sessions will be arranged for his convenience, so
								that all teachers may have the opportunity of gaining practical information which he
								will impart in the interest of vocational education.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head><hi rend="center sc">TOWNSHIP TRUSTEE.</hi></head>

							<p>In the first survey of western lands, congress set apart a section of land in every
								township, generally the sixteenth, for school purposes, the disposition <pb
									id="VAC1000-161" n="161"/> of the land to be in the hands of the residents of the
								respective townships. In 1829 the township was provided with three trustees elected
								for one year at the September election. These members appointed a clerk. The duties
								of the trustees were to divide their township school lands into convenient sizes for
								sale and set a minimum price, not less than a dollar and twenty-five cents per acre.
								It was the duty of the school commissioner to sell the lands thus divided to the
								highest bidder.</p>

							<p>The law of 1838 provided that a civil township should have three township trustees,
								selected for a term of three years, one elected each year. These appointed a clerk
								and a treasurer. These officers were to build roads and care for them and divide the
								township into school districts. There were in each school district three district
								trustees whose duty it was to examine and employ teachers. In 1849 one district
								trustee was provided for each school district in place of three. His duties were
								practically those of the three. He was paid seventy-five cents per day, as were also
								the township trustees.</p>

							<p>In 1859 the "civil township was declared a school township," and "the trustee for
								such a township shall be trustee, treasurer and clerk." It was this law which
								created the present township trustee, though subsequent legislation has added much
								to his list of duties and largely increased his power.</p>

							<p>In 1865 the voters of a school district met the first Saturday in October and
								elected one director. The duties of this official were to call meetings of the
								district voters and preside. The meeting could appoint the teacher for the district;
								determine the branches to be taught in addition to the common branches provided by
								law, and could set the term of school under two limitations. The power of employing
								and paying teachers belonged to the township trustee.</p>

							<p>In 1873 the district meeting with the director lost the power of appointing the
								teacher. The duty fell into the hands of the township trustee. From this time to the
								present the office of director has gradually fallen into disuse.</p>

							<p>In 1883 the Legislature placed some limitations upon the trustee's power in
								employing teachers which were removed by the act of 1901. Under this act, although
								the advisory board since 1899 has limited his power in two directions, viz., tax
								levies and the number of days he may be employed as trustee, the trustee is in
								complete control of the schools of his township. He has the authority to ask
								patrons, while taking the enumeration, what their preferences are, if any, and thus
								has a guide in selecting his teachers for the next year. This custom has grown out
								of the directors' meetings and taken their place.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT.</hi></head>

							<p>The county superintendent was given large duties by the text book law of 1889. He
								makes the requisition for all books used in the county; he is the bookkeeper for
								each of the school book contractors; and he collects from each corporation handling
								the books as well as from the various dealers. A recent act of the Legislature,
								however, relieves the superintendent of all these duties except the matter of making
								requisitions.</p>

							<p>The county superintendent has the general superintendence of the schools of his
								county. He must attend each township institute at least once in each school year and
								as often thereafter as possible, and preside over and conduct its exercises. He
								shall visit schools while they are in session for the purpose of increasing their
								usefulness and elevating, as far as practicable, the poor schools to the standard of
								the best. He must conduct teachers' institutes and encourage other like associations
								and shall labor, in every way, to elevate the standard of teaching and to improve
								the education of the schools of the county. In all controversies of a general nature
								arising under the school law, the decision of a county superintendent must first be
								obtained. It is his duty at all times to carry out the orders and instructions of
								the state board of education and the state superintendent of public instruction. The
								same Legislature which enumerated the above duties of the county superintendent also
								relieved him of the supervision of cities and towns with superintendents.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">HIGH SCHOOL STATISTICS.</hi></head>

							<p>There are high schools at present in Hendricks county at the following towns: Amo,

								Plainfield, Guilford township; Clayton, Liberty township; Brownsburg, Lincoln
								township; New Winchester, Marion township; Pittsboro, Middle township; Lizton, Union
								township, and Danville, Center township. All of these high schools are commissioned
								by the state board of education with the exception of those at New Winchester and
								Lizton. The latter is to be commissioned this year. The total enrollment in 1913 was
								six <pb id="VAC1000-163" n="163"/> hundred and forty-eight, with thirty-one
								teachers. The high schools are well regulated in the county and a course is divided
								into semesters of a half year, sixteen weeks each. Thirty-two credits are required
								for graduation, with music and drawing in addition. A system of uniform high school
								text books was adopted by the state board of school book commissioners on July 24,
								1913, for a period of five years. This regulation does not restrict the work of the
								schools, for the books allowed are many and excellent texts. The high schools in the
								county are in excellent condition, all attention being turned towards modeling them
								after the most modern laws promulgated by the leading minds in the educational and
								legislative world. Athletics are being featured and meets are held annually,
								beginning with 1914, in which all the high schools of the county join. This has a
								tendency, and a strong one, of drawing the students closer together and promoting a
								healthier and better spirit. The county, as compared with the others in the state,
								ranks among the first six in educational excellence. Nearly all of the high schools
								are housed in new buildings, built according to the most scientific and hygienic
								rules of school house construction. New structures are going up at present at
								Hazlewood, Avon and Amo, the latter to cost twenty-nine thousand dollars.
								Consolidation is the ultimate aim of every township, and this is being largely
								effected. In Brown township, as there is no town, an effort will be made to
								establish a community center.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">CENTRAL NORMAL COLLEGE.</hi></head>

							<p>The chief educational feature of Hendricks county is the Central Normal College,
								located at the county seat, Danville. The college is a normal school for prospective
								teachers and supplies a need in the educational world which, not so many years ago,
								was an unsatisfied one.</p>

							<p>The school had its origin back in the year 1876, at Ladoga, Montgomery county,
								Indiana. Prof. W. F. Harper and Prof. J. W. Dart were the founders of the school and
								the first term under their management saw but forty-eight students enrolled. The
								outlook at that time was far from encouraging and the existence of the school
								continued solely on account of the far-sightedness and courage of the two founders.
								They worked unceasingly for the good of their school and their efforts were crowned
								with success. At the end of the first year twelve students, having completed the
								course prescribed by the institution, received the degree of Batchelor of Science.
								Near the close of the year, Professor Darst having resigned, Frank P. Adams, of
								Kentucky, came and assisted Professor Harper and was afterward president of the
								college.</p>

							<p>The second year of the school's existence opened in an encouraging manner. Many
								students came and it became evident that larger accommodations would have to be
								secured in order to care for the increased attendance. Efforts were made to raise
								enough money to build a school house adequate for the need and many people
								interested themselves to the extent of giving cash. However, there were others who
								refused to aid. This lost the school to Ladoga. On May 10, 1878, arrangements having
								been made, vehicles supplied by the people of Danville went over to Ladoga and
								hauled the teachers, their hundred and seventy-five students, and their personal
								belongings, including the school apparatus, over to Danville. The old Seminary
								building was remodeled for the use of the school. This building had been the home of
								the Methodist Academy. The procession through the country and the reception given in
								Danville were events of great importance. The good people of Danville opened their
								homes to the teachers and students and school was not interrupted. Classes were
								resumed in the new location as if nothing had ever happened. By popular subscription
								the citizens of Danville purchased the Academy building and the Methodist Episcopal
								church <pb id="VAC1000-165" n="165"/> deeded the property to Prof. William Harper
								and he deeded it to Professor Adams in 1879.</p>

							<p>On November 25, 1882, Professor Adams was called by death, at the age of thirty
								years.</p>

							<p>The institution was the property of Professor Adams and before his death he
								requested his wife, Mrs. Ora Adams, to assume the presidency, with Prof. John A.
								Steele as vice-president. Every friend of the college rallied to the support of the
								new officials, so that there was no check in its educational or financial progress.
								The college building was improved, a large boarding house erected and a handsome
								residence constructed for Mrs. Adams.</p>

							<p>But misfortune was again to come. In 1884 Professor Steele became ill with
								tuberculosis and in May, 1885, passed to his death. During the illness of Professor
								Steele his work gradually passed into the hands of Charles A. Hargrave, who, since
								April, 1883, had been his assistant in class and office. He was known as the
								secretary and treasurer of the college and through him the plans of the college were
								executed.</p>

							<p>On July 10, 1889, President Adams was married to James A. Joseph. Desiring to be
								relieved of public duties, she promoted Professor Hargrave to the presidency. Miss
								A. Kate Huron was made vice-president and Professor Joseph, secretary and treasurer.
								At the close of the school year in 1890 Professor Joseph assumed the presidency. He
								had already begun the erection of a large additional building, now known as Chapel
								Hall, just across the street west of the original building. The attendance increased
								and additional instructors were employed. The enrollment the spring term of 1891 was
								seven hundred and seventy-one students.</p>

							<p>In August, 1900, a stock company of eighty citizens of Danville bought the college
								of Professor and Mrs. Joseph. From that time on it has been managed by a board of
								trustees. The first board consisted of the following members: Thomas J. Cofer,
								president; G. L. Spillman, secretary; Townsend Cope, I. N. Estep, H. S. Dickey,
								Jonathan Rigdon, C. A. Hargrave. College officials were elected as follows: Jonathan
								Rigdon, president; G. L. Spillman, vice-president; C. A. Hargrave, secretary and
								treasurer. In 1903 both Professor Rigdon and Spillman resigned. Their successors
								were A. J. Kinnaman and G. W. Dunlavy. Doctor Kinnaman resigned in 1906 and
								Professor Dunlavy was made his successor, and John W. Laird was elected
								vice-president. Professor Dunlavy's health failed in two years and he retired to
								take up farm life. Professor Laird was elected president and still holds this
								position. Prof. H. M. Whisler was made vice-president.</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-166" n="166"/>

							<p>In 1911 the college was reincorporated, under a new Indiana law, without capital
								stock, the stockholders donating their stock. It is controlled by a
								self-perpetuating board of trustees, serving without compensation. The board is as
								follows : Otis E. Gulley, president; George T. Pattison, secretary; W. C. Osborne,
								J. D. Hogate, Mord Carter, Dr. W. T. Lawson and C. A. Hargrave.</p>

							<p>The institution stands high with the educational public and receives a large
								patronage. The attendance for the summer term of 1912 was seven hundred and four
								students. Up to this time the college has been self-supporting. It has never had any
								help to pay operating expenses. It has been entirely independent of church, state or
								endowment. Former students now fill Indiana state offices as follows: S. M. Ralston,
								governor; Charles A. Greathouse, superintendent of public instruction; Philip
								Zoercher, reporter of supreme court; Edward Barrett, state geologist; E. W.
								McDaniels, assistant reporter of supreme court; John W. Spencer, judge of supreme
								court; Edward W. Felt, judge of appellate court; James L. Clark, Thomas R. Duncan,
								members of state utilities commission; Thomas C. McReynolds, member of Panama
								exposition commission.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">CENTRAL NORMAL COLLEGE LIBRARY.</hi></head>

							<p>This library had its beginning in the private library of a few scarce volumes of

								good books loaned by the professors of the college. Additions were made from year to
								year by purchase and donations until the number of volumes reached into the

							<p>The books have been carefully selected, the needs of the students and the college

								in the old frame building. He continued until November, when he joined hands with

							<p>Hendricks county is one of the richest agricultural counties in the state. In
								addition to this, there is a large amount of stock raising done in the county. The
								presence-of valuable grazing land in all of the townships is accountable for this.
								The tilling of the soil, with its kindred vocations, however, is the greatest
								industry in Hendricks.</p>

							<p>The county has an area of four hundred and eighty square miles or three hundred
								seven thousand two hundred acres. Very nearly two-thirds of the population live in
								the country. The farmers own about nine-tenths of the taxable property. The soil of
								the county is well adapted to cereals, especially corn, wheat and oats. The leading
								cereal grown is corn, a yield of one hundred bushels per acre being not uncommon.
								The average to the acre, however, is about forty bushels and aggregates about two
								million bushels per annum.</p>

							<p>Wheat comes next to corn, with an average of fifteen bushels to the acre. In an
								ordinary wheat year the county produces about four hundred and fifty thousand
								bushels. Oats is not raised as extensively as corn and wheat, but is considered a
								profitable crop for feeding purposes. Over four hundred and fifty thousand bushels
								are produced each year, being worth in the neighobrhood of one hundred and fifty
								thousand dollars. There are about forty thousand tons of hay put in the mows
								annually, and scarcely a day passes but that you may see several loads on the way to
								the Indianapolis markets. Most of the hay is timothy. Clover is raised in abundance
								for seed and for its fertilizing qualities and is considered one of the most
								profitable crops in the county.</p>

							<p>Every farm in the county has some kind of fence around it and most of the fences
								are in good condition. Quite a number of the old rail fences are yet to be seen,
								some board, hedge, picket, barbed wire, but chiefly woven wire <pb id="VAC1000-169"
									n="169"/> Tiled ditches, which are in general use, have greatly increased the
								productiveness of the soil.</p>

							<p>The county has many fine herds of Hereford, Shorthorn, Jersey and Guernsey cattle.
								Thousands of stock cattle are bought at the stock yards and fed on the pasture land.
								These pasture lands are mostly bluegrass, but little inferior to the bluegrass
								regions of Kentucky. Hogs and sheep are raised extensively and are a very profitable
								part of present-day farming. Poultry is also raised extensively and there is
								scarcely a farm but has chickens, geese and ducks.</p>

							<p>The finest and most expensive homes in the country have been constructed by the
								farmers. Many of them have been equipped with all modern improvements and
								conveniences.</p>

							<p>It will be interesting to the reader to present the following figures, taken from
								the United States census report of 1910:</p>

							<p>Number of all farms in Hendricks county, 2,786; land area, 261,120 acres; land in
								farms, 254,159 acres; value of all, $28,677,219; in 1900 the value of farm lands was
								$14,776,661; of domestic animals, $2,518,444. The total value of crops for the year
								1910 was $2,580,853. Of this amount $2,075,821 was the value of cereals and $3,949
								the value of other grains and seeds. Hay and forage was worth $300,262; vegetables,
								$90,637; fruits and nuts, $50,739; and all other crops, $59,445.</p>

							<head><hi rend="center sc">ROADS.</hi></head>

							<p>The progress of the good roads movement in Hendricks county during the past few
								years has been truly remarkable. It is a fact that during the year 1910 there were
								only two and eight-tenths miles of gravel road constructed under the law for
								improving highways in the county. It was at this point that the improvement of
								highways began. By the year 1912 there was a total of two hundred and forty-seven
								miles of gravel road in the county. Today there is about five hundred miles of
								improved, gravel and macadam road in the county. The expenditures for road viewing
								and surveying in 1911 was $63.10; for bridges, $41,895.49. The township gravel road
								bonds outstanding in 1911 amounted to $294,587.91.</p>

								which is in Hendricks. One-fourth of it is timberland, mostly level, some of it
								rolling, with ravines and gulleys. Flowing through it from north to south is Clark
								creek.</p>

							<p>The second preserve lies near the center of the county two miles north <pb

								land, one-fifth of which is in timber, with much copse and underbrush. A small per
								cent. of the lands are hilly. Most of them are level, but some of them rolling.
								White Lick creek, with its tributaries, supply it with water.</p>

							<p>The third preserve lies south of the center of the county, in Clay and Franklin
								townships. It contains sixty-two hundred acres, one-fifth of which is in woodland,
								with much copse and underbrush. The lands are rather level. The east and middle
								branches of Mill creek supply the water. Neither has yet proved successful, chiefly
								on account of hawks.</p>

							<p>The first interurban car ran into Danville at 11:05 a. m., August 30, 1906, over

						<p>John V. Hadley is a native son of Hendricks county, Indiana, born on the 31st day of
							October, 1840, and is a son of Jonathan and Ara (Carter) Hadley, who were natives,
							respectively, of North Carolina and Ohio. They were the parents of seven children, of
							whom five grew to maturity, Enos, Harlan, William C., John V. and Mary, all being now
							deceased excepting John V.</p>

						<p>The subject's paternal grandparents were Jeremiah and Sarah (Hornaday) Hadley,
							natives of Guilford county, North Carolina, where the father followed the vocation of
							farming. In 1822 they made the long and tiresome overland journey to Indiana, stopping
							first at Indianapolis, which at that time was but a small and unpretentious village.
							Because of the prevalence of typhoid fever there at that particular time, Jeremiah
							Hadley continued his journey westward, locating permanently near what is now
							Plainfield, Hendricks county. There he cleared and improved a farm, reared a family of
							children, and there he and his wife spent the remainder of their days, dying at
							advanced ages. Among their children were Jonathan, Elias, John, Ruth and others whose
							names are not recorded. In religion, Jeremiah Hadley was a birthright Quaker, but lost
							his birthright by marrying outside the church.</p>

						<p>Jonathan Hadley, father of the subject, was reared to manhood in <pb id="VAC1000-175"
								n="174"/> Guilford county, North Carolina, where he followed agricultural pursuits.
							He and his wife accompanied his father on the emigration to Hendricks county, Indiana,
							others in the company being David Carter, a son-in-law of Jeremiah Hadley, and his
							wife, also two other sons of Jeremiah Hadley, Elias and John, who subsequently went to
							Ohio, there married sisters of Jonathan's wife, and, returning to Hendricks county,
							took up land adjoining the other members of the family, the present site of Plainfield
							and for about a half mile south and one mile north on east shore of White Lick being
							the family possessions. Jeremiah and Jonathan Hadley and David Carter at once began
							clearing the land, and as soon as enough logs were cut they each erected a one-room
							log cabin, in which they established their permanent homes. Thus the Hadleys are
							properly numbered among the true pioneers of Hendricks county, and through the years
							they have proven a valuable, element in the civic life of this favored locality. In
							that early day Indians were numerous here, though as a rule they were not hostile to
							the white settlers. Rattle-snakes were much more to be feared, while wolves, bear and
							many other species of wild game were abundant. For a number of years all of the
							settlers in this immediate locality were Hadleys and Carters, all of whom reared large
							families. Jonathan Hadley accumulated two hundred acres of land, which he brought to a
							high state of improvement, and to the cultivation of which he devoted himself until
							his death, from typhoid fever, at the comparatively early age of forty years. He was
							survived a number of years by his widow, who passed away in 1866, at the age of
							sixty-three years. Both were members of the Christian (Disciples) church, to which
							they rendered faithful allegiance, and enjoyed to a marked degree the confidence and
							respect of all who knew them.</p>

						<p>Judge Hadley's maternal grandparents were Mordecai and Sarah Carter, who were farming
							folk, residing near Collinsville, Ohio. They never left their native heath, dying
							there when well advanced in years. Their children were Harlan, James, John, Ara
							(mother of the subject), Lucinda and another daughter.</p>

						<p>John V. Hadley was reared to manhood on his father's farm, where there was plenty of
							work to do and where, in close touch with nature, he formed those habits of industry,
							perseverance and independence which characterized his later years. His elementary
							educational training was received in the old-fashioned subscription schools of that
							locality, and he afterwards entered Northwestern Christian University (now Butler
							College), where, he remained two years, his studies being interrupted by the outbreak
							of the war between the states. In response to his country's need of defenders, he laid
							aside <pb id="VAC1000-176" n="175"/> his text-books and, on August 20, 1861, enlisted
							as a private in Company B, Seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, serving his
							country faithfully until receiving his honorable discharge on March 22, 1865. He was
							promoted from the ranks to first lieutenant and was then detailed on Gen. J. C. Rice's
							staff, where he rendered the remainder of his service. He took part in many of the
							hardest fought battles of' that great internecine conflict and was twice wounded,
							first at the second battle of Bull Run, and again at the battle of the Wilderness. At
							the latter place he was left unconscious and helpless on the battlefield, was taken
							prisoner and for three weeks was confined in a Confederate field hospital and then
							sent south as a prisoner. He was first confined in the prison at Macon, Georgia,
							whence he was sent to Savannah, Georgia, then to Charleston, South Carolina, and
							finally to Columbia, South Carolina. From the latter place he escaped on November 4,
							1864, and, after enduring many hardships and passing through many dangers, he
							succeeded in reaching the Union lines at Knoxville, Tennessee, on the 10th day of
							December following. Mr. Hadley wrote an interesting and dramatic account of his
							imprisonment and escape, which, under the title of "Seven Months a Prisoner," was
							published by Scribner &amp; Sons in 1898, in a little volume of the Ivory series.</p>

						<p>After his return to peaceful pursuits, Mr. Hadley took up the study of law and
							attended the private school of Judge David McDonald in Indianapolis. In June, 1866, he
							was admitted to the Hendricks county bar at Danville and immediately entered upon the
							active practice of his profession here, being so engaged when, in 1886, he was elected
							to the circuit bench of Hendricks and Marion counties. So satisfactory were his
							services as a jurist that in 1892 he was elected to succeed himself and during the ten
							years that he presided over this circuit he gained a wide reputation as an able,
							careful and conscientious judge, so that in 1898 a well-deserved promotion came to him
							in his election to the supreme bench of the state. He was re-elected to the supreme
							bench in 1904 and served until 1911, when he retired of his own accord, and has since
							devoted himself chiefly to his private business affairs and looking after his
							farm.</p>

						<p>As a lawyer, Judge Hadley early won a high reputation as a successful and adroit
							attorney and he enjoyed a large and representative clientele in Hendricks and
							neighboring counties. As a jurist, he in no way disappointed those who knew him, for
							in him there are embodied a weight of character, a native sagacity, a far-seeing
							judgment and a fidelity of purpose which enabled him at all times to not only get to
							the bottom of facts, but to quickly and accurately comprehend the fine points of the
							questions at issue. While on the <pb id="VAC1000-177" n="176"/> supreme bench Judge
							Hadley's decisions were characterized by a clearness, candor and breadth of view which
							have made them authority on many fine points of law assigned to him for
							interpretation. Among the important decisions written by Judge Hadley while on the
							supreme bench, involving the constitutionality of legislative enactments, were the
							following: The act concerning municipal improvements, known as the Barrett Law, 154
							Ind. 467; For the Protection of Wild Game, 155 Ind. 611; An Act to Regulate Dentistry,
							156 Ind. 187; the Pure Food Law, 157 Ind. 517; An Act to Deprive Ft. Wayne of Local
							Self-Government, 158 Ind. 126; the Weekly Wage Law, Republic Iron and Steel Co. v.
							State, 160 Ind. 379; the Status of the State University in Our Common School System,
							159 Ind. 139; Relocation of County Seat of Newton County, 161 Ind. 616; The Right of
							County Assessors in Quest of Taxable Property to Examine Bank Books, 166 Ind. 631;
							Employers Liability Act, 171 Ind. 612; The County Option Law, 174 Ind. 60; Railroad
							Commission no Power to Fix Rates that are Confiscatory, 172 Ind. 113. Careful and
							painstaking in everything, Judge Hadley's opinions, for their uniform, unvarying
							excellence of workmanship, were not excelled by those of any of his brother justices.
							The impression that he made on the limited circle of friends and neighbors in
							Hendricks and adjoining counties at the beginning and during the early years of his
							practice, was the one he left on the larger circle of his acquaintance after years of
							faithful and appreciated service on the highest legal tribunal of the state, namely,
							that he was a man who could be relied on and trusted in all things.</p>

						<p>On the 15th day of March, 1865, John V. Hadley was united in marriage to Mary J.
							Hill, who was born in Hendricks county, Indiana, on August 13, 1844, the daughter of
							Samuel and Rebecca (Hornaday) Hill. Her parents were natives of North Carolina, who
							became pioneer settlers in Hendricks county, where the father followed farming. Mr.
							Hill died in May, 1896, in the ninety-first year of his age. Mrs. Rebecca Hill died in
							1863, of typhoid fever, at the age of fifty-four years. They were the parents of seven
							children, Oliver, Samira, William, John, Daniel, Mary and Eliza. Mrs. Hadley's
							paternal grandfather, Joseph Hill, who also was a native of North Carolina, came to
							Indiana in an early day, sometime after the death of his wife, and located in Parke
							county, where he spent the rest of his days, and died. He was a Quaker in his
							religious belief. He was the father of a large family, of whom the following names are
							remembered: William, John, Daniel, Clark and Julia. Mrs. Hadley's maternal
							grandfather, Lewis Hornaday, spent his entire life in North Carolina. He was the
							father of five children, Rebecca, Susan, Ruth, Hester and Simon.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-178" n="177"/>

						<p>To Judge and Mrs. Hadley have been born three children, namely: Kate B., Hugh H. and
							Walter G. Kate B. became the wife of W. W. Buchanan, of Evanston, Illinois, and they
							have three daughters, Dorothy, Mary J. and Katherine. Hugh H. Hadley, who is a
							successful lawyer in Chicago, with residence in Oak Park, Illinois, married Madge
							Silverthorne, of Wisconsin. Walter G. Hadley, who has charge of his father's farm,
							married Jennie Christie, and they have two daughters, Jane and Ann.</p>

						<p>Politically, Judge Hadley has been a life-long supporter of the Republican party and
							has always kept in closest touch with public questions and issues. In 1868 he was
							elected to the state Senate, serving through three sessions. Aside from this office
							and his judicial preferment, the Judge has never held public positions. Fraternally,
							he is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons, belonging to the lodge at Danville,
							and also belongs to Jesse Ogden Post No. 164, Grand Army of the Republic, and to the
							Military Order of the Loyal Legion. Religiously, the Judge and Mrs. Hadley are members
							of the Christian church at Danville.</p>

						<p>Thus briefly have been outlined the leading facts in the career of one who has
							stamped the impress of his individuality on the community in which practically his
							entire life has been spent. As the day, with its morning of hope and promise, its
							noontide of activity and accomplishment, and its evening of completed and successful
							efforts, so has been the life of this honored man. Easily approached, obliging and
							straightforward in all the relations of life, his personal relations with his fellow
							men have ever been mutually pleasant and agreeable, and he has enjoyed to a marked
							degree their confidence and regard. A representative of one of the sterling old
							families of Hendricks county, Judge Hadley has added luster to the family name and has
							made a record of which his county may justly be proud. <hi rend="right">E. E.

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN WATT WHYTE.</hi></head>

						<p>The gentleman of whom the biographer now writes is widely known as one of the honored
							citizens of Hendricks county and for almost half a century has been a valued factor in
							the development of the same, prominently identified with the varied interests of his
							community. His well directed energies in the practical affairs of life and his sound
							judgment have demonstrated what may be accomplished by the man of energy and ambition.
							Born on a foreign soil, Mr. Whyte early demonstrated the sterling qualities of <pb
								id="VAC1000-179" n="178"/> citizenship possessed by him and his success in life is
							due solely to his own innate manhood and unfailing energy and ambition along right
							lines.</p>

						<p>John Watt Whyte was born on October 14, 1846, at Paisley, Scotland, the son of George
							and Elizabeth (Watt) Whyte, both of whom were natives of that town and country. George
							Whyte came to America before the outbreak of the Mexican war. He was a weaver by
							trade, being particularly expert in weaving coverlets, using of course the old-style
							hand loom. He followed his trade after coming to this country and after power looms
							came into use, practically eliminating the class of trade to which he had catered, he
							entered the large woolen mills of the east, operating the power looms. He was a
							veteran of the Mexican War, having received a wound while in service. At the outbreak
							of the Civil War, he enlisted in Company F, Forty-third Regiment Indiana Volunteer
							Infantry, being assigned to the Army of the Tennessee. He enlisted for three years,
							but served until the close of hostilities. He was living in Terre Haute, Indiana, at
							the time of his enlistment and entered the ranks from Sullivan county. He was never a
							resident of this county, and died at Louisville, Kentucky, in 1870. Elizabeth (Watt)
							Whyte, mother of the immediate subject of this sketch, followed her husband to America
							soon after he came over. She crossed in one of the slow sailing vessels of that time,
							leaving her family in the old country. After being here a short time, she returned for
							her children, coming back directly and bringing with her the subject of this sketch
							and her youngest child, George. Two other children, William and Jennie, had died in
							Scotland and George is also deceased, leaving the subject the sole remaining one of
							the family. Her death occurred at Terre Haute, Indiana, on October 10, 1856, the fall
							of the election of President Buchanan.</p>

						<p>On October 18, 1868, Mr. Whyte was united in marriage with Ann Eliza Jackson,
							daughter of James and Mary (Jackson) Jackson, the former of whom was a native of
							Putnam county, this state, and the latter a native of Kentucky, having been born on
							October 27, 1816, the same year in which Indiana was admitted to the sisterhood of
							states. She departed this life July 1, 1900, at the advanced age of eighty-four years.
							James Jackson lived for many years in Putnam county, where he followed the trade of a
							blacksmith. He was considered unusually skilled in his trade and mechanics generally
							and many specimens of his work are still extant. He served throughout the war of the
							Rebellion, being identified with an Iowa regiment and his death occurred in a
							soldiers' home in the state of Michigan. They were the parents of six children, those
							beside Ann Eliza, wife of the subject, <pb id="VAC1000-180" n="179"/> being: Sarah
							(Mrs. McCoy) and John, deceased; James, Thomas and William, who are still living.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Whyte have an interesting family of ten children, namely: Ida, deceased,
							who was the wife of Henry Lawson. She was the mother of three children, Urban, Eula
							and Ida Kate. Her death occurred March 8, 1894. William, who married Blanche Pierson,
							resides in Muncie, Indiana, where he is employed in a garage. He is the father of one
							child, Mildred. George L., whose wife was Alice Leachman, is a farmer in this county
							and the father of one child, Joyce Roseland. Lenora married Elmer E. Brown and resides
							at Brownsburg in this county. She is the mother of one child, Doris. Mary became the
							wife of John C. Taylor, of Danville, and has one child John W. Oliver resides at home.
							Lurene is Mrs. Fred Scearce, of Danville, and has one child, Maurice. Walter T.
							married Alice Anderson. of Knoxville, Tennessee, and has one child, Walter Allen.
							Raymond makes his home in Danville and Eunice, who became the wife of Lynn L.
							Bolinger, resides at Seymour, Indiana. Her husband was formerly a traveling salesman,
							but has recently engaged in the grocery business. They are the parents of one child,
							Lynn Lewis.</p>

						<p>Mr. Whyte was quite a small child when his mother brought him from his native
							Scotland and in his earlier years was moved about considerably and finally became a
							"bound" boy in Terre Haute, where he remained until twenty years of age, when he came
							to Danville on September 4, 1866. On October 15, 1864, he had volunteered for one year
							in Company M, Fourth Indiana Cavalry, and received his discharge, dated August 27,
							1865, at Indianapolis, having seen no active duty. Since coming to Hendricks county he
							has spent the rest of his life here with the exception of one year at Lafayette, this
							state. All his life he has been connected with agricultural pursuits, although he has
							also worked at other trades. He was engaged in carpentry for some time and for over
							eight years was in the tombstone business at Danville. He has done considerable
							trading and was first located on a farm about three miles southeast of Danville. He
							traded around some and for twenty years lived on a farm of one hundred and sixty acres
							about two miles north of Danville. From there he came to the farm known as the Bob
							McCoun farm, where he has resided for the past twelve years, carrying on general
							farming. He has about eighty acres at present, on which he has made all the
							improvements, clearing the land, draining it and putting up fences, so that the farm
							today is in an excellent state.</p>

						<p>Mr. Whyte's fraternal affiliation is with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and he
							has served his local lodge as treasurer for seven years. He <pb id="VAC1000-181"
								n="180"/> is also a member of the local post at Danville of the Grand Army of the
							Republic. Mr. Whyte is a stanch Republican and takes pride in the fact that he has
							always adhered to that party's ticket. His first vote was cast for General Grant as
							President. He takes an active interest in local politics and in 1892 was elected
							county commissioner, serving in that capacity for three years. During 1906 and 1907 he
							served as ditch commissioner and again in 1898 was elected county commissioner,
							serving another term of three years. In 1908 he was elected township trustee for a
							term of six years, assuming his office on January 1, 1909, so that he is the present
							incumbent of that office. In the discharge of the duties which have devolved upon him
							from time to time, Mr. Whyte has ever sought to be absolutely fair and impartial in
							his judgment and faithful to his trust at all times. The fact that he is universally
							well spoken of and held in high esteem shows he has succeeded in his endeavor. He is a
							good mixer, a most congenial companion and is regarded as a man of unswerving
							integrity, absolutely honest in all his dealings with his fellow men. His religious
							affiliation is with the Christian church, of which he has been a member since 1867.
							Mrs. Whyte is also a member of the same church, having identified herself with same at
							the tender age of seventeen years. Both are sincerely interested in the progress of
							that church society, giving liberally of time and means toward its support. Mr. Whyte
							is extremely liberal in all his views and his hand is active in advancing the welfare
							of the community in every way possible. A man of generous impulses and genial
							disposition, he readily makes friends and always retains them. Having gained by his
							earnest efforts and consecutive labor a competence for himself, he is ever ready to
							assist those struggling toward the same goal. Because of his unimpeachable career, in
							both private and public life, he is eminently entitled to representation in a work of
							the scope of the one at hand.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JAMES A. DOWNARD.</hi></head>

						<p>In placing the name of James A. Downard before the reader as one standing in the
							front rank of the enterprising men of affairs and a leader of the bar at Danville,
							Indiana, whose influence has tended to the upbuilding of the city of his residence and
							the advancement of the affairs of his native county of Hendricks, simple justice is
							done a biographical fact recognized throughout the community by those at all familiar
							with his history and cognizant of the important part he has acted in the circles with
							which he has <pb id="VAC1000-182" n="181"/> been identified. His career presents a
							notable example of those qualities of mind and character which overcome obstacles and
							win success, and his example is eminently worthy of imitation.</p>

						<p>James A. Downard, a prominent lawyer and abstracter of Danville, was born in New
							Winchester, Hendricks county, Indiana, November 15, 1855. His parents, David M. and
							Cassandra (Morgan) Downard, were both natives of this county. David Downard was a
							farmer and stock raiser and was regarded as a fine judge of stock. He was a large
							breeder of high grade stock of all kinds and was one of the most successful in this
							line in the county. He was the son of Judge James Downard, who was one of the first
							probate judges of the Hendricks county court. He was one of the four proprietors who
							laid out the town of Danville in 1825. Judge Downard came from Kentucky to Indiana,
							having been born in Pennsylvania and emigrating to the Northwest territory about 1811.
							A few years later he went to Kentucky, and in 1818 came to Indiana, first settling
							near Brooklyn, afterwards moving to Indianapolis and later on permanently settling in
							Plainfield, where his death occurred in 1846. Judge Downard married Elizabeth Curry in
							Pennsylvania, a descendant of a' Scotch-Irish family who came from Ireland. Judge
							Downard and wife were the parents of ten children, David being the ninth in order of
							birth, and his death occurred on January 2, 1892, his wife having passed away many
							years before, on May 17, 1880. Mr. and Mrs. David Downard were the parents of ten
							children: James A., the immediate subject of this sketch; Mrs. Martha Hammond, of
							Danville; Mrs. Mary J. Anderson, of Anderson, Indiana; Canada H., who lives on the old
							home place near Hadley in this county; William, a merchant of East St. Louis,
							Missouri; Erie, deceased, who married Charles S. Hall, of Evansville, Indiana; Oliver,
							of Lynn, Indiana; Frank, of Danville, and two who died in infancy.</p>

						<p>James A. Downard received his education in the district schools and later spent one
							year at Butler University and also took a course at Bryant &amp; Stratton's Business
							University at Indianapolis. In 1877 he entered the law office of Cofer &amp; Taylor to
							read law and one year later he was admitted to the practice of all courts in Indiana.
							In the same year he took up the abstract business and now has the finest set of
							abstract books in Hendricks county, and is recognized as an authority on land titles
							in the county. In 1882 he formed a connection with the Union Central Life Insurance
							Company, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and has -been their financial correspondent for this
							county since that time. He has carried on this threefold line of work since 1882, <pb
								id="VAC1000-183" n="182"/> namely, the practice of law, the abstract business and
							the insurance business. He has managed his business in such a way that he has acquired
							a very comfortable competence and is regarded as one of the leading and substantial
							men of Danville.</p>

						<p>Mr. Downard was married May 22, 1884, to Maude L. Donaldson, the daughter of William
							H. and Araminta B. Donaldson, of Danville. Mr. Downard was for fourteen years on the
							town board of Danville, and during this period, from 1892 to 1906, he was instrumental
							in providing sidewalks, brick streets, electric lights, water works and a new high
							school building for the town. In recognition of his efficient service on the town
							board he was elected on the Republican ticket as county commissioner in 1910, and
							renominated in 1912, but went down to defeat with the rest of his party ticket. As
							county commissioner he has been one of the men responsible for the handsome new court
							house in Danville. He has been the one to take the lead in the work and has been
							recognized as the most important man on the board by virtue of his past experience. He
							has been treasurer of the Citizens' Building, Savings &amp; Loan Association since
							1882, and during his long incumbency the institution has never lost a cent or had to
							make a foreclosure.</p>

						<p>Fraternally, Mr. Downard is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons, the Knights of
							Pythias, and, religiously, is identified with the Friends church. His career has
							indeed been a busy one and it has been as useful as busy. He and his wife move in the
							best social circles of Danville and are highly esteemed wherever they are known.</p>

						<p>Among the families of Hendricks county, Indiana, whose members have worthily

							close relations they have sustained to the welfare and prosperity of the locality
							which has been honored by their citizenships, they are eminently entitled to
							representation in a work of the character of the one in hand.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-184" n="183"/>

						<p>One of the most prosperous business men of Danville, Indiana, is Edgar W. Shirley,
							the son of John M. and Susan (Hale) Shirley, who was born February 10, 1860, in
							Pittsboro, in this county. His father was also a native of Hendricks county, his birth
							having occurred three miles southwest of Brownsburg on June 15, 1835. His mother was
							born about one and one-half miles southwest of Pittsboro. Jamnes W. Shirley, the
							grandfather of Edgar W., was born in 1803, in Kentucky, and came to Hendricks county,
							Indiana, in 1830, or before, settling on Big creek, where he lived until his death,
							which occurred in 1893. James W. Shirley married Deborah Pressley, and they reared a
							family of eight children, the father of Edgar W. being the third in order of birth.
							John Shirley spent his whole life in the county of his birth. In October, 1852, he
							removed to Pittsboro, where he lived until 1873, being engaged in the mercantile
							business in that place. He continued in this business until July 29, 1873, at which
							time he came to Danville and took charge of the mercantile establishment which he had
							bought some years before in that place. He continued in active business until his
							death, which occurred October 14, 1913, and was one of the wealthiest and most
							successful business men who have ever lived in this county. He was married January 11,
							1857, to Susan Hale, and to this union there were born two children, William J., who
							died in 1899, and Edgar W., the immediate subject of this sketch. John Shirley was a
							member of the Christian church and for many years was a trustee of that denomination.
							He was trustee of Middle township for several terms and was postmaster of Pittsboro
							for a number of years. After moving to Danville he held the office of trustee of
							Center township for two terms. He was a large landowner in Hendricks county, and one
							of its most solid and substantial citizens at the time of his death.</p>

						<p>Edgar W. Shirley was educated in the public schools of Pittsboro, concluded the
							common school courses in that town, and attended Butler University, Indianapolis.
							Immediately after the termination of his college course, he entered the store of his
							father in Danville, and has remained there continuously since that time. Upon his
							father's death in 1913, he succeeded him in the business firm of Shirley &amp;
							Showalter. This firm has by its courteous treatment of its customers and strict
							integrity in all their business dealings, not only gained the confidence of the
							people, but have built up a large and profitable business, being numbered among the
							enterprising and progressive business houses of this city.</p>

						<p>Mr. Shirley was married in 1908 to Bernice (Burk) Kendall, of Danville. Industry and
							probity have been the chief factors of Mr. Shirley's steady advance in business
							affairs and his position in the world is such as to reflect high <pb id="VAC1000-185"
								n="184"/> credit upon himself and to add to the reputation of Danville as an
							important business center. In addition to his interests in the mercantile business,
							Mr. Shirley has large real estate holdings in the county. Fraternally, he is a member
							of the order of Free and Accepted Masons, having taken all the degrees, including the
							thirty-second. In his politics, he has been affiliated with the Republican party,
							although he has never held any office. At the same time he takes an active interest in
							the political issues of the day. He helps all public enterprises and when the new
							Christian church was started in Danville he donated three thousand five hundred
							dollars to its erection. By the exercise of sound business principles and by being
							energetic at all times Mr. Shirley has forged to the front and is today one of the
							most deserving business men of the county, where he is held in high esteem by all
							classes because of his honesty of purpose, his industry, courteous manner and public
							spirit.</p>

							heads this sketch, who is a conspicuous figure in the civic life of the community. A
							man of tireless energy and indomitable courage, he has won and held the unqualified
							esteem of his fellow citizens. Although the law is his profession, he has won a high
							reputation as a real estate, insurance and business man. In fact, he has probably done
							more for the material advancement of Danville and Hendricks county than any other
							citizen.</p>

						<p>John W. Trotter, the son of James M. and Nancy E. (Crose) Trotter, was born in
							Hendricks county, Indiana, October 15, 1861. His parents were both natives of this
							county and are still living in Danville. James M. Trotter was a farmer and stock
							raiser and was one of Hendricks county's most substantial agriculturists, but has been
							living retired in Danville for several years. Mr. and Mrs. James M. Trotter are both
							members of the Methodist Episcopal church and have been for the past forty years. They
							are the parents of six children, five of whom are still living: John W.; Rose, the
							wife of George M. Thompson, of Lizton, this county; James <pb id="VAC1000-186" n="[]"/>

							<pb id="VAC1000-187" n="185"/> W., a farmer in Eel River township; Gretta, who died in
							1893, at the age of twenty-four years; Mary C., the wife of Aaron Kinder, of Danville;
							Retta, the wife of Robert Davidson, of Detroit, Michigan. The Trotter family is of
							English lineage and came to America in the eighteenth century. The great-grandfather
							of the present John W. Trotter came from Virginia to Indiana when he was only two
							years old, his parents settling in Eel River township, this county, on land which they
							entered from the government. James Trotter was the father of ten sons, all of whom
							settled in western states except three who stayed in Hendricks and adjoining counties.
							These three were Anderson Trotter, of Jamestown, Boone county, Indiana; William
							Trotter, of North Salem, this county, and James, the grandfather of John W., the
							immediate subject of this sketch. James Trotter, in addition to being a very succesful
							farmer, was also the township trustee for several terms.</p>

						<p>John W. Trotter was reared on the home place, worked as a boy on his father's farm
							and has never known an idle day since that time. He entered the Central Normal
							College, at Danville, at the age of seventeen, but after a few weeks he secured a
							license to teach and began his pedagogical experience before he was eighteen years of
							age. He taught in the county schools and at North Salem, Lizton, Brownsburg and
							Danville. He resigned the principalship at Lizton, after being there for three years,
							to take the principalship at Brownsburg. While teaching at the latter place, he was
							elected county surveyor, being the youngest man ever elected to a county office in
							Hendricks county. Upon being elected to the office of county surveyor he moved to
							Danville in 1887, where he has continued to reside. He was elected to the office of
							surveyor five times in succession by majorities ranging from nine hundred and
							eighty-five to fourteen hundred and nineteen. His long service in the surveyor's
							office made him a practical man in the abstract business, and upon retiring from the
							surveyor's office he bought a set of abstract books and in 1894 sold a half interest
							in the business to George T. Pattison, who had been a professor in the Central Normal
							College for several years. Messrs, Trotter and Pattison then studied law together and
							were admitted to the bar, and for nine years, under the name of Trotter &amp;
							Pattison, practiced law and conducted an abstract, real estate, loan and insurance
							business. During the past ten years Mr. Trotter has been alone in the business, doing
							a probate business and a large real estate and loan business, selling many thousand
							acres of western land in North Dakota, Texas and other states. He also handles large
							real estate deals at home and <pb id="VAC1000-188" n="186"/> has platted and sold out
							many additions to towns and cities throughout the Central West. He has the largest
							loan business in the county, his loans amounting to three hundred thousand dollars a
							year. Besides making loans for corporations, he loans for one hundred and fifty
							private parties. He is financial correspondent for the Connecticut Mutual Life
							Insurance Company for this territory and inspects lands, examines titles, prepares all
							papers and closes the loans in his own office, making it possible in this way to close
							a loan on short notice. The companies which he represents are giving the cheapest
							money and on the best terms of any company loaning money in Indiana. In addition to
							his loaning business, he does a large amount of insurance business, having eleven of
							the best old-line fire insurance companies. He looks after his law, real estate, loan
							and insurance business and his farms and buildings with the aid of one office man, and
							he tries not to neglect the other things of life which he considers of importance.</p>

						<p>Mr. Trotter is now serving his fourth year as president of the Danville Commercial
							Club and has always devoted much of his time to its interests and the improvement of
							Danville. He is president of the Danville Canning Company and is a promoter and
							stockholder in the Danville Creamery. He is also president of the Danville South
							Cemetery Association, president of the board of stewards of the Danville Methodist
							Episcopal church, and vice-president and director of the Capitol Circuit Traction
							Company. It was in Mr. Trotter's office that the company was organized that built the
							interurban railroad from Indianapolis to Danville, and he was a director and its
							secretary until it was sold to a Boston syndicate. He was the engineer, surveyor and
							superintendent of construction in full charge of the road when it was sold. He is now
							interested in two other roads, which he hopes to see built before long</p>

						<p>Mr. Trotter, by native gift of what we call enterprise and diplomacy, and by hard
							work all the time from childhood, all through the years of his life, has developed an
							accuracy for details, a versatility in knowledge of business and affairs of small and
							large concern that make him a ready, a quick, a judicious and a decidedly big man in
							the business world. His experience on the farm as a boy doing all kinds of farm work,
							his ten years in the surveyor's office, his railroad building, his inspection of land
							for loans for many companies, his traveling in many states in the Union and in Mexico
							and Canada, have awakened in him a great interest in lands and farm property, and he
							deems it the safest and most stable investment that can be made. He is now the owner
							of nearly eight hundred acres of land in <pb id="VAC1000-189" n="187"/> Central
							Indiana, which he is farming, besides about eighteen hundred acres of Texas and North
							Dakota land which he believes will soon develop into fine farms, as the country in
							which these lands are located is rapidly developing. He classes himself among the
							farmers and stock raisers of this country and makes a specialty of stock raising and
							general diversified farming. Governor Marshall, recognizing his interests in
							agricultural affairs, appointed him as a delegate from this congressional district to
							the National Farm Land Congress, in Chicago, November 16 to 21, 1909. He has always
							been a progressive of progressives. When he bought the building known as the Trotter
							block, in Danville, he put an army of carpenters, masons, painters, paper hangers,
							plumbers and electricians at work and remodeled and modernized the building until he
							had a three-story building that for comfort, convenience, beauty and desirability for
							modern offices and living rooms, would do credit to a city five times as large as
							Danville.</p>

						<p>Mr. Trotter was married to Mary E. Jeffers in 1887, and he gives a large share of the
							credit of his success in all his enterprises to her aid as an untiring worker at the
							practical affairs of life and to her encouragement. They have worked together through
							all these years as true helpmates and their home life has been ideal. Mr. Trotter has
							always taken an active interest in church affairs, and for fourteen years has been
							teacher of the largest Bible class in Hendricks county, teaching the normal class in
							which the students of Central Normal College, to the number of over two hundred, are
							enrolled yearly. These students are young men and women from every county in the state
							and from many other states, many being teachers in this and other states. He numbers
							his pupils in his class by thousands and regards this as his best work and productive
							of the most pleasure and profit. He was a Sunday school superintendent when only
							eighteen years of age at North Salem, and has been superintendent or assistant
							superintendent of the Danville Methodist Sunday school for twenty-three years.</p>

						<p>Fraternally, Mr. Trotter is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, to
							which order he has belonged for the past twenty-seven years, joining the Danville
							Silcox Lodge in 1887. He is also a member of the encampment and Rebekahs. Mr. Trotter
							is a man of vigorous mentality and strong mental fiber and finds these qualities the
							chief factors in the carving out of a career that has been above suspicion and
							reproach and of honor to the county which he so ably and acceptably serves as a public
							and private citizen.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">TAVNER NEAL.</hi></head>

						<p>One of the sterling citizens of Hendricks county, who is today filling an important
							position, is Tavner Neal, the efficient superintendent of the Hendricks county poor
							farm, who was born in Bourbon county, Kentucky. His parents were Charles W. and Emma
							S. (Bradley) Neal.</p>

						<p>Tavner Neal has been one of those self-made men who have risen to prominence solely
							because of their own industry and perseverance. When he was married he and his wife
							started to housekeeping in a log cabin, built at the northwest corner of his father's
							farm. This little square log cabin speaks eloquently of the early delays when they
							started their married life. They lived there for about two years, when they moved to
							their present home three and one-half miles southeast of Brownsburg, and there lived
							until March 1, 1914. He then took his present position as superintendent of the county
							poor farm. Starting out with nothing in life, he has accumulated a farm of one hundred
							and thirty-three acres in Lincoln township, and has taken a great deal of interest in
							the breeding of live stock of various kinds. He not only raises live stock but he has
							dealt largely in poultry. He raises pedigreed Jersey cattle, Berkshire hogs, and for
							several years has made a specialty of pure bred Barred Rock chickens. He is regarded
							as an expert chicken fancier and has taken many premiums at various fairs and exhibits
							in his county and other counties in the state. He is a member of the American
							Berkshire Record Association, and for the past twenty years has belonged to the
							American Poultry Association, as well as the American Barred Plymouth Rock
							Association. He is a progressive and well informed farmer and lectures frequently at
							farmers' institutes and has the honor of raising one hundred and six and one-half
							bushels of corn to the acre at a time when average crops in his community were about
							twelve bushels to the acre. When he came to his farm it was exhausted from consecutive
							cropping and in very poor condition. He has not only reclaimed his land, which was
							practically useless, but has conserved the food element in his soil. He knows, to
							begin with, that an ounce of fertilizer as a preventive against soil exhaustion is
							worth a pound of fertilizer for soil reclamation. On this basic principle he plans his
							crops and plants in rotation to the end that the continuous growth of one variety of
							crop on the same ground will not rob it of its plant food elements. Clover naturally
							follows corn, or some similar rotation, and the land remains fertile and only a
							minimum amount of fertilizer is required. Not many years ago land in Indiana in more
							than one part of the state was <pb id="VAC1000-191" n="189"/> "corned" to death. Crop
							after crop of corn was planted until corn no longer thrived. Now it is rare indeed to
							find a farmer who plants corn in the same field twice in succession. He insists that
							at least one crop of some other farm produce must intervene between two corn
							plantings.</p>

						<p>In 1885 Mr. Neal was married to Annie Turpin, the daughter of Anderson and Eveline
							(Reupert) Turpin, of Kentucky. Anderson Turpin was born in Bourbon county, Kentucky,
							the son of Robison and Rachel (Powell) Turpin. Robison Turpin was the son of Jacob and
							Martha Turpin, and his birth occurred in Bourbon county, Kentucky, on April 7, 1805,
							and in 1820 he moved to Scott county, in that state. In 1834, Robison Turpin sold his
							farm in Kentucky and moved to Indiana, where he bought two hundred and five acres of
							land in the eastern edge of Hendricks county, near Brownsburg.</p>

						<p>The Turpin family trace their ancestry back as far as Jacob Turpin, who was born in
							eastern Maryland in 1785, the son of William and Nancy (Henley) Turpin, who were
							married in Maryland in 1783. Jacob Turpin's grandfather was a soldier in the
							Revolutionary War and lived until he was more than one hundred years old. In 1786
							William and Nancy Turpin moved to Kentucky and settled among the hostile Indians, and
							were compelled to live in block houses with other settlers in order to protect
							themselves from the Indians. Jacob Turpin married Martha Taylor in Bourbon county,
							Kentucky, in 1804, she being born in that county in 1786, of Scotch parentage. In 1820
							they moved to Scott county, that state, and bought a farm and in the same year sold it
							and moved to Indianapolis when it was a town of seven hundred people. In 1829 Jacob
							Turpin and his wife moved to Hendricks county, settling near Clermont, where there was
							a cabin, log stable and five or six acres already partly cleared. Jacob Turpin died in
							1849 and his wife in 1865. They had one son, Robison Turpin, born in 1805, in Bourbon
							county, Kentucky, who was married in 1827 to Rachel Powell, also a native of Kentucky,
							her birth having occurred there in 1807. Robison Turpin was engaged in farming in that
							state until 1834, when he sold out his holdings in Kentucky and came to Indiana,
							purchasing two hundred and five acres of land in Hendricks county, where he became one
							of the most prosperous and successful farmers of that day. He was a man of excellent
							business ability and judgment and when his death occurred on January 30, 1905, he was
							sincerely mourned by his community, having won the esteem and confidence of all by his
							straightforward and honorable life. Robison Turpin and wife were the parents of ten
							children, Anderson, the father of Mrs. Neal, being the third child. Anderson Turpin
							was born in Scott county, <pb id="VAC1000-192" n="190"/> Kentucky, on October 2, 1831,
							and came with his parents to Indiana in 1834. He was married to Louisa Eveline
							Reupert, who was a native of Georgetown, Kentucky, her birth having occurred there in
							1835. Anderson Turpin lived and died a farmer, passing away at Brownsburg, this
							county, in 1905. His wife lived until May, 1913.</p>

						<p>Mr. Neal lends his hearty support to the Democratic party, and has been very active
							in the affairs of that political organization. He and the members of his family are
							faithful attendants of the Methodist Episcopal church and lend to it their zealous
							support. They are the parents of two children, Chester and Bertha. Chester married
							Grace Phillips and lives near his father's old home south of Brownsburg, and has one
							son, Marley. Bertha is still at home with her parents.</p>

						<p>In his fraternal relations Mr. Neal has long been a member of the Independent Order
							of Odd Fellows and the Tribe of Ben-Hur. He is a man who has always been a hard worker
							and is highly esteemed by his neighbors because he has been a busy man. Judged by his
							labors, none have done more to advance the material interests of his section of the
							county, and as a citizen no one stands higher in the esteem and confidence of the
							people of Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>It is the progressive, wide-awake man of affairs who makes the real history of a
							community and his influence as a potential factor of the body politic is difficult to
							estimate. The example such men furnish of patient purpose and steadfast integrity only
							illustrate what is in the power of each to accomplish, and there is always a full
							measure of satisfaction in adverting even in a casual way to their achievements in
							advancing the interests of their fellow men, and in giving strength and solidity to
							the institutions which make so much for the prosperity of the community. Such a man is
							the worthy subject of this sketch, and as such it is proper that his career be
							accorded a place among the representative citizens of the county in which he has lived
							for so many years. As a merchant and as a county official he has made his mark in the
							community and in the county where he has lived as a man of more than ordinary ability,
							and it is believed that a study of the life of such a man by the youth of the county
							will be an inspiration which will help them in their future careers.</p>

						<p>Charles E. Edwards, the present county clerk of Hendricks county, was <pb
								id="VAC1000-193" n="191"/> born August 29, 1871, on a farm in Clay township, between
							Amo and Coatesville. His parents were Solomon D. and Mary (Hornaday) Edwards, his
							father being a native of this county, and his mother a native of Morgan county, this
							state. Solomon Edwards is still living on the old home farm in Clay township, where he
							and his wife lived the simple lives of farmers all their lives. They are the parents
							of six children, all of whom are living: Minnie B., the wife of William O. Brown, of
							Clay township; Roscoe, a farmer of Clay township, who married Bertha Kendall; Charles
							E., the immediate subject of this sketch; Myrtle, the wife of Walter Hodgson, a farmer
							of Clay township; Maude L., the wife of Virley Moon, a rural route carrier out of Amo;
							John A., who is a merchant in Danville, who married Mary Wills. The mother of these
							children was called to rest April 13, 1914. She was a good Christian and lived a life
							above reproach, and no mother could have been more kind and loving. Her thoughts were
							always of others and self was forgotten. Quiet and retiring in manner, yet she exerted
							a potent influence for good over those with whom her life was spent.</p>

						<p>Charles Edwards spent his boyhood days in the manner which is customary with all
							farmers' lads, attending school in the winter months, and working on the farm during
							the summer months. He attended the country schools until he reached the eighth grade
							and then took the last year of his common school course in the graded schools at
							Coatesville. With the idea of preparing himself for the teaching profession, he
							attended the State Normal School at Terre Haute in the spring of 1890. Following this
							he taught for three years in the Coatesville schools, where he made a successful
							record as an instructor. He afterwards took some work in the Central Normal College at
							Danville. However, the call of business was not to be denied and he engaged in the
							mercantile business at Coatesville in his father-in-law's store, and upon the death of
							his father-in-law, became the manager of the store. Subsequently he became interested
							in the milling company at Coatesville and managed this plant for one and one-half
							years, at the expiration of which time he sold it out and bought a grocery and
							queensware business in Danville, which he conducted for ten years. Upon his election
							as county clerk in 1910, he sold his store and became interested with Otis E. Gully in
							the real estate and loan business. He was elected county clerk of Hendricks county in
							November, 1910, on the Republican ticket, with a handsome majority at a time when part
							of his ticket was defeated. In the conduct of the affairs of his office, which he
							assumed on July 27, 1912, he has proved himself an able and efficient administrator of
							the public's affairs and is making an enviable <pb id="VAC1000-194" n="192"/> record
							as one of the most popular officials who have ever held office in Hendricks
							county.</p>

						<p>Mr. Edwards was married December 23, 1894, to Ida A. Job, the eldest daughter of
							Allen and Nettie Job, of Coatesville. Her father was one of the leading merchants in
							that part of the county. To this union have been born two daughters: Pauline, who is
							now sixteen years of age and a junior in the high school at Danville, and Mary
							Jeannette, who is thirteen years of age and completing her common school work this
							year. Mr. Edwards and all the members of his family are consistent and loyal adherents
							of the Methodist Episcopal church. Mr. Edwards has been a member of the board of
							stewards of this denomination for many years. Fraternally, he is a member of the
							Knights of Pythias and Silcox Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.</p>

						<p>Mr. Edwards is interested in the real estate and loan business with Otis E. Gulley
							under the firm name of Gulley &amp; Edwards and also has land interests scattered
							throughout the county. He was a member of the Danville school board for five years and
							resigned that position when he became county clerk. Mr. Edwards is a man of splendid
							business qualifications, which, combined with his courtesy, genial disposition and
							unfailing good nature, have commended him to the good will and friendship of all who
							know him. His life is the record of a well balanced mental and moral constitution. In
							all of life's relations he has been true and faithful to himself and all the trusts
							reposed in him and thereby he has won the unqualified confidence and respect of his
							fellow men.</p>

						<p>It is a well attested maxim that the greatness of a community or a state lies not in
							the machinery of government, nor even in its institutions, but rather in the sterling
							qualities of the individual citizen, in his capacity for high and unselfish effort and

						<p>Everett R. Robards, banker, merchant, farmer and stock breeder of Stilesville, was
							born in that place on November 17, 1865, the son of Casper and Mary Elizabeth
							(Matlock) Robards, the father a native of Owen county, Indiana, his birth having
							occurred on September 1, 1830, and his mother a native of Stilesville, having been
							born there in 1843. Casper Robards was deputy treasurer of Morgan county, Indiana,
							from 1850 to 1855, and in 1856 established the first drug store in Stilesville. In
							1866 he sold his drug store and engaged in the general merchandising business, which
							he continued until 1873, when his health failed and he sold out his mercantile
							business in that year. However, he continued to live in Stilesville until his death,
							which occurred on May 8, 1902. His wife, Mary E. Matlock, the daughter of James and
							Sarah Matlock, was only twenty-three years of age when her death occurred, leaving
							three small children: James, who died in 1864; Sarah Caroline, who died in 1865, and
							Everett R., the immediate subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>Everett R. Robards attended the common schools of Hendricks county and later took the
							two-years course then offered by the normal school at Danville. After leaving school
							he engaged in a general merchandising business in Stilesville and in 1899 he opened a
							private bank, which has proved to be very successful. As a business man Mr. Robards
							has won signal success along several different lines. As a banker he has been
							conducting a bank which has won the confidence of a large number of patrons. His
							well-stocked store in Stilesville is managed in such a way as to reflect great credit
							upon the owner. In addition to his banking and mercantile interests Mr. Robards also
							has farm lands in Hendricks, Morgan, Marion, Putnam and Scott counties, this state,
							and personally oversees all of them. Upon his farm in Hendricks county he breeds heavy
							draft horses, for which he finds a ready sale. In addition to all of these manifold
							duties, he has been the efficient trustee of Franklin township and has also served a
							term on the county council of Hendricks county. In every undertaking he has proven
							that close attention to business is sure to win success, when accompanied with strict
							integrity and high purposes.</p>

						<p>Mr. Robards was married to Addie A. Almond, the daughter of Hiram and Angeline
							(Ellis) Almond, on November 29, 1899, and to this union there have been born two
							children, Mary Elizabeth and Everett Almond. Mrs. Robards was one of four children,
							the other three being Orville, who married Daisy Howard; Etta, who married K. E.
							Faucette, and they have <pb id="VAC1000-197" n="194"/> one child, Warner; and Ethel,
							who married W. R. Robertson, and they have two children, James and Russell.</p>

						<p>Mr. Robards was formerly a Republican, but in the split which occurred in that party
							in 1912 he espoused the Progressive cause, believing that in this new party there were
							better hopes for the future. He has always taken an active interest in the political
							issues of the day and even sacrificed his personal affairs in order to serve his party
							in office. Fraternally, he is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons, belonging to
							Larrabee Lodge, No. 131. He and the members of his family are adherents of the
							Christian church of Stilesville and contribute generously to its support. The life
							which Mr. Robards has led has indeed been a busy one, but through it all he has kept
							his self respect and the tongue of censure has never had any charges to bring against
							him. His clean life and -the honorable methods which he has used all these years in
							transacting his business affairs, have won for him a host of friends throughout the

						<p>Indiana has been especially honored in the character and career of her men of
							industry. In every section have been found men born to leadership in their vocation,
							men who have dominated because of their superior intelligence, natural endowment and
							force of character. It is always profitable to study such lives, weigh their motives
							and hold up their achievements as incentives to greater activity and higher excellence
							on the part of others. These reflections are suggested by the career of one who has
							forged his way to the front rank and who, by strong, inherent force and marked
							business ability, directed and controlled by an intelligent judgment, has stood for
							the last five years as one of the leading business men of Danville, Indiana.</p>
						<p>Thrown early upon his own resources, George A. Keeney set out with the avowed
							determination of securing an education and how well he has succeeded is shown in the
							brief sketch which follows. Through the common school, through the high school,
							through the normal, through the state university he worked his way, and through it all
							he was the same simple man we find him today. Although he has seen disappointments and
							many discouragements, yet his optimistic nature has always been to the front and this
							happy characteristic has made it possible for him to win the success which is so
							worthily his today. It is not often that the theoretical college man and <pb
								id="VAC1000-198" n="195"/> professor can go into the business world and make a
							success, and yet this is what Mr. Keeney has been able to do. The study of the career
							of such a man as this should be an inspiration to the young men who have to make their
							way in the world.</p>
						<p>George A. Keeney, of the hardware and implement concern known as The Danville
							Hardware Company, was born on a farm at Rainstown, Hendricks county, Indiana, June 28,
							1877. His childhood, youth and young manhood were spent in active work on the farm,
							which is the best school for practical knowledge for the young. There the boy,
							consciously or unconsciously, is a student of soil, climate, kinds of seed to be
							planted and methods of planting and harvesting, of the kinds of stock to be kept and
							cared for and used or raised for market. Mr. Keeney is naturally inclined to be a
							student of men and things and men's affairs, and his ambition to learn had ample vent
							in the study of the book of nature on the farm. Ambitious to train his mind and learn
							of history and science, he began early to inform himself from books as well as from
							nature. He was fortunate in being thrown upon his own resources and arose to the
							occasion by making his own way. He gained a much better education from the school than
							the average man because he worked for it. He earned money at whatever he could find to
							do, and worked his way through the high school two terms in Central Normal College and
							a four-year course in the Indiana State Normal and finally graduated from that
							institution. He then took two years at Indiana State University, graduating with the
							Bachelor of Arts degree, after which he took a term in the great Chicago University.
							He taught school for eight years, four years of this time in the country schools
							during his college life in order to earn money to pay his way. He was superintendent
							of the schools, one year at Pittsboro, one year at Clayton, and two years at North
							Salem, where he had seven subordinate teachers.</p>
						<p>He had a head for business, and accumulated money as a teacher, a thing that is done
							by too few of that worthy profession. In 1909 he bought a half interest in what was
							then the Leak &amp; Keeney hardware business at Danville and has been a student of
							that business since. His training has made it easy and the natural thing for him to
							devote energy to the business in hand. For him it is the natural thing to know the
							best and most modern in the varied and comprehensive lines of goods their large store
							carries, so that they can meet the demand for the tools and implements the farmer and
							builder use. His business and the needs and convenience of his customers is his study,

						<p>The men most influential in promoting the advancement of society and in giving
							character to the times in which they live are two classes, to-wit, the men of study
							and the men of action. Whether we are more indebted for the improvement of the age to
							the one class or the other is a question of honest difference in opinion; neither
							class can be spared and both should be encouraged to occupy their several spheres of
							labor and influence, zealously and without mutual distrust. In the following
							paragraphs are briefly outlined the leading facts and characteristics in the career of
							a gentleman who combines in his make-up the elements of the scholar and the energy of
							the public-spirited man of affairs. Devoted to the noble and humane work of teaching,
							he has made his influence felt in the school life of Hendricks county, and is not
							unknown to the wider educational circles of the state, occupying as he does a
							prominent place in his profession and standing high in the esteem of educators in
							other than his own particular field of endeavor.</p>

						<p>Professor M. S. Mahan, the present efficient superintendent of the Danville schools,
							was born in Sullivan county, Indiana, May 25, 1872. His parents were William and Emily
							(Phillips) Mahan, his father being a native of Kentucky and his mother of Indiana. His
							father followed the occupation of a farmer all his life, his death occurring in 1897,
							his wife having preceded <pb id="VAC1000-200" n="197"/> him in death several years
							previous, in 1888. Mr. and Mrs. William Mahan were the parents of seven children,
							three of whom are living: Samuel, of Terre Haute; William, who is living on the home
							farm, and Professor M. S. Mahan, the immediate subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>Professor Mahan is an excellent type of the man who devotes all of his time and
							energy to the noble profession of instructing the youth. Since he was six years of age
							there has not been a year in which he was not in the school room either as a student,
							or as an instructor of students. He received his elementary education in the district
							schools of his home county and then entered the graded school at Farmersburg, where he
							continued for two years. After one year's service as a country school teacher he came
							to the Central Normal College at Danville, where he remained for three years. This was
							followed by two years of successful teaching in Henry county in this state. The next
							two years found him in charge of a school in Hardinsburg, Washington county, Indiana.
							From here he went to Pleasantville, Sullivan county, this state, where he was
							principal of the schools for one year. He then lived at Orleans for the following six
							years, two of which were spent as principal of the schools, and four years as
							superintendent. He then went to the State University at Bloomington, where he remained
							in continuous residence until his graduation in June, 1907, with the degree of
							Bachelor of Arts. After his graduation from the university he was elected
							superintendent of the schools at Danville, Indiana, and has been in charge of these
							schools continuously since. Since taking charge of the schools in Danville he has
							practically revolutionized the course of study. He has added courses in domestic
							science, commercial work and manual training, and has seen the attendance nearly
							doubled. There are now two hundred and seventy pupils in the grades and one hundred
							and forty-five in the high school. All of the high school teachers but one are college
							graduates. He has also introduced a department of agriculture in order to meet the
							demand for this kind of work. In fact, the attendance has grown to such an extent that
							the present buildings are wholly inadequate to accommodate the pupils. It is
							interesting to note that he has brought about the changes in the courses of study
							without increasing the tax levy in Danville, a fact which should call for special
							mention. This has been made possible by the hearty co-operation of the town and
							Central Normal College in the employment of teachers for special courses. It is safe
							to say that no schools in the state have made as rapid or more efficient progress
							within the last three years than have the schools of Danville, and it is all due to
							the wise administration of Professor Mahan.</p>

						<p>Mr. Mahan was married to Gertrude Webb, at Orleans, Indiana, <pb id="VAC1000-201"
								n="198"/> November 26, 1902, and to this marriage there have been born two children,
							Margaret and Dwight, the latter deceased. Mr. and Mrs. Mahan are members of the
							Methodist Episcopal church, and he is a member of its official board. They both take
							an active part in church work and Professor Mahan is the teacher of the Bible class in
							his church.</p>

						<p>Fraternally, Mr. Mahan is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons. He is a member of
							the National Educational Association, the Indiana State Teachers' Association and the
							various local organizations pertaining to educational subjects. He is the present
							vice-president of the Indiana State Teachers' Association. Professor Mahan is a well
							educated, splendidly developed man and his work as an educator has for many years been
							of such a high standard of excellence that his position in the front rank of his
							profession is universally conceded. He keeps abreast of the times in advanced
							educational methods and is in hearty sympathy with the practical education which is
							demanded by the times. His influence for good in the community of Danville is
							incalculable and the work which he is doing quietly and unostentatiously makes him one
							of the most potent forces for good in the city of Danville.</p>

						<p>It is proper to judge of a man's success in life by the estimation in which he is
							held by his fellow citizens. They see him at work, in the family circle, in church,
							hear his views on public questions, observe the operation of his code of morals,
							witness how he conducts himself in all the relations of society and civilization, and
							are therefore competent to judge of his merits and demerits. After a long course of
							years of such daily observation, it would be out of the question for his neighbors not
							to know of his worth, for, as has been said, "actions speak louder than words." In
							this connection it is not too much to say that the subject of this sketch has passed a
							life of unusual honor, that he has been industrious and has the confidence of all who
							have the pleasure of his friendship.</p>

						<p>John S. Duckworth, the present county recorder of Hendricks county, Indiana, was born
							in North Salem, Eel River township, this county, on March 6, 1858. His parents were
							Pressley S. and Eliza (Woodward) Duckworth, his father being a native of Kentucky and
							his mother of this county. Pressley Duckworth was a farmer by occupation and came to
							Hendricks county about 1850 with his widowed mother, and settled one mile north of
							North Salem. <pb id="VAC1000-202" n="199"/> where he lived all of his life, his death
							occurring on April 13, 1872. His widow still survives him, and makes her home in North
							Salem. To Mr. and Mrs. Pressley Duckworth were born eight children: John S., the
							immediate subject of this sketch; Oliver E., of Jamestown, Indiana; James A., St.
							Louis; Mollie, deceased; Allie, deceased; Mrs. Maggie Ergenbright, of Kansas City;
							William, of North Salem, and Lizzie, deceased.</p>

						<p>John S. Duckworth was educated in the common schools of his home neighborhood and
							remained under the parental roof until he had attained his majority. In 1873, he went
							to work in a saw mill and followed this occupation for twenty years. Following this he
							engaged in teaming and farming until his election as county recorder of Hendricks
							county in November, 1906. His record during his first term of office was such that he
							was nominated for re-election and although he had three candidates against him he
							carried every township in the county but two and had a majority of more than five
							hundred. He has taken especial care to have all the records in his office bound and
							preserved and kept in the most approved manner. He is distinctly a man of the people,
							a man who has very little education, but who has that happy faculty of being able to
							make the very most of all of his possibilities. He is a hard worker and deservedly
							popular with all classes of people.</p>

						<p>John S. Duckworth was married October 23, 1883, to Nannie O'Rear, the daughter of Mr.
							and Mrs. Newton O'Rear, of Boone county, Indiana. To this union there have been born
							six children: Mabel C., deceased; Fred Allen, railroad employe at Indianapolis; George
							P., who lives in the West; Lela and Beulah, twins. Beulah is the wife of Carl White,
							of Jamestown, and Lela keeps house for her father, and has been his constant companion
							since her mother's death, August 10, 1897; Kenneth, the sixth and last child, died in
							infancy.</p>

						<p>Mr. Duckworth has always been a Republican in politics, and has been one of the most
							active men in the councils of his party for many years. His re-election to the office
							of county recorder shows the high esteem in which he is held by the citizens of his
							county. Fraternally, he is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons and the
							Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He holds membership in the Methodist Episcopal
							church of North Salem, and is a liberal contributor to its various needs. Personally,
							Mr. Duckworth is a man whom it is a pleasure to know, being generous-hearted, kind and
							helpful. He is honest in all his dealings with his fellow men and eminently worthy of
							representation in a work of this character, as he is one of Hendricks county's most
							valued citizens.</p>

						<p>The Union soldier during the great war between the states builded wiser than he knew.
							Through four years of suffering and wasting hardships, through the horrors of prison
							pens and amid the shadows of death, he laid the superstructure of the greatest temple
							ever erected and dedicated to human freedom. The world looked on and called those
							soldiers sublime, for it was theirs to reach out and strike the chains from off the
							slave, preserve the country from dissolution, and to keep unfurled to the breeze the
							only flag that ever made tyrants tremble and whose majestic stripes and scintillating
							stars are still waving universal liberty to all the earth. For all these unmeasured
							deeds the living present can never repay them. Pensions and political power may be
							thrown at their feet; art and sculpture may preserve upon canvas and in granite and
							bronze their unselfish deeds; history may commit to books and cold type may give to
							the future the tale of their sufferings and triumphs; but to the children of the
							generations yet unborn will it remain to accord the full measure of appreciation and
							undying remembrance of the immortal character carved out by the American soldiers in
							the dark days of the early sixties, numbered among whom was the gentleman whose name
							appears at the head of this sketch.</p>

						<p>Among the most highly respected citizens of Hendricks county, Indiana, is George W.
							Scearce, who was born in Shelby county, Kentucky, March 19, 1843. His parents were
							Ezra W., born in 1808, and Martha (Shepherd) Scearce, born in 1809, both of whom were
							natives of Kentucky. Ezra W. Scearce was a farmer and came to Indiana in March, 1851,
							locating a half mile southwest of Danville, where he lived until his death, which
							occurred March 30, 1885. Ezra Scearce was a great student of the Bible, a consistent
							member of the Universalist church, and was a man of high ideals and of a philosophic
							bent of mind. Mr. and Mrs. Ezra Scearce were the parents of seven children, only one
							of whom is living, George W. The six deceased children are James, Elizabeth, John N:,
							Johanna K., William W. and Curtis.</p>

						<p>George W. Scearce spent his boyhood on his father's farm and received the education
							which was accorded to the children of his county in the period before the Civil War,
							which amounted to only a few months during the winter, and consisted of reading,
							writing and arithmetic. At an age when most of the boys of the present time are in
							high school, he left school to enter the army. When the war broke out he was only
							eighteen years of age, but his youth did not interfere with his plans for serving his
							country. At the <pb id="VAC1000-204" n="[]"/>
							<figure>
								<p rend="center">GEORGE W. SCEARCE</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-205" n="201"/> opening of the war he enlisted in Company K,
							Fifty-first Regiment Indiana Volunteers, and served three years and two months. During
							that time he was in thirty-one engagements, among the most famous battles in which he
							took part being Shiloh, Stone's River, Perryville, Franklin and Nashville. At the
							battle of Nashville, on December 16, 1864, he received a gunshot wound in his left
							hip. He was a prisoner of war for a short time, and was confined at Belle Isle, in the
							James river, near Richmond, Virginia. During part of his service his regiment was
							attached to General Streight's brigade and detailed to do field duty in destroying
							munitions of war and lines of communication. His brother, William W., was also a
							soldier in the war and was made a prisoner, being confined in the infamous Libby
							prison. He, in company with three others, escaped from this in the tunnel which has
							been made famous in history and successfully reached the Union lines. George W.
							Scearce was mustered in as a private, but was promoted to second lieutenant and from
							June 19, 1863, until the close of the war he held the rank of captain, being promoted
							to that rank when he was twenty years of age.</p>

						<p>Upon being mustered out of service Mr. Scearce returned to his father's farm in
							Hendricks county, Indiana. On December 7, 1865, he was united in marriage to Sophia
							Chamberlin, who was a native of Madison, Indiana, and to this union were born five
							children: Harry C., of Mooresville, Indiana; Edwin A., a farmer living near Danville,
							this county; Martha L.; Bertha E., and Grace K., wife of C. V. Cook, assistant cashier
							of the First National Bank, of Danville. After his marriage Mr. Scearce took charge of
							the old homestead farm, where he lived until 1911, when he moved to Danville. Previous
							to leaving the farm for the city of Danville, he built a fine modern home in this
							city, where he now lives a retired life, surrounded by all modern conveniences and
							comforts. He has been a resident of Hendricks county for sixty-three years, having
							arrived in this county on the day he was eight years of age, and has lived to see the
							little village of Danville grow to become the flourishing little city which it is
							today.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Scearce is a life-long Republican and has always been more or less
							interested in politics. During the eighties he served as trustee of Center township
							and rendered faithful and efficient service to his fellow citizens during that time.
							He assisted in organizing the Farmers Co-operative Insurance Company, of Hendricks
							county, and was its secretary-treasurer for fifteen years. For the past twenty years
							he has been president of this insurance company, and is now acting in that capacity.
							He has the honor of being the oldest Odd Fellow in Danville in point of continuous
							membership, <pb id="VAC1000-206" n="202"/> having joined the lodge in 1864, when he
							was home from the war on a furlough. He is also a loyal member of the Grand Army of
							the Republic and takes an active interest in the affairs of the post in Danville. His
							religious affiliations are with the Methodist Episcopal church, of which he has been a
							trustee and a member of the board of stewards for many years. He has always been a
							strong advocate of temperance, and in all the movements of his county which have had
							for their object the extermination of the liquor traffic he has always taken an active
							part. He was president of the organization at Danville which routed the saloons from
							that city. Though past the psalmist's allotted span of years, Mr. Scearce still
							retains to a remarkable extent his physical and mental vigor and takes a deep interest
							in all the current affairs of the community, being numbered among the enterprising men
							of this section of the state. He has worked hard and accomplished much, and because of
							his past efforts he is thoroughly entitled to representation in a work of the
							character of the one in hand.</p>

						<p>Indiana was not lacking in loyalty during the dark days of the Rebellion, and no
							governor in all the northern states was more prompt or rendered more efficient service
							to President Lincoln than did Governor Morton. When the ship of state was almost
							stranded on the rocks of disunion, Indiana came to the front and contributed over two
							hundred thousand brave and valiant men to assist in preserving the integrity of the
							government. Prominent among the citizens of Hendricks county who served their country
							faithfully and well were Sylvanus Mabe and his father, James M. Mabe. Although they
							enlisted from Brown county, this state, they have made their home in Hendricks county
							for many years, the father having answered the last roll call several years ago. Today
							there is in Hendricks county no old soldier who is more widely and favorably known and
							none that can boast of a more honorable record than Sylvanus Mabe. He was loyal to his
							country in its hour of peril and extremity, and demonstrated on many a bloody battle
							field that he was ready to fight and even die for his country.</p>

						<p>Sylvanus Mabe, the son of James M. and Anna (Noblet) Mabe, was born in Brown county,
							Indiana, May 31, 1844. James M. Mabe was born October 23, 1820, in Stokes county,
							North Carolina, and died March 5, 1896, in Hendricks county, Indiana. He was one of
							six children, the others being <pb id="VAC1000-207" n="203"/> Bettie, Mrs. Mary
							Williamson, Mrs. Ruth Clark, William F., and Mrs. Nancy Medlock. When James M. Mabe
							was about ten years of age he moved with his parents to Brown county, Indiana, where
							he and his father entered land from the government. He never had any schooling except
							what he picked up in the wide field of experience, since he never had any opportunity
							of attending a school in Brown county while he was a lad. Sylvanus Mabe and his
							father, with their families, lived in Brown county until 1892, when they moved to
							Hendricks county. James M. Mabe enlisted in Company H, of the Eighty-second Regiment
							Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and served from the date of his enlistment, September 18,
							1862, until the close of the war. He was present at the Grand Review at Washington, D.
							C., in the spring of 1865. His son, Sylvanus, also enlisted, serving from August 20,
							1861, until about the close of the war. He was only seventeen years of age when he
							enlisted in Company C, of the Sixth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, which was
							made a part of the Army of the Cumberland. He was engaged in the battle of Shiloh, the
							seige of Corinth and all of those engagements which were fought by Grant in Tennessee
							and Mississippi. His regiment was later transferred to the eastern part of Tennessee,
							where he fought in the battles of Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge,
							and in the last named battle he was wounded, being struck by pieces of shell in the
							right knee, incapacitated from further service and within the next six months he was
							mustered out at Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>James M. and Anna (Noblet) Mabe reared a large family of thirteen children: Sylvanus;
							Hiram, who died at the age of twenty-six; Vandever, deceased April 13, 1909, a member
							of Company D, Forty-third Indiana Volunteer Infantry, married Jeannette Anthony;
							William; Williamson, deceased; Levi, who died when small; Cyrus, deceased; Mary Jane,
							the wife of A. D. Handcher; Margaret, the wife of Oliver Craig; James, deceased;
							David, who married Etta Gates, and two who died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Sylvanus Mabe received a very limited common school education in the district schools
							of Brown county before he enlisted in the war at the early age of seventeen. After
							returning home from the war he and his father continued farming on the old homestead,
							where he remained until his marriage, March 14, 1869, when he began farming for
							himself in Brown county. In 1874 he moved to Nebraska and remained there for two
							years, after which he came to Clay township, in this county, and settled on a rented
							farm of fifty acres, which he operated for the next thirteen years. He was a
							hard-working man who attended strictly to his own affairs and by thrift and economy he
								<pb id="VAC1000-208" n="204"/> succeeded in saving enough to purchase a small farm.
							After he had once made a start he added to his land holdings until at the present time
							he is the owner of two hundred and eighty acres of fine land in Clay township. His
							success can be attributed only to hard work and upright dealings in all of his
							business transactions.</p>

						<p>Mr. Mabe married Harriet C. Bartholomew, the daughter of Eli and Mamie M. (Fuller)
							Bartholomew, and to this union there have been born two children, Eli and Lorenzo F.
							Eli, a farmer living at Pecksburg, in this county, married Lora McCormick and has one
							daughter, Mabel. Lorenzo F., a miller and implement dealer living at Clayton, in this
							county, married Rilla Hurley, and they have one child, Lorenzo Lyle. Mrs. Mabe's
							parents had a family of eight children: Ira, the wife of Zibil Baldwin; John, who
							married Savannah Lewis; Augustus, deceased May 30, 1864; Cyrus, who married Sarah
							Handcher; Pamelia, who married William Cox; Harriet, "the wife of Mr. Mabe; Polly,
							deceased 1849; Maria, deceased. Mrs. Mabe's mother died November 29, 1873. Mrs. Mabe's
							father died July 16, 1891, in this county. The grandparents of Mrs. Mabe on her
							mother's side were natives of Trumbull county, Ohio, and had a family of four
							children, Abial, Mary, Eli, and a Mrs. Scofield.</p>

						<p>Mr. Mabe is a stanch Democrat, and has voted this ticket for a half century. While he
							has always taken an interest in political affairs he has never aspired to any public
							office, preferring to devote all of his time and attention to his agricultural
							interests. He is a member of the Grand Army of the Republic and is one of the most
							active members of the post at Danville. Mr. Mabe has won an honorable name for himself
							in this county, because of his upright life and he and his wife are valuable members
							of society in this county.</p>

						<p>The history of a county or state is chiefly a chronicle of the deeds and lives of
							those who have conferred honor and dignity upon the society of that county or state.
							The world judges the character of a community by those of its representative citizens
							and yields its tribute of admiration and respect to those whose words and actions
							constitute the record of a state or county's prosperity or pride. Among the prominent
							citizens of Hendricks county, Indiana, who have long since passed away, but who in
							their day took a prominent part in the life of the community in which they lived are
							Edom <pb id="VAC1000-209" n="205"/> R. Hadley and his son, Milton M. Hadley. This
							father and son were good men and good citizens in the highest sense of the term and
							the locality in which they lived suffered an irreparable loss when they passed away.
							They were useful citizens of the commonwealth, men who were deeply interested in the
							welfare and social uplift of their fellow citizens, men who stood for the highest
							ideals of citizenship and all that it means. The brief history of their lives which is
							here given can be nothing more than a poor tribute to their worth as men who did their
							duty as God gave them the power to so do.</p>

						<p>Edom R. Hadley, the son of James and Mary (Richardson) Hadley, was born in North
							Carolina in 1819, and when six years of age, came to Hendricks county, Indiana. with
							his parents, and settled two and one-half miles west of Danville on Mill creek. There
							his father entered land from t-he government and at the time of his death owned six
							hundred acres. Here in the wilderness and amidst pioneer conditions which have long
							since disappeared, Edom R. Hadley grew to manhood and here married Louisiana Vannice,
							daughter of Peter and Sallie (Smith) Vannice. She was born in Lincoln county,
							Kentucky, February 7, 1829, and came with her parents when she was three years of age
							to this county, where they located in the northwestern part of Marion township, near
							the Putnam county line. Peter Vannice entered land from the government and lived on
							his farm of two hundred acres until his death, which occurred in 1888, on February
							9th, his wife dying three days later. It is interesting to note that had they lived
							until the 14th of the same month, they would have been married sixty years. Peter
							Vannice and wife reared a large family of eleven children, only five of whom are now
							living: Mrs. Joan Allen, who lives in Iowa; Samuel, of the same state; Mrs. Sarah
							Ferguson, of Chicago, Illinois; Mrs. Ella Hawkins, of Indianapolis; and Mrs. Louisiana
							Hadley, the widow of the late Edom R. Hadley. Mrs. Hadley grew to womanhood at a time
							when none of the modern conveniences were to be had; no pianola was found in the
							parlor at that time, the music then in the evenings being furnished by the wolves,
							which roamed the forests and howled around the log cabin. For fourteen years after
							their marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Edom R. Hadley lived one mile west of Danville, at which
							time they moved to the present home farm of two hundred and eighty acres, three miles
							north of New Winchester. On this farm Mr. Hadley died in March, 1888, having lived a
							full and complete life in every sense of the word. He and his wife were members of the
							Cumberland Presbyterian church and to this church he gave his conscientious service.
							Three children were born to bless their union: Jennie, the wife of George W. House, of
							Danville, who is the mother of three children, Ida, Nettie and <pb id="VAC1000-210"
								n="206"/> George; Milton M., whose history is reviewed later in this article;
							Charles L., who married Jennie Kurtz, and lived on a farm two and one-half miles west
							of Danville until his death; he left two children, Dovie and Myrtle.</p>

						<p>Milton M. Hadley was born December 21, 1857, one mile north of Danville, and grew to
							manhood on the homestead farm north of New Winchester. After finishing the common and
							high school course at New Winchester, he entered Lincoln University at Lincoln,
							Illinois, from which institution he graduated in 1883, with the degree of Master of
							Arts. In 1887 he married Mary Fielding, a lady whom he met while attending school at
							Lincoln College. They entered the freshman class there together and their friendship
							ripened into love and this was consummated by their marriage after they left college.
							Mrs. Hadley was born in Chandlerville, Illinois, the daughter of James and Elizabeth
							(Briar) Fielding. Her father was a native of England, where his birth occurred in the
							city of Manchester, and here he lived until he was eleven years of age. According to
							the custom in his home town in England he attended school the year round, but leaving
							his native country at the age of eleven with his parents to come to America, his
							education stopped at that time. However, he was a well read man and was an omnivorous
							reader all his life. His parents, whose names also were James and Elizabeth, came to
							America and settled fourteen miles east of Beardstown, Illinois, on a farm and there
							they lived the remainder of their lives. Mary Fielding grew up in Illinois and it was
							while attending Lincoln University that she met her future husband. For a time after
							their marriage they lived in Kansas City, but they soon tired of city life and moved
							to Marion township in this county, where he resumed farming and followed this
							occupation until his death, December 23, 1895. They had one son, Harry, who was born
							August 11, 1888, and is now attending the University of Illinois, where he will
							receive his doctor's degree in commercial chemistry in June, 1914. Harry Hadley
							graduated from the Danville high school and then from James Milliken University with
							the degree of Bachelor of Science. The next year he took his Master of Arts degree in
							chemistry at the University of Illinois and will take his Doctor of Philosophy degree
							there this year. He is doing special research work in chemistry for the university and
							has a very promising future before him.</p>

						<p>Milton M. Hadley was a man of exceptionally strong character, clean minded, and a man
							whom to know was to love. He was elected a ruling elder in the Presbyterian church in
							1892, and at the time of his death was superintendent of the Sunday school and
							president of the Christian Endeavor.</p>

						<p>Thus is shown in brief outline the careers of two men, father and son, <pb

						<p>The gentleman whose name forms the caption of this sketch belongs to that class of
							men who win in life's battles by earnest endeavor, coupled with good judgment and in
							whatever he has undertaken he has shown himself to be a man of ability and honor. He
							has always been ready to lend his aid in defending principles affecting the public
							good, having ably and conscientiously served his county in the capacity of a public
							school teacher for twenty years, while in other phases of civic life he has so ordered
							his actions as to earn the endorsement and support of his fellow citizens.</p>

						<p>John N. Phillips, the cashier of the First National Bank of Amo, was born two miles
							southwest of Amo on June 24, 1855. His parents were Samuel and Rachel (Newman)
							Phillips, of North Carolina. His grandfather, John S. Phillips, was born in
							Pennsylvania in 1776. His great-grandfather, John Phillips, was a native of Germany
							and went to North Carolina about 1789, taking his family with him, and his death
							occurred shortly after settling in that state. The children of the grandfather, John
							S. Phillips, came to Indiana in the thirties and located in Wayne county, where he
							afterwards joined them and died about 1832. Samuel Phillips, the father of the subject
							of this sketch, came to Hendricks county, Indiana, about 1836, where all of his
							children were born and reared. Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Phillips were the parents of nine
							children, two of whom died in infancy.</p>

						<p>John N. Phillips was the sixth child in order of birth of his father's family and was
							reared as a farmer's lad, receiving his elementary education in the district schools
							and completing it by taking a course in the Central Normal College at Danville. As a
							boy he showed unusual intelligence and his parents were anxious to give him the best
							possible education. After completing his course in the college at Danville he became a
							public school teacher and followed that noble profession for the next twenty years,
							during which time he was rated as one of the most successful teachers of Hendricks
							county In 1898 he retired from the teaching profession and for eight years he was
							engaged in the lumber business and farming. Then he, with others, organized the First
							National Bank of Amo, the organization articles being dated <pb id="VAC1000-212"
								n="208"/> January 20, 1906. Its present officers are as follows: E. B. Owen,
							president; George W. Christie, vice-president; J. N. Phillips, cashier; Miller E.
							Kendall, assistant cashier. The bank now has a capital stock of twenty-five thousand
							dollars.</p>

						<p>Mr. Phillips was married August 21, 1879, to Joanna Ratliff of Hendricks county, the
							daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Isaac Ratliff, an old and highly respected family of that
							county. Mr. and Mrs. Phillips are the parents of one daughter, Elsie, who married Otis
							Rammel. Mr. Phillips is a member of the Friends church and an active worker in all the
							activities of that denomination, being especially interested in the Sabbath school
							work. Mr. Phillips is a man whom to know is to respect, and during his career in this
							county he has led a life which has been free from censure of any kind. He has always
							been ready to aid in the moral or material welfare of those who required assistance,
							and in every particular measures up to the highest ideals of the American citizen.</p>

						<p>It is a well recognized fact that the most powerful influence in shaping and
							controlling public life is the press. It reaches a greater number of people than any
							other agency and thus has always been used and, in the hands of persons competent to
							use it, always will be a most important factor in moulding public opinion and shaping
							the destiny of the nation. The gentleman to a brief review of whose life these few
							lines are devoted is prominently connected with the journalism of central Indiana, and
							at this time is editor and publisher of the Danville Gazette, one of the best
							Democratic papers of this section of the state in news, editorial ability and
							mechanical execution.</p>

						<p>Will A. King, the son of E. Douglas and Ruth (Warner) King, was born in Cincinnati,
							Ohio, May 5, 1864, and has lived in this county since he was fourteen years of age.
							His father was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, and came to Indiana in 1869 as editor
							of the <hi rend="i">Fort Wayne Sentinel</hi>, and also has the honor of publishing the
							first directory of that city. In February, 1878, he came to Danville and established
							the <hi rend="i">Hendricks County Democrat</hi> and in September, 1880, he started the
								<hi rend="i">Danville Gazette</hi>, taking his son, Will A., the subject of this
							sketch, into partnership with him. Shortly after starting the Gazette he accepted a
							position in the government printing office at Washington, D. C., and left his son in
							full charge of the paper.</p>

						<p>Will A. King received a good practical education and when a small boy entered the
							printing office of his father, who had been a printer and newspaper man for thirty
							years. Under the able guidance of the latter he acquired a through knowledge of the
							mechanical part of the business and, being a lad of keen ability, he was soon
							competent to assume the control of the paper and manage it from the editorial as well
							as the mechanical side. As has been said, he helped his father establish the <hi
								rend="i">Gazette</hi> in 1880 and he has been in charge of the paper up to the
							present time. It has for years been recognized as the official organ of the Democratic
							party in Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>Mr. King was married to Jennie Hill, the daughter of John C. and Sarah J. (Parker)
							Hill, and they have an interesting family of three children, Ruth A., Sarah J. and
							Robert H. They are fitting their children for their future careers by giving them the
							best possible education.</p>

						<p>In view of the fact that Mr. King has been the editor of the leading Democratic paper
							of the county for so many years, it is not strange that he has been a very important
							factor in the deliberations of his party. Probably no other man in the county has
							exerted as much influence in the councils of his party as has Mr. King, and it is to
							his credit that he always takes his stand on the side of clean politics. Personally,
							he is a man who easily makes friends and, being a newspaper man, has friends in every
							part of the county.</p>

						<p>Specific mention is made of many of the worthy citizens of Hendricks county within
							the pages of this book, citizens who have figured in the growth and development of
							this favored locality and whose interests are identified with its every phase of
							progress, each contributing in his sphere of action to the well-being of the community
							in which he resides and to the advancement of its normal and legitimate growth. Among
							this number is he whose name appears above, peculiar interest attaching to this career
							from the fact that for the past ten years he has been prominently identified with the
							banking business in North Salem, during which time he has also taken a prominent part
							min the civic and moral advancement of his community.</p>

						<p>Joseph B. Fleece, a banker of North Salem, was born near North Salem, July 24, 1866.
							His parents were Capt. Jacob and Lettie B. (Ashby) Fleece. The late Jacob H. Fleece
							was born near Danville, Kentucky, on June 4, 1829, and died in North Salem, November
							2, 1910, a devout Christian man who <pb id="VAC1000-215" n="210"/> was honored and
							respected by everyone. The parents of Captain Fleece were Charles and Mary (Harlan)
							Fleece, who came to this county from Kentucky and settled in Eel River township in
							1836. Here Captain Fleece was reared to manhood and in October, 1853, married Lettie
							B. Ashby, the daughter of Silas and Nancy (Radford) Ashby. Silas Ashby was the son of
							Thompson and Lettie (Van Meter) Ashby. The Ashby family is a remarkable family. They
							trace their ancestry back to England where for centuries they have been people of
							honor. Thompson Ashby was born in Virginia and at the age of fourteen, with two older
							brothers, came to Kentucky where he grew to manhood and then married Lettie Van Meter.
							Her father was given a large grant of land for his services in the Revolutionary War,
							but lost part of it by defective title. Thompson Ashby lived the remainder of his life
							in Kentucky, and upon his death his widow sold his farm and brought her children to
							Indiana and settled between Ladoga and Roachdale in Putnam county. There she entered
							land, managed wisely and reared her children to useful lives. They prospered and
							became large land owners and today their descendants are numerous about Ladoga and are
							among the most highly respected people of the various communities in which they live.
							Lettie N. Ashby, the wife of Capt. Jacob Fleece, was born and reared near Roachdale
							and lived there until her marriage. After his marriage, Captain Fleece and his
							brother. John engaged in the mercantile business at Ladoga in Montgomery county, but a
							year later he returned to his farm in Eel River township in this county. In 1859 he
							was elected county recorder of Hendricks county and served until the fall of 1861 when
							he resigned and entered the army. In September, 1861, he was commissioned captain of
							Company A. Fifty-first Regiment of Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and remained in the
							service as captain until his resignation in September, 1862. He then returned to this
							county and resumed farming. In 1882 he was elected to represent this county in the
							lower house of the State Legislature, and was re-elected in 1884 and again in 1886,
							serving six years in the Legislature. He was a very successful farmer and at the time
							of his death owned two hundred and seventy acres of land, which he farmed until within
							the last fifteen years of his life when he moved to North Salem. He was a Mason and a
							member of the Grand Army of the Republic. lie and his wife belonged to the Christian
							church, in which he was an elder for many years. Captain and Mrs. Fleece were the
							parents of three children: Silas F.; Joseph B., whose history is herein presented; and
							Lulu C. Silas F. Fleece is in the hardware business at Tuxedo, the eastern part of
							Indianapolis. He married Francis Davis and had three children, Aletha, Alta and
							Verner. Lulu married L. <pb id="VAC1000-216" n="211"/> C. Moore, and lives on the home
							farm a mile west of North Salem. They have two children, Herbert and Maynard.</p>

						<p>Joseph B. Fleece grew up on the farm, attended the district schools and then took a
							course in a business college at Indianapolis. In 1888 he engaged in the merchandise
							business at North Salem in partnership with his brother-in-law, L. C. Moore, under the
							firm name of Moore &amp; Fleece. The firm continued in business for ten years, when it
							was dissolved and Mr. Fleece went to Indianapolis and entered the real estate
							business. Two years later he returned to North Salem and became interested in the
							North Salem Bank with Charles W. and George B. Davis and has continued in the banking
							business ever since. In addition to his banking interests, Mr. Fleece owns about two
							hundred acres of land in the southern part of Texas near Houston and Brownsville.</p>

						<p>Mr. Fleece was married in 1897 to Emma Williams, the daughter of Alexander and Martha
							(Griggs) Williams. Alexander Williams was born in Marion township, this county, June
							26, 1840, the son of James B. and Eliza (Ramsey) Williams. James B. Williams and his
							wife were born, reared and married in Kentucky, coming to this county in 1836 in
							wagons. They bought one hundred and twenty acres of land in Marion township from a man
							who had entered the land, but was not able to make any improvement. They started in
							the wilderness, built a real pioneer cabin of round logs, puncheon floor, clapboard
							roof and stick-and-mud chimney. Alexander Williams had two sisters and five brothers,
							of whom he is the only one living at the present time. His mother died when he was
							about fourteen years of age, and his father married Eliza Tamplin, who is now living
							near Danville with four children by his second marriage: Matilda, Sarah, Eleanor and
							Tilman. James B. Williams died in 1878. In October, 1863, Alexander Williams enlisted
							in Company B, One Hundred and Twenty-fourth Regiment of Indiana Volunteer Infantry and
							was immediately transferred to General Sherman's command in the Atlanta campaign.
							Later his company was ordered to return to .General George Thomas in Tennessee and was
							in the attack on Nashville, December, 1864, and followed Hood's army until they
							crossed the Tennessee river in the early part of 1865. Shortly afterwards his regiment
							was ordered to Washington, D. C., and was there compelled to camp in an open field
							without shelter in zero weather. Thence his regiment was taken by boat to the coast of
							North Carolina and landed at Moorhead City. His regiment was sent there in order to
							repair the railroad in North Carolina to connect Sherman with Virginia and ship him
							supplies. In North <pb id="VAC1000-217" n="212"/> Carolina he was in several
							skirmishes of a minor character. He took part in the Grand Review at Washington, D.
							C., in the summer of 1865 and was later mustered out at Indianapolis in July.
							Immediately after the close of the war he returned to Marion township and resumed
							farming. In 1871 he moved to Eel River township where he bought land and, by gradual
							addition, has now accumulated three hundred and twenty-one acres of land in that
							township. In 1907 he retired from active life and bought a home in North Salem, where
							he is now living a retired life. Alexander Williams was first married in January,
							1867, to Anna Fassett, the daughter of Isaac and Unity Fassett. To this union one son
							was born, Harry. His first wife died about fifteen days after the son was born. Harry
							now lives two miles north of North Salem on a farm. He married Pearl Speers and has
							one son, Aubry, who married August Gaines and lives on a farm north of Danville.
							Alexander Williams was married the second time in June, 1871, to Martha Griggs, the
							daughter of David and Emeline (Webster) Griggs. She was born in Clark county,
							Kentucky, and came to Marion township in this county, when she was a babe. To this
							second marriage five children were born: Emeline, the wife of Joseph B. Fleece. Anna,
							the widow of Clarence Bryant. Flora, who received a fine education, attending the
							State Normal at Terre Haute and later the State University at Bloomington. She taught
							several terms in Hendricks county, and also at Indianapolis, but is now making her
							home with her father in North Salem. Dicey, the wife of Frank Branch, lives at
							Stockton, California, and has three children, Helen, Doris and Frances. Urban L. lives
							on his father's farm. He married Lydia Davis, the daughter of Smith R. and Martha
							Davis, and has one son, Roger. The second wife of Mr. Williams died March 8, 1910.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Fleece are the parents of four interesting children, Pauline, Eugene,
							Maurice and Harlan. Mrs. Fleece is an accomplished musician and a pleasant woman in
							every way. For some years before her marriage, she was a teacher of instrumental
							music, having received her training in the music department of the Central Normal
							College at Danville. Mr. and Mrs. Fleece are loyal members of the Christian church and
							Mr. Fleece has been a deacon in the denomination for many years. He is a member of the
							Knights of Pythias. In the civic life of his community, Mr. Fleece has always taken an
							active interest, giving his support to all movements having for their object the
							advancement of the general welfare of his town and vicinity. He is a genial and
							agreeable man to meet and enjoys a justly merited popularity among his many

						<p>Among the strong and influential citizens of Hendricks county, Indiana, the record of
							whose lives have become an essential part of the history of this section, the
							gentleman whose name appears above occupies a prominent place and for years has
							exerted a beneficial influence in the locality where he resides. His chief
							characteristics are keenness of perception, a tireless energy, honesty of purpose and
							motive and everyday common sense, which has enabled him not only to advance his own
							interests, but also largely contribute to the moral and material advancement of the
							community.</p>

						<p>Charles P. Hornaday was born June 12, 1866, in Washington township, Hendricks county,
							Indiana. His parents were Anson D. and Sarah (Hanna) Hornaday, both of whom were
							natives of Indiana. Anson Hornaday was a farmer by occupation during all of his life
							and settled in Hendricks county in 1865, having come to this county from Indianapolis,
							where he had been a contractor. He engaged in agricultural pursuits in Washington
							township, and continued to reside there until his death, which occurred in 1908 at the
							age of eighty years. His widow is still living in Plainfield at the age of eighty-one.
							Anson Hornaday was a member of the Free and. Accepted Masons, and a member of the
							Methodist Episcopal church from his boyhood. Mr. and Mrs. Anson Hornaday were the
							parents of six children: Ella, deceased; James P., who is now the special
							correspondent of the Indianapolis News with headquarters at Washington City; Charles
							P., the immediate subject of this sketch; W. D., of Austin, Texas, where he is engaged
							in the newspaper business; Mrs. Mary L. Hadley, of Plainfield, and John, who died in
							infancy.</p>

						<p>Charles P. Hornaday was reared on the home farm and educated in the common schools,
							finishing his educational training at Plainfield Academy. He then took a course in the
							Indianapolis Business College, and after his graduation from that institution, engaged
							in the mercantile business in Indianapolis for a short time. In 1889 he came to
							Danville, where he followed the feed and grain business for two years. He next engaged
							in the grocery business and operated a grocery store for the next seventeen years, at
							the expiration of which time he retired from the grocery business and went to
							Indianapolis, where he engaged in the real estate business for three years. He then
							returned to Danville and in 1910 was appointed postmaster by President William H.
							Taft, a position which he held until 1914.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hornaday was married November 28, 1896, to Effie M. Blair, the <pb
								id="VAC1000-219" n="214"/> daughter of Clark Blair, of Washington township in this
							county. To this union there have been born four children, Howard B., Sarah Josephine,
							Mary Louise and Charles P., Jr. Mr. Hornaday is a Republican in his political views
							and has always taken an active interest in politics, although he had never held any
							public office until his appointment as postmaster of Danville. He is a member of the
							Free and Accepted Masons, and, with his wife, is affiliated with the Methodist
							Episcopal church of Danville. He is also a member of the Chamber of Commerce of
							Indianapolis and the Commercial Club of Danville. He is actively interested in all
							civic matters and is prominent in all movements looking toward the betterment of his
							home town. He is a man who has won a large circle of friends and acquaintances and is
							universally regarded as one of Hendricks county's leading citizens.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">WESLEY BRADY.</hi></head>

						<p>The gentleman whose name appears at the head of this article is well and favorably
							known throughout Hendricks county and particularly in the vicinity of Danville. This
							is not because he can claim great wealth nor because of remarkable accomplishments in
							mercantile life, though he has been a successful business man; but because of the fact
							that he is genial in manner, warm hearted, charitable and kindly to man and beast. In
							addition to these qualities he is a recognized authority upon the care and breeding of
							horses; and his proverbial kindness to the animals in his charge has shown marked
							results. These animals are docile and well trained, and could they speak, they would
							probably say, "We do our best for him because he is so kind." And this quality in him
							has appealed to his fellow men.</p>

						<p>Wesley Brady is a true product of Hendricks county, having made it his home since the
							day of his birth, in the year 1858. His parents, George W. Brady and Delilah (Selch)
							Brady, were among the early inhabitants of the county, and his maternal grandparents
							were among the first to brave the terrors of the unbroken forest.</p>

						<p>His father, George W., was born in Morgan county, Indiana, near Mooresville, in the
							year 1839, but during his childhood his parents, Merrill Brady and wife, emigrated to
							Hendricks county. Here, near Cartersburg, they took up their abode, and the remaining
							(lays of their lives were spent upon this homestead, he cultivating the soil and
							toiling diligently to acquire sustenance for the family. Mr. Brady was particularly
							successful as a <pb id="VAC1000-220" n="215"/> breeder of and dealer in live stock,
							and the love which he bore for domestic animals, particularly the horse, was
							inculcated into the mind and heart of his son.</p>

						<p>His wife, Delilah Selch, was a native of Hendricks county also, her parents being one
							of the early families to brave the terrors of the long, tedious journey by wagon from
							Kentucky, through the forest country infested by wild animals. Near the present site
							of Cartersburg in Hendricks county, they selected their abode and entered from the
							government eighty acres of land. This tract was. later doubled in size, and the
							arduous labor of clearing 'away the grand old forest trees, which to-day are so highly
							prized, was gladly endured as they saw the cabin raised which was to be their home.
							During the time of building, one of the workers shot a deer at the hour for noon day
							rest, and at night the howling of wolves trying to get their sheep disturbed their
							slumbers. Here they lived the life of the pioneer, the father and sons hewing the huge
							trees to clear space for the garden and grain, and the mother and daughters spinning
							and weaving, and later, knitting and sewing by hand the products of the wheel and
							loom. Baking and broiling were accomplished by the open fireplace, and their table was
							replete with game.</p>

						<p>Hence, we see that the subject of our sketch is truly a son of Hendricks county. His
							childhood and youth were spent on the farm of his father, and he was busily engaged in
							all the activities of the place. At the age of twenty-four years, his marriage to Kate
							Riggen was solemnized. She, also, is a native of Hendricks county, having been born
							and reared near Cartersburg. His parents took the long journey from North Carolina by
							wagon in the early days of this county, and purchased the tract of land which has been
							their homestead throughout their days.</p>

						<p>Soon after they were united in marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Brady established their home on
							a farm in the vicinity of their former homes, and here he engaged in the pursuit of
							agriculture until the year 1909, supplementing this work, however, with the purchase
							and sale of horses. In this year he brought his family to Danville and entered the
							livery business with John W. Ader, under the firm name of Ader &amp; Brady. In this
							vocation he has been at liberty to exercise all his talents in the' care and training
							of horses, for which he is eminently fitted by heredity, experience and environment,
							for the love of this work is inherited from several generations of ancestors. He is
							now the possessor of "Guy Princeton," a horse that has sired more speed and high class
							road horses than any other stallion in Hendricks county. Many <pb id="VAC1000-221"
								n="216"/> of his offspring have sold for sums ranging from fifteen hundred to
							twenty-five hundred dollars. His pedigree runs back three generations to Hambletonian
							Ten.</p>

						<p>But dearly as Mr. Brady loves his horses, his home and family are of paramount
							importance in his life. His one daughter, Lela, is now the wife of Raymond Miles, and
							resides near Clayton. Though a man of few words, he is proverbially a good neighbor
							and stanch friend; and his many kind acts have won for him a more desirable reputation
							than could the possession of large wealth. He is affiliated with the Knights of
							Pythias, among whom he has many devoted friends.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">FRED B. SOPER.</hi></head>

						<p>In the early days the Middle West was often a tempting field to energetic, ambitious,
							strong-minded men, and Indiana was filled with them during the time she was struggling
							up to a respectable position in the sisterhood of states. There was a fascination in
							the broad field and great promise which this newer region presented to activity that
							attracted many men and induced them to brave the discomforts of the early life here
							for the pleasure and gratification of constructing their fortunes in their own way and
							after their own methods. It is this class of men, more than any other, who give shape,
							direction and character to the business of a community. Fred B. Soper, well known
							citizen of Center township, this county, is the son of one of the pioneer citizens of
							this community, his father, the late Charles Soper, for many years being one of the
							most substantial and prominent citizens of Hendricks county. He became identified with
							this section at an early date and for many years wielded a potent influence in local
							circles.</p>

						<p>Fred B. Soper was born in Marion township, this county, on December 31, 1869, about
							one and one-half miles north of New Winchester, the son of Charles and Sarah
							(Underwood) Soper. Charles Soper was born in Bourbon county, Kentucky, on December 5,
							1823, and came to this county in 1853. He was twice married, his first wife, whom he
							married in Kentucky, being Nancy Bryan. Their marriage took place in 1844 and she died
							after coming to this county, in 1867. She left three children, namely: James,
							deceased; Mary Alice and Charles Clay. Mr. Soper took as his second wife Sarah
							Underwood, to whom were born two children, the eldest being the immediate subject of
							this sketch, and the youngest, William <pb id="VAC1000-222" n="[]"/>

								<p rend="center i">Fred B. Soper</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-224" n="217"/> Kendricks, who departed this life July 13, 1902. Sarah
							Underwood was a native of Decatur county, this state, her parents originally coming
							from Kentucky and later coming to this county, where her father entered from the
							government one thousand acres of land in Marion township. She died in Lake county,
							Illinois, on September 13, 1909.</p>

						<p>Charles Soper, the subject's father, was one of the leading farmers of his day, being
							thoroughly progressive in his work at a time when many tillers of the soil rather
							hesitated to depart from old established methods. He was a firm believer in modern
							ideas in agriculture and ever endeavored to keep right in the front rank in his chosen
							vocation. He first settled in Marion township, this county, on a farm of about five
							hundred acres, where he had excellent opportunities to work out some of his advanced
							theories. There he lived until the fall of 1870, when he moved to Danville, where he
							resided for about thirteen years. Becoming wearied of town life and hungering for the
							country again, he returned to the farm where the subject now lives. This homestead
							contains one hundred and seventy-four acres, all buildings and improvements being
							modern, and is one of the best conducted farms in the county. On this farm Charles
							Soper passed his declining years, his death occurring on January 20, 1909. He was
							quiet and unassuming in manner, yet with a quality of firmness and determination
							rarely equaled. Highly successful in his chosen field of endeavor, he won his way by
							his never-ceasing effort, tireless energy and rare judgment and ability, yet, with all
							his large interests, he found considerable time to devote to his home and family,
							being a man of marked domestic traits. His fraternal affiliation for some years was
							with the Independeent Order of Odd Fellows, but he dropped his membership in this
							society shortly before his death. He was a stanch Democrat in his earlier years, but
							later endorsed the principles of the Prohibition party and was active in its affairs
							as related to his community, but never aspired to office in either party. He was one
							of those splendid men of brains and brawn who always prove themselves such strong
							factors in the improvement of a new country, for, by reason of their varied qualities,
							they lead in the moral, educational and material advancement of their community and
							their influence for general uplift can never be estimated.</p>

						<p>Fred B. Soper spent his early years at home, assisting his father in his labors and
							imbibing from him the principles of life and business which make him one of the
							leading citizens of today. He received his elementary education in the township
							schools, later attending the high school at <pb id="VAC1000-225" n="218"/> Danville,
							from which he was graduated in due time. He chose the vocation of his father as that
							of his own and all the efforts of his manhood years have been spent in this direction,
							until he is considered one of the most progressive farmers of the county. He gives
							considerable attention to the breeding and raising of cattle and hogs, principally the
							latter. Mr. Soper has never married and he and his sister, Mary Alice, who also
							remains single, make their home together on the old homestead, and she unites with him
							in a determined effort to make their business an unqualified success.</p>

						<p>There are individuals in nearly every community who, by reason of pronounced ability
							and force of character, rise above the heads of the masses and command the unbounded
							esteem of their fellow men. Characterized by perseverance and a directing spirit, two
							virtues that never fail, such men always make their presence felt and the vigor of
							their strong personalities serves as a stimulus and incentive to the young and rising
							generation. To this energetic and enterprising class the subject of this sketch very
							properly belongs. Having never been seized with the wanderlust spirit that has led <pb
								id="VAC1000-226" n="219"/> many of Hendricks county's young men to other fields of
							endeavor and other states, Mr. Blessing has devoted himself to his adopted profession
							and to the public duties to which he has been called, and because of his personal
							worth and his accomplishments, he is clearly entitled to representation among the
							enterprising and progressive men of his locality.</p>

						<p>Edgar M. Blessing, the son of George A. and Margaret (Ladd) Blessing, was born in
							Wadena, Indiana, in 1876. He was given a good common school education, graduated from
							the high school at Wadena and later from the Indiana State Normal at Terre Haute in
							1899. Between the time he entered the State Normal and his graduation he taught two
							years, and after his graduation was principal of the Plainfield high school for two
							years. During the summer of 1900 he was in attendance at Cornell University, Ithaca,
							New York. In 1901 he was for five months clerk of the Indiana Boys' School at
							Plainfield. In the fall of 1901 he entered the law department of the University of
							Michigan, and graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Law in June, 1904. In January,
							1905, he opened a law office in Danville for the practice of law. A year later he was
							elected prosecuting attorney, and was re-elected in 1908. January 1, 1912, he became
							county attorney, which office he now fills very acceptably. He has been distinguished
							by his work in the office of attorney in the well known Asher and Moon cases. As
							county attorney he is official attorney for the board of county commissioners, and has
							had work of great importance for them, which he has creditably performed. He prepared
							all the papers for the board of commissioners in the new court house matters and
							prepared the transcript for the sale of the bonds for two hundred and twenty-five
							thousand dollars for the proposed new court house. The bond attorneys who examined the
							transcript pronounced it legally perfect and could make no corrections or amendments
							and went so far as to compliment the work he did. In this high and difficult service
							for the public he evidenced capacity in his profession.</p>

						<p>Mr. Blessing was married October 5, 1905, to Geraldine M., the daughter of Mr. and
							Mrs. Dr. C. A. White, of Danville. He and his wife are members of the Methodist
							Episcopal church of Danville, and are interested in all its activities. He is a member
							of the Knights of Pythias and is worshipful master of the Western Star Lodge of Free
							and Accepted Masons at Danville. He is also a thirty-second-degree Mason and a Shriner
							of Murat Temple, Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>Mr. Blessing loves the law because its purpose is the preservation for each citizen
							in the state of his rights for his own use. The practice of the <pb id="VAC1000-227"
								n="220"/> true lawyer is the practice of patriotism, and Mr. Blessing has the high
							ambition to be a true lawyer. There is no nobler ambition, no greater field for
							usefulness, and all that is needed is time to make him eminent in his profession. He
							is now assistant to Prof. Solon Enloe, the head of the law department of Central
							Normal College, of Danville.</p>

						<p>Among the men of Hendricks county who have seen it emerge from a virgin forest to its
							present state as one of the finest agricultural counties in the state, there is no one
							who can give a more vivid picture of the steady growth of the county than William W.
							Trotter, who was born February 19, 1833, about two miles east of North Salem, and has
							spent his entire life in this county. His parents were James and Sarah (Whitt)
							Trotter, and his father was born in Lee county, Virginia, June, 1813, the son of James
							and Elizabeth (Culton) Trotter. In 1815 the Trotter family came from Virginia to
							Indiana and settled in Monroe county, where they remained for two or three years; from
							thence they went to Greencastle, Indiana, and still later to Lafayette, in this state.
							They finally settled in Hendricks county, where they bought a farm of two hundred
							acres south of North Salem. Here James Trotter, Sr., died on October 27, 1857. James
							Trotter, Jr., was a young man when his parents moved to this county, and shortly after
							coming here he married Sarah Whitt, who was a native of Montgomery county, Virginia.
							She had come to Indiana with the family of James Hedge, who only stayed a short time
							in Indiana, when they returned to their old home in Virginia. After his marriage,
							James Trotter, Jr., bought a farm east of North Salem, and lived there the rest of his
							life. He built a cabin in the woods and started life like all of the pioneers of early
							Indiana. William, whose history is here portrayed, remembers distinctly of the
							clearing of that farm and all of the incidents which surrounded their pioneer home.
							James Trotter died February 16, 1878, his wife having passed away November 12,
							1872.</p>

						<p>William W. Trotter was married February 28, 1857, to Nancy E. Keith, who was born
							December 9, 1838, in Putnam county, in this state, the daughter of Bird and Hannah
							(Stigleman) Keith. Bird Keith was a native of Virginia, the son of James Keith and
							wife. He married Hannah Stigleman in Wayne county, Indiana, when he was about thirty
							years of age, and shortly afterwards moved to Putnam county, where they lived until
							1852. <pb id="VAC1000-228" n="221"/> They then moved to Hendricks county and located
							east of North Salem, although his wife had died before he came to this county. His
							death occurred later at Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>After Mr. Trotter married he engaged in farming on rented land for several years and
							then purchased a farm two miles east of North Salem, where he lived until February 19,
							1901, at which time he retired from active farming and bought a home at North Salem,
							where he has since maintained his residence. Mr. and Mrs. W. NW. Trotter are the
							parents of seven children living and two who died in infancy, the ones deceased being
							Jesse and Arthur T. Those living are Allen F., who lives with his father; James, a
							hardware merchant of North Salem; Silas B. and Oliver W., who are in the dry goods
							business in North Salem, and whose histories are given elsewhere in this volume;
							Charles M., a dentist of North Salem; Clarence H., agent for the Cincinnati, Hamilton
							&amp; Dayton Railway Company at North Salem, and Nora B., who is at home with her
							parents.</p>

						<p>Mr. Trotter was assessor of Eel River township from 1865 to 1867, and again from 1883
							to 1891, and on several different occasions acted as treasurer for the land in his
							township. His father, James Trotter, had been township trustee of this same township
							for nine years, beginning in 1860. Mr. Trotter and his whole family belong to the
							Christian church, and give to this denomination their most earnest support. Mr.
							Trotter has been a loyal member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows since April,
							1870. Mr. and Mrs. Trotter have lived useful and busy lives in this county and have
							reared a family of children, all of whom have became useful members of the

						<p>It is a well authenticated fact that success comes as the result of legitimate and
							well applied energy, unflagging determination and perseverance in a course of action
							when once decided upon. She is never known to smile upon the idler or dreamer and she
							never courts the loafer, and only the men who have diligently sought her favor are
							crowned with her blessings. In tracing the history of David A. Higgins, of Danville,
							Hendricks county, Indiana, it is plainly seen that the success which he enjoys has
							been won by commendable qualities and it is also his personal worth that has gained
							for him the high esteem of those who know him.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-229" n="222"/>

						<p>David A. Higgins, deputy state oil inspector, was born in Hendricks county, Indiana,
							June 30, 1850. His parents were Michael and Elizabeth (Plasters) Higgins, his father's
							birth having occurred in Putnam county, this state. He came to this county when he was
							a boy with his parents. His mother was born in Kentucky and came to this county with
							her parents when a small child. Michael Higgins was a farmer in Marion township, where
							he lived on the same farm until his death in 1904, at the age of eighty-one years. He
							was a member of the Christian church at New Winchester, and served as trustee of
							Marion township for three terms. His wife died at the age of sixty in 1882. They were
							the parents of six children: William, of Marion township; David A., the immediate
							subject of this sketch; Mary J., wife of J. L. Wilson, of Marion township; Cassandra,
							wife of Henry Hunt; Charles E., of Marion township, and May, the wife of Willard
							Kellum, who lives on the home farm in Marion township.</p>

						<p>David A. Higgins was reared on his father's farm and received the education which was
							afforded by the district schools of his home township. He had more than the ordinary
							taste for knowledge and after finishing the common school course in his township, he
							attended the academy at Ladoga for two years when it was in charge of Professor M. B.
							Hopkins, later superintendent of instruction for Indiana. Upon the completion of his
							education he returned to his father's farm and followed agricultural pursuits until
							1893. In addition to carrying on a general system of diversified farming he was
							actively engaged in the buying and shipping of live stock. In fact, this was the main
							source of his income. In 1893 he moved to Danville, where he engaged in the hardware
							business for the next ten years. In 1910 he was appointed deputy oil inspector for
							Indiana, a position which he is still filling.</p>

						<p>Mr. Higgins has long been identified with the Democratic party in his county and his
							worth as a man is shown by the fact that he has been the county chairman of the
							Democratic central committee for the past eight years. Hendricks county was formerly
							Republican, but is now practically in the hands of the Democratic party, only two of
							the county officers being Republicans.</p>

						<p>Mr. Higgins was married December 1, 1881, to Angeline Hunt, the daughter of Ithamer
							and Fanny Jane Hunt, who were also residents of Marion township. Mr. and Mrs. Higgins
							are faithful and consistent members of the Christian church at Danville and are
							generous in their support of its various activities. Mr. Higgins is a member of the
							order of Free and Accepted Masons. He has ever enjoyed the respect and esteem of those
								<pb id="VAC1000-230" n="223"/> who know him because of his friendly manner, marked
							ability in public affairs and upright living, and he is regarded by all as one of the

							merchants and representative citizens. A man of excellent endowments and upright
							character, he has been a valued factor in local affairs and has ever commanded
							unequivocal confidence and esteem, being loyal to the upbuilding of his community and
							ever vigilant in his efforts to further the interests of his city along material,
							moral and civic lines.</p>

						<p>Silas B. Trotter, of the firm of Trotter Brothers, of North Salem, was born in Eel

							Nancy E. (Keith) Trotter, whose family history is given elsewhere in this volume.</p>

						<p>Silas B. Trotter was given a good practical education and continued to reside on the
							home farm until 1886, at which time he went to the state of Missouri, where he spent
							one year, being employed in the railway round house. He then returned to North Salem
							and took up the study of telegraphy, and from 1890 to 1904 was a telegraph operator on
							the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton railway at Montclair, Dana and North Salem. In
							1904 he went to Rush county, in this state, and engaged in the mercantile business
							until 1907. On April 1st of that year he and his brother, Oliver W., formed a
							partnership in North Salem, and have continued there in business under the firm name
							of Trotter Brothers until the present time. They handle dry goods, shoes and millinery
							and have built up a large and lucrative trade in the town 'and vicinity, owing to
							their courteous and gentlemanly treatment of their patrons. They purchased this
							business of Bymaster &amp; Company, a firm which had been established in North Salem
							for twenty years in the same line. Since taking over this business they have doubled
							the amount of stock in different lines and have improved the store in various ways. In
							1912 they erected a new brick store room, into which they moved in January, 1913.</p>

						<p>Silas B. Trotter was married in 1894 to Louisa J. Pritchett, the daughter of Thomas

						<p>In no profession is there a career more open to talent than is that of the law, and
							in no field of endeavor is there demanded a more careful preparation, a more thorough
							appreciation of the absolute ethics of life or of the underlying principles which form
							the basis of all human rights and privileges. Unflagging application and intuitive
							wisdom and determination fully to utilize the means at hand are the concomitants which
							insure personal success and prestige in this great profession, which stands as the
							stern conservator of justice, and it is one into which none should enter without a
							recognition of the obstacles to be encountered and overcome and the battles to be won.
							Success does not perch on the banner of every person who enters the competitive fray,
							but comes only as the legitimate result of capability. Possessing all of these
							requisite qualities which stamp the able lawyer, Otis E. Gulley stands today among the
							eminent practitioners of Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>Otis E. Gulley, one of Danville's best lawyers and president of the board of trustees
							of Central Normal College, is a native of the county, having been born at North Salem
							on March 22, 1867. Reared to the life of a farmer's boy, he knows what kind of a life
							the farmer leads and this has been no small factor in his success as an attorney. The
							farmer in search of legal advice feels that he can have a sympathetic helper in Mr.
							Gulley and he finds that he is not mistaken. Mr. Gulley received his elementary
							education in the common schools of his township and in preparing himself for teaching
							he attended Franklin College for one term. He came to Danville in 1891 and was shortly
							after, admitted to the practice of law and has continued to follow that profession,
							for which he seems to be especially gifted. He is peculiarly gifted in the capacity of
							the investigator who is never satisfied until he gets to the bottom of things. He goes

							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-233" n="225"/> through obstacles, revolutionizing his methods if the
							old ways do not meet the exigencies of the situation. Old ways may do for some men,
							but if a new way is better he digs it up out of the limitless field of opportunity and
							presses it into service, His philosophy is that there is a way to do everything if the
							way can but be found.</p>

						<p>Mr. Gulley's life has been a busy one and he has had discouragements and
							disappointments to meet many times. Starting out as a school teacher at seventeen, he
							has received his education with his work. He lived in Arkansas two years and was
							living in that state in 1890 when the United States census was taken. He was census
							supervisor of the second district, which covered about half of the state. Coming back
							to Danville, he was elected to the office of county prosecutor two terms and was one
							of the best prosecutors the county ever had.</p>

						<p>Mr. Gulley was married in 1895 to Mary Tilford, of Martinsville, Indiana, and has a
							handsome home two and a half miles east of Danville. Mrs. Gulley died on July 2, 1907.
							He is a loyal member of the Christian church and is interested in the many activities
							of that society. He was a stanch Republican and his high standing among the men of the
							state is shown in the fact that he was nominated on the Republican ticket, in 1910,
							for secretary of state. At the organization of the Progressive party, he became
							actively identified with that organization, by which he was honored with a nomination
							for Congress. In his fraternal relations he is a member of the Knights of Pythias, a
							thirty-second-degree Mason and a Mystic Shriner. He has been the president of the
							board of trustees of the Central Normal College for some years and takes a very active
							interest in the affairs of that institution. A man of sterling qualities, his honest
							and strictly square dealings, his upright principles and genial disposition have won
							for him numerous friends throughout the community in which he lives.</p>

							must force them into an admirable notoriety which their modesty never seeks, who
							command the respect of their contemporaries and their posterity and leave the impress
							of their individuality deeply stamped upon the community.</p>

						<p>John A. Showalter, of the firm of Shirley &amp; Showalter, was born in Henry county,
							Indiana, seven miles west of Newcastle, on July 15, 1854. His parents were Ashbury and
							Susan Ruth (Cooper) Showalter, the father being a native of Indiana, and the mother of
							Ohio. Ashbury Showalter was a contractor and is now living retired in Kennard, Henry

							Indiana; Mrs. Mary Cook, of Newcastle, Indiana; R. R. Showalter, of Knightstown,
							Indiana, and Ada, who lives with her father in Kennard.</p>

						<p>J. A. Showalter received his common school education in the district schools of Henry
							county, Indiana, and when a mere boy, began clerking in a grocery store near his home.
							In 1880, when he was twenty-six years of age, he came to Danville, where he became a
							member of the firm of Shirley, Showalter &amp; McCoun. The business was conducted
							under this name for about four years and a half, at the expiration of which time the
							firm name was changed to Shirley, Showalter &amp; Company, Mr. McCoun retiring from
							the firm. This firm, starting in a modest way, has expanded both in size and stock
							until it is now one of the leading stores in Danville. The company employs a large
							number of clerks and the stock is one of the largest and most complete in its line to
							be found in any city the size of Danville. Courtesy and an evident desire to please
							all who patronize the store have been the strongest elements in the success which has
							accompanied the firm's efforts, and it has enjoyed at all times the full confidence of
							all who have done business with it.</p>

						<p>Mr. Showalter was married September 10, 1891, to Belle C. Conrad, of Florence, Boone
							county, Kentucky, and to this union there has been born one child, Mary Agnes. Mr. and
							Mrs. Showalter are devoted and consistent members of the Christian church, of which
							denomination Mr. Showalter has been a deacon for many years. Politically, he is an
							earnest supporter of the Republican party, but his business interests have precluded
							his taking an active part in political affairs. Mr. Showalter is regarded as a good
							business <pb id="VAC1000-235" n="227"/> man and excellent manager, and a man who
							possesses sound judgment and foresight, and who believes in ever pressing forward, so
							that his success is but the legitimate result of the efforts which he puts forth. He
							enjoys the respect and esteem of those with whom he mingles for his friendly manner,
							his business ability, his interest in public affairs and his upright living. He is

						<p>It is not an easy task to describe adequately a man who has led an eminently active
							and busy life and who has attained a position of relative distinction in the community
							with which his interests are allied. But biography finds its most perfect
							justification, nevertheless, in the tracing and recording of such a life history. It
							is, then, with a full appreciation of all that is demanded and of the painstaking
							scrutiny that must be accorded each statement, and yet with a feeling of satisfaction,
							that the writer essays the task of touching briefly upon the details of such a record
							as has been that of Edward V. Ragland whose eminently successful career is now under
							review.</p>

						<p>Edward V. Ragland, a prominent real estate and loan agent of Danville, Indiana, was
							born February 27, 1863, in the southwestern corner of Marion township, Hendricks
							county, Indiana. His parents were James and Ann (Cord) Ragland, his father being a
							native of this county, born March 28, 1838. The parents of James Ragland were Dudley
							and Ailsey (Flynn) Ragland, both of whom were born and reared in Kentucky, near
							Winchester. Dudley Ragland and wife came from Kentucky to Hendricks county in pioneer
							time and located on the Rockville road in the eastern edge of Marion township, where
							Dudley Ragland kept a tavern in the early days. Later he sold this farm and bought a
							farm near Reno, in the southwestern corner of Marion township, and later bought a farm
							three miles southwest of Coatesville on which he lived until his death. James Ragland
							was born in Marion township, and upon reaching man's estate he was married to Ann
							Cord, the daughter of John and Christine (Caywood) Cord. Her parents were from New
							England, but came to this county early in their married life and lived here the
							remainder of their lives. In 1868 James Ragland and wife moved to Illinois and
							remained there nine years. They then came back and bought <pb id="VAC1000-236" n="228"
							/> a farm in Morgan county, just south of the Hendricks county line and have lived in
							that neighborhood ever since.</p>

						<p>Edward V. Ragland was reared on his father's farm and remained there until his
							marriage. He completed his education in the common schools in this county and then
							attended the Indiana State Normal at Terre Haute, after which he taught for nine years
							in Morgan and Putnam counties, Indiana, and in Edgar county, Illinois. He retired from
							his teaching profession in 1891 and engaged in the general merchandise business at
							Broad Park, a village in the eastern part of Putnam county, which he named. There he
							built up a lucrative business and remained two years, whereupon he and the man with
							whom he had gone into partnership dissolved and he moved his stock to Lake Valley in
							the northwestern part of Morgan county, where he remained for the next five years,
							three of which he was postmaster. In 1899 he sold his store to S. M. Johnson and after
							a one year's residence at Martinsville, where he dealt in live stock, he bought a farm
							in Franklin township in Hendricks county, where he resided three and one-half years.
							His wife owned a farm in the immediate vicinity, part of the farm known as the Green
							Valley farm. In February, 1904, Mr. Ragland moved to Danville and engaged in the real
							estate, loan and insurance business, which he has followed up to the present time. In
							this line of work he has been uniformly successful, listing valuable property and
							building up a loan and insurance business which is netting him very handsome returns.
							Nearly all his life Mr. Ragland has engaged in dealing in horses, even while
							principally interested in other lines of business. He is a breeder of high-grade road
							horses and owns some fine animals at the present time.</p>

						<p>While attending the State Normal at Terre Haute, Mr. Ragland became acquainted with
							Rusha E. Hadley, the daughter of Jehu and Jerusha (Stiles) Hadley, and before moving
							to Martinsville they were married. Jehu Hadley was one of the most prominent farmers
							of Hendricks county. He was born in Chatham county, North Carolina, October 19, 1810,
							and in 1825 went with his parents, James T. and Mary (Richardson) Hadley, to Hendricks
							county and located in Center township. He was married August 3, 1837, to Jerusha
							Stiles, who was born July 18, 1819, in Vermont, the daughter of Jeremiah and Sibyl
							Stiles. Her father was the founder of Stilesville, locating there in 1821. Mrs. Stiles
							died in 1828 and was the first married woman who died there. Mr. Stiles was married
							again and shortly afterward died of cholera at Savannah, Missouri. In March, 1838,
							Jehu Hadley bought three hundred and twenty acres in section II, Franklin township,
							which at that time was <pb id="VAC1000-237" n="229"/> a swamp. The only arable part of
							his farm was covered with a heavy growth of timber, and many of the old settlers
							pronounced the farm valueless and predicted starvation for the owner, but they did not
							reckon with the industry and perseverance of Jehu Hadley. By incessant toil and energy
							he cleared the farm and drained the swamp, putting in two thousand rods of tile
							drainage and four hundred rods of open ditches, in addition to building a mile of
							levee on Mill creek, which ran through the farm. It is today known as the Green Valley
							Farm and is one of the show places of the county. A fine park containing an
							amphitheatre is on the farm and for the past thirteen years the old settlers have held
							their reunions there, as many. as six thousand persons being present on these annual
							occasions. Mr. Hadley owned, at one time, six hundred and fifty acres, nearly all of
							which he had brought under cultivation. In 1876 he built a beautiful brick residence,
							probably the most costly country home in Hendricks county, costing him over ten
							thousand dollars. He was widely known and well respected for his many fine qualities
							of character. He was not only just, but a man who was generosity itself. Honorable
							himself, he never distrusted another man, till proved unworthy of trust. He was strong
							in his likes and in his dislikes, too, and yet a charitable man who was always true to
							his friends. He died in 1891 and his wife seven years later. He belonged to the
							Christian church and his wife to the Missionary Baptist.</p>

						<p>Rusha E. Hadley was born in Danville, where she attended the public school, and later
							the State Normal, where she and her husband became acquainted. After leaving the State

						<p>In this day of specialization the world demands experts in every line and he who
							would make the most pronounced success along any particular line of endeavor must
							concentrate all of his time, attention and energy on his chosen field. In the field of
							medicine the work of the old family doctor is now in the hands of a hundred different
							specialists, each treating some particular ailment and no others. There has also
							arisen within the last twenty-five years a new field in the department of therapeutics
							and medicine and one which is of great importance. This new departure will not only be
							the means of saving the health of hundreds of thousands of people, but it has an
							influence which will affect the very life of the nation itself, striking as it does at
							the foundations of our social fabric. The home, the school, the industrial world and
							every phase of society is going to be changed for the better because of this new phase
							of the medical profession.</p>

						<p>Inebriety is now recognized as a disease and there has been discovered by Dr. Leslie
							E. Keeley, a treatment which, properly administered, results in a complete relief from
							the craving or appetite for alcohol and narcotics. Nearly half a million persons have
							been treated within the last twenty-five years and the success which has attended the
							use of Dr. Keeley's remedies has made his name a household word in thousands of homes.
							For the past twenty-three years there has been a branch of the Keeley Institute at
							Plainfield, Indiana, and during all but five years of that time it has been under the
							charge of Dr. A. P. W. Bridges, who has achieved a notable success in handling
							thousands of cases of inebriety and morphineism.</p>

						<p>Dr. Bridges, the son of Rev. M. C. and Sophia J. (Doyle) Bridges, was born September
							27, 1856, in Owen county, Indiana. His father was a native of Indiana and his mother
							of North Carolina. Rev. Bridges was born near Abington, Wayne county, his ancestors
							having come to Indiana from Virginia by way of Kentucky. They settled in Wayne county
							in the <pb id="VAC1000-239" n="231"/> twenties and in the thirties moved to Owen
							county and lived there the remainder of their days, the father dying in 1900 at the
							age of seventy-five, the mother having passed away several years before. They reared a
							large family of children, but Dr. Bridges is the only one living.</p>

						<p>Dr. Bridges received a good common school education and then took the course in the
							Indiana Medical College, at Indianapolis, graduating from that institution in the
							spring of 1892. He started to practice at Cloverdale, Indiana, and shortly afterwards
							removed to Alaska, Morgan county, where he remained until he took charge of the Keeley
							Institute at Plainfield. Under his efficient administration the institute has made a
							steady growth and is now recognized as one of the best in the United States. In 1912
							the buildings were completly overhauled and put in first class condition in every
							particular.</p>

						<p>Dr. Bridges was first married to Emma F. Alverson, of Spencer, Indiana, in 1883, and
							to this union there were born five children: Ralph, who is a graduate of Depauw and
							Indiana Universities, and is now a professional chemist, at Plainfield; Alta, who is a
							graduate of Depauw University, and now a teacher in the high school, at Plainfield;
							and three who are still at home, Joyce. Willard and James. Mrs. Bridges died in April,
							1908, and January 7, 1913, Dr. Bridges married Minnie Morgan, of Plainfield, to which
							union Ruth Adelaide was born, February 19, 1914.</p>

						<p>Dr. Bridges is a thirty-second-degree Mason, a Shriner, and also holds membership in
							the tribe of Red Men. He is a member of the Methodist Episcopal church and has been a
							trustee in the church for many years. He is a stanch Democrat and takes an active
							interest in the affairs of his party and was nominated by his party in 1914 for the
							office of county clerk. He has been the precinct committeeman from Guilford township
							ever since he lived there. He has been identified with the Plainfield Building and
							Loan Association as its vice-president for many years. He is a member of the library
							board of Plainfield.</p>

						<p>It is safe to say that the work being done by Dr. Bridges is conferring a boon upon
							thousands of homes and the sphere of his influence is constantly increasing. His work
							is highly indorsed by men in every profession who see in the service he is rendering
							to afflicted humanity the positive means of ameliorating untold suffering and misery.
							Dr. Bridges is a widely read man and one whom it is a pleasure to meet, and his
							friends are truly numbered by the thousands.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JUDGE GEORGE W. BRILL.</hi></head>

						<p>It is scarce less than supererogation in outlining the leading facts in the life of
							Judge Brill to refer to him as a lawyer in the ordinary phraseology which meets the
							requirements when dealing with the average member of the legal profession. He is
							indeed much more than eminently successful in his legal career, as is indicated by his
							long and praiseworthy record at the bar and his efficient service on the bench. He is
							a master of his profession, a leader among men distinguished for the high order of
							their legal talent, and his eminent attainments and ripe judgment make him an
							authority on all matters involving a profound knowledge of jurisprudence and vexed and
							intricate questions growing out of its interpretation.</p>

						<p>Judge George WV. Brill, the son of William and Jeannette (Matthews) Brill, was born
							in Hendricks county, Indiana, December 15, 1859. His father was a native of Virginia
							and his mother of Scotland. William Brill was a millwright by trade and came west when
							a young man, settling in Hendricks county, Indiana. Here he lived until his death, in
							April, 1873, his widow surviving him until 1907. They were loyal and consistent
							members of the Lutheran church of Pecksburg. To Mr. and Mrs. William Brill were born
							six children: George W., the immediate subject of this sketch: William Henry,
							deceased; Rachel Jeannette, the wife of L. F. Sparks; Bess, who lives with her
							brother, and William T., who is a furniture dealer in Danville.</p>

						<p>Judge Brill was born on the farm near Center Valley, Liberty township, this county,
							and received his education in the common schools of this township. He finished his
							education by taking the course in the Central Normal College, at Danville, and has
							been granted two diplomas from that institution. Following his graduation from the
							college. he taught school for four years, in the meantime reading law with Hadley,
							Hogate &amp; Blake in Danville. He was admitted to the bar in June, 1883, and was in
							continuous practice until November 16, 1913, when he went on the bench of the
							fifty-fifth judicial circuit of Indiana. He formed a partnership with Col. George T.
							Harvey in 1890, which continued until he went on the bench. This firm was very
							successful in every way and was in most of the important litigation of the county and
							central part of Indiana for the past twenty years.</p>

						<p>Judge Brill was elected judge at the general election in November, 1913, on the
							Democratic ticket, and gave up a law practice of eighteen thousand dollars a year to
							take the judgship at three thousand five hundred. He <pb id="VAC1000-241" n="[]"/>

								<p rend="center i">Geo. W. Brill</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-242" n="233"/> did this only at the earnest solicitation of his
							friends. This was his first office, although about twenty years ago he was the party
							nominee for joint senator of Marion and Hendricks counties, when, though he carried
							Marion county by over seven hundred, he lost his home county and was defeated.</p>

						<p>Judge Brill was married on November 23, 1883, to Emma L. Gregg, the youngest daughter
							of Martin and Mary Jean Gregg. Martin Gregg was county commissioner when the old court
							house was built and was a very estimable and substantial citizen of the county. Two
							children have been born to Judge and Mrs. Brill, one of whom died in infancy, while
							the other daughter, Gertrude Holt, is still under the parental roof. Mrs. Brill died
							on October 11, 1913.</p>

						<p>Fraternally, Judge Brill is a member of the Knights of Pythias and has been in that
							order since 1882, during which time he has held every office in that lodge. He is also
							a member of the Free and Accepted Masons at Danville. Judge Brill is the owner of
							considerable real estate in the county, having several town properties and also farm
							lands scattered throughout this section. His career indicates what can be done by the
							young man who starts out to make his own way through life. He had no influential or
							rich friends or relatives to help him and can be truly called a self-made man.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">HIRAM T. STORM.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the highly honored veterans of the Civil War, who are still living in Hendricks
							county, is Hiram E. Storm, who lost one of his legs twelve days after he was mustered
							into the service, in one of the hardest fought battles of the Civil War. Although he
							was nearly seventeen years of age when he enlisted, he came back and started to common
							school in order to prepare himself for some useful profession. Handicapped as he was,
							he was determined not to be a charge upon anyone and with grit and determination he
							set about to prepare himself for the profession of teaching and thirty-six years of
							his useful life have been spent in teaching in this and other counties in Indiana. His
							life history is very interesting and instructive to the coming generation and is well
							worthy of mention in this volume.</p>

						<p>Hiram T. Storm, the son of Isaac and Sarah (Lunsford) Storm, was born in Putnam
							county, Indiana, November 26, 1845. Both of his parents were natives of Monroe county,
							Indiana, and when his father, Isaac, was about seventeen years of age, he left his
							home in Monroe county, because the surroundings of his community were such as not to
							be conducive to the best development of a young man. Nearly everyone was addicted to
							the use of strong liquor and having had a repugnance to the use of intoxicating
							liquors from his childhood days, he decided to settle in some place where he would be
							under a different environment. Accordingly he went to Putnam county and found work
							with a farmer by the name of Lunsford, who was a strong temperance man, an
							abolitionist and a worthy mah in every way. It so happened that Isaac Lunsford had a
							daughter and, as it has often occurred before and since, the youthful Isaac fell in
							love with <pb id="VAC1000-244" n="235"/> his employer's daughter, Sarah. An
							interesting story is connected with the life of Peter Lunsford. When he first entered
							government land in Putnam county, he killed one hundred and forty rattlesnakes the
							first spring and got so disgusted with the farm that he sold it and bought another one
							in the same county. Isaac and his young wife, Sarah, began life under truly primitive
							conditions in Putnam county, and were worthy people, who reared to large usefulness
							thirteen children, four boys of whom served gallantly in the Union army during the
							Civil War. Isaac Storms died in 1904, at the age of eighty-seven, while the bride of
							his youth is still living on the old home farm at the advanced age of ninety.</p>

						<p>Hiram T. Storm lived on the home farm until the breaking out of the Civil War and on
							August 18, 1862, enlisted in Company C, Seventy-first Regiment of Indiana Volunteer
							Infantry. The next twelve days were probably the most exciting which have ever
							happened in the career of Mr. Storm. His regiment in 1863 was transferred to the Sixth
							Indiana Cavalry, and he was rushed to Kentucky and on the 30th, twelve days after he
							was mustered in at Indianapolis, he was engaged in the battle of Richmond, Kentucky,
							one of the severest battles in that state during the whole war. Here he was severely
							wounded in the leg and in order to save his life, his leg was amputated. As soon as he
							was able to return to his home, he came back to Putnam county and started to school.
							Things must have looked discouraging to him at this time, but with pluck and
							perseverance he applied himself to his books with such diligence that he was soon
							recognized as one of the best educated men in his county. As soon as he applied for a
							teacher's license he successfully passed the examination and for the next six years
							taught in Putnam county.</p>

						<p>In 1869, Mr. Storm moved to Eel River township, in this county, and bought a farm,
							where he made his home until 1912. Before coming to this county he married the widow
							of William F. Harper, another gallant soldier, who lost his life in the Civil War.
							Mrs. Harper had two children by her first marriage, Melvin and Melvina Eva Harper,
							whose interesting careers are delineated elsewhere in this volume. After removing to
							this county, Mr. Storm continued teaching until 1872, when he was elected treasurer of
							Hendricks county on the Republican ticket. After leaving the office of county
							treasurer he returned to the farm and continued teaching until 1909, having completed
							a total of thirty-six years in the school room. He has taught the children of former
							pupils and in fact a few grandchildren of former pupils. He has been very successful
							as a business man and now <pb id="VAC1000-245" n="236"/> owns eighty acres of land in
							Hendricks county, as well as his father's old home place in Putnam county.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Storm are the parents of two children, May and Orville T. May was the
							wife of Frank West, and died in January, 1897, leaving two children, Lester V. and
							Evalina. Orville T. was born October 31, 1869, and after graduating from the high
							school at Danville attended Purdue University for a term, after which he returned to
							the old home farm where he has since resided. Upon his marriage, in 1898, his father
							gave him fifty acres and since that time he has added one hundred and thirty more to
							his farm in this township. He was married in 1893 to Ida West, the daughter of Simpson
							and Julia. (Weddle) West. Her father was born in Kentucky and came here with his
							parents, Mr. and Mrs. Hiram West, in infancy. Hiram West entered land in the
							southeastern part of Eel River township and lived there until his death. Julia Weddle
							was born in Putnam county, the daughter of Benjamin and Nancy Weddle, who were natives
							of Virginia. Mr. and Mrs. Orville T. Storm have one daughter, Nellie, who is now
							attending the Central Normal College at Danville.</p>

						<p>Hiram T. Storm has been a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows since 1872,
							holding membership in both subordinate lodge and encampment. He has been a life-long
							member of the Christian church and is now an elder in that denomination at Lizton.
							Personally, Mr. Storm is a man of great force of character and enjoys a high degree of
							popularity in his community, possessing, as he does, those qualities of mind and heart
							that win and retain warm friendship.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">SENATOR HORACE L. HANNA.</hi></head>

						<p>Senator Horace L. Hanna, of Plainfield, Indiana, was born at Greencastle, Indiana,
							April 1, 1874. His parents were Hon. John and Emma (Hobbs) Hanna, his father being a
							native of Marion county, and his mother of Jennings county in this state. His father
							was for many years one of the most prominent lawyers not only of Indiana, but of the
							middle West, and had a national reputation as a man of extraordinary ability. John
							Hanna was a member of Congress from the seventh district of Indiana, was an elector on
							the first Lincoln ticket, was appointed by President Lincoln as United States district
							attorney for Indiana, was a member of the territorial <pb id="VAC1000-246" n="237"/>
							Legislature of Kansas and chairman of the judiciary committee which introduced the
							bill for the prohibition of slavery in that state.</p>

						<p>Senator Horace L. Hanna received a good common school and high school education in
							Plainfield, graduating from the Plainfield Academy in 1873. His parents had moved to
							Plainfield when he was about eight years of age. After graduating from the academy at
							Plainfield, he worked on the farm for four years, and then spent one year in DePauw
							University. While in DePauw he was a member of the Sigma Chi Greek-letter fraternity,
							and has always taken an active interest in this organization of his college days.
							After leaving DePauw he taught school for one year in the country near his home and
							then became a traveling salesman for the next four years, traveling for the
							Baker-Vawter Company, of Chicago. He then entered a law school in Indianapolis and
							graduated from the Indiana Law School in 1904 and immediately located for the practice
							of law at Plainfield. In 1905 he was elected to the lower house of the Indiana
							Legislature and re-elected in 1907. In 1909 he, was elected to the Senate from Boone
							and Hendricks counties, having served in all, through four sessions of the
							Legislature, the sixty-fourth, the sixty-fifth, the sixty-sixth and sixty-seventh
							sessions. Senator Hanna was appointed in 1909 by Governor Hanly as chairman of the
							legislative committee to visit and investigate the needs of the various state
							institutions. While in the Legislature he took a very prominent part and was the
							author of many bills. He feels that the bill of most importance with which he was
							connected was the one making the boards of the various state institutions nonpartisan.
							He does not assume the entire credit for this bill, but was one of the prime movers in
							its passage.</p>

						<p>Senator Hanna was married to Hortense B. Moore, December 23, 1909. She is a daughter
							of Patterson F., deceased, and Willie A. Moore, of Plainfield. He is a member of the
							order of Free and Accepted Masons, the Knights of Pythias and the United Commercial
							Travelers of America. It is interesting to note that in the list of legislative
							celebrities which was published from time to time in the <hi rend="i">Indianapolis
								Star</hi> that Senator Hanna figured in a very interesting sketch in this newspaper
							on February 24, 1913. In this sketch he is referred to as a man who carries his point
							as often as any other Republican could carry it in the Indiana Senate. In fact, his
							optimistic and cheerful demeanor at all times has won for him a host of warm friends,
							who are glad to see him making a name for himself in the political arena of Indiana.
							He is rapidly building up a lucrative legal practice in Plainfield and surrounding
							territory and is universally recognized as a man of keen analytical mind who has a
							good grasp of the law.</p>

						<p>The farmer is the bulwark of the nation and investigation has shown that a large
							majority of our best business and professional men were reared on the farm. Presidents
							of the United States and governors of our own fair state have often come from the
							rural districts. George Washington was a farmer and was proud of the fact; Abraham
							Lincoln was reared on a farm in Spencer county, Indiana. Probably the most popular
							Democratic governor Indiana ever had was "Blue Jeans" Williams, who prided himself on
							being a farmer and defeated Benjamin Harrison for governor with the campaign cry that
							Harrison was a "Blue Stocking;" the Republican party has never had a better governor
							in this state than that plain, unostentatious farmer, James A. Mount. Verily, the
							farmers of to-day are the bulwark of the nation, the salt of the earth.</p>

						<p>John W. Ader, the son of Jacob and Mary (Springer) Ader, was born March 2, 1863, in
							Putnam county, Indiana. His father was a native of Putnam county and his mother was
							born in Schenectady, New York. Jacob Ader was a farmer all his life, as was his
							father, Solomon, before him. The Aders, it is believed, came originally from Ireland,
							Solomon coming to this country from Ireland with his parents, and at first settled in
							Virginia. From Virginia they went to North Carolina, and Solomon, the grandfather of
							the subject of this sketch, came from that state to Indiana with his family and all
							his possessions in a two-wheel cart. Jacob Ader died in 1872 and his widow, some years
							later, married B. G. Edmundson and is still living at Clayton, Indiana. Mr. and Mrs.
							Jacob Ader Were the parentss of three children: Solomon, a farmer in Putnam county;
							Jacob, who died at the age of two; and John, the immediate subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>John W. Ader was given a good practical education in the common schools of his
							township and has supplemented his early training with wide reading .and close
							observation of men and events. In other words he is well schooled in the affairs of
							the business world, an education that teachers and books cannot give. He spent his
							summers on the farm while he was still of school age and continued to work on the farm
							until his marriage, at the age of twenty-one. His father had died when he was only
							nine years of age and this necessitated him taking considerable responsibility on his
							shoulders at an early age.</p>

						<p>Mr. Ader was united in marriage on September 11, 1884 to Jennie Shepherd, a girl with
							whom he had gone to school. She is the daughter of <pb id="VAC1000-248" n="239"/>
							James P. and Margaret (Weller) Shepherd. She was born and reared near Mr. Ader's home
							in Putnam county. To this happy union there have been born six children, four of whom
							are living: Tressie Olive, who is a music teacher, and lives at home; Jacob, who is a
							student in the School of Medicine, of Indiana University, will receive the degree of
							Bachelor of Science in June, 1914, and the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1916. He is
							taking the full seven years' course which is prescribed by the university, the last
							three years of which is given at Indianapolis. He is a member of the Greek-letter
							fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta and the medical fraternity of Phi Rho Sigma; the third
							child of Mr. and Mrs. Ader is Shirley Florence, who is a graduate of the high school,
							at Danville, and also of both the scientific and the classic courses of the Central
							Normal College. During the year 1913-1914 she is teaching English and art in high
							school at Jonesboro, Indiana; the youngest child is Helen, who is now a sophomore in
							the Danville high school.</p>

						<p>Immediately after his marriage Mr. Ader went on a farm and was successful from the
							start, and within four years was able to purchase a general store at Groveland, which
							he managed no less successfully for the next five years. While he was on the farm he
							became interested in the buying and selling of horses and when he went into the
							mercantile business he continued to handle horses. In fact the handling of the horses
							interfered with the operation of his store, so he sold it and engaged in the buying
							and selling of stock exclusively. He went into partnership with Henry Underwood at
							Groveland in Putnam county and in the next few years laid the basis of his present
							substantial holdings. In 1893 he moved to Danville where he continued in the same
							business and in the next fourteen years became known as one of the most substantial
							business men of the county. He invested in land and owns some of the finest farming
							land to be found in the state. He also bought town property in Danville and has
							recently built one of the most modern and up-to-date houses in the town. In 1908 he
							was elected sheriff on the Democratic ticket, by a good majority, despite the fact
							that the county is normally Republican. His administration of the office was so
							satisfactory that he was re-elected in 1910 without any difficulty; his last term of
							office expires January 1, 1913. It is safe to say that Hendricks county never had a
							more efficient and popular sheriff than John Ader.</p>

						<p>Mr. Ader is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons, at Groveland, and has been a
							close student of Masonry for many years. He and all the members of his family are
							devoted and consistent adherents of the Presbyterian <pb id="VAC1000-249" n="240"/>
							church, at Danville, and contribute freely of their means to the support of the
							various organizations of that denomination. Mr. Ader is a man who makes friends
							everywhere he goes and probably has as wide an acquaintance throughout the county as
							any other man. Personally, he is a splendid specimen of manhood, more than six feet in
							height and tipping the scales around two hundred and fifty. His life has been a busy
							and useful one and no citizen in the county is held in higher esteem by his fellow
							citizens than Mr. Ader. His career shows what may be accomplished by the exercise of

						<p>Whether the elements of success in this life are innate attributes of the individual
							or whether they are quickened by a process of circumstantial development, it is
							impossible to clearly determine. Yet the study of a successful life, whatever the

						<p>James E. Humston was educated in the old-fashioned schools which were in vogue in his
							day and spent his boyhood days helping his father on the farm. When a mere lad of
							seventeen, he enlisted in Company A, Sixty-seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer
							Infantry, and served for three full years. He took part in the siege of Vicksburg, in
							the summer of 1863, and participated in seventeen engagements of the war. He was twice
							taken prisoner, first at Munfordsville, Kentucky, and held at Alexander, Louisiana,
							later on, having been taken prisoner twenty-seven days after he enlisted. He was never
							sick a day during his whole service and never missed a single roll call, excepting
							during time he was in prison. He participated in the battle of Champion's Hill, which
							history says was one of the bloodiest battles of the whole Civil War, and yet was one
							of the fortunate few who went through the whole service without being wounded in any
							way, or having his health impaired in the slightest. After the close of the war he
							came back to Lawrence county, Indiana, and remained there until 1868, when he went
							west for a short time. Upon his return to Indiana he was married in 1870 and came to
							Danville, this county, where he has since lived. As a farmer he has been very
							successful and has accumulated a comfortable competence for his declining years. While
							in the active work of directing his farm he raised all of the crops common to this
							section of the state, and also added to his income by the sale of live stock.</p>

						<p>Mr. Humston was married February 24, 1870, to Philista T. Wood, who was born and
							reared in Hendricks county, and to this union were born five children: Ora Minta, the
							wife of Joseph M. Miller, of Clermont, Indiana; Everett E.; of Beech Grove, Indiana;
							Lee W., of Indianapolis; Cly R., assistant cashier of the Danville State Bank, and
							Hallie H., who lives in South Dakota.</p>

						<p>Mr. Humston has always taken a prominent part in Republican politics and has served
							his party on several occasions in conventions. He was elected assessor of Franklin
							township for three terms, and in 1890 was elected recorder of Hendricks county. He is
							financially interested in the Danville State Bank and is a director in that
							institution at the present time. After his term of office as county recorder expired
							in 1895, he moved back to his farm in Washington township, but did not take a very
							active part in the management of the farm. He moved back to Danville in 1905, where he
							has since resided.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-252" n="242"/>

						<p>Mr. Humston is a faithful and consistent member of the Methodist Episcopal church,
							and one of the gradually diminishing number who belong to the Grand Army post at
							Danville. His record has been one replete with duty well and conscientiously performed
							in every relation of life. He has been an advocate of wholesome living and cleanliness
							in politics as well, and has always stood for the highest and best interests of the
							community in which so many of his active years have been passed and which has been
							honored by his citizenship. The life history of such a man shows what industry, good
							habits and sound citizenship will accomplish.</p>

						<p>The career of William H. Nichols has been a strenuous and busy one, entitling him to
							honorable mention among the representative citizens of his day and generation in the
							county with which his life has been so long identified. Although his life record is
							nearing its close by the inevitable fate that awaits all mankind, his influence still
							pervades the lives of a wide circle of friends and acquaintances throughout the
							county. It is very probable that he has a larger speaking acquaintance in this county
							than any other living man, due to the fact that he has been identified with the office
							of auditor for so many years. As a private citizen, as a soldier in the Civil War and
							as a public official he has always been true to himself and his fellowmen and the
							tongue of calumny has never touched him. As a soldier he proved his loyalty to the
							country he loved so well and in the long marches in all kinds of situations, on the
							tented fields and amid the flame and smoke of battle, where the rattle of musketry
							mingled with the deep concussions of the bursting shell, he was always found to be a
							man who could be depended upon. To such as he the country is under a debt of gratitude
							which it cannot repay and in centuries yet to come posterity will commemorate their
							bravery in fitting eulogy and tell their deeds in story and in song.</p>

						<p>William H. Nichols, .one of the most highly respected citizens of Hendricks county,
							was born near Danville, February 24, 1841. His parents were Thomas and Patty (Hadley)
							Nichols, his father being a native of Virginia, who came to this county in 1821.
							Thomas Nichols settled southeast of Plainfield, where he lived for a short time and
							then removed to a farm near Danville, and later into Danville, where he lived until
							his death at the advanced age of ninety-two years. Thomas Nichols was one of the most
								<pb id="VAC1000-253" n="243"/> important men of the county during his time. He was
							elected sheriff on three different occasions, being one of the first sheriffs ever
							elected in the county. The Black Hawk war was disturbing the settlers in 1832 and in
							that year he joined the local militia and went to the front, but did not see any
							fighting. He and his wife were members of the Methodist Episcopal church and he was a
							charter member of the Danville lodge of Free and Accepted Masons, being initiated at
							Indianapolis. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Nichols were the parents of nine children, only
							three of whom are living: O. E. Nichols, of Danville; Mrs. Julia A. Harney, who taught
							for thirty-eight years in Lebanon, Indiana, and W. H. Nichols, the immediate subject
							of this sketch.</p>

						<p>W. H. Nichols was reared in Danville and attended the public schools of this place.
							After finishing the course in the common schools, he became a student at Danville
							Academy and graduated from that institution. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War he
							enlisted for service in Company B, One Hundred Seventeenth Regiment Indiana Volunteer
							Infantry, and served with distinction until the close of his term of enlistment. When
							a young man he started as a carpenter, learning the trade from his father, but
							subsequently he entered a printing office, where he worked for two years. His first
							public office was that of township assessor, which he held for one term. Upon the
							expiration of his term of office as assessor, he became deputy auditor for three
							years. The next four years, from 1875 to 1879, were spent in the employ of the
							Hadley-Homan Banking Company, of Danville. In 1878 he was elected county auditor and
							served from 1879 to 1883. As auditor he was very efficient and his work in this office
							has been recognized by every auditor from 1883 down to the present time. He was deputy
							for a time after 1883 and was then elected for two more terms as auditor, after which
							he again served as deputy auditor until January, 1912, a period of thirty-six years,
							and during all that time he rendered the same faithful and efficient service in this
							important office. It is probable that he holds the record along this line, and that no
							man in Hendricks county will ever again hold a county office for the same number of
							years.</p>

						<p>Mr. Nichols was married in 1868 to Laura F. Cash, of Danville, and to this union two
							children were born, both of whom are deceased, and his wife's death occurred in June,
							1899.</p>

						<p>Mr. Nichols has been a life-long Republican and has always taken an active interest
							in politics. Fraternally, he is a member of the order of Free and Accepted Masons, and
							a charter member of the lodge of Knights <pb id="VAC1000-254" n="245"/> of Pythias at
							Danville. In his religious affiliations he is connected with the Methodist Episcopal
							church. Mr. Nichols is a genial and unassuming gentleman who is spending his declining
							years in the city where he has lived all of his long and busy life. His career has
							been an eminently busy and useful one and during all of his public career no action of
							his has ever brought upon him the censure of his fellow citizens. For this reason he
							has won the admiration and respect of a large circle of friends and admirers.</p>

						<p>The subject of this review is a representative farmer and stock raiser of Clay
							township, Hendricks county, Indiana, and is known as one of the alert, progressive and
							successful agriculturists of this favored section of the Hoosier state. In his labors
							he has not permitted himself to follow in the rut in a blind, apathetic way, but has
							studied and experimented and thus secured the maximum returns from his enterprising
							efforts, while he has so ordered his course at all times as to command the confidence
							and regard of the people of the community in which he lives, being a man of honorable
							business methods and advocating whatever tends to promote the public welfare in any
							way.</p>

						<p>Joseph N. Hargrave, son of Nathaniel H. and Matilda (Powers) Hargrave, was born in
							Johnson county, Indiana, November 6, 1873. Both his parents were natives of North
							Carolina and lived there until after the Civil War. Nathaniel Hargrave was in the
							Confederate service and served throughout the war in a North Carolina regiment. After
							the close of the war Nathaniel Hargrave and his wife came to Tipton county, Indiana,
							where they rented a farm, but within a short time moved to Johnson county, in this
							state, where Joseph N. was born. After a few years' stay in Johnson county the family
							moved to Tennessee, but in a short time returned to Tipton county, where they lived
							until about ten years ago. Nathaniel Hargrave then retired from active farm life and
							is making his home now with his children. Mr. and Mrs. Nathaniel Hargrave were the
							parents of eleven children: Susan, wife of Thomas Hendricks; Betty, who married
							Granville Cunningham; Thomas, who married Ida Gordon; John, who married Ollie Brown;
							Ida, who became the wife of Frank Winders; Dora, the wife of George Smith; Grover, who
							married Alda Graham; Arlie and Michael, both deceased: Della, the wife of John
							Samuels, and Joseph N.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-255" n="245"/>

						<p>Joseph N. Hargrave attended the public schools of Tipton county and received a good
							practical education. He then started to work on the home farm and continued to assist
							his father until he was about twenty-six years of age. He then married and began
							farming operations for himself and has proved to be a very successful and enterprising
							agriculturist.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hargrave was married November 3, 1898, to Maude Johnson, daughter of Jesse and
							Phoebe (Law) Johnson, and to this marriage there have been born six children: Inez,
							Paul, Stella, Beryl, Raymond and Martha. Mrs. Hargrave's parents had a family of three
							children: Maude, the wife of Mr. Hargrave; Alta, who died when young, and Stella, who
							married Clem Watson. The paternal grandparents had two children, and the maternal
							grandparents had six children: Wilson, Joseph, Jesse, James, Sarah and Phoebe.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hargrave is a Democrat in politics and takes an interest in the local public
							affairs of his party. Fraternally, he is a member of the Independent Order of Odd
							Fellows, while religiously, he and his wife are members of the Methodist Episcopal
							church and contribute liberally of their means to the support of this denomination.
							They are' firm believers in the efficacy of church work and are very sympathetically
							inclined toward all movements which seek to better the welfare of the community in
							which they live.</p>

						<p>The men most influential in promoting the advancement of society and in giving
							character to the times in which they live are of two classes, to-wit, the men of study
							and the men of action. Whether we are more indebted for the improvement of the age to
							the one class or the other is a question of honest difference in opinion; neither
							class can be spared and both should be encouraged to occupy their several spheres of
							labor and influence, zealously and without mutual distrust. In the following
							paragraphs are briefly outlined the leading facts and characteristics in the career of
							a gentleman who combines in his makeup the elements of the scholar and the energy of
							the public-spirited man of affairs.</p>

						<p>Seth Thomas Huron, son of Benjamin A. and Katharine Huron, was born in Washington
							township, Hendricks county, Indiana, June 26, 1850. His entire life, except for a few
							brief trips away, has been spent on the farm where he was born. He received his
							education in the public schools of his <pb id="VAC1000-256" n="246"/> home district,
							supplemented by a review course in the National Normal School, at Lebanon, Ohio.
							Afterwards he taught school four years, three of them being in his old home district.
							He belongs to a family of teachers, his father and all his brothers and sisters having
							been teachers. One of his sisters, Mrs. A. Kate Gilbert, made it her life work, having
							taught in district and city schools, and in the normal schools at Ladoga, Danville,
							Mitchell and Marion, Indiana, and at Central City and Fremont, Nebraska. At the latter
							place she is still teaching, lacking only a year of half a century engaged in her
							chosen profession.</p>

						<p>August 2, 1876, Mr. Huron was married to Mary Etta Farmer, at Clermont, Indiana. She
							was the daughter of David and Sibby (Ferree) Farmer, early settlers of this township,
							coming to Indiana from North Carolina before their marriage. Soon after their marriage
							they moved to Iowa and Mrs. Huron was born in Jefferson county, in that state, October
							19, 1856. When she was but a child her father volunteered in the Thirtieth Iowa
							Infantry, serving three years in the Civil War. After the close of the war he came
							again with his family to this county. He remained here until 1876 when he removed to
							Lucerne, Missouri. where he died, October 9, 1912, at the age of eighty-six years. In
							politics, Mr. Farmer was a staunch Republican; in religion, a firm Methodist and in
							every walk of life, a Christian gentleman.</p>

						<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Huron have been born six children: Mrs. Mary E. Blair, born May 3,
							1877; Frank Paul, born June 16, 1880, died March 16, 1881; Mrs. Irma R. Smith, born
							April 30, 1882; Flora F., born December 23, 1884, died June 15, 1894; Leroy B., born
							November 26, 1887, and John T., born October 16, 1890, are yet under the paternal roof
							and both are progressive farmers. Mr. Huron, with the constant support of his wife
							who, he says, helped him to attain to all that he has and is, is one among the many
							successful farmers of Hendricks county. His farm of near two hundred acres, known as
							Maple Row farm, is situated one-half mile east of Avon on the traction line and is one
							of the most attractive farms between Indianapolis and Danville. He believes in clover
							and tile drainage as the best means of conservation of the soil. He is also doing what
							he can to help introduce alfalfa as one of our most important crops. He feeds what the
							farm produces, selling the animal rather than the grain. Mr. Huron says he has always
							been a Republican, but never much of a politician. He served a term on the county
							council and a couple of terms as justice of the peace., but never sought an office nor
							asked any man to vote for him. The members of this family have always shown their
							interest in education and have ever been <pb id="VAC1000-257" n="247"/> loyal
							supporters of the church. The school building is on the corner of the farm and the
							Methodist church is opposite it. To this church the whole family have given their
							membership and support in all its activities. Mr. Huron has long served on the
							official board as trustee and steward, and for a dozen years was superintendent of its
							Sunday school and both he and his wife and their children have been among its teachers
							and its constant attendants.</p>

						<p>A family sketch for a county history should reach farther back from the immediate
							family and tell something of its ancestry. This is especially true if these ancestors
							had much to do in the early beginning of said history and if, throughout long lives
							lived in the community, they possessed such sterling qualities as to give their full
							measure of help in starting, sustaining and preserving measures for the common good of
							such community; and such qualities as have influenced and will continue to influence
							the community to make it a good and desirable place in which to live. It is therefore
							proper that this sketch include something of an older, a pioneer family.</p>

						<p>Benjamin A. Huron, the father of the subject of this sketch, was born in Warren
							county, Ohio, December 31, 1811. He came to Hendricks county in 1832 and from the
							government entered the same year the land now owned by the son. He spent the remainder
							of his life on this farm. In December, 1835, he married Katharine Harding, who came
							here from Kentucky with her parents. They began at once the making of a farm and a
							home to take the place of a dense forest. A two-room log cabin was erected in a small
							clearing near the center of the tract. These first years were years of privation and
							hardship. The heavy timber was cut down and burned in huge log-heaps, the wife helping
							to pick and burn the brush as well as care for the house. In addition she helped pull,
							break, swingle, hackle, spin and weave flax and also spin and weave the wool from a
							few sheep and thus, in a measure, supply the needs of the family. The husband spent
							the summers in the clearing and the field, producing the small amount of grain
							required for their own use and at one time, when a small surplus remained, he drove,
							in his farm wagon, to Madison, a hundred miles away, where he exchanged it for a
							barrel of salt and a few groceries and in a week or so was again safe at home. He also
							marketed hogs at Madison, driving them the distance on foot. In the early forties a
							settlement having formed and a school being needed, Mr. Huron gave the ground for a
							school and most of the timber for a frame building and for a number of years he taught
							school in this building each winter. Again in 1858 he gave a new school-house site
							where a one-room house answered the needs until 1879 when a four-room <pb
								id="VAC1000-258" n="248"/> graded school building was erected and five years later
							rebuilt after a fire. This fourth building still stands, so that up to the present
							time the district school, the "hope of the country," has never left the Huron
							farm.</p>

						<p>On this farm Benjamin and Katharine Huron together toiled for many years. They lived
							to see the wilderness transformed into a beautiful farm on which they reared a large
							family of children. Their eldest died in infancy, but nine others came to bless their
							home, and these nine yet live, though widely scattered. The sum of their combined ages
							is more than six hundred years. The eldest, George A., is police judge of Topeka,
							Kansas, and is seventy-six years old. Frank H. is a physician of Danville and Willis
							B., a physician of Tipton, Indiana. Mrs. Lu A. Bennett and Miss Jennie Huron live at
							Clearwater, Florida. Mrs. Esther A. Kelsey lives at Kansas City, Missouri; Mrs. A.
							Kate Gilbert, at Fremont, Nebraska; Mrs. Mary E. Ragan, at Plainfield, Indiana, and S.
							T., the only farmer of the family, lives on the old home farm. The two oldest sons
							served in the army during the Civil War, George in the Seventh and Frank three months
							in the Seventh and three years in the Seventieth Indiana Infantry. Frank answered the
							first call for troops and was among the first in the field. In the three years service
							he was color bearer of the Seventieth and at one time the flagstaff was shot almost in
							two just just above his head. Both brothers were in many hard fought battles, although
							neither was wounded. In politics the family have been Republican; the father was at
							first a Whig, but when the Republican party was organized in 1856 he at once joined it
							and remained with it during life. He served his township several terms as trustee and
							one term as assessor. February 23, 1888, he was killed by a train, on the Big Four
							Railroad, at the age of seventy-six years. The mother remained until August 30, 1902,
							when she died at the age of eighty-seven years. These two pioneers left their impress
							on the community where they lived so long and contributed their full share in making
							it the quiet and law-abiding place it is to-day.</p>

						<p>Though several years have passed since the subject of this sketch was transferred

							community in which he lived so long and which he labored so earnestly to upbuild in
							any way within his power, it is particularly consonant that specific mention should be
							made of him in a work containing mention of the representative citizens of the
							community in a past generation. A man of high moral character, unimpeachable
							integrity, persistent industry and excellent business judgment, he stood "four square
							to every wind that blew," and throughout the locality where he lived he occupied an
							enviable position among his fellow-men, among whom he was universally esteemed.</p>

						<p>The late Edwin Morton Kurtz was born in 1856 in Putnam county, Indiana, and died
							December 9, 1909. He was the son of Jacob F. and Eliza (Cassity) Kurtz, both of whom
							were also natives of Putnam county, Indiana. Jacob Kurtz was born in 1833 and was the
							son of Jacob and Allutia Kurtz, who emigrated from Kentucky to Putnam county in 1828.
							The father of Edwin M. Kurtz was reared as a farmer and followed this occupation all
							his life. After his marriage he lived with his parents until their death, caring for
							them in their old age. His father was an invalid for more than twenty years and walked
							on crutches all that time. He died at the age of eighty-three years. The mother was
							active until about one year before her death, but during the latter period she was
							helpless as a little child, and her death occurred at the age of eighty-two.</p>

						<p>After the death of his father and mother Jacob F. Kurtz became the owner of the old
							home farm, and there he lived until 1878. He was married in March, 1855, to Eliza
							Cassity, who was born November 19, 1838, the daughter of David H. and Susan Cassity.
							Her parents came from Kentucky, settling in Putnam county, this state, in the early
							history of that county. In 1882 Jacob F. Kurtz purchased a farm in the northwestern
							part of Marion township, this county, and there he remained until his death, in 1899.
							He was a life-long Republican and he and all the members of his family were faithful
							members of the Presbyterian church. His wife is still living in Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>Edwin M. Kurtz was reared on a farm in Putnam county, and after receiving a common
							school education in the district schools of that county his parents sent him to
							Lincoln University, at Lincoln, Illinois, where he received a college education. He
							came with his parents to Marion township, Hendricks county, in 1882, and two years
							later, on September 18, 1884, was married to Mary Florence Summers, who was born in
							Putnam county, the daughter of William C. and Mary (Lake) Summers. Her mother was born
							in 1833, on land now occupied by the city of Indianapolis, her father being <pb
								id="VAC1000-261" n="250"/> Elisha Lake, a native of New Jersey. William C. Summers,
							father of Mrs. Kurtz, was born in 1830 near Bowling Green, Kentucky, and when about
							nine years of age came with his parents to Putnam county, Indiana, where he grew to
							maturity, and followed the vocation of a farmer all his life. In 1872 Mr. Summers
							moved to Kansas, locating in Rice county, that state, and there he remained the rest
							of his life, his death occurring in 1898. His wife is still living there at the
							advanced age of eighty-one years.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Kurtz lived in Hendricks county for one year after their marriage and
							then moved to Rice county, Kansas, where they reamined for two years, when they
							returned to Hendricks county because of the failing health of Mr. Kurtz's father and
							the fact that there was no one to manage the home farm. Mr. Kurtz continued to live at
							the old place until the death of Mr. Kurtz in 1909. They were the parents of six
							children: Blanche is the wife of Harry Page, who lives west of New Maysville, Putnam
							county, and they have four children, Maynard, Gerald, Kathryn and Muriel; Osie is the
							wife of Earl Maston, of Coatesville, and they have two children, Roy and Jeannette;
							the other four children, Lora, Lyell, Herschel and Kye, are still with their mother at
							home. The year before Mr. Kurtz's death he built a fine, large modern home on his
							farm, in which Mrs. Kurtz and -the four youngest children are now living. Mr. Kurtz
							was a very successful farmer and at his death left a highly improved farm of two
							hundred and ten acres, which is one of the most productive farms in the county. He was
							an excellent citizen in every respect, a good neighbor, kind, unselfish, reliable, and
							a man whose integrity was never questioned. His life was such that his children and

						<head><hi rend="center">CHARLES FRANKLIN BENBOW.</hi></head>

						<p>The following is a brief sketch of the life of one who, by close attention to
							business, has achieved marked success in the world's affairs and risen to an honorable
							position among the enterprising men of the county with which his interests are
							identified. It is a plain record, rendered remarkable by no strange or mysterious
							adventure, no wonderful and lucky accident and no tragic situation. Mr. Benbow is one
							of those estimable characters whose integrity and strong personality must force them
							into an admirable notoriety, which their modesty never seeks, who command the respect
							of their <pb id="VAC1000-262" n="251"/> contemporaries and their posterity and leave
							the impress of their individuality upon the age in which they live.</p>

						<p>Charles Franklin Benbow, of Clay township, was born in the county in which he has
							spent his entire life on November 2, 1867. He is the son of Harvey R. and Lydia
							(Atkins) Benbow, his father being a native of this county, and his mother of Kentucky.
							Harvey R. Benbow served his country nobly and well in the dark days of the Civil War
							and after returning home worked for his father on the home farm for about two years.
							He then married and engaged in farming on forty acres which his father gave him. To
							Mr. and Mrs. Harvey R. Benbow were born two children, Charles Franklin and Oscar, who
							married Daisy Blunk, of Clay township.</p>

						<p>Charles F. Benbow was given the best common school education which his home township
							afforded, attending school in the Dover school district. He spent his summer vacations
							working on his father's farm, and after finishing his educational training he
							continued to work with his father until his marriage. About three years after he
							purchased seventy acres of land, part of which is now included in the. present farm
							where he is living. He has been uniformly successful in all of his transactions and
							has improved his place in the way of buildings, fencing, drainage, etc., until it
							presents a very attractive appearance. He has inaugurated a scientific system of crop
							rotation which keeps the soil of his farm up to the highest point of productivity.</p>

						<p>On December 18, 1894, Mr. Benbow was married to Nora Whicker, the daughter of Allen
							and Amanda J. (West) Whicker, and to this union there has been born one child, Leland
							W., who is still under the parental roof. Allen Whicker, the father of Mrs. Benbow,
							was a native of North Carolina and came to this state when a small lad with his
							parents. They located in Franklin township, this county, and in that township he
							received his education. He followed the occupation of a farmer all his life, and to
							him and his wife were born eleven children: Mary, who became the wife of John Bundy;
							George, deceased; Sinia, the wife of Louis Beasley; Simon, who married Nora Wright;
							Dennis married Gertrude Mason; Otto, who married Martha Schneider; Effie, deceased;
							Perman, deceased; Nora, the wife of Mr. Benbow and two who died in infancy. Mrs.
							Benbow's grandparents were Frederick and Elizabeth (Cosmer) Whicker. Mrs. Benbow's
							mother died April 1, 1910.</p>

						<p>The grandparents of Mr. Benbow were Elam and Lydia (Harvey) Benbow. Elam Benbow was a
							native of North Carolina and came to Hendricks <pb id="VAC1000-263" n="252"/> county,
							Indiana, when a young man and here he married. To this union were born five children:
							Thirza, Nancy, Sarah, Rhoda and Harvey, the father of Charles F. Benbow. Thirza,
							deceased, married Woodson Bryant, also deceased; Nancy married Eli Duffey; Sarah
							married William Hunt, who is mentioned specifically elsewhere in this volume; Rhoda
							married George Tincher.</p>

						<p>Mr. Benbow has been a life-long Republican, but has never felt any inclination to
							take an active part in politics, his agricultural interests having required his
							attention to such an extent that he has left the political game to others. He and his
							wife are members of the Baptist church, at Amo, and are firm believers in the efficacy
							of church life in its relation to the good of the community. Mr. Benbow was treasurer
							of the church for a period of ten years. He is a man who is vitally interested in the
							educational, moral and civic advancement of his community and takes every opportunity
							to further every movement looking toward its welfare.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">ENOCH HARLAN.</hi></head>

						<p>It is a pleasure to investigate the career of a successful, self-made man. Peculiar
							honor attaches to that individual who, beginning the great struggle of life alone and
							unaided, gradually overcomes unfavorable environment, removes one by one the obstacles
							from the pathway of success and by the master strokes of his own force and vitality
							succeeds in forging his way to the front and winning for himself a competency and a
							position of esteem and influence among his fellowmen. Such is the record of the
							popular citizen of Clay township to a brief synopsis of whose life and character the
							following pages are devoted.</p>

						<p>Enoch Harlan, a gallant veteran of the Civil War and a prominent farmer in Hendricks
							county, Indiana, for three score and ten years, was born in this county, October 8,
							1838. He is a son of Enoch and Rachel (Osborne) Harlan, both natives of North
							Carolina. Enoch Harlan, Sr., spent the most of his life in the latter state, coming to
							Indiana after his marriage and locating in Franklin township, where he followed the
							vocation of a farmer. He had always been engaged in this calling with the exception of
							a short time when he worked in a gold mine in North Carolina. Enoch Harlan, Sr., and
							his wife were the parents of eight children: Lydia, who died in 1838; John, who
							married Polly McAninch, and after her death, Araminta <pb id="VAC1000-264" n="253"/>
							McAninch; Stephen, who married Dosia A. Johnson; Malinda, who married Jackson Ally;
							Mariam, who became the wife of William Holslaw; Elizabeth, who married Benjamin
							Bottorff; Jesse, who married Jemima Robinson; Rachel, who married Madison Wright, and
							Enoch, the immediate subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>Enoch Harlan, Jr., received all of his education in the subscription schools of his
							home township, and when a mere lad engaged in the carpenter trade with his brother. He
							was following that vocation when the Civil War broke out and he immediately forsook
							the carpenter's bench for the battlefield and first enlisted in Company C of the
							Fifty-fifth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, in which he served for three months.
							At the expiration of his first enlistment he re-enlisted in the One Hundred
							Seventeenth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry and served for about nine months, and
							upon the expiration of this enlistment he was enrolled for the third time with Company
							H, of the Eleventh Indiana Volunteer Infantry, with which command he served until the
							close of the war. His Civil War record was a remarkable one and yet with his modesty
							it is difficult to get him to say anything about it.</p>

						<p>After his return from the Civil War Mr. Harlan was married to Susanna E. Phillips,
							the daughter of Samuel and Rachel Phillips, and to this union were born six children,
							two of whom died in infancy and one, Alvin, who died at the age of five. The other
							three are unmarried and are all under the parental roof: Eva, Ella and Albert.</p>

						<p>The grandparents of Mr. Harlan reared a large family of twelve children: Hiram, who
							married Sallie Hodson; Enoch, the father of the subject of this sketch; John, who
							married Rebecca Hill; Nathan, who married Rachel Jordan; Ahi and William, who died in
							infancy; Eleazer, who married Rebecca Hodson; Eli; Alice, who became the wife of John
							Hadley; Carter, who married Nancy Tates; Mary and Jesse, who married Elizabeth
							Borders. Enoch Harlan, Sr., died July 8, 1840, and his wife on March 14, 1871. The
							wife of Enoch Harlan, Jr., died November 20, 1903.</p>

						<p>Mr. Harlan has been a life-long Republican and has been old enough to cast his vote
							for every Republican president from 1860 until the present time. He has never been a
							seeker for any political office, being content to devote all of his time and energy to
							his agricultural interests. He is and has been for many years a member of the Friends
							church, and has always been actively interested in every movement which was
							inaugurated by his denomination. He is still hale and hearty despite his years and
							enjoys life <pb id="VAC1000-265" n="254"/> as befits a man who has lived a clean and
							wholesome life for so many years. His life has been so conducted that he has won the
							unbounded admiration of all of those with whom he has been associated, and because of
							his genial personality he is a welcome guest in any home in his community.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN JAY CRITTENDEN CLAY.</hi></head>

						<p>One of the largest and most influential families in Hendricks county, Indiana, is the
							Clay family. They have traced their ancestry back to the Highland clans of Scotland,
							and from thence to Virginia, Kentucky and Indiana. Two of the most conspicuous members
							of this family were Henry Clay and Cassius M. Clay of Kentucky. Many members of this
							family are scattered throughout the central and western states of this country, and
							one of the most prominent branches of the family in the state is found in this county.
							Wherever they have been found, they are always numbered among the representative
							citizens of their respective communities.</p>

						<p>John Jay Crittenden Clay was born December 17, 1853, in Eel River township, in this
							county, the son of James H. and Susan (Fleece) Clay, his father a native of Bourbon
							county, Kentucky, his birth having occurred there January 20, 1819. James H. Clay was
							the son of Littleberry and Arabella (McCoun) Clay, and he was married July 29, 1841,
							to Susan Fleece, his marriage taking place shortly after his father and wife arrived
							in this county. They came to Indiana about 1840, settling in the southern part of Eel
							River township where Littleberry Clay bought a section of land. A few years later he
							went to Missouri, but James remained in this county. Susan Fleece was born in Boyle
							county, Kentucky, near Danville, and came here with her parents, Charles Fleece and
							wife, in the early history of the county. Her parents settled west of North Salem near
							Eel River where they entered government land when that part of the county was a total
							wilderness. James H. Clay followed the vocation of a farmer for the remainder of his
							life and was a resident of this place about forty years, and here his death occurred.
							At one time he owned nearly a section of land, but before his death he divided it
							among his children, nine of whom grew to maturity: Mrs. Arabella Waters; Mrs. Mary
							Catherine Rose; Samuel C., of Lebanon; Mrs. Sallie Rogers, of Amo; James A., of
							Indianapolis; John J. C., whose history is here delineated: Nicholas, deceased; Arthur
							E., of Indianapolis, <pb id="VAC1000-266" n="255"/> and Joseph F., living about six
							miles southwest of North Salem; one daughter, Lillie, died in infancy.</p>

						<p>John J. C. Clay grew to manhood on his father's farm and received such education as
							was afforded by his home schools. When he was about eighteen years of age he learned
							the carpenter's trade and followed this vocation for the next four years. However,
							farming offered better opportunities for financial returns and he decided to engage in
							agricultural pursuits. Early in his career he turned his attention to the buying,
							feeding and breeding of live stock, and has been one of the largest shippers in the
							county. He has gradually added to his landed possessions until he is now the owner of
							over fifteen hundred acres of land in the northwestern part of Hendricks county and
							the northeastern part of Putnam county.</p>

						<p>Early in life Mr. Clay was married to Mattie J. Walker. In fact, he was only a youth
							of nineteen when he assumed the responsibilities of married life. Mrs. Clay was reared
							in Eel River township, the daughter of David and Mary Walker. Her father came to this
							state from North Carolina. One son was born to the first marriage of Mr. Clay, Charles
							C., who, is now living in North Salem. Mr. Clay's first wife died in 1875, and in 1881
							he was married to Mary E. Ballard, the daughter of George and Margaret (Polk) Ballard.
							Margaret Polk was born in Wayne county, Indiana, on May 9, 1831, and came to Marion
							county in this state in childhood with her parents. She was married June 12, 1849, to
							George Ballard, and her death occurred November 25, 1898. George Ballard was born in
							Scott county, Indiana, January 14, 1822, and moved to Marion county in 1834, where he
							lived most of the remainder of his life, following the trade of a carpenter. He lived
							a part of the time in the city of Indianapolis, but spent his declining years at North
							Salem, where his death occurred in 1912. He and his wife were both members of the
							Methodist Episcopal church.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Clay have two children living and one deceased: Edna Coral, born in
							1882, is the wife of Taylor Owen, and lives in North Salem; James Henry, born in 1885,
							married Ina Sparks, and is a farmer in this township.</p>

						<p>Mr. Clay and his wife are both loyal and earnest members of the Christian church, and
							are zealous in the support of the various organizations of that denomination. He has
							spent most of his life in North Salem, from which point he ships a large amount of
							live stock annually. Personally, Mr. Clay is a man of unblemished reputation and the
							strictest integrity, and his private life has always been above reproach. He is a
							vigorous, as well <pb id="VAC1000-267" n="256"/> as an independent thinker and has the
							courage of his convictions upon all subjects which he investigates. He is essentially
							cosmopolitian in his ideas, a man of the people and a fine type of the strong American
							manhood which commands the respect of all classes by reason of genuine worth. Thus he
							has so impressed his individuality upon the community as to win the confidence and
							esteem of his fellow citizens and become influential in leading them to better
							things.</p>

						<p>The present age is essentially utilitarian and the life of every successful man
							carries a lesson which, told in contemporary narrative, is productive of much good in
							shaping the destiny of others. There is, therefore, a due measure of satisfaction in
							presenting, even in brief resume, the life and achievements of such men, and in
							preparing the following history of the scholarly physician whose name appears above it
							is with the hope that it may prove not only interesting and instructive, but also
							serve as an incentive to those who contemplate making the medical profession their
							life work.</p>

						<p>Dr. W. J. Hoadley, the oldest physician in Hendricks county, was born March 2, 1831,
							in Chatham county, North Carolina. His parents, Abram and Sophia (Staley) Hoadley,
							came to Hendricks county, Indiana, in 1837, where they lived the remainder of their
							lives. Abram Hoadley was born in Bramford, Connecticut, in 1793, and began the
							practice of medicine in Chatham county, North Carolina, as a young man. His wife was a
							native of Randolph county, that state. After Dr. Abram Hoadley came to Hendricks
							county, Indiana, he practiced medicine in this and adjoining counties and was one of
							the best known men in Hendricks county at the time of his death in 1865. When he and
							his family came from North Carolina to this state, they made the long trip in a wagon
							and carriage, and such was the condition of the roads at that time that it took them
							over six weeks to make the journey. The widow of Dr. Abram Hoadley died in 1898, at
							the advanced age of ninety-two years. Dr. Abram Hoadley and wife were the parents of
							twelve children, only three of whom are now living, Abram Hoadley, who lives on the
							old homestead farm in Washington township, this county; Mrs. Alvira Hornaday, who is
							the oldest of the family and lives with her children in this county, and Dr. W. J.
							Hoadley, the immediate subject of this review.</p>

						<p>Doctor W. J. Hoadley was only six years of age when his parents made <pb

								<p rend="center">W. J. HOADLEY, M. D.</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-269" n="257"/> the overland trip from North Carolina to Indiana. He
							received his primary education in his home township schools and then spent two years
							in Asbury University. He then took up the study of medicine and, as was the custom in
							those days, read in the office of his father. Although he did not graduate from the
							Medical College of Ohio until 1866, he had practiced medicine for nine years before
							that time at Pittsboro, this county. In 1866, immediately after his graduation, he
							opened offices in Danville and has practiced there continuously, although he is now
							practically retired from the active duties of his profession. He is now, and has been
							for the past eighteen years, secretary of the Hendricks county board of health.</p>

						<p>Doctor Hoadley was married on April 11, 1861, to Louisa F. Shirley, the daughter of
							James and Demirah Shirley, a well known family of Hendricks county, and to his
							marriage there were born four children: Willis F., who lives in central California;
							Eva, the wife of Nathan J. Thompson, of this county; Harry H., who also is a resident
							of California; Anna May, deceased, who was the wife of Benjamin Lingenfelter. Doctor
							Hoadley's wife has been dead for about twenty years.</p>

						<p>For more than eighteen years after the Civil War, Doctor Hoadley was pension examiner
							and was known for his absolute honesty in the conduct of this office. He bore an
							unblemished reputation for honesty and high integrity. While active in the practice he
							was wholly devoted to his profession and no man stands higher in the community than
							the venerable Doctor Hoadley. He is the oldest physician in the county, both as to
							years and as to length of service. His health is excellent for a man of his age and
							his physical and mental powers are intact after a busy life of over eighty-three
							years. He has a hopeful disposition and is of an optimistic nature and has always made
							it a practice to look for the silver lining on every cloud which has swept across his
							horizon. He is a stanch member of the Christian church and has been one of its elders
							for more than twenty-five years. For many years he was a Mason, but now has a demit
							from the local lodge at Danville.</p>

						<p>Doctor Hoadley's father came of English ancestry, while his mother was of German
							descent. The Hoadleys trace their lineage back to the year 1600, when there was a man
							by the name of Hoadle, who reared four sons, who married and in turn reared large
							families of their own. Doctor Hoadley is the sixth generation from this Hoadle of
							1600. There are now about eighteen hundred Hoadleys in the United States alone.</p>

						<p>Doctor Hoadley is a remarkably strong and active man for one who has lived fourscore
							and three years, with a self-governed body and a mind of <pb id="VAC1000-270" n="258"
							/> sterling quality. With a generous nature, he has been in the forefront among the
							good men of this county, leading the wonderful development that has marked Hendricks
							county the past seven decades. Few men here have done longer or equal service in the
							progress of this community.</p>

						<p>There is no calling, however humble, in which enterprise and industry, coupled with a
							well directed purpose, will not be productive of some measure of success, and in the
							pursuit of agriculture the qualities mentioned are quite essential. Among the well
							known and highly respected farmers of Hendricks county who have attained to a definite
							degree of success in their line and who at the same time have greatly benefited the
							community in which they have lived, is the gentleman to a review of whose career we
							now direct the reader's attention.</p>

						<p>Lincoln A. Masten, the proprietor of a one-hundred-ten-acre farm in Clay township,
							Hendricks county, was born in this county, September 21, 1860, the son of William and
							Delphinia (Johnson) Masten. His father was a native of North Carolina, his birth
							having occurred there in 1832, while his mother was a native of Indiana, having been
							born here in 1833. When a small child, William Masten was brought from North Carolina
							to Indiana by his parents, and his father entered land from the government, south of
							Amo, Franklin township, and here William Masten spent his boyhood and was married.
							After his marriage his father gave him a small farm to start with, and being a farmer
							of more than ordinary ability he gradually added to his possessions. However, he did
							not always reside in this county. For some years he lived in Morgan county, Indiana,
							and for three years he farmed in the state of Kansas, but the love for his home state
							drew him back and he died in Greencastle, where he spent the last twenty-six years of
							his life, dying March 13, 1910.</p>

						<p>William Masten was married three times, first to Janie Jackson, to which union were
							born three children, namely: Ursula Ann, who became the wife of Simon Allen, and they
							have three sons; Ellwood, who is married and is the father of a son and a daughter;
							Nathan, deceased, married Dora Cook, of Indianapolis, and they had a son, Otis. For
							his second wife William Masten married Delphinia Johnson, and to them were born four
							children, namely: Charles, who married Ida Ingold; Fred, who died in 1907; Rosella,
								<pb id="VAC1000-271" n="259"/> who married Lewis Phillips, and Lincoln, the
							immediate subject of this sketch. Mr. Masten's third wife was Elizabeth Wells, of
							Greencastle, Indiana, who died on February 3, 1914, there being no issue to this
							union. The subject's mother had the following brothers and sisters: Snyder, who
							married Patsy Shoemaker; Euphemia Curtis; Sarah Shields; Maria Wilhite; Wesley was
							married twice, first to Mary Garrison and second to Sallie Bryant; Belinda McClelland,
							and Jesse, who married a Miss Seaton.</p>

						<p>Lincoln Masten attended school in Morgan county, and when his parents went to Kansas
							he spent three years in the public schools of that state, and upon their return to
							Hendricks county he finished his education in the district schools of this county,
							after which he worked on the farm with his father until his marriage, when he
							purchased forty acres of land and started farming for himself. Being a man of good
							sound judgment and a farmer of up-to-date methods, he has been uniformly successful in
							all his transactions and to-day is the owner of one hundred ten acres of fine farming
							land in Clay township. He has his farm well improved and has a fine home and good
							barns and other outbuildings which add not a little to the value and attractiveness of
							his home.</p>

						<p>Lincoln A. Masten was married to Rosa Sanders, the daughter of Oliver S. and Saluda
							(Shirley) Sanders, and to this union there have been born three children; Clarence H.,
							Blanche G. and Sanders W. Clarence married Mary Derr, daughter of John Derr; Blanche
							married Thomas Wolfrom, and has one son. Maynard. The paternal grandparents of Mr.
							Masten reared a family of ten children, Eli, Nathan, Hanna, Mathias, Cyrus, William,
							Manuel, John, Reuben and David. Mrs. Masten was one of two children born to Oliver and
							Saluda Sanders, her sister being Minnie. Minnie married Louis Wilcox, of Los Angeles.
							The maternal grandparents were Aaron and Abigail Sanders and they had a family of ten
							children. Abraham, William, Jesse, Oliver, Ebenezer, Mary Ann, Lucinda, Emmeline,
							Martha and Jane. Mrs. Masten's mother's parents were Richard and Jerusha Shirley, and
							to them were born eleven children, Absalom, Minerva. Jennie, William, Mary Ann, Ruth,
							Saluda, Winerd, Stillwell, John and Benton. Absalom died at the age of twenty-two;
							Minerva married Joseph Scott; Jennie married James Cherfoweth; William died at the age
							of nine-teen; Mary Ann married Samuel Brazell; Ruth died at the age of twenty-four;
							Saluda is the mother of Mrs. Masten; Winerd died in infancy; Stillwell married Jennie
							Logari; John; Benton died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Mr. Masten has been a life-long Republican and has been very much <pb
								id="VAC1000-272" n="260"/> interested in politics, taking an active part in local
							elections. However, he is not a strict partisan, but reserves the right to vote for
							the best men in local affairs, regardless of political affiliations. He and the
							members of his family are adherents of the Methodist Episcopal church of Amo. Mr.
							Masten has been interested in all the civic and moral movements of the community and
							casts his influence in the scale in favor of all worthy causes.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">QUINCY ADAMS DAVIS.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the earliest settlers of Hendricks county, the Davis family occupy a prominent
							and conspicuous part. From 1835 down to the present time they have been important
							factors in the material and civic advancement of the county. The Davis family, of
							Hendricks county, trace their ancestors back to one Josiah Davis, who, according to
							the records, was born about the year 1665 in Wales. The family history has recorded
							only one son of Josiah Davis, who crossed the Atlantic ocean about the year 1771,
							stopping first in Pennsylvania, thence, after a residence there of some years, he
							moved to Virginia and later settled near Mount Sterling, the county seat of Montgomery
							county, Kentucky. He was married four times and was the father of twelve children in
							all, six sons and six daughters. Two of these sons, Enoch and Nathan, with their
							families, were among the early settlers of Eel River township, in this county, and
							from these two sons was sprung a numerous progeny, whose descendants are now residents
							of Tennessee, Texas, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Colorado,
							California, Washington, Oregon and probably other states.</p>

						<p>Nathan Davis, who has been mentioned, was born in Kentucky sometime during the latter
							part of the eighteenth century, and married Nancy Kidd, a native of that state After
							several children were born in Kentucky, Nathan, with his family, and his brother Enoch
							and his family, came to Hendricks county and settled in Eel River township. Nathan
							settled east of North Salem, bought part of his land from the government, and became
							the owner of more land from time to time until at his death he owned about five
							hundred acres of land. Nathan Davis and wife were the parents of nine children: John;
							Walter, the father of Quincy A., whose history is herein presented; Quincy, William,
							Frank, Marion, Mrs. Louisa Hunt, Mrs. John Fleece, Mrs. Catherine Tucker and Mrs.
							Susan Ann Riner.</p>

						<p>Walter Davis, the father of Quincy A., was born December 12, 1822, <pb
								id="VAC1000-273" n="261"/> near Mount Sterling, in Montgomery county, Kentucky, and
							was twelve years of age when his parents came to Hendricks county. Here he grew to
							manhood and here he married Mary Margaret Speers, who was born near Danville,
							Kentucky, and came here about 1835 with her parents, John and Martha (Mitchell)
							Speers. They settled about one and a half miles northeast of North Salem, where John
							Speers bought land and became a large owner in several townships in Hendricks and
							Boone counties. He bought lowland at a time when others were choosing the highlands,
							believing the lowland would eventually become the most profitable. To Walter Davis by
							his first wife were born eight children: John, Quincy A., Lafayette, Robert, Charles
							(the last two being deceased), Martha E., Nancy A. and Frances A. The first wife of
							Walter Davis died June 16, 1861, and he then married Mary A. Scott, of Montgomery
							county, Kentucky. To this second marriage were born six children: Walter; Lorenzo;
							Thomas Clarence; Edgar L.; Betty L., who died at the age of five, and Mrs. Myrtle D.
							Hendricks, the wife of Edgar Hendricks, of Jamestown, Boone county. The second wife of
							Walter Davis died in the summer of 1873 and two years later he married Mrs. Matilda
							(Free) South, of Danville. Walter Davis died January 11, 1893, in his seventieth year,
							a man highly respected and honored by everyone because of his upright and
							unostentatious life. He was a member of the Methodist church from his childhood and so
							conductd his life that he was beloved by everyone who knew him.</p>

						<p>Quincy A. Davis grew up on his father's farm and after completing his common school
							education in the district schools he attended Northwestern Christian University, now
							Butler College, at Indianapolis, for eight terms, between the years of 1867 and 1870.
							In early manhood he clerked in a gas fitting and plumbing establishment in
							Indianapolis for three years and a half and also taught school for eight terms, which
							included one year at North Salem, near his home. In 1876 he moved to the farm east of
							North Salem where he has since resided. He is a man of excellent judicial ability and
							has the entire confidence of the community. He has served as administrator of a large
							number of estates, a fact which testifies to the confidence which the people of his
							community have in him. For thirty years he has been a farmer and has kept pace with
							modern movements in agriculture, so that his farm today presents a very attractive
							appearance.</p>

						<p>Mr. Davis was married February 8, 1872, to Betty (Linn) Scott, who was born near
							Mount Sterling, Kentucky, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William Scott. Her parents came
							to this county early in its history and <pb id="VAC1000-274" n="262"/> lived here to a
							good old age. Mr. and Mrs. Davis have three children living and one deceased: Sylvan
							B. died at the age of three; Alden has taken the civil service examination for railway
							mail clerk, having passed one examination, another to be taken; he married Nora
							Higgins and has two children; Charles is in the blacksmith business at North Salem and
							Mary, who is still at home with her parents and who teaches music, having three large
							classes.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Davis belong to the Church of Christ at North Salem, and have lived true
							Christian lives through all of their career. Mr. Davis is a kind and courteous person,

						<p>The farmer is the bulwark of the nation and investigation has shown that a majority

							life, have been raised on the farm. George Washington was a farmer and was proud of
							the fact; Abraham Lincoln was reared on a farm in the southern part of our own state.
							Probably the most popular Democratic governor this state ever had was "Blue Jeans"

						<p>Silas M. Pearson, the son of Henry and Anne Spears) Pearson, was born in 1840, in
							Miami county, near Troy, Ohio. Henry Pearson was born in South Carolina in 1799 and
							came to Ohio with his parents when he was about twelve years of age or younger. In
							1858 he came to Hendricks county, Indiana, where he lived the life of a farmer and
							where his death occurred in 1882. Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearson were the parents of ten
							children: Rebecca, deceased; Sidney, deceased; Eunice, deceased; William, deceased at
							the age of two years; Robert, deceased; Hiram, deceased; Silas M.; John, deceased;
							Henry, of Grant county, and one child who died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Silas M. Pearson received his education in Ohio, but has supplemented the meager
							education which he received in the public schools with <pb id="VAC1000-275" n="263"/>
							continuous reading all his life. He was married to Melissa J. Little, daughter of
							Samuel and Rebecca (Green) Little. Samuel Little was a native of Washington county,
							Indiana, and came to Hendricks county with his father, Alexander Little, when he was a
							small boy. Alexander Little was in the Legislature in 1822 when the present capital of
							the state received its name. He served in the first, second, eleventh, twelfth and
							fourteenth sessions of the Legislature. Alexander Little died in 1903 and his wife in
							1883. To Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Little were born nine children: Mrs. Sarah Crawford;
							Elizabeth; Joseph, deceased; Alexander, deceased; Mary Ann, deceased; Robert; one who
							died in infancy; Melissa and Thomas. Mr. and Mrs. Pearson are the parents of seven
							children, five of whom are living: Edward; John, deceased; Mrs. Laura Esarey, whose
							husband is a member of the history department of Indiana University; Mrs. Cora Gard;
							Ada, deceased at four years; Mrs. Pearl Lamy and Harry.</p>

						<p>When the Civil War broke out, in the spring of 1861, Mr. Pearson, then a young man of
							twenty-one years, was seized with the same patriotic fervor which caused two hundred
							thousand of Indiana's native sons to go to the front, and as soon as an opportunity
							offered itself he enlisted for the service. He was mustered in during August, 1861, in
							Company I, of the Eleventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry. His company was
							attached to there Army of the Cumberland, and was in the field three years and three
							months. He saw hard service in the battle of Fort Donelson and many other battles. At
							the battle of Shiloh Mr. Pearson had the good fortune to escape unharmed, although the
							men on both sides of him were shot. He was not so lucky in the battle of Champion's
							Hill, for on this bloody battlefield, on May 16, 1863, he was twice wounded and then
							taken prisoner. He lay on the battle field of Champion's Hill for twenty-four days and
							for eight days was without food of any kind. He' remained a prisoner until the 30th of
							September, 1863, when he was paroled and then transferred to Company Ninety-one of the
							Veteran Reserve Corps, and assigned to the quartermaster's office, at Madison,
							Indiana, where he remained until the end of his enlistment, being mustered out at
							Indianapolis in 1864. Immediately after being mustered out Mr. Pearson returned to his
							home county and settled down on the homestead farm south of Danville, where he
							remained until his marriage, two years later. He lived on various farms in the
							immediate neighborhood and then moved to Danville, where he remained for five years.
							In 1898 he moved to his present farm of one hundred and sixty acres, where he is still
							active and able to manage his farm in a <pb id="VAC1000-276" n="264"/> very efficient
							manner. He raises all the crops common to this section of the country and in addition
							gives considerable attention to the breeding of livestock. As a farmer he has been
							very successful, because he has kept pace with modern methods of agriculture.</p>

						<p>Mr. Pearson has been a member of the Free and Accepted Masons for fifty years, having
							been initiated at Madison in this state, during the last years of the war. In
							politics, he has been a Republican since reaching his majority, but in 1912 allied
							himself with the Progressive party, feeling that the old-line Republicans were not
							conducting the affairs of the nation as they should. He keeps well informed on all the
							current questions of the day and is able to discuss intelligently the political issues
							which are before the people. Although he has always been very much interested in
							politics, he has never held any public offices, being content to devote all of his
							energies to the management of his agricultural interests. He and the members of his
							family are adherents of the Presbyterian church of Danville and contribute of their
							means to its support. Mr. Pearson is a keen, alert and progressive farmer in every
							sense of the word. He has always been a great reader and this has made him an
							entertaining conversationalist. He is a quiet man, who attends strictly to his own
							affairs, a man of strict integrity and high ideals, who has never failed to ally
							himself with all enterprises which have for their object the improvement and
							betterment of the conditions in the community in which he lives.</p>

						<p>It is universally conceded that there are three factors which are more potent than
							all others in the advancement of civilization, the pulpit, the platform and the press.
							Of these three the press reaches places and conditions which the other two are never
							able to touch. Public opinion as voiced by the newspapers has as much influence in
							molding legislation, advancing reforms and eliminating corrupt politics as all other
							agencies put together. A good newspaper, one which stands for the best interests of
							the community, is a blessing and the good that it can do is incalculable. It is the
							paper of the town which often is the only means of driving graft out of city affairs
							and placing the government of the city in the hands of the best class of citizens. The

							<pb id="VAC1000-278" n="265"/> deserves the praise of the community in which he lives.
							Such a man is the subject of this brief review.</p>

						<p>Julian D. Hogate, the editor and proprietor of the <hi rend="i">Hendricks County
								Republican</hi>, was born in Danville, Indiana, October 14, 1868. His parents were
							Charles F. and Sarah E. (DePew) Hogate, his father being a native of Salem county, New
							Jersey, where his birth occurred June 7, 1838. He came to Indiana when he was nineteen
							years of age and settled in Danville, where he was employed as a clerk until the
							opening of the Civil War, when he enlisted first in the Seventh Regiment Indiana
							Volunteer Infantry for the three-months service and later, upon the expiration of his
							enlistment, he reenlisted in the One Hundred Seventeenth Regiment Indiana Volunteer
							Infantry as second lieutenant of Company B. He served to the end of the war with
							honor, participating in some of the fiercest battles of that great struggle. He was a
							man of marked ability and popularity and in 1864 was elected on the Republican ticket
							to the Legislature from Hendricks county. He was one of the organizers of the Meridian
							National Bank, of Indianapolis, of which he was cashier until 1869, when he was
							appointed internal revenue collector for the sixth district of Indiana. He held this
							position until his, death, which occurred March 16, 1874. Charles F. Hogate was twice
							married, his first wife being Julia A. DePew and his second wife Sarah E. DePew, both
							being daughters of Jeremiah and Ann J. DePew. To the second union were born two
							children, Clair, deceased, and Julian D., the immediate subject of this sketch.
							Charles F. Hogate was a Methodist in his religious affiliations and always took a deep
							and abiding interest in the affairs of his church. In the Republican party he was for
							years a man to whom the party looked for counsel. He was a member of the Republican
							national convention in 1868, which nominated General Grant for the Presidency.</p>

						<p>Julian D. Hogate was reared in Danville, where he received his elementary education.
							After finishing the common and high school courses at Danville, he attended DePauw
							University. In 1888 he became connected with the <hi rend="i">Danville Republican</hi>
							as local editor, a paper which had been established in 1847. In 1890 he purchased the
							establishment and since that time has conducted the paper alone. His paper is the
							official organ of the Republican party of Hendricks county and, under the able
							editorial management of editor Hogate, it has forged its way to the front until it is
							recognized as one of the leading weekly Republican papers in the central part of
							Indiana.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hogate was married October 5, 1893, to Etta B. Craven, the daughter <pb
								id="VAC1000-279" n="266"/> of W. R. and Sarah E. Craven, and they are the parents of
							two very promising sons, who are now approaching manhood.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hogate are devoted members of the Methodist Episcopal church of Danville
							and have great faith in the efficacy of the various activities of the church. Mr.
							Hogate is a member of the order of Free and Accepted Masons and the Knights of
							Pythias. He has been a stanch Republican for many years and has served two terms as a
							member of the state central committee of his party. He served also as secretary of the
							state Senate during the sessions of 1905 and 1907 and the special session of 1908. As
							editor of the party organ for the county, he has been of inestimable value to his
							party. He has not been a rank partisan, but has stood for the better elements in his
							party during all these years in which he has been at the helm. He has always taken an
							active interest in the civic affairs of his town and every movement which seeks to
							uplift the community always finds in him a hearty and sympathetic supporter. He and
							his wife are very hospitable people, and number their friends everywhere throughout
							the county.</p>

						<p>Farming was the original profession of man. Through the countless ages which elapsed
							since the first tiller of the soil grew the first crop, the farmer has been the
							bulwark of all nations. Today more attention is paid to farming than to any other
							profession, and there is a reason for it. When a railroad thinks of expansion, it
							first examines crop conditions, and when a great insurance company has money to
							invest, it first examines crop conditions also. When the secretary of the treasury,
							Mr. McAdoo, and his committee sought to locate the new American original bank, they
							examined the crop productions of the various bank regions. When Dun &amp; Company
							prepare a general statement of business they examine crop conditions and always find
							the farmers' wealth most secure and increasing, and there is a reason for all of this.
							Land itself is the foundation of prosperity. The farmer not only feeds them all, but
							acts as the balance wheel and wealth builder of the nations and lives a more happy and
							contented life than his misguided brother. The interurban, telephone, rural mail route
							and automobile makes his farm a city improved estate. He is the final force that turns
							the wheels of factories; his land is the basis of security, the foundation of credit,
							"the great factor of prosperity and constitutes ninety per cent. of our nation's <pb
								id="VAC1000-280" n="267"/> wealth at the present time. Eliminate the farmer from
							Hendricks county and no other profession could exist. Thus it is that the farmer is
							the main-spring of prosperity in any county and the better farmers a county has the
							greater the material prosperity which that county will enjoy. Among the many
							substantial and wide-awake farmers of Hendricks county, there is no one who is making
							more strenuous effort for the advancement of his county's interests today than is
							Stephen Douglas Noland, the present trustee of Eel River township.</p>

						<p>Stephen Douglas Noland, the son of William and Elizabeth (Underwood) Noland, was born
							October 19, 1852, in Putnam county, Indiana. His father was born in Madison county,
							Kentucky, and grew to manhood, married and reared six children there. After the death
							of his first wife, William Noland married Elizabeth Underwood, a native of Virginia,
							who had come to Kentucky with her parents when a small girl. In the fall of 1852, a
							short time before the birth of Stephen Noland, the family moved to Putnam county, this
							state, and temporarily located near Cloverdale. While in this county Stephen D., whose
							history is herein presented, was born. A year later the Noland family moved to Center
							township, in Hendricks county, and located near Danville on the land where the Mount
							Pleasant church is now standing. William Noland was a life-long farmer and died at a
							ripe old age, honored and respected by all of his fellow citizens. There were six
							children born to the second marriage of William Noland, of whom Stephen D. is the
							eldest; Melinda, deceased, was the wife of Marene Bonifield; Perry; Julia, deceased,
							was the wife of Walter Eastes; Mary, the wife of James Mannings, of Danville; John, of
							Indianapolis, who married Lulu Thrift.</p>

						<p>Stephen Douglas Noland remained on his father's farm until his marriage. He was given
							such education as was afforded in his home neighborhood and in October, 1874, married
							Ella Whitenack, daughter of Abraham and Caroline E. (Reynolds) Whitenack. The
							Whitenack family originated in Holland and were driven from, or rather left, the
							country on account of religious differences. They belonged to the nobility and upon
							coming to America in the colonial days they first settled in New Jersey and later
							emigrated to Ohio, where Mrs. Noland was born. When she was a year old, her parents
							located in Eel River township, this county, between Danville and North Salem, where
							her father bought a farm in 1856. Here the family lived until her father's death in
							1882. He was a farmer and during the summer operated a threshing machine and at other
							times operated a tile factory, employing more men in his various enterprises than any
							other man in the <pb id="VAC1000-281" n="268"/> township. He was a life-long Democrat
							and at one time was nominated on the ticket for county treasurer, but inasmuch as his
							party was in a hopeless minority he had no chance of election. Mr. and Mrs. Whitenack
							reared a family of eight children, namely: Ella, Mrs. Noland; Llewellyn, deceased;
							Isalona, the wife of John F. Jeffries; Viola, the wife of Marshall Gardner, of
							Indianapolis; Levona, the wife of Harry Dean, of North Salem; Theresa, wife of G. W.
							Lackey, of Lawrenceville, Illinois; Oscar Odell, of Denver, Colorado, and Leon A., of
							Indianapolis. Mrs. Whitenack is still living at North Salem, at the age of
							seventy-eight years.</p>

						<p>After Mr. Noland's marriage, he spent two years working with his father-in-law in the
							tile factory and then engaged in farming for himself. In 1881 he bought the farm where
							he now lives, two and one-half miles southeast of North Salem, on the Jamestown road.
							As a Democrat, he was nominated by his party for the office of township trustee and
							elected to this office in 1908. He is still holding this office by virtue of the fact
							that the 1913 Legislature increased the length of the trustee's term by two years,
							thus giving all trustees in the state who were elected in 1908 a six-year tenure.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Noland have reared a very interesting family of children, all of whom
							have received, or are receiving, the best educational advantages which it is possible
							for them to get. Mona, the oldest child, is the. wife of H. F. Adams, a farmer in Eel
							River township, and has two children, Edna and Harmon; Ralph W., who lives in West
							Lafayette, is now an instructor in machine designing, heating and ventilating at
							Purdue University, from which he graduated in 1910 in mechanical engineering. He is a
							brilliant young man with a very promising future before him; he married Madge
							Holloway, of Lafayette; Vera is a graduate of Indiana University, completing her
							course in 1911, and she is now teaching history and English in the North Salem high
							school; Ernest D., the youngest child, is a student in Purdue University, where he is
							taking the full course in agriculture. Mr. Noland has always been a stanch supporter
							of education, believing that in the training of the mind there lies the greatest hope
							for our future generations. As township trustee he has been interested in securing the
							best possible teachers for his district schools, and, moreover, believes in paying
							them the best salaries which the law will allow him to pay. He has seven schools under
							his charge, as well as an excellent high school at North Salem, where there are now
							seventy-five enrolled in the high school.</p>

						<p>Mr. Noland has been a Mason for many years and his son, Ernest, is also a member of
							that fraternal order. Sufficient has been said to indicate <pb id="VAC1000-282"
								n="269"/> the esteem in which Mr. Noland is held by the people of his township, and
							it is shown that he is essentially cosmopolitan in his ideas, a man of the people in
							all that the term implies and, in the best sense of the word, a representative type of
							the strong, virile American manhood which demands and retains respect by reason of his
							worth, sound sense and correct conduct. None have made better use of their talent and
							opportunities and today he stands as one of the representative men of his county and,
							measured by the accepted standard of excellence, his career has been in every way
							eminently honorable and useful and his life fraught with good to his fellowmen at
							large.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">WILLIAM I. GILL.</hi></head>

						<p>The record of William I. Gill, who is one of the leading citizens and progressive men
							of North Salem, Hendricks county, is that of a man who, from a modest beginning, has,
							without the aid of anyone, made a comfortable living, secured valuable property and
							laid by a competency for his old age, and at the same time won the undivided respect
							of all who know him as a result of his clean living and evident desire to promote the
							community in which he resides.</p>

						<p>William I. Gill, the son of James and Jane E. (Williams) Gill, was born in Floyd
							county, Virginia, on July 21, 1847. James Gill was a brick layer by trade and in 1867,
							when William I. was twenty-one years of age, the family came to Indiana, settling in
							Eel River township, this county, where James Gill engaged in farming and also followed
							his trade of brick laying as opportunity presented itself, and here he lived the
							remainder of his life, his death occurring in 1876. His wife survived him several
							years, dying in 1887. James Gill was a member of the Masonic order and both he and his
							wife were earnest and consistent members of the Christian church. They were the
							parents of seven children who grew to maturity and three who died in childhood. Those
							who lived were William I., Amanda, John T., Eli, Emma, James, Alfred and Mary.</p>

						<p>William I. Gill was educated in the common schools of his native state, and early in
							life learned the brick-laying trade with his father and continued to assist his father
							until the latter's death in 1876. He then operated a brick yard of his own for about
							fifteen years at North Salem and in the mean-time engaged in contracting and building.
							In 1891 he erected the town hall <pb id="VAC1000-283" n="270"/> and opera house
							building in North Salem. Later he built the bank building, which contains the Masonic
							hall in the upper stories, and since then has built most of the business houses of
							North Salem. He has also built all of the brick school houses in Eel River township
							except two, and a large number of concrete bridges over Hendricks county. At the
							present time he manages the opera house and also owns and operates a cement tile
							factory at North Salem. As a contractor he is recognized as one of the most efficient
							and trustworthy artisans in the county, and his various buildings are a tribute to his
							skill as a workman.</p>

						<p>Mr. Gill was married in 1877 to Lydia M. Henry, who was a native of Putnam county,
							Indiana, and a daughter of John B. and Elizabeth (LaFollette) Henry, her father being
							a farmer of that county. To Mr. Gill and his first wife were born nine children: Ora,
							who is a bricklayer, lives at Indianapolis, and is the secretary of the bricklayers'
							union of that city; Mary, who became the wife of Ollie Graves, of Marion township,
							this county; Beryl, the wife of Otha Williams, of Brownsburg, who is engaged in the
							retail meat business in that place, and they are the parents of three children,
							Martha, Kenneth and Louise; Malta and Brewer are still under the parental roof, Malta
							being the telephone operator in the local exchange; Vesta is employed in the North
							Salem postoffice. The mother of these children died in March, 1897, and in 1903 Mr.
							Gill married Sarah Elizabeth Bunten, a native of Marion township, this county. She was
							the daughter of Henry Harvey and Frances (Robbins) Bunten. Henry H. Bunten was born in
							Mercer county, Kentucky, in 1818, and came to Hendricks county, Indiana, in 1833, with
							his parents, William and Leanna Bunten. They entered government land near New
							Winchester and lived there the remainder of their lives. Frances Robbins was a native
							of North Carolina, the daughter of William and Leah Robbins, and came here in 1834
							with her parents, who located in the northern part of Marion township, where her
							father entered government land. Henry Bunten was a life-long farmer and was county
							commissioner and also held other public offices of trust. He spent his entire life
							here near North Salem, his death occurring in 1899, his wife surviving him until 1902.
							Mrs. Gill lived at home with her parents until their death.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gill are both earnest and consistent members of the Christian church and
							he is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons, both of them also belonging to the
							Order of the Eastern Star. Mr. Gill is a man of unusual business abilities and has
							been one of the most important factors in the upbuilding of his home town. He is a
							quiet, friendly man, always <pb id="VAC1000-284" n="271"/> progressive and has always
							thrown his influence in favor of all worthy enterprises.</p>

						<p>The family history of the LaFollettes, to which Mr. Gill's first wife belonged, is
							very interesting. The family originally came to the United States from France, during
							the time when the Huguenots were being persecuted, and first settled in New Jersey.
							The one male representative of the family who first came to America is the ancestor of
							a large and influential family, among whom are to be found Senator Robert M.
							LaFollette, of Wisconsin. Many of the LaFollettes have been prominent in the history
							of this state and nation and the Lafollettes of Putnam county have long been one of
							the prominent families of the county.</p>

						<p>One of the striking characteristics of the twentieth century is the advent of women
							into the professional field. It has not been many years since it was thought that
							housekeeping was the only occupation to which a woman might aspire, and yet today we
							find women in all of the learned professions. It does not follow that the entrance of
							women into the professional life means the loss of her womanly qualities in any way.
							Women have made the greatest inroads into the teaching profession and here may be
							found some of the brightest, keenest and most charming of the sisters of Eve. Indiana
							has been foremost among the states of the Union in opening her higher educational
							institutions to women, the State University at Bloomington being the first university
							to open its doors to women on an equal footing with men. Since 1867, when the first
							woman entered the portals of Indiana University, there have gone forth thousands of
							well-trained young women who have become important factors in molding the life history
							of the state. More than a score of young women from Hendricks county have availed
							themselves of the opportunity to obtain a higher education, and among this number
							there is no one who has achieved more distinct success than has the present efficient

						<p>Una Doris Adams was born in North Salem, the daughter of Thomas J. and Mary (Fleece)

							years in teaching and in 1909 received the Bachelor of Arts degree from the State
							University at Bloomington. She had already done high school work before entering the
							State University, having taught at Rock Branch and North Salem. She also taught two
							years in the public schools of Newcastle, this state, before graduation at the
							university, and after her graduation she returned to Newcastle and taught one more
							year, then came to North Salem and became assistant superintendent of the public
							schools at that place, under the superintendency of Theodore F. Martin. The following
							year Professor Martin became the county superintendent of Hendricks county and she was
							elected superintendent of the schools, a position which she has been filling ever
							since. As a teacher she combines both the proper educational qualifications and that

							school. On April 24, 1861, he enlisted in Company A, Seventh Regiment Indiana
							Volunteer Infantry, for the three-months service and from a private became promoted to
							the rank of a corporal. At the expiration of this term of enlistment, he went to Iowa
							and there enlisted in the Thirteenth Regiment Iowa Volunteer Infantry, and served
							until after the battle of Shiloh, where he was severely wounded by an artillery horse
							running over him. He came home on a furlough after the accident and while home helped
							to recruit a company from Hendricks county and Marion county, which was made a part of
							the Ninety-ninth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry. He was commissioned captain of
							this company, which was mustered in as Company H. Afterward he was promoted to the
							rank of major and was finally mustered out as lieutenant-colonel, after serving three
							years and seven months. His company lost nineteen men in the battle of Shiloh. Among
							the engagements in which the subject participated during the war were the following:
							Phillippi, Laurel Hill, Carrick's Ford, Chattanooga, Dalton, Tunnel Hill, Mission

							Chattahoochee River, Decatur, Atlanta, Snake Creek Gap, Resaca, Kingston, in and about
							Dallas, Pumpkinvine Creek, Altoona, New Hope Church, Big Shanty, Kenesaw Mountain and

							months at Charleston, South Carolina, until exchanged at Rough and Ready, Georgia. At
							the close of the war, Major Homan came home and engaged in the dry goods business in

						<p>The life of a farmer is one of comparative obscurity, yet such is the peculiar
							fitness of things that in no other station in life do we find men of sounder character
							and stronger principles than in the environment of the farm. Surrounded by nature, the
							farmer's life is one which offers fewer temptations and more facilities for developing
							strength than does the artificial life of the cities. And, as in the last analysis, it
							is character which counts, so in the end the life of an honest, upright farmer, like
							Mr. Bunten, may outweigh the life of a man who occupied a much larger place in the
							eyes of the world.</p>

						<p>John Henry Bunten, of North Salem, was born in Marion township, Hendricks county,
							Indiana, on February 24, 1850, his father being a native of Mercer county, Kentucky,
							and his mother of Randolph county, North Carolina. Henry Harvey Bunten was born in
							1818 and was the son of William and Leanna (Wilson) Bunten. When Henry Harvey Bunten
							was a young man he and his parents came to Marion township, this county, from
							Kentucky, and here William Bunten entered government land and lived the remainder of
							his life as a farmer. He was married to Frances Robbins, who was born in 1819, the
							daughter of William and Leah (Lamb) Robbins. She was a small girl when her parents
							left North Carolina in wagons to make the long trip across the Blue Ridge mountains
							and the Ohio river valley to this county, where the family entered government land in
							Marion township. Henry H. Bunten and Frances Robbins were married when they were both
							very young and lived the simple life of farmers all their lives, he dying in 1898, and
							his wife two years later. Henry H. Bunten was county commissioner of Hendricks county
							at one time, and, with his wife, was a life-long member of the Christian church, in
							which he was a deacon and elder for many years. Mr. and Mrs. Henry Harvey Bunten were
							the parents of nine children, <pb id="VAC1000-289" n="275"/> eight of whom grew to
							maturity. At the present time three daughters and John H., whose history is here
							presented, are the only living children of this marriage.</p>

						<p>John Henry Bunten was reared on the home farm and upon reaching manhood was given the
							management of the home place. He and his sister, Sarah E., stayed at home, caring for
							their parents until their death. Sarah E. is now the wife of William I. Gill, whose
							career is portrayed elsewhere in this volume.</p>

						<p>Mr. Bunten was married April 28, 1904, to Mrs. Pearl D. (Hadley) Duncan, the widow of
							Elmer Duncan, and the daughter of James and Jennie (Fleece) Hadley. James Hadley was
							born in 1847 in Marion township, this county, and was the son of Edmond R. and Sarah
							S. (Ragan) Hadley. Edmond R. Hadley was born in North Carolina, the son of James C.
							and Mary (Richardson) Hadley. When Edmond R. was a small boy, his parents came to
							Hendricks county, Indiana, and located southwest of Danville, where James C. entered
							government land. On this farm James C. Hadley lived and died, a life-long farmer and
							stock raiser. Edmond R. Hadley grew up on the farm and married Sarah S. Ragan, who was
							born in Mercer county, Kentucky, the daughter of Abner and <milestone
								unit="typography" n="-------"/>(McCown) Ragan. She came to this county in early
							childhood with her parents, who first settled in Putnam county, but later came to
							Hendricks county. After Edmond R. Hadley's marriage he was given a farm of forty acres
							by his father in Marion township, this county, and as the years went by he added to
							this until he had seven hundred acres of fine farming land at the time of his death in
							1875. Edmond R. Hadley and wife were the parents of eight children, two of whom died
							in childhood. Three or four years before his death Mr. Hadley bought a farm in Eel
							River township, and here he remained for the rest of his life. James Hadley, the
							father of Mrs. J. H. Bunten, was married October 25, 1871, to Louisa J. Fleece, a
							native of Eel River township and the daughter of John and Elizabeth (Davis) Fleece.
							John Fleece was a child when he came to this county with his parents. Elizabeth Davis
							was born in this county and was a sister of Walter Davis, the father of Quincy A.
							Davis, whose family history is given elsewhere in this volume. Since his marriage
							James A. Hadley has followed farming pursuits in Eel River township, and for the past
							thirty-four years he has lived in North Salem. In 1901 he sold all of his land but
							twenty acres, which adjoins North Salem. He owns a threshing and shredding outfit and
							still engages in that business. Mr. Hadley is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons
							and the Independent Order <pb id="VAC1000-290" n="276"/> of Odd Fellows, while he and
							his wife are both members of the Christian church.</p>

						<p>Mrs. Bunten was born in Eel River township, this county, and in 1891 married Elmer C.
							Duncan, the son of George H. and Nancy (Davis) Duncan. For two years after their
							marriage Mr. and Mrs. Duncan lived in this county, then went to Colorado, where they
							remained for the next seven years. At the time of his marriage, Mr. Duncan assisted
							his father in a tile factory, but upon his removal to Colorado he engaged in gardening
							and fruit raising. He died in June, 1900oo, at the age of thirty-three years, leaving
							his widow with one son, Glenn D. After Mr. Duncan's death his widow came back to the
							home of her parents and lived with them until her marriage to Mr. Bunten.</p>

						<p>After Mr. Bunten's marriage he built his present home in North Salem, and lived there
							for about four years. He then returned to the farm, but two years later moved back to
							North Salem and now rents his farm out. He is the owner of one hundred acres of fine
							farming land and also has the management of forty acres adjoining, which belong to his
							sister.</p>

						<p>Mr. Bunten is a stanch Republican in his political views but has never been a blind
							partisan in defense of his party. He is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons and
							he and his wife are both members of the Order of the Eastern Star. Religiously, their
							affiliation is with the Christian church, to which they give their earnest and zealous
							support. Mr. Bunten is a man in whom everyone reposes the utmost confidence, for his
							word is to him a sacred obligation and he has always been ready to assist in every
							good work and help those in need. He has a wide acquaintance throughout the northern
							part of this county, and is highly respected by all of those with whom he has come in
							contact and who know him personally.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">DR. THOMAS J. ADAMS.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the men of the past generations who have been influential factors in the life
							of Hendricks county, the late Dr. Thomas J. Adams occupied a prominent place. Doctor
							Adams was born September 22, 1837, in Center township, near Danville, and died at
							North Salem, this county, March 13, 1908. He was the son of Solomon and Nancy
							(Griffiths) Adams. Solomon Adams was a native of Nicholas county, Kentucky, and in the
							twenties of the last century came to Switzerland county, Indiana, where he married.
								<pb id="VAC1000-291" n="277"/> After his marriage he came to Hendricks county, where
							he was one of the leading pioneers.</p>

						<p>Thomas J. Adams received an academic education at the old Thorntown Academy in Boone
							county and began the study of medicine with Doctor Lockhart, of Danville, as his
							preceptor. For several years before the war he taught school in Tipton, Boone and
							Hendricks counties and on January 2, 1864, he enlisted at Danville in Company I, Ninth
							Regiment Indiana Volunteer Cavalry, for three years. He served until he was honorably
							discharged in 1865, the close of the war. On the organization of his regiment he was
							appointed hospital steward and served in that capacity throughout the remainder of his
							service. During six months of this time he acted as surgeon, his superior officer
							being absent from -the regiment. His regiment took part in many heavy skirmishes on
							Hood's campaign, being in the battles of Columbia, Franklin, Nashville and many
							others. Doctor Adams helped to care for the wounded. At the battle of Nashville, he
							remained behind several days to help gather up the wounded and send them to
							hospitals.</p>

						<p>After the close of the war Doctor Adams returned to this county and at once entered
							Rush Medical College in Chicago, from which he graduated in 1870. However, in the
							meantime he had been practicing at North Salem, beginning in March, 1866, after he had
							had one term at the medical college. After graduation he started to practice at North
							Salem and was more than usually successful. He was a member of the county, state and
							national medical societies and had a large medical library.</p>

						<p>Doctor Adams was married in April, 1867, to Mary A. Fleece, the daughter of John and
							Elizabeth (Davis) Fleece. John Fleece was born in Boyle county, Kentucky, the son of
							Charles and Mary (Harlan) Fleece. In 1836 the Fleece family came to Hendricks county
							and settled in Eel River township. Elizabeth Davis was born near Mt. Sterling,
							Montgomery county, Kentucky, and was the daughter of Nathan and Nancy (Kidd) Davis.
							She was about fourteen years of age when her parents came to this county and located
							northeast of North Salem, where they entered government land. While Mrs. Davis was
							still a small girl, her parents moved to Ladoga, where the father engaged in the
							general merchandise business for sixteen years. Then they moved to North Salem, and
							after the war her father moved to Jamestown, where he again engaged in the mercantile
							business until his death, about fifteen years later. While living in Ladoga he served
							as township trustee.</p>

						<p>Doctor Adams continued his practice in North Salem and vicinity until two or three
							years before his death, when a stroke of paralysis necessitated <pb id="VAC1000-292"
								n="278"/> him giving up his practice. He died in North Salem, March 13, 1908. Doctor
							and Mrs. Adams were the parents of seven children: Galen, Una and Herbert are still
							living with their mother at North Salem; Beulah is the wife of Dr. C. M. Trotter, a
							dentist of North Salem, with one son, Richard; Percy died at the age of twenty; Herman
							died when he was about six years of age; Ernest, the youngest child, is a graduate
							pharmacist of Purdue University.</p>

						<p>Doctor Adams was a member of the Free and Accepted Masons and the Grand Army of
							Republic, and held official positions in both. He was one of those strong, sturdy
							individuals who have contributed largely to the material welfare of this county and
							was a public-spirited citizen who always stood for the best interests of his
							community. For a long term of years he was active in promoting the community's
							progress along social and moral lines, and consequently his name will long be
							remembered for his potent influence for good in this county.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">E. E. BLAIR.</hi></head>

						<p>Specific mention is made of many of the worthy citizens of Hendricks county within
							the pages of this volume, citizens who have figured in the growth and development of
							this favored locality and whose interests have been identified with every phase of
							progress, each contributing in his sphere of action to the well-being of the community
							in which he resides and to the advancement of its normal and legitimate growth. Among
							this number is E. E. Blair, who, as a private citizen and public official in his home
							township, has won the esteem of his fellow citizens because of his blameless private
							life and his efficient public service. Some men in each community are the natural
							leaders in public affairs and among this number is Mr. Blair, whose training has
							rendered him peculiarly adapted to public service.</p>

						<p>E. E. Blair, ex-trustee of Washington township and successful farmer, was born
							October 13, 1865, in the township where he has lived the most of his life. His parents
							were Clark and Marium Blair, who were highly respected citizens of the community in
							which they lived.</p>

						<p>Mr. Blair received his common school education in his home schools and then entered
							Purdue University at Lafayette, Indiana, where he took an agricultural course of one
							year, then returning to his father's farm, remained <pb id="VAC1000-293" n="279"/>
							there and assisted his father until he moved on' to his present farm in 1895, He
							purchased it from the Walter Ross heirs and has improved this tract in many ways by
							erecting new buildings and draining and fencing it in a way to increase its value
							materially. While he raises all of the crops peculiar to this section of the state, he
							has made a specialty of hog raising and has been uniformly successful along this line.
							In his farming methods he has kept abreast of the times and keeps well informed upon
							the latest agricultural methods so that he may keep his farm to the highest state of
							efficiency. He is interested in all of the farmers' institutes and special short
							courses for farmers, feeling that these are things in which the farmer cannot make a
							mistake.</p>

						<p>Mr. Blair was married, in 1887, to Jennie Barker, the daughter of William and Louisa
							Barker, of Avon, this county. Mrs. Blair was born June 7, 1868, in Avon and received
							her education in the schools of that place. Mr. and Mrs. Blair are the parents of
							seven children: Nola, born July 10, 1888; Earl H., born July 21, 1891; Bessie, born
							December 29, 1892; Eddie E., born December 29, 1894; Everett C., born July 10, 1896;
							Russell B., born March 21, 1898, and Helen G., born January 23, 1900. All these
							children are still under the parental roof and are being given the best educational
							advantages by their parents.</p>

						<p>Mr. Blair has always taken an active interest in Republican politics and in 1895 was
							selected by his party to make the race for township trustee and that he was elected to
							that important office shows the esteem in which he is held by the citizens of his
							township. He responded to their confidence in him by rendering to them and to the
							township faithful and efficient service while in the capacity of a trustee. He
							interested himself in the township schools, roads and everything which came within his
							jurisdiction.</p>

						<p>Mr. Blair has spent his whole life in the township of his nativity with the exception
							of a short time in the West, when he spent about a year on a ranch in Indian territory
							and another year with a contracting firm in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>

						<p>Fraternally, Mr. Blair is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons at Bridgeport,
							Indiana, and is actively interested in the affairs of his local lodge. In every avenue
							of life's activities he has performed his full part and because of his genuine worth
							and high character he has enjoyed to a large degree the respect and confidence of his
							fellow citizens.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">CHARLES A. WHITE, M. D.</hi></head>

						<p>No other profession has accomplished, during the last century, the progress and
							development that have been made by the medical. The man of original thought and
							action, whose text-book forms but the basis of future work, has ever moved forward,
							taking advantage of and utilizing new discoveries in the science and looking always
							for better methods and surer means to the desired end. Such a man is he whose name
							heads this review. In considering the character and career of this eminent member of
							the medical fraternity, the impartial observer will not only be disposed to rank him
							among the leading members of his profession in his locality, but also as one of those
							men of broad character, culture and mental ken who have terrible struggles of the
							Civil war, his whole career has been replete with honor and success. He has been
							actuated by the highest motives, and to the practice, of his profession he has brought
							rare skill and resource, his quick perception and almost intuitive judgment enabling
							him to make a correct diagnosis. He has always been a close student of medical
							science, keeping in intimate touch with the latest advances along that line, and he
							has for this reason kept thoroughly abreast of the times.</p>

						<p>Dr. Charles A. White, one of the oldest practitioners in Hendricks county, was born
							in Canton, Washington county, Indiana, January 4, 1845. His parents, Maxamillian and
							Martha (Miles) White, removed to Hendricks county in the fall of 1850 and located in
							Liberty township, about two miles south of Belleville, then the largest town in the
							county.</p>

						<p>Doctor White was only five years of age when his parents came to this county. He was
							given a good common school education and at the age when most boys of today are in
							school, he enlisted in the local military company which was being raised in his
							county. Although he was only sixteen years of age when the Civil War opened, his
							excess of patriotic zeal made up for his lack of years, and as soon as the opportunity
							offered itself he enlisted in Company A, One Hundred and Seventeenth Regiment Indiana
							-Volunteer Infantry, and served out his term of enlistment. As soon as he came back
							from the front he began the study of medicine in the office of Drs. R. C. Moore and L.
							H. Kennedy at Belleville and later enrolled as a student in Rush Medical College of
							Chicago. He was compelled to borrow the money with which to pay his school expenses,
							and for this he paid twelve per cent. compound interest. In the spring of 1868 he
							began the practice of medicine near Bloomington, Indiana, but remained there only
							about a year. On March <pb id="VAC1000-295" n="[]"/>

							<pb id="VAC1000-296" n="281"/> 15, 1869, he formed a partnership with Dr. John Dancer
							at South Milford, Indiana, which was dissolved two years later. While located at South
							Milford, Doctor White took a second course of lectures at Rush Medical College and
							graduated as valedictorian of his class on February 1, 1871. In the following April he
							located at Wolcottville, Indiana, in partnership with Doctor Dancer and was rapidly
							building up a good practice when sickness in the family necessitated a change. His
							partnership with Doctor Dancer closed on April 1, 1873, and he at once moved to
							Danville, near their former home. He next went into practice in Danville with Dr.
							Henry G. Todd and they continued together from January 1, 1874, until March 1, 1877,
							when they agreed to dissolve. Doctor White then united with Dr. Wilson T. Lawson and
							they practiced together until October, 1879, since which time Doctor White has
							practiced alone.</p>

						<p>Doctor White was married on January 21, 1873, to Dee A. Miller, the daughter of
							Tolliver B. and Matilda (Gill) Miller, and to this union there have been born two
							children, Geraldine Max Millar, born June 14, 1880, and Glyndon DeLaskie Miller, born
							November 1, 1881.</p>

						<p>Politically, Doctor White has been a life-long supporter of the Republican party, in
							the councils of which he has been a prominent figure, and has frequently been a
							delegate to county, district and state conventions. Doctor White is a birthright
							member of the Quaker church, but at the age of twenty-eight years he united with the
							Methodist Episcopal church, of which he has since been a consistent member. In his
							fraternal relations, Doctor White has been a Mason since he was twenty-one years of
							age and is also a member of the Royal Arch chapter and the council of Royal and Select
							Masters. He also belongs to the Scottish Rite, thirty-second degree; to Murat Temple,
							Nobles of the Mystic Shrine; to the Knights of Pythias since 1878, and, from the age
							of twenty-one years, has been identified with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He
							is also an appreciative member of the Grand Army of Republic. He is a member of
							several medical societies, in the proceedings of which he is deeply interested. He was
							vice-president of the State Medical Society, president of the Seventh Indiana
							Councilors' District Medical Association, and has served as a delegate to several
							meetings of the American Medical Association. During President Harrison's
							administration, he served as a member of the board of pension examiners. He has for
							many years been medical examiner for several leading life insurance companies, is
							local surgeon for the Big Four railroad and for years has been a member of the Big
							Four Railroad Surgeons' Association. He has during <pb id="VAC1000-297" n="282"/> the
							forty years of his residence in this county built up a large and lucrative practice
							and been a potent factor for good in all lines of endeavor. He has been a
							public-spirited citizen who has always made his influence felt in all enterprises
							looking toward the betterment of the community in which he lives. During his early
							years in this community, Doctor White took a great interest in horses and he was
							instrumental in introducing into this county a higher grade of horses than had
							formerly been bred here. Personally, the Doctor is unassuming and approachable, a
							splendid conversationalist and excellent companion. Because of his high professional
							standing and sterling character, he is eminently deserving of the exalted position he
							holds in the esteem and confidence of his fellow men.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JEREMIAH JASPER PAGE.</hi></head>

						<p>One of the old families of Hendricks county which traces its ancestry back to England
							is the Page family, whose descendants now number thousands throughout the United
							States. The family name "Page" indicates that the family was once connected with the
							nobility, some members of which were once pages to members of the royal family. Later
							on some members of the family were given titles and received valuable concessions from
							the crown with the result that many of them became immensely wealthy. There is said to
							be an estate of several million dollars left in England by members of the Page family
							to which the American branch are justly entitled. However that may be, the Pages in
							America have always been able to take care of themselves and have never made any
							effort to establish their claim to the Page fortune of England.</p>

						<p>The Pages of Hendricks county trace their ancestry directly to Peter Page, an
							Englishman who came to Virginia early in the sixteenth century. Peter Page lived and
							died in Virginia, and to him and his wife was born Williamson Page.</p>

						<p>Williamson Page grew to manhood in Lee county, Virginia, and there married Elizabeth
							McCloud, who also was a native of the same county, and the daughter of John McCloud
							and wife, natives of Iowa. In 1830 Williamson Page and wife came to Indiana and
							settled first in the southern part of Hendricks county, where Jeremiah Jasper, whose
							history is herein recorded, was born. He entered land in Eel River township, one mile
							south of where <pb id="VAC1000-298" n="283"/> Jeremiah J. Page now lives, entering two
							tracts of fifty-six and one-half acres each. He moved onto his land in the fall of
							1834, built his rude log cabin of notched log and started in to carve his fortune out
							of the wilderness. At this time there were no roads except blazed trails from one
							settler's cabin to another; dense underbrush filled the lowlands and covered the
							highlands of the county; deer, wolves, turkey and small games of all kinds were very
							numerous, and the county was merely a hunter's paradise. Williamson Page had been a
							blacksmith in Virginia and his profession was one which was a very necessary
							accomplishment in a pioneer community. Gradually the farm was cleared and as the sons
							grew up and he had increasing assistance, the farm was eventually brought under
							cultivation. Williamson Page and wife were the parents of a large family of children:
							Nellie, Nancy, Elizabeth, Stephen, Andrew J., Jeremiah J., Chesley, Robert, Williamson
							and Demerius. It is interesting to note that at this time there were only three
							families in this locality, the Pages, Fleece and Zimmerman families. The Fleece and
							Zimmerman families had fifteen children each, making a total of forty children in the
							three families, and of those forty children there are only two living today, Jeremiah
							Jasper Page and Mrs. Rosena (Zimmerman) Waters.</p>

						<p>Jeremiah Jasper Page was reared under the pioneer conditions which have just been
							described and at the age of twenty, June 15, 1854, he was married to Ann Elizabeth
							Hypes, who was born August 18, 1838, in Botetourt county, Virginia, the daughter of
							Jacob and Mary (Pfeffly) Hypes. When she was three weeks old her family came to this
							county from Virginia in wagons, taking the trip of hundreds of miles through unbroken
							forests and enduring hunger and hardships of all kinds. The Hypes family settled in
							the northwestern part of Eel River township, where they entered government land, and
							here Jacob Hypes died in 1849. Ann Elizabeth was only fifteen years of age and her
							useful husband was only five years older when they were married and it is interesting
							to note the prenuptial agreement of these youthful lovers, a plan which they agreed
							upon before their wedding day. This plan, which is guaranteed to promote domestic
							felicity, they have followed for more than sixty years of wedded life and have never
							had a quarrel. This wonderful agreement, which has never been broken throughout sixty
							years of wedded life, is simply this: When either one becomes cross or out of humor in
							any way, the other is to keep still until the irritability passes away and not enter
							into any discussions when angry.</p>

						<p>The useful couple bought forty acres of new timber land entirely on credit and in a
							rude log cabin this fifteen-year-old bride started up <pb id="VAC1000-299" n="284"/>
							house-keeping. That they worked faithfully need not be told here. Within a few years
							they had their first forty acres paid for and were able to buy another forty adjoining
							it. This happened within a few years after their marriage, and it is to be remembered
							that when they were married they had only the following possessions: two beds, a
							horse, a cow, a few chairs, a few cooking utensils and no money, and yet this happy
							couple enjoyed life just as much as we do today with all of our modern conveniences.
							The table he made out of a plank and the meat and bread which she cooked in the
							fire-place tasted just as good to them as our porter-house steak cooked on the gas
							stove of today.</p>

						<p>Another chapter in the history of this interesting couple begins in 1866 when they
							sold their eighty acres of land and went to Iowa at the earnest solicitation of the
							mother of Mrs. Page. After reaching Iowa, Mr. Page carefully examined several
							prospective farms and came to the conclusion that the safest thing for him to do was
							to return to Indiana. Accordingly they came back to this county and purchased one
							hundred and forty-four acres of land in Eel River township. His success as a farmer in
							this county shows that he did not make a mistake when he left the broad plains of Iowa
							for the rolling fields of Indiana. He has prospered to a degree which he little
							dreamed, when, as a twenty-year-old youth, he started in married life with practically
							nothing. He has added to his land holdings from time to time until he and his children
							now own two thousand acres of land.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Page are the parents of eleven children: John H., of North Salem, who
							married Clarinda Davis and has four children; Mary Elizabeth, who married W. H.
							Robbins, of North Salem, whose sketch is delineated elsewhere in this volume; Samuel
							R., a farmer of this township, who married Rebecca Murphy and has five children;
							Jacob, a farmer in this township, who married Ida Thompson and has nine children;
							Frank, a farmer of this township, who married Ora Carpenter and has two children
							living; Ellen, deceased, was the wife of Daniel Robbins and died in February, 1912,
							her husband dying just a week before; they left one son; Joseph, who died at the age
							of seventeen; Belle, the wife of Amos Thompson, a farmer of this township, they have
							two children living; Cora, the wife of Ed Davenport, a farmer of this township, has
							one child living; Sarah Francis, and one other child, who died in infancy. Mr. and
							Mrs. Page have twenty-seven grandchildren living and twenty great-grandchildren.</p>

						<p>Mr. Page and his wife are both loyal members of the Christian church of North Salem
							and have been for many years. He is a man who esteems <pb id="VAC1000-300" n="285"/>
							honesty as the first essential to success and during his long career in the county he
							has so conducted himself that he has never been the cause of censure on the part of
							his neighbors. He has such a reputation for peace, that he is frequently called in to
							settle differences between his neighbors. Enough has been said to show the character
							of Mr. Page and to indicate the influence which he has had upon the growth of his
							township. His life has been a busy one and yet he has always found time to take his
							full share in the various public questions which concern his immediate community. His
							career has been honorable in every way and such as to justly warrant the biographer in
							using that famous old saying, "This was a man."</p>

						<p>Among the men of sterling worth and strength of character who have made an impress on
							the life of the locality in which they live none have received a larger meed of
							popular respect and regard than the gentlemen whose family name is well known
							throughout this section of Hendricks county, Indiana, E. B. and J. A. Owen, successful
							merchants of Amo, Indiana. Lifelong residence in one locality has given the people an
							opportunity to know them in every phase of their character and that they have been
							true to life in its every aspect is manifest in the degree of confidence and regard in
							which they are held by those who know them. In their mercantile business they have
							shown unusual ability and have achieved a splendid success among the followers of
							their profession.</p>

						<p>Eleazar B. Owen, the son of Jonathan and Asenath (Bales) Owen, was born near
							Plainfield, Hendricks county, Indiana, September 7, 1837. The Owens were of Scotch
							descent and upon coming to America settled first in Georgia, where the grandfather,
							Samuel Owen, was born and grew to manhood. Samuel Owen moved from Georgia to Ohio in
							an early day, coming from that state to Indiana in 1828, settling in Hendricks county.
							The maternal grandfather was prominent in the early days as a Quaker preacher and
							traveled, extensively in that capacity. He settled in Plainfield, where he followed
							the dual occupation of farming and preaching, being probably the first minister of the
							Friends church to locate in this county. He continued preaching and farming all of his
							life and in his preaching made extended trips throughout this and adjoining states,
							making one trip to North Carolina <pb id="VAC1000-301" n="286"/> on horseback. He
							lived to the advanced age of ninety-four. Jonathan Owen came to Indiana from Ohio
							early in life and settled in Hendricks county, where he lived until 1865, when he
							moved to Illinois, where he was later joined by other members of the Owen family.
							Before going to Illinois he conducted a flouring mill for a few years in Mooresville,
							Indiana. After going to Illinois, he engaged in farming and became a successful man in
							that state, his death occurring there at the age of seventy-two years. To Mr. and Mrs.
							Jonathan Owen were born several children: Eleazar B.; Anna, the widow of John T.
							Thompson, of Amo; Samuel, who died in infancy; Rachel C. died single; J. A.; Jemima V.
							(deceased), who married John Nugent; Benjamin B., a fruit grower, living near Tampa,
							Florida; Isaac J., an undertaker, living in Uma, Colorado; Ida, who married Wesley
							Thompson, of Farnam, Nebraska; Mary E., married Dr. William H. White, of Amo,
							Indiana.</p>

						<p>E. B. Owen was reared in Hendricks, Morgan and Marion counties, Indiana, and also
							lived for a time in Illinois. His father was in business in Indianapolis for about
							three years at one time. In 1864 he started in business on his own account by buying a
							saw mill in Amo in conjunction with Benjamin L. and John T. Thompson. They conducted
							this mill for two years and then sold it, after which Mr. Owen and William F. Henley
							purchased a store of J. G. Ralston, in Amo, and this they managed for two years, when
							they again sold out, although a short time afterward Mr. Owen and John V. Parker
							bought the same store back and continued to manage it for the next six years. At the
							end of six months Mr. Owen bought his partner out and continued to operate the store
							alone until he took his brother, J. A. Owen, into partnership in 1896, since which
							time the firm has been known as E. B. Owen &amp; Company. In 1886 Mr. Owen built his
							present two-story brick building, which, with improvements and additions, he has
							continued to occupy until the present time. He carries a large and well selected
							assortment of goods and by his genial manner and strict integrity has built up a large
							and lucrative business in the community. He is interested in the First National Bank
							of Amo, and is now president of that institution.</p>

						<p>Mr. Owen was married to Elizabeth Hunt, of Hendricks county, the daughter of Mr. and
							Mrs. Amiel Hunt, and to this marriage there have been born four children: Florence,
							the wife of William Hopkins, of Indianapolis; Ora Lela, who resides at home and is a
							teacher of music by profession; Myrtle, who is also a music teacher, and Nettie E., a
							teacher in the high school at Plainfield. Mr. Owen's mother is still living, at the
							advanced age <pb id="VAC1000-302" n="287"/> of ninety-six years, and is remarkably
							active and well preserved for a woman of her years. Mr. Owen himself has always led a
							clean and active life and, at the age of seventy-six, he enjoys good health and is as
							active physically and mentally as men of fifty.</p>

						<p>J. A. Owen, a brother of E. B. Owen and a member of the firm of E. B. Owen &amp;
							Company, was born in Plainfield, Hendricks county, Indiana, January 2, 1850. His
							boyhood days were spent in Hendricks and Morgan counties, Indiana, and in Illinois. He
							completed his education in Grand Prairie Seminary in Iroquois county, Illinois. In
							1875 he came from Illinois to Amo, Indiana, and entered his brother's store as a
							clerk, where he continued until he became a partner in 1896. For several years his
							brother, E. B. Owen, was in poor health and not able to be in attendance at the store,
							and during his absence J. A. managed the business.</p>

						<p>J. A. Owen was married October 13, 1881, to Laura A. Swaim, of Hendricks county, the
							daughter of Thomas and Elmira Swaim. Mrs. Owen's parents came from North Carolina to
							Indiana. Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Owen are the parents of six children: Mrs. John Stark, of
							Clinton, Indiana; Mrs. Don Garrison, of Amo, Indiana; Wilbur B., of Indianapolis, and
							two who are still at home, Edith and Dorothy.</p>

						<p>Fraternally, Mr. Owen is a member of the time-honored order of Free and Accepted
							Masons, and is, as are all the members of the family, a loyal adherent of the Friends
							church.</p>

						<p>Leslie Dayton Owen, the son of J. A. Owen, was born September 30, 1890, in Amo,
							Indiana, and received his education in the Amo schools, graduating from the local high
							school. After leaving school he entered the employ of the Terre Haute &amp; Eastern
							Traction Company, where he remained for one year. He then became a clerk in the store
							of his father and uncle, where he is still employed. He was married on June 2, 1913,
							to Ruth Stanley, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Stanley, of Coatesville, this
							county. His wife's father is a merchant in Coatesville. Leslie Owen is a member of the
							Masonic order and a young man of more than ordinary ability, with the promise of a
							bright future before him. Wilbur Owen also graduated from the Amo high school and
							since that time has held some position with the Terre Haute &amp; Eastern Traction
							Company, at the present time being employed at the Terminal ticket office in
							Indianapolis. He is a member of the Knights of Pythias, Uniform Rank, also of the
							Masonic order.</p>

						<p>E. B. Owen is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, merchant in Hendricks county now
							living, having commenced in 1867.</p>

						<p>Professional success comes from merit. Frequently in commercial life one may come
							into possession of a lucrative business through inheritance or gift, but in what are
							known as the learned professions advancement is gained only through painstaking and
							long-continued effort. Prestige in the healing art is the outcome of a strong
							mentality, close application, thorough mastery of its great underlying principles and
							the ability to apply theory to practice in the treatment of diseases. Good
							intellectual training, thorough professional knowledge and the possession and
							utilization of the qualities and attributes essential to success have made the subject
							of this review eminent in his chosen calling and he stands today among the scholarly
							and enterprising physicians in a county noted for the high order of its medical
							talent.</p>

						<p>Dr. Louis V. Armstrong, a man of exceptionally high intellectual and professional
							attainments, was born in New York city September 21, 1875. His parents were Robert W.
							and Eudocia E. (Muller) Armstrong, both of whom were natives of Baltimore, Maryland.
							His father was a dentist, but retired from this profession early in life and devoted
							his energies to literary work. He came west in 1849, but always retained his home at
							Baltimore, where his death occurred in 1902, his wife having died in 1898. Dr. Robert
							Armstrong and wife were the parents of seven children, six of whom are still living:
							William R. and Harry J. live near Baltimore, where they have a country home; Gelston
							H. is an electrical engineer with the Carnegie Company, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;
							Mrs. George F. Ludington lives at Baltimore, where her husband is in the packing
							business; Adelaide R. lives in Baltimore, but at present is traveling in Europe; Mrs.
							Wade H. Free, of Anderson, Indiana, whose husband is a prominent lawyer of that city,
							and was secretary of the Indiana Senate in 1913.</p>

						<p>Doctor Armstrong was given an excellent education, all of his elementary and college
							training being received in the Baltimore schools. He received his degree of Doctor of
							Medicine from the University of Maryland, graduating in the class of 1900. He was a
							resident interne at the university hospital before his graduation, after which he
							became the first assistant resident interne and later resident physician of Bay View
							Hospital at Baltimore, after which, for a period of ten years, he was on the surgeons'
							staff at the Franciscan Hospital at Breckenridge, Minnesota, and part of this time was
							chief surgeon. During all this time he was division surgeon of the Great Northern
							Railway Company. He left the state of Minnesota and <pb id="VAC1000-304" n="[]"/>

							<pb id="VAC1000-305" n="289"/> came to Danville, Indiana, in June, 1912, and bought
							out the office and practice of Doctor O'Brien. Since then he has built substantial
							additions and improved his hospital until he now has one of the finest private
							hospitals in the state. He specializes in surgery and has been remarkably successful
							along this line. Though comparatively a newcomer in Danville, he has rapidly forged to
							the front, and now occupies a distinct position both as a public-spirited citizen and
							as a physician of more than local repute.</p>

						<p>Doctor Armstrong was married June 8, 1904, to Louise E. Hyser, daughter of Edward R.
							and Susan Hyser, of Breckenridge, Minnesota. Her father was a native of Boston,
							Massachusetts, and her mother of Germany. To this happy marriage there have been born
							two children, Robert W. and Margaret S., aged eight and seven respectively. Doctor
							Armstrong is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons, the Order of the Eastern Star,
							Knights of Pythias, Ancient Order of United Workmen and Independent Order of Odd
							Fellows. He is also a member of the county, state and American medical associations
							and takes a deep interest in the affairs of all associations which concern his chosen
							field of endeavor. As a surgeon he is a member of the Clinical Congress of Surgeons of
							America, the greatest organization of its kind in the world. He and his wife are loyal
							and consistent members of the Methodist Episcopal church and contribute liberally of
							their substance to its support.</p>

						<p>The gentleman to a review of whose life the reader's attention is here respectfully
							directed is recognized as one of the energetic, well known business men of Hendricks
							county, Indiana, who, by his enterprise and progressive methods, has contributed in a
							material way to the commercial advancement of the locality where he lives. In the
							course of an honorable career he has been successful in the manifold lines to which
							his efforts have been directed and, enjoying distinctive prestige among the
							representative men of his community, it is eminently proper that attention be called
							to his achievements and due credit be accorded to his worth as an enterprising
							citizen.</p>

						<p>Archibald A. Figg, one of the widest known and most popular business men of Hendricks
							county, Indiana, was born February 12, 1866, in Floyd township, Putnam county,
							Indiana, the son of William H. and Louisa <pb id="VAC1000-306" n="290"/> (Miller)
							Figg, his father being a native of Shelby county, Kentucky, and his mother of Putnam
							county, Indiana. William H. Figg came to Putnam county with his father, Asbury Figg,
							when he was a lad of fourteen years and the family settled in Floyd township, that
							county. Asbury Figg lived in that county until his death, at the age of eighty years.
							Mr. and Mrs. WV. H. Figg still live in Clay township, Hendricks county, and are among
							the oldest and most highly respected citizens of the community in which they have
							lived for so many years. William H. Figg lived in Putnam county until about
							twenty-five years ago, when he removed to Hendricks county, where he has continued to
							follow the occupation of a farmer. W. H. Figg was an ardent member of the Methodist
							Episcopal church all his life and in his political affiliations he adhered to the
							Prohibition party. Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Figg were the parents of six children: Laura,
							the wife of John H. Summers, of this county; Archibald A., the immediate subject of
							this sketch; John S., of Indianapolis; James W., of Danville; Ida B., wife of Ote
							Hunt, of Coatesville, Indiana; Ella died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Archibald A. Figg was born, reared and grew to manhood on his father's farm, and
							received his education in the district schools of his home township, while early in
							life he was initiated into all the mysteries of farming. At the age of twenty-five
							years he began to farm for himself, and for a number of years he farmed in the
							immediate neighborhood of the old homestead. In 1898 he was elected sheriff of
							Hendricks county upon the Republican ticket and so efficient and popular was his
							administration that he secured the nomination in 1900 and a re-election. He was the
							first man for twenty-two years in Hendricks county to serve two terms, as there had
							been no man in the county for that length of time previous to his re-election who had
							been elected for more than one term. Before he served his county as sheriff and most
							of the time since then he has been more or less engaged in the auctioneering
							profession. He is a member of the Indiana Auctioneers' Association and was president
							of the association for two terms. Since leaving the sheriff's office he has been
							engaged in the livery business and within the last three years he has been in the
							automobile business as well. He is now agent for the Studebaker and Ford cars and has
							been a very successful agent for the companies manufacturing those cars. His twelve
							years of experience as an auctioneer and four years as sheriff his enabled him to call
							more people by their names than any other man in the county. He is a man of
							magnificent physique and one who attracts attention where-ever he goes. His genial
							personality makes itself felt in all his auctioneering <pb id="VAC1000-307" n="291"/>
							audiences and this fact is probably the real cause of his remarkable success on the
							block.</p>

						<p>Mr. Figg was married November 23, 1913, to Mrs. Ada B. (Smith) Thompson, the daughter
							of Mr. and Mrs. McKindry Smith. Mr. Figg is a prominent member of the Knights of
							Pythias and has had the honor of holding every chair in the subordinate lodge of that
							fraternal order. He is familiarly known throughout the county as "Colonel," and his
							optimistic disposition and genial manner with his friends have made him one of the
							best known and best liked men in the county. His sterling uprightness in all of his
							business transactions through the many years in which he has been engaged in business
							has won for him the unlimited confidence and regard of all those with whom he has had
							business relations. The world has too few men who shed sunshine around them, and were
							there more such men as Colonel Figg the world would be brighter and happier.</p>

						<p>The men most influential in promoting the advancement of society and in giving
							character to the times in which they live are two classes, to-wit, the men of study
							and the men of action. Whether we are more indebted for the improvement of the age to
							the one class or the other is a question of honest difference of opinion. Neither
							class can be spared and both should be encouraged to occupy their several spheres of
							labor and influence, zealously and without mutual distrust. In the following
							paragraphs are briefly outlined the leading facts and characteristics in the career of
							a gentleman who combines in his makeup the elements of the scholar and the energy of
							the public-spirited man of affairs. Devoted to the noble and humane work of teaching,
							he has made his influence felt in the school life of Hendricks county, Indiana, and is
							not unknown to the wider educational circles of the state, occupying as he does a
							prominent place in his profession and standing high in the esteem of educators in
							other than his own particular field of endeavor.</p>

						<p>Samuel B. Ensminger, one of the oldest teachers of Hendricks county, Indiana, was
							born August 3, 1849, on a farm in Center township, this county, one mile northeast of
							Danville. His parents were Samuel J. and Mary Ann (Megee) Ensminger, his father being
							a native of Maryland and <pb id="VAC1000-308" n="292"/> his mother of Kentucky. Samuel
							J. Ensminger came to Hendricks county, Indiana, when a young man and taught school in
							Crawfordsville, Montgomery county, Indiana, for a short time, and then came to
							Danville, where he followed the same profession. Upon the discovery of gold, in
							California, in 1849, he was seized with the same fever which actuated thousands of
							other men and went to that state, where he remained for the next twenty-two years.
							While in California he followed the occupation of a miner most of the time and made
							his headquarters at Placerville. In 1871 he came back to Indiana and later went to
							Tennessee, where he died at Murfreesboro, at the age of sixty-three years. His wife
							died December 29, 1871. Mr. and Mrs. Samuel J. Ensminger were the parents of five
							children: Melville C., deceased; one who died in infancy; Henry B., deceased, who was
							a soldier in the One Hundred Seventeenth Indiana Regiment and later in the One Hundred
							Forty-Eighth Regiment; Marshall L., deceased, and Samuel B., the immediate subject of
							this sketch, who is the youngest of this family and the only one now living.</p>

						<p>Samuel B. Ensminger was born on August 3, 1849, and, as his father left in May of
							that year for California, and did not return until 1871, he was past twenty-one years
							of age before he ever saw his father. He received a good education in the public
							schools of his county and later took a course in the academy at Danville. Being of a
							studious turn of mind, he was inclined toward the teaching profession and for nineteen
							years taught school in Center township, this county. During all of these years he
							farmed in the summer months and was equally successful in both occupations. His joint
							income from his farming operations and his teaching enabled him to increase his land
							holdings until he has become one of the most substantial farmers of his township. He
							eventually retired from the teaching profession and devoted all of his time to his
							agricultural interests, and continued to operate his farm until 1910, when he sold his
							farm and removed to Danville to spend the remainder of his days.</p>

						<p>Mr. Ensminger was married October 26, 1876, to Amanda Worrell, daughter of William
							and Martha (Wilson) Worrell. She was born in Washington township, this county. Her
							father was a farmer who came from Virginia. He was a great man for church and upright
							living; was often administrator and guardian. He had a family of thirteen children, of
							whom Mrs. Ensminger was the youngest. Two children have been born to Mr. and Mrs.
							Ensminger: Charlotte E., wife of Vernon Rudd, who works in the First National Bank of
							Danville, and Frederick DeWitt, an attorney <pb id="VAC1000-309" n="293"/> of
							Danville, but now with the Prest-O-Lite Company, of Indianapolis. Frederick is a
							graduate of the University of Michigan.</p>

						<p>Mr. Ensminger is allied with the Republican party and has served his party on more
							than one occasion in conventions. He has been the assessor of Center township and for
							five years and three months was trustee of the same township. He has also been ditch
							commissioner for Hendricks county. In all of his official work he proved to be an
							efficient and faithful administrator of the duties which he was called upon to
							perform. The Ensminger family are all members of the Presbyterian church of Danville
							and take an active interest in the various organizations of that denomination.
							Fraternally, Mr. Ensminger is a member of the Knights of Pythias of his home town. He
							is a jovial gentleman whom it is a pleasure to meet, and one who makes friends with
							all classes of people. In his capacity as a public official he was one of the most
							popular men who ever held office in Hendricks county. He is very widely known
							throughout the county., and has a large circle of warm friends, who esteem him for his
							record as a teacher and as a public official. It is probable there is no one, not even
							the minister, who comes as close in touch with the life of the community as does the
							school teacher, and in the nineteen years in which he taught in his home township he
							was brought closely in touch with life in all its phases. He has always been a
							practical and methodical man, as all members of the teaching profession usually are,
							has never known such a thing as idleness, and it can truly be said that he has been
							one of the most potent factors for good in the community in which he has spent so many
							of his years.</p>

						<p>The race of life, is like a horse race; if one is properly started with suitable
							grooming, such as a good education and proper home training, he will lead in the race
							in after years and enjoy every moment of existence. Such home influences were thrown
							around Thomas C. Rose in his early years. Both father and mother were people of
							intelligence, religious instincts and high ideals, and their son has endeavored to
							uphold the honor of the family during his entire career, and Marion township has no
							more highly respected citizen or industrious farmer. As a gallant veteran of the Civil
							War he well merits an honored place in the history of this county.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-310" n="294"/>

						<p>Thomas C. Rose, a retired veteran of the Civil War, now living in North Salem, was
							born in Marion township, this county, in 1840, and has spent nearly seventy-five years
							within the limits of this county. He is the son of Lewis A. and Flora (Vannice) Rose.
							Lewis A. Rose was born in Mercer county, Kentucky, in 180l, the son of Charles and,
							Mary (Reese) Rose. Charles Rose was born October 6, 1778, and his wife, Mary Reese,
							was born February 4, 1779. Lewis A. Rose married Flora Vannice August 11, 1825, and to
							this union were born ten children. About the year 1827 Lewis A. Rose and family came
							to Indiana and settled in Marion township, this county, where they spent the remainder
							of their lives. Lewis and his wife were members of the Presbyterian church, and at his
							death he owned two hundred and forty acres of land in Marion township. Mr. and Mrs.
							Lewis A. Rose were the parents of nine children. Two of the boys, Lewis and James,
							died in the Civil War, and another, Charles, died in his boyhood days. Thomas C.,
							whose history is herein portrayed, is the only one of the six sons who is living.</p>

						<p>Thomas C. Rose stayed on the home farm until the opening of the Civil War and in 1861
							enlisted in Company A, Fifty-first Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and
							participated in various battles in Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. He was mustered
							out in 1863, because of ill health, being almost totally disabled at the time of his
							discharge. After regaining his health, he married Mary C. Clay in 1866. She was born
							in Putnam county, Indiana, and was the daughter of James Henry and Susan (Fleece)
							Clay.</p>

						<p>After his marriage, Mr. Rose farmed for one year on his father's place and then came
							to Eel River township where he began operations on his own farm of one hundred and
							seventy acres, and continued to reside there until about 1900oo, when he moved into
							North Salem and retired from active work. He now rents his farm, but gives it his
							careful oversight.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Rose have one son, Webster C., who was born in 1877. He is married and
							is engaged in the poultry business in the state of Oregon. Mr. Rose has always been a
							very careful business man and has accumulated his competence through his own
							individual efforts. He has carried forward to careful completion whatever he undertook
							and his business methods have always been in strict concomitance with the standard
							ethics of business life. His career presents a notable example of those qualities of

							eminently worthy of imitation by the coming generation.</p>

							physicians of this country hold its life in their hands, and the conscientious

							sympathy. It is now an acknowledged fact that there is a therapeutic value in the hand
							clasp and in the smile of the physician and the most successful physician is he who
							successfully combines a magnetic smile with his healing drugs.</p>

						<p>Frederick Newton Wright was born on June 22, 1878, in Indianapolis, Indiana, and is a
							son of Levi and Louisa (Martin) Wright. Levi Wright was a native of Salem, Washington
							county, Indiana, where he was born in 1834. His boyhood days were spent in that county
							at Salem, and on reaching manhood he entered the ministry of the Methodist Episcopal
							church and followed this noble profession until his death on July 4, 1891. For many
							years he preached at Ben Davis, and helped to build the church in that place. His wife
							was also a native of Washington county, Indiana, and is now living in Hazelwood,
							Hendricks county, Indiana, having remarried after her husband's death. Mr. and Mrs.
							Levi Wright were the parents of five children: Dr. Francis Marion Wright, of

							Arthur L., of Indianapolis. and Dr. Frederick N., of Hazelwood.</p>

						<p>Frederick N. Wright spent his boyhood days in the city of Indianapolis and finished

							He then entered the medical department of Indiana University, graduating in the spring
							of 1905, and immediately located at Hazelwood, Hendricks county, Indiana, for
							practice, and in the nine years which he has spent here in the active practice of his
							profession, he has built up a large and lucrative patronage. Doctor Wright has the
							necessary optimistic disposition which should be a part of every successful
							physician's equipment and this, coupled with his undoubted technical training, makes
							him one of the best physicians of the county.</p>

						<p>Politically, Doctor Wright is a Progressive, but on account of his large practice he

						<head><hi rend="center">JUDGE THOMAS J. COFER.</hi></head>

						<p>The life history of him whose name heads this sketch has been for many years closely
							identified with the history of Hendricks county, Indiana. Throughout the years his
							life has been one of untiring activity and it has been crowned with a degree of
							professional success attained by comparatively few who aspire to eminence in their
							chosen calling. Years of conscientious work as a lawyer have brought with them not
							only increase of practice and reputation, but also that growth in legal knowledge and
							that wide and accurate judgment the possession of which constitutes marked excellence
							in the profession. By a straightforward, honorable course Mr. Cofer built up a large
							and lucrative legal business and, financially, has been proportionately successful.
							His life affords a splendid example of what an American youth, plentifully endowed
							with good common sense, energy and determination, can accomplish when accompanied by
							good moral principles. He achieved a splendid record at the bar at an age when most
							men are merely starting out on their life work, for, from the beginning, he was
							intensely methodical and unswervingly persistent in search of the true light and of
							the essentials of the legal foundation and sources of legal conception and thought,
							holding devoutly to the highly embellished record of equity and the sure, certain,
							invincible methods of practice. Therefore, success could not help crowning his efforts
							and attracting to him public recognition and appreciation.</p>

						<p>Judge Thomas J. Cofer, lawyer, old soldier, public-spirited citizen and a friend of
							every one in Hendricks county, was born September 2, 1836, three and one-half miles
							north of Danville, this county. His parents, Stephen and Milanda (Ashbrook) Cofer,
							were both natives of Kentucky, his father coming to this county about 1831, and lived
							here the remainder of his life. Stephen Cofer was a plain and unostentatious farmer,
							who died at the age <pb id="VAC1000-313" n="[]"/>
							<figure>
								<p rend="center i">Thomas J. Cofer</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-314" n="297"/> of sixty, his widow surviving him many years, her death
							occurring at the advanced age of ninety-four years. Stephen Cofer and wife were the
							parents of eight children, only three of whom are now living: Mrs. Nellie Woods, of
							Oregon, Mrs. Nancy Riddle, of Kansas, and Judge T. J. Cofer.</p>

						<p>Judge Thomas J. Cofer was born, reared and practically educated on the farm. The
							district schools of his day were very rudimentary, but his thirst for knowledge was
							such that he insisted on continuing his education. He therefore entered the Danville
							Academy and continued his education at Asbury University, and would have graduated
							from that institution had not the Civil War interrupted his career. With the first
							call for troops in the. spring of 1861, Judge Cofer enlisted in the Sixteenth Regiment
							Indiana Volunteer Infantry for one year, and immediately upon the expiration of his
							term of enlistment he joined the Seventh Regiment of Indiana Volunteers. He was in the
							battle of Port Republic, where he was wounded in the shoulder, captured and thrown
							into prison, where he remained until he was paroled six months later. He then came
							home to recuperate, but as soon as he was able to go to the front again he enlisted in
							1863 in the Ninth Regiment Indiana Cavalry, with which command he served until he was
							mustered out in September, 1865. He participated in the battles of Pulaski, Franklin,
							Nashville, Spring Hill, Rennell's Hill, Sugar Creek and many others. Immediately after
							the close of the war Mr. Cofer returned to Hendricks county, and was engaged for a
							short time in the mercantile business, studying law in the meantime. In 1872 he was
							admitted to the bar and has practiced in, the courts of this county continuously since
							that time. He first entered into partnership with Judge J. G. Adams and later with
							Judge Newton M. Taylor. Some time afterwards he entered into partnership with Judge C.
							C. Hadley, which partnership was terminated in a few years and, until he was appointed
							judge of the circuit court in 1889, he practiced alone. Governor Mount appointed Judge
							Cofer as judge of the circuit court in 1889 to succeed Judge John V. Hadley, who was
							elected to the supreme court at that time. He served two years as an appointee, and

						<head><hi rend="center">WILLIAM ROBERT DAVIDSON.</hi></head>

						<p>This is an age in which the farmer stands pre-eminently above any other class as a
							producer of wealth. He simply takes advantage of the winds, the warm air, the bright
							sunshine and the refreshing rains and, applying his own hands and skill to nature's
							gifts, he creates grain, hay, live stock, etc., all of which are absolute necessaries
							to the inhabitants of the world. Nature does much for the husbandman, so much, indeed,
							that it is often a question whether he fully appreciates what is thus done for him. Of
							course he must make proper use of his brain and his muscle, must not quail at
							obstacles and sit down and repine if things go wrong; on the contrary, he must ever be
							up and doing, with a heart for any fate. Such a man is William Robert Davidson, of Eel
							River township, one of the leading farmers in this locality and a man who has refused
							to permit obstacles to down him.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-317" n="300"/>

						<p>William Robert Davidson, the son of Daniel N. and Elizabeth (Davidson) Davidson, was
							born in North Salem, Hendricks county, Indiana, May 14, 1860. His father, Daniel N.,
							was a son of Silas and Elizabeth (Stamper) Davidson, and was born September 6, 1832,
							in Breathitt county, Kentucky. Shortly after his birth, his parents moved to this
							state and settled about two and one-half miles northwest of North Salem, but a year
							later moved across in Montgomery county and entered land in the southeastern part of
							Clark township. Silas Davidson and wife lived there until 1855. then moved to Iowa and
							spent the remainder of their lives there. Daniel N. Davidson grew to manhood in this
							county and married Elizabeth Davidson, a native of this county and the daughter of
							Samuel and Susan (Dent) Davidson. Her parents were natives of Kentucky who had come
							here early in the history of the county. After Daniel N. Davidson was married, he and
							his wife went to Iowa with his parents, but three years later returned and located in
							North Salem, where he spent the most of his career in farming, although he has of late
							years been engaged in the mercantile business in North Salem. Early in life he started
							to study medicine, but eventually gave this up and devoted his attention to farming.
							He died in May, 1893, and his wife on December 31, 1891. Mr. and Mrs. Daniel N.
							Davidson were the parents of seven children: Oliver F., who died at the age of nine;
							Ida, who was the wife of William H. Vannice and died September 7, 1892; Melissa, who
							was the wife of A. G. Hypes and died in May, 1903; Lillie V., of North Salem; Mary N.,
							the wife of James Oscar Emmons, of North Salem; William Robert, whose career is herein
							presented, and one child who died in infancy.</p>

						<p>William Robert Davidson remained on the home farm until his marriage, after which he
							farmed his father's place for eight years and then, after three years' residence in
							North Salem, he bought ninety-two and a half acres east of his present farm, where he
							lived for thirteen years. He then sold this farm and moved four miles northeast of
							North Salem, after which he lived three years in North Salem, then bought his present
							farm of sixty-seven and a half acres, two miles northeast of North Salem. He has
							improved his farm in many ways and has brought it up to a high state of
							cultivation.</p>

						<p>Mr. Davidson was married on January 13, 1884, to Rosella Crose, the daughter of James
							Ross and Ann Eliza (Riggin) Crose. James R. Crose was born in Marion township, this
							county, in 1834, the son of <pb id="VAC1000-318" n="301"/> Andrew Jackson and Nancy
							(Rogers) Crose. Both his parents were born, reared and married in Nicholas county,
							Kentucky, and came to this county in 1831 and entered land. When James R. was about
							thirteen years old, his parents moved to Boone county, where Andrew J. Crose died
							about six months later, leaving his widow and seven children.</p>

						<p>James Ross Crose remained in Boone county until his marriage, in 1852, to Lurancy
							Riley, the daughter of Allen and Levina Riley, of Boone county. His wife died in 1860,
							leaving one son, James Madison; two other children had died in infancy. James Madison
							Crose married Alice Ellington and was killed by a falling tree in Eel River township
							at the age of forty-two. Mr. Crose was married a second time on March 12, 1862, to Ann
							Eliza Riggin, who was born in 1842 in Montgomery county, Kentucky, daughter of Wesley
							and Ann (Wren) Riggin. She came with her parents from Kentucky to this county when she
							was nine years of age. They came in wagons, and consumed eight days in making the
							overland trip to this county. Mr. and Mrs. Riggin located about two miles north of
							North Salem and later moved three miles southwest of Lizton, where they made their
							home and spent the remainder of their lives. There were three children by the second
							marriage: Rosella, the wife of William Davidson: Lillie Dale, the wife of Dr. William
							Wiseheart, of Colfax, Indiana, and Mary Etta, the wife of Douglas S. Grimes, a
							merchant of North Salem. Dr. and Mrs. Wiseheart have one daughter, Nina; Mr. and Mrs.
							Grimes have two children, Edna and Herman C.; Mr. and Mrs. Davidson, of North Salem,
							have four daughters, Blanche Naomi, Murle Agnes, Nellie May and Hilda Marie. Blanche
							is the wife of James H. Fiscus, of North Salem; Murle Agnes is a teacher in the city
							schools of Muncie, having previously taught at North Salem and Connersville; the other
							two daughters are still at home. All four daughters graduated from the North Salem
							high school and three attended the Central Normal College at Danville. Murle has been
							a student at the State University at Bloomington.</p>

						<p>Mr. Davidson is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He has never sought
							or desired office of any kind, though by nature and experience he is well qualified to
							fill important trusts. He has chosen the quiet way rather than the turmoil and unrest,
							and in the quietude of home has found the content which would have been denied him in
							public places. A successful farmer, a kind and obliging neighbor and a worthy citizen,
							he has lived to honorable ends.</p>

						<p>The gentleman whose name heads this article is so well and favorably known throughout
							Hendricks county that an elaborate introduction to our readers would be superfluous;
							but some of the facts of his life's history cannot fail to be of interest to many.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hollingsworth was born January 1, 1852, in Washington township, Hendricks county,
							the son of Samuel V. and Lydia (Mullin) Hollingsworth. His father, Samuel V., was one
							of the early settlers of the county, having been brought from Ohio by his own. parents
							when a child, and living thereafter for many years in the vicinity of Plainfield. He
							received his schooling in the little country school, and lived the free, untrammeled
							life of the farm; but, though revelling in the pure air and sunshine of his
							surroundings, he was ambitious and sought eagerly for new avenues of employment. Never
							failing to grasp the opportunities for improvement which came to him, he learned the
							various trades of the silversmith, gunsmith and blacksmith, and became especially
							skilled as a wood worker, for which there was much demand in the early days, before
							the advent of the modern, machine-equipped furniture factory. His versatility found
							him ample employment aside from that of farming, and, though he spent his life in the
							country, it was in the various trades that he excelled. His wife, the mother of
							William Hollingsworth, was a native of North Carolina, coming first to Jackson county,
							and then to Hendricks county at the age of ten years with her parents, who settled
							near Plainfield. To this union were born four children, William A., Delia Catherine
							(Smith), Sarah Adaline and Charles Dayton.</p>

						<p>In the year of 1883 death called the wife and mother, and in 1906 the father was
							carried to his final resting place.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hollingsworth was not active in church, fraternal, or political affairs, though a
							consistent Republican voter; but was an excellent neighbor and interested in all
							movements for the public welfare at home and abroad.</p>

						<p>The boyhood and youth of William A. Hollingsworth were spent upon his father's farm,
							and his education was afforded by the district school. Rural life with its labors and
							its pleasures became "second nature" to him, and the pursuit of agriculture in its
							various phases became, early in life, his chosen calling. He was married on November
							13, 1873, to Ellen Hadley, who was born near Avon, the daughter of Enos and Susan
							(Smith) Hadley, and to them have been born five children, as follows: Florence Effie,
							Bertha <pb id="VAC1000-320" n="303"/> Beatrice, Susan Belle, Samuel Vestal and Wilda
							Azalee. The eldest daughter, Florence Effie, was twice married, first to William
							Logston, one daughter being born of that marriage, Edna Logston; the second husband is
							Lewis Darnell, a prosperous farmer of Middle township. The second child of Mr. and
							Mrs. Hollingsworth is now Mrs. Earl C. Weaver, who lives in Texas and is the mother of
							two children, Gladys and Earl Cassius, Jr. Mr. Weaver was formerly a printer at
							Pittsboro and at Jamestown. Susan Belle, now Mrs. Carl Clark, resides on a farm
							southwest of Maplewood, in this county, and is the mother of one son, John William.
							The two younger children still enjoy the protection of the parental roof, being on the
							old homestead, which has been the abiding place of the family since March, 1874,
							though a new and modern residence was erected in 1912. Here Mr. Hollingsworth brought
							his bride the year following their marriage, and around the old house clustered all
							the memories of many happy years. The fifty-acre tract of land which surrounds the
							home is in a high state of cultivation and shows the care of an intelligent, careful,
							industrious man.</p>

						<p>In the past Mr. Hollingsworth has dealt largely in live stock, having raised many
							choice animals for the market, and so discriminating in his judgment in this branch of
							his work that he found it profitable for eight years to give his time entirely to the
							purchase of live stock for John V. Hadley, depending upon hired help to carry forward
							the general work on his farm.</p>

						<p>In the year 1904 Mr. Hollingsworth was elected trustee of Middle township and four
							years he served in this capacity, devoting his time and energy zealously to the
							service of the people.</p>

						<p>Mrs. Hollingsworth is also a member of one of the most prominent families of
							Hendricks county, being the daughter of Enos Hadley, a native of this county and one
							of the pioneer settlers. He was born in 1825 and spent his days in his home locality.
							One of the very successful farmers in the vicinity, he yet found time and energy for
							the exercise of his talents in a still broader capacity, serving for many years as
							commissioner of Hendricks county, and also acting as ditch commissioner. He was
							actively engaged in this work until the day of his death, which occurred November 11,
							1893, at the home of his son, Cassius Hadley, in Danville. His wife was a native of
							Henry county, Kentucky, born there January 28, 1834. Nine children were born to them:
							Ellen E. (Hollingsworth), James A., Horace E., Cassius C., deceased, Clara B.
							(Vickery), Robert S., Wilber E. and <pb id="VAC1000-321" n="304"/> Lester B.,
							deceased. The children have inherited the ability of the parents, and many have won
							for themselves enviable places in the community.</p>

						<p>Reverting to the subject of this article, William H. Hollingsworth, we find him a man
							of few words, but with a kindly manner which inspires confidence not only in the home
							circle, but throughout the county, where he is known by a host of friends. He is a
							member of the Masonic order at Danville; an adherent of the Republican party, and both
							he and Mrs. Hollingsworth are prominent members of the Methodist church, at Bartlett's
							Chapel. </p>

						<p>The living exemplification of virtuous lives, well spent for their family and the
							community at large, they are enjoying the fruits of their labor among a host of

						<p>Among the men of a past generation who left the impress of their individuality upon
							Hendricks county, Indiana, there is no one who can gainsay the fact that John W.
							Tinder was one of nature's noblemen. To know him intimately was to be impressed with
							his earnestness of purpose, his purity of life and the nobility of his character. To
							be associated with him in daily work was to be impressed with the truth that here was
							a man honest, liberty loving and God fearing. He was retiring in his nature, yet he
							had that tenacity of purpose and that industry that pushed to successful completion
							whatever he undertook. He was ever an industrious man and his wonderful executive
							ability brought him much to do. He was justly proud of his military record, yet he
							rarely referred to it, and when he did it was with that modesty which revealed the
							unassuming man. He was an intense partisan and always took an active interest in his
							party's welfare, and it is doubtful if any man in Hendricks county knew more men in
							the county than did he at the time of his death. To a wonderful degree he held the
							confidence of the people and their confidence was never betrayed in the slightest
							degree. He was successful in the business world and his life throughout is a worthy
							example which the coming youth of this county would do well to emulate. In him was
							peace and his memory will be long cherished by those who knew him.</p>

						<p>The late John WV. Tinder, of Hendricks county, Indiana, was born January 22, 1835, in
							the county where he spent his whole life, and died in Danville July 8, 1903. He
							received such education as the common schools of his <pb id="VAC1000-322" n="[]"/>

							farm where he was born. He remained at home until he was twenty-two years of age and
							then, on February 5, 1857, married Laura Hamrick, daughter of William F. and Jane
							Hamrick. The Hamrick family is one of the best known and oldest families of Putnam
							county, Indiana, and many of its descendants have occupied responsible positions in
							the affairs of the county.</p>

						<p>Immediately after his marriage Mr. and Mrs. Tinder bought a farm in Marion township,
							where they lived most happily until July 2, 1862, and on that date Mr. Tinder enlisted
							in Company A, Fourth Indiana Cavalry, and commenced his service of three years in that
							memorable struggle which goes down in history as the greatest civil war the world has
							ever known. Upon the organization of the troops he was promoted to sergeant and was
							mustered out as lieutenant. He was in continuous service from the date of his
							enlistment until he was honorably discharged at Nashville, Tennessee, in September,
							1865. He participated in the battles of Chickamauga, Dalton, Resaca, in all the
							battles of the Atlanta campaign, Kenesaw Mountain, Peach Tree Creek, Jonesboro and
							Wilson's raid. He saw severe fighting in Kentucky at Lebanon and Perryville, and while
							on the Bardstown pike was wounded in the left leg below the knee. He received a
							furlough for two months on account of this disability, spending the time at home,
							rejoining his command at Gallatin, Tennessee. On the Atlanta campaign his regiment was
							under fire for almost four months, and after the surrender of Atlanta he returned to
							Nashville and was in the memorable battle of Franklin. He was always an active soldier
							and, possessing a hardy constitution, endured all the vicissitudes and hardships of
							army life with fortitude, but was never in a hospital nor captured during his period
							of service.</p>

						<p>Shortly after the close of the war Mr. and Mrs. Tinder moved to Danville, where they
							resided until the time of his death, and his widow is still a resident of that place.
							Two children were born to them, both of whom died in infancy. They reared three
							children and gave them all the advantages of a tender mother's and father's care,
							namely: John O'Donnell, whom they took at the age of eight years, and who made his
							home with them until he died at the age of twenty-five; Linnie Wallen, who went to
							live with them at the age of ten, and who died in 1894, and Thomas Bence, who came
							into their lives when he was a child of fourteen, and who is now in the newspaper
							business in Danville.</p>

						<p>Mr. Tinder had a love for politics and his interest in public affairs was <pb
								id="VAC1000-324" n="306"/> one of the pronounced characteristics of his nature. He
							served during several campaigns as chairman of the county organization of the
							Republican party, and was elected commissioner of Hendricks county for four terms, and
							no county ever had a better or more faithful officer. He also served on the town board
							and at the time of his death was a trustee-elect from his ward. He was a member of
							Silcox Lodge, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and had been treasurer of this lodge
							for years. Among the monuments to his memory in his public official career is the
							Danville water plant, which was put in under his immediate supervision.</p>

						<p>Such, in brief, is the life history of a man who truly lived for the service he could
							render to his home, to his country and to his God. His life was a blessing to the
							community in which he lived and, as has been said, the lives of such men do not go
							out, they go on.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">ALFRED R. GLOVER.</hi></head>

						<p>This honored veteran of the Civil War is to be designated as one of the progressive
							and influential citizens of Hendricks county, where for many years he has maintained
							his home, figuring as one of the builders of the community and especially worthy of
							consideration in this work. He has, by his industry and sound judgment, not only
							improved a fine farm and gained a large competency for his old age, but he has
							materially assisted in the general welfare of the community, in many ways lending his
							valuable time and influence in the promulgation of various uplifting movements.</p>

						<p>Alfred R. Glover, one of the leading farmers of Hendricks county, Indiana, and
							justice of the peace at Clayton, was born on December 19, 1841, near Belleville, this
							county, the son of James and Mary P. (Reagan) Glover, the former of whom was born in
							the northern edge of Tennessee on the Barron river in 1813. His parents both died when
							he was a small child and when a boy in his teens he came to Indiana, having relatives
							in Lawrence county, near Bedford, and also near Belleville, this county. He worked as
							a farm hand and saved his money, so that shortly after his marriage he was able to
							purchase, eighty acres of land, something over two miles southwest of Clayton, and
							there the family took up their residence after the birth of the immediate subject of
							this sketch. It was on that farm James Glover passed the remainder of his life, his
							death occurring about 1888. Mary P. Reagan, mother of the subject, was a native of
							Virginia, born about 1815, <pb id="VAC1000-325" n="307"/> and was early left an
							orphan. At the age of four years she was brought westward into Indiana and was reared
							in the family of Major Red. They took up their residence near Belleville at an early
							day and in this locality she passed the remainder of her life. She remained on the
							home farm after the death of her husband until about two years prior to her death,
							when the subject built for her a home in Clayton and had nurses to care for her the
							remainder of her life. She passed away in 1892, surrounded by every care and comfort
							the subject was able to procure for her.</p>

						<p>Alfred R. Glover grew to maturity on his father's farm south of Clayton, assisting
							with the work of the home place until the beginning of the Civil War. In August, 1862,
							he enlisted in Company C, Seventieth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, under Gen.
							Benjamin Harrison, that regiment being part of the Twentieth Army Corps. As a private
							in the Army of the Cumberland he was with Sherman through the Atlanta campaign and was
							engaged in almost continual fighting after leaving Tennessee until the fall of
							Atlanta. At Resaca he was wounded, but made a quick recovery. It was at this battle he
							was in the hottest fight of his service. His regiment led the charge against the enemy
							and got into the fort through a rain of lead, fighting the enemy hand to hand. They
							captured four pieces of artillery, the only artillery captured on that campaign. In
							that fierce conflict of fifteen minutes, which well might have dismayed the bravest,
							they lost one hundred and sixty-nine men killed and wounded. After the close of the
							Atlanta campaign, Mr. Glover came down with typhoid fever. Up to that time he had
							never been off duty and now to his dismay he was ordered sent back to the hospital at
							Chattanooga. There he remained for some time, having the disease in so severe a form
							that at times his case seemed hopeless. However, he finally recovered sufficiently to
							be returned home, but so anxious was he to be again at the front that after a
							thirty-day furlough he rejoined his regiment at Alexandria, Virginia, going by rail to
							New York City and from thence by ship down the coast. This was in April, 1865, and
							when his regiment arrived at the place above mentioned he was so overjoyed that he
							rushed eagerly past the guards to greet his comrades in arms. He was still
							incapacitated on account of his illness and was not able to participate in the grand
							review of troops which passed before President Johnson (Lincoln having been
							assassinated a short time before) in Washington during May, 1865, but was able to
							witness that impressive sight and in June of the same year was mustered out of service
							and sent home. He returned to his father's farm and took up the reins of duty where he
							had lain them down at the call of his country.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-326" n="308"/>

						<p>On October 4, 1866, a little more than a year after his return from the army, Mr.
							Glover was united in marriage to Isabinda Estes, who was born on Mill Creek near
							Pecksburg, a daughter of Edward B. and Mary (Smith) Estes, both natives of Randolph
							county, North Carolina, and among the early pioneers of this section. Edward B. Estes,
							when a boy of eight years, was brought to Washington county, this state, by his
							parents and later came to Morgan county, where he was married. Later on he brought his
							family to near Pecksburg, where he bought one hundred and sixty acres of land which
							another man had entered from the government, and there passed the remainder of his
							life. After his marriage, the subject purchased a farm of forty and three-quarters
							acres of land in section 29, in Liberty township, this county, near Hazelwood; the
							three-quarters of an acre was intended as a building site, the balance of the land
							being very wet. He carried out his plans, building a home and living there for many
							years until he moved to Clayton. Some time after his original purchase, he bought the
							eighty acres adjoining and in all has put in twenty-six hundred rods of ditching and
							drain tile. In this way he has disposed of the surplus moisture and has made an
							excellent farm of it which produces banner crops. In September, 1892, he moved into
							Clayton, where he bought a home, which he later sold for twenty-four hundred and
							seventy-five dollars, and in 1906 purchased the residence where he now resides. This
							is located in the northern part of Clayton, being one of the finest homes in the town,
							strictly modern, with private lighting plant and in the basement a fine flowing well
							that never runs less than an inch stream of water. Mr. Glover manages his farm and
							also is engaged in the coal business. In addition to his business, he has served as
							notary public for four years and for the past seventeen years has been justice of the
							peace. He was first appointed to fill out another's unexpired term and since that time
							has been four times elected, each time for a term of four years. He is considered
							remarkably wise and fair in his decisions, his long experience enabling him to see a
							case from all sides and also to judge correctly of the veracity of his witnesses. He
							is said never to have had a case reversed on appeal and in all the years he has had
							only four cases where a jury was called for and many cases have been venued to him
							from other townships. He has made for himself an enviable reputation in this line of
							work and by his wisdom and justice has promoted kindlier feelings among those who have
							been brought before him.</p>

						<p>Mr. Glover has been twice married, his first wife having passed away on May 16, 1890.
							To their union had been born two children, the eldest <pb id="VAC1000-327" n="309"/>
							being a son who died at birth in September, 1867. On July 24, 1875, their daughter
							Samantha was born. She is now Mrs. Oliver Edward Frazier and lives near Ellettsville,

						<p>On November 28, 1901, Mr. Glover was again married, his bride being Mary Frances
							Jones, who was born three miles south of Clayton, the daughter of John and Rose
							(Williams) Jones. John Jones was born in Owen county, this state, and when a small
							child of three years was brought to this county by his parents. John Jones, senior,
							entered land from the government south of Clayton and also purchased other land,
							making in all a farm of one hundred and twenty acres, where he lived the remainder of
							his life. He was an excellent man and for many years prior to his death was a minister
							in the Baptist church. He was a man of strong influence for good in the early days of
							this locality and reared his family strictly in accordance with the tenets of his
							chosen church society. His son John, father of Mrs. Glover, was also active in Baptist
							church circles, saving served his society as deacon for forty years prior to his
							death. The vocation of farming was his life's work and his efforts in this direction
							were entirely confined within Liberty township, this county. Rose Williams, mother of
							Mrs. Glover, was a native of North Carolina and at the tender age of two years was
							brought by her parents, Enoch Williams and wife, to Hendricks county,.locating just
							east of the Jones farm, where Mr. Williams purchased land and passed the remainder of
							his life. Rose (Williams) Jones departed this life November 17, 1899, her husband,
							John Jones, junior, following her into the great beyond on May 15, 1907. It was the
							desire of Mr. and Mrs. Jones that their children should all be well educated, and
							after attending the schools near home where she received her elementary education,
							Mrs. Glover attended the Central Normal College at Danville, Indiana, and later
							studied at Franklin College, Franklin, this state. After teaching school for one year,
							she took further training at the State Normal School at Terre Haute. Then for one year
							she taught school in Johnson county, this state, two years in this county and three
							years in Page county, Iowa. She then returned to Clayton, where she has since resided.
							A sister, Mrs. Minnie Swindler, and a brother, J. Ulysses, are both also graduates of
							Franklin College. For ten years J. Ulysses Jones was connected with the United States
							revenue service, but is at present engaged in farming on the old homestead. Two others
							of the family, Wayland and Mrs. Alice Gully, attended Franklin College. Jewett,
							another brother, died in 1912.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-328" n="310"/>

						<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Glover are members of the Baptist church at Clayton, the former
							having served as deacon for considerably over forty years, being ordained to that
							service on the same day as Mrs. Glover's father. This was in the Friendship Baptist
							church and Mr. Glover has continued without interruption ever since. Mrs. Glover also
							is active in church work, being the financial secretary of the Woman's Foreign
							Missionary Society of the White Lick association. Mr. Glover is secretary of the
							Crawford Industrial Home, located at Zionsville, this state, being a home for
							friendless children supported by the White Lick association of Baptist churches. In
							politics, Mr. Glover is a Progressive, having readily endorsed the principles of the
							new party as laid down by the leaders of same at its birth in Chicago. Prior to that
							time he had been a stanch Republican. Mr. Glover is a man whose influence has ever
							been extended for the advancement of the best interests of his community, and is held
							in the very highest esteem by the friends and neighbors who have known him for years.
							This is the highest tribute a man can win. To live in the same community year in and

							in the regard and esteem of those with whom he comes in contact is the great privilege
							only of those whose lives are ordered by the highest principles and who give

						<p>Among the men of sterling worth and character who have made an impress upon the life
							of the locality in which they live there is no one who has received a larger meed of
							popular respect and regard than John E. Leach, whose family name is well known
							throughout this county. A life-long residence in one county has given the people an
							opportunity to know him in every phase of his character and that he has been true to
							life in its every phase is manifested in the degree of confidence and regard in which
							he is held by all those who know him.</p>

						<p>John E. Leach, one of the most prosperous farmers of Union town ship, was born July
							30, 1861, in the township where he has lived all his life. <pb id="VAC1000-329"
								n="311"/> His parents were James M. and Elizabeth (Hamilton) Leach, both of whom
							were born in Hendricks county. James M. Leach was born February 9, 1834, and was the
							son of Enos and Elizabeth Leach, who were natives of Kentucky. They settled in Union
							township, Hendricks county, in the fall of 1831, where Enos Leach entered two hundred
							acres. They were the parents of seven children, of whom James M. was the fifth. James
							M. grew to manhood in Hendricks county and was married on March 17, 1859, to Elizabeth
							Hamilton, the daughter of Abraham Hamilton, of Hendricks county. James M. Leach became
							one of the leading farmers of the county and had two hundred and seventy-one acres of
							fine farming land and one of the finest residences in the county. He and his wife were
							members of the Christian church, of which he was an elder for several years.</p>

						<p>John E. Leach was given a good common school education and remained at home until he
							was twenty-five. He then began farming on land which his grandfather had entered and
							to this he has added seventy-eight acres, which now gives him a fine farm of three
							hundred and eighteen acres in this township. He has a beautiful home, excellent barn
							and outbuildings and keeps all these details about his place in a manner which speaks
							well for the taste of the owner. He has raised all of the crops which are peculiar to
							this latitude and in addition has supplemented his annual income by breeding a large
							amount of stock each year.</p>

						<p>Mr. Leach was married September 1, 1886, to Malissa Money, the daughter of John T.
							and Malinda Money. John T. Money was a native of Kentucky and came to this county with
							his parents when he was a small boy. His wife was a native of Boone county, Indiana,
							and died on the Money homestead farm in this county in 1903. Mr. Money died December
							11, 1906, on his son's farm south of Danville, as a result of a severe fall. Mr. and
							Mrs. Money were the parents of seven children: William; John, deceased; Pressley;
							Oliver; Malissa, the wife of Mr. Leach, and two who died in infancy. Mr. and Mrs.
							Leach have reared a family of five children: Granville, Paul, Fannie E., deceased,
							Ralph and Emma. Paul married Mamie Kendle and lives on a farm across from the old
							homestead place; he has three children, Pauline, John Edward and Barbara Ellen.</p>

						<p>Mr. Leach is a member of the Knights of Pythias at Lizton. Politically, he has always
							identified himself with the Republican party and takes an interest in the various
							political questions of the day, although he has never been a seeker for any office. He
							and his wife are members of the Christian church and take a deep and abiding interest
							in all church work, <pb id="VAC1000-330" n="312"/> Mr. Leach being a elder in the
							church at the present time. Personally, he is one of the best known farmers in the
							township and is well liked by everyone because of his square dealings and upright
							manner in all things. He can now look back over his life without regret for any
							misspent days, for it has been such as to bring only good to himself and to
							others.</p>

						<p>It is not possible in the brief history which is here presented of Jacob J. Page to
							enter into the interesting details of his career in an exhaustive manner. He has
							filled a large and important place in the ranks of successcessful citizens in Eel
							River township and has done his part well. His record as a farmer and as a
							public-spirited citizen has been such as to gain for him the compensation and approval
							of his fellow citizens. His career has been a long, busy and useful one and he has
							contributed much to the material, civic and moral advancement of the community.</p>

						<p>Jacob J. Page, the son of Jeremiah J. Page and wife, was born March 15, 1863, two and
							one-half miles west of North Salem, in Putnam county, Indiana. A complete history of
							the Page family is given in the biography of Jeremiah J. Page, which is found
							elsewhere in this work.</p>

						<p>Jacob J. Page received a good common school education and remained under the parental
							roof until his marriage, when his father gave him twenty acres and, with this as a
							beginner, he has become one of the most prosperous and substantial farmers of the
							county. He has been a farmer and stock raiser all of his life, making a specialty of
							cattle and hogs. He has also bought and sold land at different times, and by the use
							of good judgment has usually been able to realize on each transaction. As he was able,
							he added to his possessions until he now owns nine hundred and sixty-six acres of
							land, all of which is improved. On his different farms he has good houses, barns and
							outbuildings and he takes a great deal of pride in keeping everything in an attractive
							manner, believing that an attractive appearance enhances the value of his
							property.</p>

						<p>Mr. Page was married in 1891 to Ida Thompson, the daughter of Nelson C. and Margaret
							(McCreary) Thompson. Nelson Thompson was born April 30, 1843, in Boyle county,
							Kentucky, the son of John R. and Martha Thompson. In the summer of 1843 John R.
							Thompson and his family came to this county and bought a farm in Eel River township.

						<head><hi rend="center">BENJAMIN GRAYSON EDMONDSON.</hi></head>

						<p>The occupation of farming, to which the major part of the business life of Benjamin
							G. Edmondson, one of the well known and popular citizens of Hendricks county, has been
							devoted, is the oldest pursuit for a livelihood of mankind and the one in which he
							will ever be the most independent. The subject's name has been inseparably connected
							with the general growth of Hendricks county, of which he has long been a resident.
							While primarily attending to his own varied interests, his life has been largely
							devoted to his fellow men, having been untiring in his efforts to inspire a proper
							respect for law and order and ready at all times to uplift humanity along civic and
							social lines.</p>

						<p>Benjamin G. Edmondson, retired farmer of Hendricks county, who is now living in
							comfortable retirement in Clayton, was born in Morgan county, this state, on September
							11, 1831, the son of Francis and Jane (Grayson) Edmondson. Francis Edmondson was born
							in Knox county, Tennessee, in 1802, where he grew to manhood and was there united in
							marriage with Jane Grayson. About the year 1828 they came into Indiana and settled in
							Morgan county, where they entered government land and remained there <pb
								id="VAC1000-333" n="314"/> until the subject was about two years old, when they came
							to Hendricks county and entered government land south of the Walker farm, located
							south of the national road in Liberty township. He at first entered eighty arces, but
							purchased more later and was possessed of two hundred and sixty acres at the time of
							his death. Both he and his wife were devout members of the Baptist church and in this
							faith they reared their family.</p>

						<p>Benjamin Grayson Edmondson grew from babyhood to manhood in this county, receiving
							his elementary education in the early schools of this district and later attending
							Franklin College. On October 20, 1853, he was united in marriage with Mary A. Little,
							who was born near Plainfield, a daughter of Samuel and Rebecca (Greene) Little, her
							father being a farmer who had come to this county from Washington county, this state.
							After the subject was married, he took his bride to a little cabin which he had
							erected and prepared for her with his own hands on a tract of land where only twenty
							acres were at that time cleared. He had considerable more work to do in this line and
							in preparing his land for cultivation he endured the hardships and privations of the
							early pioneers. On this first tract he lived for about three years, when he purchased
							the tract of forty acres adjoining, where he resided until 1867. He then moved a short
							distance south of Clayton, where he purchased a farm of eighty acres, to which he
							later added eighty acres more and then again a tract of one hundred and eight acres.
							He now owns about six hundred and forty acres of excellent land, in this township, all
							attesting to the business ability and indomitable energy of their owner. On January
							14, 1888, Mrs. Edmondson passed away, being the mother of eight children who lived
							beyond infancy, one of whom, Rebecca, died when seventeen years of age. The seven
							living are Columbus, Robert A., Mrs. Lizzie Worrell, Thomas B., Joseph L., Samuel
							Eugene and Charles Arthur. Mr. Edmondson has the pleasure of seeing all his children
							in good circumstances and an excellent way of life, and has the additional enjoyment
							of having them all near him, as all reside in or near Clayton. All but Charles are
							engaged in farming, he being in the implement business. He is a skilled marksman and a
							trap shooter of national reputation. Robert is president of the People's Bank and
							Trust Company. Joe is a prosperous and successful farmer, who, in addition to the
							regular business of his farm, pays particular attention to a fine strain of horses and
							mules.</p>

						<p>On February 29, 1888, Mr. Edmondson was again united in marriage. his bride being
							Mrs. Mary E. (Springer) Ader, who was born in Darke county, Ohio, the daughter of
							Benjamin O. and Eliza Springer. In 1856. <pb id="VAC1000-334" n="315"/> when she was
							fifteen years old, her folks moved to Decatur county, where her father entered land
							for himself and all his sons. In 1860 she was united in marriage to Jacob H. Ader, who
							was born in Putnam county, this state. His father and Mrs. Edmondson's father moved to
							the state of Iowa at the same time. In 1861 Mr. and Mrs. Ader came back to Indiana and
							located in Putnam county, near Groveland, and remained there as long as her first
							husband lived. His death occurred about 1872. She remained there on the farm until the
							time of her marriage to Mr. Edmondson. She had two sons by her first husband, John W.,
							of Danville, and Solomon O., who still lives on the farm in Putnam county. In 1902 Mr.
							Edmondson purchased a residence in Clayton, where he has lived most of the time since,
							but he passes considerable of his time on the farm. He has made farming and stock
							raising his life's vocation and still continues to manage the farm. Mr. Edmondson has
							raised himself to an enviable position among the agriculturists of his county,
							entirely by his own efforts. He possesses an unfailing energy, excellent judgment and
							his ambition has ever been set on a goal far ahead. While seeking primarily the
							interests of himself and family, he has ever borne in mind his duty to his fellow man,
							and has proven himself a neighbor of unusual helpfulness and consideration. Through
							this manner of living, he has endeared himself to a large circle of friends and
							acquaintances. Mr. Edmondson is independent in politics, voting for the man instead of
							the party every time. Both he and his wife are members of the Presbyterian church and
							give liberally toward its support. He is one of the trustees of the church and has
							been an honored and active member for a number of years. United in his composition are
							so many elements of a provident, practical nature, which during a series of years have
							brought him into prominence and earned for him a first place among the enterprising
							men of his county, that it is but just recognition of his worthiness that he receive
							specific mention in this work.</p>

						<p>The biographies of the representative men of a country bring to light many hidden

							lawyers, physicians, bankers and members of other vocations and professions. The
							subject of this sketch is distinctively one of the leading citizens of the township in
							which he lives, and as such has made his influence felt among his fellow men and
							earned a name for enterprise, integrity and honor that entitles him to worthy notice
							in a work of the nature of this volume.</p>

						<p>Marshall Underwood, the son of Franklin and Ella (Christie) Underwood, was born in
							Marion township, Hendricks county, September 27, 1863. His father was born March 1,
							1826, in Shelby county, Kentucky. He came to this county with his parents when he was
							eight years of age. His father, John Underwood, entered land in Marion township, this
							county, and lived on the farm which he entered, until his death in 1861.</p>

						<p>Franklin Underwood was twice married, his first wife being Catherine Martin, to whom
							he was married January 24, 1850. To the first marriage were born three children:
							Clara, who died September 21, 1867; Mrs. Rebecca Beckley and Mrs. Sarah L. Christie.
							His first wife died August 13, 1859, and in 1860 Mr. Underwood married Ella Christie,
							who was a native of Kentucky and has been a resident of this county since she was four
							years of age. Her parents came to this county from Kentucky and lived near New
							Winchester in Marion township. To this second marriage was born one child, Marshall,
							whose history is herein presented. The second wife of Franklin Underwood was born in
							1832 and died in 1914, at the age of eighty-one.</p>

						<p>Franklin Underwood was a remarkable man in many ways. He was a very careful man in
							his business affairs, and in everything he did was honest and upright. While he was
							laying aside a comfortable competence for his old age, he did not neglect the affairs
							of a higher life to come. In 1852 he, with his wife and three of his sisters, united
							with the New Winchester Baptist church. In 1857 he was chosen and ordained a deacon in
							that denomination. In 1862 he changed his church membership to Danville and united
							there with the Regular Baptist church, and still later, as a matter of convenience, he
							placed his membership in the Palestine church, in Putnam county, Indiana, where he
							continued as a member until his death, May 2, 1892. Franklin Underwood was one of a
							family of seven and of his five sisters and one brother, all are deceased now except
							his sister, Mrs. Lottie McMurry, who lives at Spokane, Washington. At his death he had
							a farm of two hundred and eighty acres, one hundred and eighty of wh4ch was in Putnam
							county and the remainder in Marion township, this county.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-336" n="317"/>

						<p>Marshall Underwood has lived all his life in Marion township and in that township
							received his early training on the farm and in the district schools. He has two
							hundred and eighteen acres of land south of New Winchester, and has it well improved
							in every way. He raises live stock and also feeds much stock for the market, in
							addition to his general farming.</p>

						<p>Mr. Underwood was married the first time on October 28, 1885, to Clara Johnson, a
							native of Morgan county, Indiana, and to this union were born two children, Mable,
							born July 1, 1890, and Clarence, born April 13, 1896. Mable married Glenn Brown, a
							farmer in Putnam county, November 10, 1912. Clarence is still with his father on the
							home farm. Mr. Underwood was married a second time on October 1, 1902, to Cora
							Thompson, a native of Hendricks county, and the daughter of Charles and Sarah Jane
							(Moon) Thompson. To this union was born one child, May 18, 1913, now deceased. Mrs.
							Underwood's father was a native of Illinois, and her mother of this county, both of
							whom are still living. Mr. and Mrs. Charles Thompson have a family of six children:
							Cora, the wife of Mr. Underwood, Mavia, Maggie, James E., Effie and Charles
							Walter.</p>

						<p>Mr. Underwood is a Democrat in politics, but takes no further interest in politics
							than to cast his vote for the candidate of his party at election time. He and his wife
							are members of the Missionary Baptist church and he has been a trustee in that
							denomination for the past six years. He is a jovial man, with a happy disposition and
							easily wins friends. He is a man with keen judgment and business qualities which would
							have made him a success in any line of business to which he might have turned. His
							conduct during his whole career has been exemplary and no action of his has ever
							brought upon him the condemnation of his fellow citizens, and thus he justly deserves

						<p>Agriculture has always been an honorable occupation and at the present time the
							agricultural output is more than equivalent to the total output of all the factories
							of the United States. There is one thing in the life of a farmer which distinguishes
							him from men in other occupations, and that is his ability to exist independent of
							every other occupation. The merchant, the banker, the manufacturer and the
							professional man depend absolutely on <pb id="VAC1000-337" n="318"/> the farmer's
							crops. A famine throughout this county would wreck the strongest bank, close the
							factories and bankrupt the merchants. The business man can see his business collapse
							within a week, but nothing short of an earthquake can ruin the farmer. Land is and it
							always has been, the most stable investment; panics may sweep the manufacturer out of
							business over night, but the farmer can survive them when every other industry falls.
							Therefore the farmer is the backbone of the nation and he who makes two blades of
							grass grow where but one formerly grew is performing the most important mission of
							man. Hendricks county's farmers are as good as can be found anywhere in the world and
							their history is the history of the material advancement of the county, and no farmer
							in the county is more deserving of recognition in this series of sketches than is the
							gentleman whose name heads this sketch.</p>

						<p>Charles W. Kocher was born September 19, 1860, in Marion county, Indiana, seven miles
							west of Indianapolis, on the Hanch free gravel road. His father, Edwin Kocher, was
							born in Allen county, Pennsylvania, and when a child moved with his parents to a place
							near Columbus, Ohio. When he was eight years of age, his parents moved to
							Indianapolis, where Edwin F. was reared to manhood and married. Edwin F. and his
							father operated a blacksmith shop on West Washington street, Indianapolis, for several
							years. They then moved seven miles west of Indianapolis, where they lived until the
							death of Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Kocher, he dying in 1892 and his wife in 1894.</p>

						<p>Charles W. Kocher received his education in Marion county, Indiana, completing his
							common school education in the city schools of Indianapolis. In 1894 he moved to his
							present farm, which he has been operating for the past twenty years. As a farmer he
							has been uniformly successful in his crops and raising live stock, which is peculiar
							to this section of the state, Duroc Red hogs receiving his chief attention.</p>

						<p>Mr. Kocher was married in 1891 to Louise J. Hurion, of Hendricks county, and to this

						<p>David W. Carter, a twentieth-century farmer, knows very little of the disadvantages
							which surrounded the pioneer farmers of this state. No longer is the farmer compelled
							to rise early in the morning and continue his labors far into the evening. The farmer
							of today can do as much work in a half of a day as his father could fifty years ago in
							a whole day. The rural route leaves the daily paper on his door step each day, the
							telephone puts him in instant communication with his neighbors, and the interurban and
							automobile enable him to participate in all the features of city life. Surrounded by
							such conditions, the farmer of today can have all the advantages of the citizens of
							the city with few disavantages.</p>

						<p>David W. Carter, the son of John M. and Susan (Wells) Carter, was born in 1855, on
							the farm where he now lives near Avon, Indiana. He was educated in the common schools
							of his township and later took a course in Northwestern Christian University, now
							known as Butler College, Indianapolis. After completing his college course he returned
							to his home county, where he has continued to follow the occupation of farming. In
							addition to raising all of the crops of this latitude, he makes a speciality of Poland
							China hogs and Jersey cattle. For the past year he has operated an up-to-date dairy
							and has proved to be a very successful dairyman.</p>

						<p>Mr. Carter was married in 1876 to Susan Hiatt, the daughter of Jesse and Achsa Hiatt,
							his wife being born in 1854 in Henry county, Indiana. Mr. and Mrs. Carter have seven
							children: Louis F., born in 1877, who is a farmer residing with his parents on the
							home farm; Mrs. Eva May Larsh, born in 1881, who is the wife of a farmer in the
							northeastern part of Washington township. She has three children, Raymond, Russell and
							Edna; John L., born in 1885, who is married and is a street car conductor in
							Indianapolis; Grace M., born in 1886, who is single and has attended the Metropolitian
							Musical College, Indianapolis, is a musician of more than ordinary ability and is now
							teaching a large class at home; Mary E., born in 1888, is single and living at home;
							she graduated from the high school at Indianapolis; Walter E., born in 1891, is an
							electrician and is making a special study of wireless telegraphy; Paul H. is working
							for the Bell Telephone Company, and Fanny. Mr. and Mrs. Carter have given all of their
							seven children the advantage of the best education possible and take a great deal of
							pride in the achievements of their children.</p>

						<p>Mr. Carter is one of the most prosperous farmers of Washington township <pb
								id="VAC1000-339" n="320"/> and his reputation as a farmer and public-spirited
							citizen is not confined to his local township, as is shown by his service on the
							county council for two terms and the township board two terms. In his official
							capacity as councilman, he advocated all measures which were for the welfare of his
							county, and took a decided stand in favor of all improvements which might enhance the
							value of farm property. He is a Republican in politics. Mr. and Mrs. Carter are

							the affairs of life, but its pertinence is most patent in those instances where men
							have so employed their inherent talents, so improved their opportunities and so
							marshalled their forces as to gain prestige, which finds its sphere of influence ever
							widening in beneficence and human helpfulness. Greater than in almost any other
							vocation is the responsibility that rests upon the physician, since in his hands
							repose at times the very issues of life and death. To those who attain determinate
							success must there be not only given technical ability, but also a broad human
							sympathy which shall pass from mere sentiment to be an actuating motive for
							helpfulness.</p>

						<p>Dr. E. Ray Royer, of North Salem, was born in Stockwell, Tippecanoe county, Indiana,
							October 22, 1875. His parents were J. W. and Sarah (Miller) Royer, both of whom were
							natives of that county. His father, who traces his ancestry back to the first
							colonists who came to America, is a merchant at Stockwell.</p>

						<p>Doctor Royer was educated in the common and high schools of Stockwell, and then took
							a course in a business college at Lafayette, Indiana. In the fall of 1899 he
							matriculated in the Physio-Medical College of Indiana at Indianapolis, graduating four
							years later. In order to better prepare himself for his life work, he spent two years
							as an interne in the College Dispensary of Indianapolis, thereby gaining an experience
							which has been of invaluable assistance to him. At the end of his interneship at
							Indianapolis, he settled in North Salem, engaging in the active practice of his
							profession, in which he has <pb id="VAC1000-340" n="[]"/>

							<pb id="VAC1000-341" n="321"/> continued very successfully since. He is now company
							surgeon for the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton Railway Company for Hendricks
							county, and, as their representative, has the patronage of all the employees of the
							company in this county, or of any one who become injured within the limits of the
							county. Doctor Royer has made a special study of the diseases of women and has had
							considerable experience along this line. Doctor Royer is a physician who believes in
							keeping abreast of the times, and to this end he keeps in close touch with the various
							medical associations, being a member of the county, state and American medical
							associations and ex-president of the Hendricks County Medical Society.</p>

						<p>Doctor Royer was married June 19, 1895, to Cora McDole, of Stockwell, the daughter of
							Clinton and Ada (Anderson) McDole. Her father was a life-long farmer and upon his
							retirement from active life owned six hundred acres of land in Tippecanoe county.
							Doctor Royer and his wife both belong to the Methodist Episcopal church of North
							Salem, while, fraternally, he is a Mason, having membership with the Royal Arch
							chapter of his town, and is very much interested in the workings of that order. He and
							his wife have a beautiful bungalow in North Salem where they dispense genuine
							hospitality in a very charming fashion.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">MARSHALL S. GLIDEWELL.</hi></head>

						<p>The present age is essentially utilitarian and the life of every successful man
							carries a lesson which, told in contemporary narrative, is productive of much good in
							shaping the destiny of others. There is, therefore, a due measure of satisfaction in
							presenting, even in brief resume, the life and achievements of such men, and in
							preparing the following history of the successful farmer whose name appears above it
							is with the hope that it may prove not only interesting and instructive, but also
							serve as an incentive to those who contemplate making the agricultural profession
							their life work.</p>

						<p>Marshall S. Glidewell, the son of Thomas and Elizabeth Glidewell, was born in
							Sullivan county, Missouri, July 2, 1856. Thomas Glidewell's father came from North
							Carolina and settled near Shelbyville, Shelby county, Indiana, in 1828, where Thomas
							was born on November 22, 1829.</p>

						<p>Marshall S. Glidewell came with his parents from Missouri to Marion county when he
							was two years old and lived in Marion county until his <pb id="VAC1000-342" n="322"/>
							marriage, in 1884. After finishing the common school course in his own township, he
							took a course in the Old Pike Township Academy, near Trader's Point, in order to
							prepare himself for the teaching profession. He taught one year in the Brown school,
							Brown township, Hendricks county, and twelve in Marion county, and was counted among
							the most successful teachers of these counties. The teaching profession lost a good
							instructor when he decided to retire from the school room and engage in farming.
							However, he has been no less successful as a farmer than as a teacher, and is now
							recognized in Hendricks county as one of the foremost farmers of the county. He is now
							and has been for six years the chairman of the farmers' institute, is now
							vice-chairman, and has taken a prominent part in the selection of a county agent for
							his county. His long experience in the school room has made a student of him in his
							agricultural affairs and there is probably no better posted man in the county on
							general agricultural topics than Mr. Glidewell. He has successfully combined theory
							and practice and in his career as a farmer he has exemplified the old saying that it
							takes even brains to be a good farmer.</p>

						<p>Mr. Glidewell was married on March 20, 1884, to Laura A. Hockensmith, the daughter of
							Henry and Jane Hockensmith. After Mr. Glidewell quit teaching in Marion county, they
							removed, on Auguust 4, 1891, to Hendricks county and bought the farm on which they now
							reside. He took this farm, which was in a very dilapidated condition, and has now made
							it one of the most attractive farms of the county. He has a beautiful home and takes a
							great deal of pride in keeping everything about him in first-class condition at all
							times. He has, in addition to his general farming, made a specialty of Poland-China
							hogs and has shown that it takes good judgment and a knowledge of scientific feeding
							in order to make the raising of hogs a lucrative business. Many farmers are not
							cognizant of the fact that Purdue University issues bulletins which set forth in
							detail the scientific method of feeding, and that these bulletins may be had free of
							charge by application to the department of agriculture connected with the university.
							It is in keeping in touch with affairs of this nature that makes Mr. Glidewell stand
							out prominently as a progressive and up-to-date farmer.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Glidewell have two interesting children, who are now in college, Ivan S.
							and Eva O. Their oldest child, Wilma R., was born June 24, 1888, and died a year
							later, June 22, 1889. Ivan S., born June 9, 1891, is a senior in Earlham College at
							Richmond, Indiana, where he is pursuing a course in scientific chemistry. The
							daughter, Eva O., who was born November 14, 1883, is a sophomore in Earlham College,
							and is making a <pb id="VAC1000-343" n="323"/> special study of the Latin language,
							preparing to teach. Mr. and Mrs. Glidewell are justly proud of their two children, who
							are certainly an honor to their parents. Mr. and Mrs. Glidewell have a hospitable home
							where they entertain their friends, who are as numerous as their acquaintances. Mr.
							Glidewell has lived a very useful life and has been prominent in the advancement of
							material, social and moral interests in his county. He always stands for such men and
							measures as he firmly believes will advance the best interests of the community and by
							so doing he has won the hearty approbation of all of those with whom he comes in daily
							contact. He has been a leader in his community in the use of commercial fertilizers
							scientifically, also advocated and put in practice sub-drainage of soils for the
							redeeming of land for better agriculture; also stands for good roads. He has a
							beautiful home, modern, as well as all of his outbuildings, which are among the best
							in the township.</p>

							and vicinity. He possesses energy and determination, and has been very successful in
							making everything he undertakes result to his advantage, and his success in his chosen
							calling is attested by the fact of his having started in a humble manner and is now
							the owner of valuable real estate, having accumulated the same by his own efforts.</p>

						<p>M. H. Wehr, a prosperous farmer of Washington township, Hendricks county, Indiana,
							was born in Franklin county, this state, July 9, 1854, the son of John and Nancy
							(Pierson) Wehr, who were highly respected citizens of their, home community. When Mr.
							Wehr was a small child of two years he went with his parents to Butler county, Ohio,
							remaining there until he was twenty-two years old, at which time he returned, to
							Indiana, and after living four years in Franklin county he moved to Washington
							township, Hendricks county, in 1880, and settled on the farm where he has continued to
							reside since that time. As a farmer he has been a pronounced success, owing to his
							persistent efforts and sound judgment, and among his fellow agriculturists he occupies
							an enviable standing because of his business success and personal characteristics. He
							has carried on general farming and has also given much attention to live stock,
							principally horses.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-344" n="324"/>

						<p>Mr. Wehr was married on September 29, 1876, to Lida F. Freeland, the daughter of

						<p>Among the native sons of Hendricks county, Indiana, who have spent their entire lives
							within its borders, is Robert Bayliss, a prosperous farmer of Liberty township. He was
							born April 18, 1867, in the township where he has spent his whole life. His parents
							were John William and Frances (Brill) Bayliss. John Bayliss was born in 1829 in
							Virginia, and came to this county in 1859, with his wife and three sons. They drove
							through from Virginia, following the national road through Ohio and Indiana, and
							located at Center Valley, in Liberty township, this county. A brother of Mrs. Bayliss,
							William Brill, was already here when Mr. Bayliss arrived. Here they farmed for several
							years on a tract of sixty acres. Later John W. Bayliss sold this farm and bought
							property near Hazelwood, where he spent his remaining days, his death occurring on
							September 30, 1909, at the advanced age of eighty-one years. He was a stanch Democrat
							all his life and held the office of township supervisor for several years. He was an
							ardent member of the Methodist Episcopal church at Salem, Indiana, and was a man who
							lived a Christian life in every way. Frances Brill, the wife of John W. Bayliss, was
							born in Virginia in 1829 and is still living at the old home place near Hazelwood, at
							the advanced age of eighty-five years. She is still hale and hearty and, despite her
							years, can do a heavy day's work, either inside the home or on the farm. Mr. and Mrs.
							John W. Bayliss were the parents of nine children: William M., who lives in Clarence,
							Missouri; Marshall, of Clayton, Indiana; Edward, who died in 1911; John, <pb
								id="VAC1000-345" n="325"/> a resident of Mooresville, Indiana; James, of Clayton,
							Indiana; Thomas, who lives in Seattle, Washington; Robert, with whom this narrative
							deals; Charles, who died at the age of three years; Ella, who stays at the old home
							place with her mother.</p>

						<p>Mr. Bayliss was married March 25, 1893, to Lura Busby, the daughter of Smith and
							Adeline (Shipley) Busby, and to this union there have been born two daughters, Hazel
							and Helena, who are both at home with their parents.</p>

						<p>Smith Busby, the father of Mrs. Bayliss, was born May 28, 1842, near Hazelwood,
							Indiana, and was the son of Miles and Ellen (Harrison) Busby. Miles Busby and wife
							were the parents of a family of eleven children, all of whom are deceased but Rachel,
							Smith and John Thomas. These children, in the order of their birth, are as follows:
							William, Margaret, Mary, Rachel, Susan, Lucinda, Smith, Elizabeth, John Thomas and
							Rebecca. Mrs. Rachel (Busby) Busby lives in this county; John Thomas is a resident of
							Indianapolis and is employed by Kingan &amp; Company.</p>

						<p>Smith Busby was married in 1863 to Adeline Shipley, the daughter of James and Mary
							(Borders) Shipley, and to this union were born three children: Lura, the wife of
							Robert Bayliss; Anda, deceased, and Elvin, who lives with his father. Mrs. Busby died
							in April, 1910. Mr. Busby has been a keen business farmer and now is the owner of one
							hundred and seventy-nine acres of excellent farming land in Liberty township, this
							county. He has been a life-long Democrat and a loyal member of the Missionary Baptist
							church from earliest manhood.</p>

						<p>Robert Bayliss has followed agricultural pursuits in this county all his life. His
							boyhood days were spent in Liberty township, where he attended school and before
							reaching manhood he lived in Center township. He then spent one year in Marion
							township, where he rented a farm, and later returned to Liberty township and remained
							there for seven years. While in Liberty township he was married and in the same year
							moved to Franklin township, on his father-in-law's farm, and here he remained until
							1903, when he returned to Liberty township and bought his present farm. He has
							forty-nine acres of excellent farming land, valued at one hundred and fifty dollars an
							acre. He keeps everything about his place in excellent repair and his place presents a
							very attractive appearance at all times.</p>

						<p>Mr. Bayliss is a member of the Improved Order of Red Men, at Hazelwood, and of the
							Pocahontas Lodge of the same place. Politically, he is a Democrat, but has never been
							active in his party. He and his wife are loyal members of the Baptist church, at
							Hazelwood, and Mr. Bayliss has <pb id="VAC1000-346" n="326"/> been a deacon in the
							church for the last two years. He and his wife are both faithful workers in the church
							and give liberally of their time and money to further the interests of the Gospel and

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN W. HOLLAWAY.</hi></head>

						<p>The gentleman whose name heads this paragraph is widely known in Hendricks county,
							being one of the honored citizens of Brown township, where he is living quietly after
							a strenuous life of activity in connection with agricultural pursuits. His well
							directed efforts in the practical affairs of life, his capable management of his
							business interests and his sound judgment, have brought to him prosperity and his life
							demonstrates what may be accomplished by any man of energy and ambition who is not
							afraid to work and has the perseverance to continue his labors in the face of any
							disaster or discouragement that may arise. In all the relations of life, Mr. Hollaway
							has commanded the confidence and respect of those with whom he has been brought into
							contact and a biographical history of this locality would be incomplete without a
							record of his career.</p>

						<p>John W. Hollaway is a native of this county, having been born on March 24, 1844, in
							the southwest corner of Brown township, the son of Joseph and Elizabeth (Coole)
							Hollaway, the former of whom was a native of the state of Virginia, the latter being a
							Hoosier by birth. Joseph Hollaway, while still a small lad, was brought to the state
							of Indiana by his parents, where his father, William Hollaway, entered government land
							near the city of Indianapolis. When a young man, in Virginia, William Hollaway served
							during the Revolutionary War. When Joseph Hollaway became of age, he came to Hendricks
							county and entered the land where in later years the subject of this sketch was born.
							He purchased one hundred and sixty-four acres at that time, giving about one dollar
							and a half per acre, and in order to have the papers in the transfer properly made out
							it was necessary for him to go to the then small village of Crawfordsville, a
							considerable distance, which he covered on foot through what was then almost a
							wilderness. The land which he then purchased still remains in the Hollaway family,
							never having been owned under any other name. Joseph Hollaway lived <pb
								id="VAC1000-347" n="327"/> on his newly acquired land for about five years before
							uniting in marriage with Elizabeth Coole, daughter of Frederick Coole, who was one of
							the early settlers near Indianapolis. Their entire married life was passed on the one
							place and there they reared their family of eight children. Joseph Hollaway passed
							from this life in August, 1895, and his wife lived until in February, 1901.</p>

						<p>John W. Hollaway lived under the paternal roof until he was thirty years old, when he
							built his present home, just north of the old homestead and across the public highway.
							In December, 1873, he was united in marriage with Mary Ann Rice, daughter of Louis and
							Sophia (Harris) Rice, both of whom were natives of Kentucky. They came from families
							quite prominent in their respective communities in their native state, both being
							slave holders and people in good circumstances. The father of Sophia Harris Rice was
							William Harris, who upon coming to the state of Indiana entered a tract of government
							land where Clermont, Indiana, now is. He later disposed of that and entered land on
							which the northwest portion of the town of Brownsburg now stands. Louis Rice also
							entered government land about one mile north of the town of Brownsburg, and there he
							passed the remainder of his life.</p>

						<p>To John W. Hollaway and wife were born three children, one of whom is still living.
							This is their son, Wilbert Forrest, who took as his wife May Offit, daughter of
							Alexander and May (Kelley) Offit, both natives of the Hoosier state. Wilbert and wife
							are the parents of four children, Russell. Esther and Byron. and a little daughter,
							Gladys, who died when ten years of age. One other child of Mr. and Mrs. Hollaway grew
							to maturity. This was their daughter Lena Leota, who became the wife of Wilbert
							Canary. She was the mother of one child, Paul Orlopp Canary, who was but fifteen
							months old when his mother died. He was then taken into the home of Mr. and Mrs.
							Hollaway and is at present attending the Brownsburg high school and is a promising boy
							in his third year's work.</p>

						<p>Both the subject of this sketch and his wife are members of the Christian church and
							are sincerely interested in the work of same. They live beautiful, consistent lives
							and their home radiates the warmth and cheer in the hearts of its owners. Mr. Hollaway
							has devoted the energies of his entire life to the vocation of farming and at present
							owns two hundred and forty acres of land, the majority being located in Brown
							township, all of which is in an excellent state of cultivation, showing care and close
							attention to modern methods of agriculture and the proper rotation of crops. Besides
							his farm, Mr. Hollaway owns property in Brownsburg, and while <pb id="VAC1000-348"
								n="328"/> he has shown business ability of a high order and a proper desire to
							further his own interests, he has never lost sight of the essential qualities of a
							well rounded manhood and today is one of the most highly respected and esteemed
							citizens of his community. His quiet but kindly disposition has won for him friends
							all over the county, while the well regulated life he has led entitles him to

						<head><hi rend="center">FRED E. WARNER.</hi></head>

						<p>It is a generally acknowledged fact that journalism is one of the most important
							factors in twentieth-century life, exerting as it does an influence on practically
							every department of society. This relation is just as actual and potent in the smaller
							cities and towns as in the larger cities, and he who directs the policy of a
							newspaper, or wields the pen which gives expression to that policy, exerts a personal
							control over local thought and action not equalled by any other profession. Among the
							newspaper men of Hendricks county, Indiana, who have, by their progressive attitude
							toward local affairs, contributed in a very definite measure to the advancement of the
							community, is the gentleman whose name appears above and who is successfully
							publishing the <hi rend="i">Friday Caller</hi> at Plainfield, Indiana.</p>

						<p>Fred E. Warner was born in Danville, in this county, on December 22, 1865. His
							parents were Dr. John T. and Mary R. (Rose) Warner, the father being a native of Long
							Island, New York, and the mother of Kentucky. His father came to this state before the
							Civil War and here met his future wife. Upon the outbreak of the war he became a
							surgeon in a New York regiment and served throughout that conflict in the cavalry
							branch of the service. Immediately after the close of the war he returned to Hendricks
							county and practiced medicine in Danville and Winchester until 1870. In that year he
							went to Neosho Falls, Kansas, his family following him one year later, and his death
							occurred there September 10, 1875. One year later his family returned to Danville,
							where his wife died in 1909. Doctor and Mrs. Warner were the parents of three
							children: Fred E., the eldest; Russell D., of Danville, and Clyde L., a merchant of
							Muncie, Indiana.</p>

						<p>Fred E. Warner received a good education in the common schools, graduating from the
							high school in Danville in 1883, then becoming a student in the Central Normal College
							at Danville for a short time. His newspaper <pb id="VAC1000-349" n="329"/> career
							began on February 14, 1884, the day on which he began working as a printer in the
							office of the <hi rend="i">Danville Republican</hi>. This means that for twenty years
							he has been connected with the printing business and during that time he has been in
							close touch with every phase of the work. On September 9, 1904, the <hi rend="i"
								>Plainfield Friday Caller</hi> was established by P. W. Raidabaugh, and Mr. Warner
							had charge of the Danville office, of the <hi rend="i">Friday Caller</hi> for six
							years. In June, 1912, he went to Plainfield as the managing editor of the paper, and
							on August 1, 1913, Mr. Warner became sole proprietor of this paper, and is now
							publishing it as a Republican weekly paper.</p>

						<p>Mr. Warner was married January 4, 1893, to Julia S. Thompson, of Danville, the
							daughter of Jesse Thompson, and to this union there has been born one son, Clifford
							T., who is now a student at DePauw University, where he is a member of the Sigma Chi
							fraternity. Mr. Warner is a member of the Presbyterian church and has been for
							twenty-five years. He was formerly a member of the board of deacons in this
							denomination. For the past seven years he has had charge of the music at the Christian
							church in Danville.</p>

						<p>A sketch of the life of Mr. Warner would not be complete without more than passing
							mention of his evangelistic work. For more than twenty-five years he has had
							evangelistic singing work of character every year. In the winter of 1911-12 he was
							with the J. Wilbur Chapman and Charles Alexander party for fourteen weeks in Chicago,
							Toronto and Brooklyn. In the following year he was with Dr. Edwin S. Stucker, of
							Ottawa, Kansas, in Washington City, D. C., and Brooklyn. He has also worked over the
							states of Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Wisconsin and Michigan. During his
							singing and evangelistic work with various evangelists he gained fame as a tenor
							singer and does a large amount of concert work.</p>

						<p>Mr. Warner has been a member of the Knights of Pythias since he was twenty-one years
							of age, and is also a member of the local camp of the Sons of Veterans. Politically,
							he has always been allied with the Republican party and has served his party in
							various capacities many times. He is at the present time secretary of the Republican
							county central committee. The only official position he ever held in the county was
							treasurer of the town of Danville. Mr. Warner is not only a well-trained newspaper
							man, a first-class musician and a believer in pure politics, but he is widely informed
							on all current topics. He is honest and upright in all his relations with his fellow
							men, and today few citizens of Hendricks county are better known and none moire highly
							respected, for in all phases of his career since making <pb id="VAC1000-350" n="330"/>
							his home here he has performed his full part as a man among men, and has earned and
							retains the sincere regard and confidence of all who know him. Personally, he is

						<p>Fortunate, indeed, is the family which has a history extending back more than three
							generations. The McHaffie family has an unbroken record going back more than three
							generations and including several hundred descendants. George W. McHaffie, the son of
							Melville F. and Mary Ann McHaffie, was born in Morgan county, Indiana, February 25,
							1856. It is interesting to note that, although he was born in Morgan county, the part
							of the county in which he was born is now a part of Putnam county. Melville F.
							McHaffie was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, December 27, 1826, and his wife in
							Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Melville came to Hendricks county with his father in 1832,
							his mother having died in Tennessee, and his father settled upon a farm west of
							Stilesville. When they first came to the county they lived in a tent for a time, and
							then they put up a rude log house in which they lived for several years. Melville
							attended the subscription schools of the neighborhood and was taught the rudiments of
							the three R's. Eventually he became a great buyer of mules and had more mules branded
							for the government than any man in the state. At one time he was also the largest land
							owner in the counties of Putnam and Hendricks, owning more than two thousand five
							hundred acres of land in the two counties. His death occurred on May 27, 1914.</p>

						<p>Melville McHaffie was married to Mary Ann Thomas, the daughter of John and Catherine
							(Ulrich) Thomas, and to this union there were born ten children: Florence, who married
							Charles W. Bridges; Virginia, who married Thomas Bogges and has one s-on, Bennett;
							Minnie, who married Dr. N. G. Masters and has one son, Alexander; Andrew, who died at
							the age of seventeen; Clementine, who died in infancy; Marcus, who died at the age of
							three; Oscar, who married Mary Leachman and has one son, Melville J.; Ernest, who
							married Anna Greer and has three children, Ernestine, Robert and Maxine; Ernestine
							married Harry Thorpe, of Cartersburg; Mary E., who married John F. Shields and has one
							son, John M.</p>

						<p>George W. McHaffie attended the district schools of his township and <pb
								id="VAC1000-351" n="331"/> after leaving school became associated with his father in
							the live-stock business. At the age of twenty-one, June 13, 1877, he was married to
							Emma Cosner, the daughter of Samuel and Nancy (Walls) Cosner, and to this union there
							have been born two children, Marion Catherine and Mary Ann. Marion married Harry
							Tincher and Mary Ann married George L. Englehart and has one daughter, Emma
							Catherine.</p>

						<p>Andrew and Nancy (Woods) McHaffie, the paternal grandparents of Mr. McHaffie, were
							both natives of Tennessee, and to them were born three children, Melville, Emeline and
							Jane. After the death of his first wife, Andrew married Nancy Hackett and to this
							marriage was born Mary Angeline. Emeline married William Robards and has three
							children, Andrew, Augusta and Laura. Jane died at the age of ten. Mary A. married
							Harvey Lee and has four children; Margaret, deceased, Charles Herbert, Edward and
							James.</p>

						<p>The parents of Samuel Cosner's wife were James and Mary Walls, Samuel being born in
							North Carolina and his wife in Indiana. He came to this county in 1829 with his
							parents and settled in Franklin township, where his father entered one hundred and
							sixty acres of government land. Samuel Cosner was a farmer and wagonmaker all his

						<p>Every one of the thirteen original colonies contributed to the population of Indiana,
							and, as was the case in the early history of the states, it was only the most
							ambitious and enterprising families in the East who ventured to this new territory in
							the West. When Fox started a new religion in England and his followers became known as
							Quakers, or Friends, no one would have thought that this new society would play such
							an important part in the early history of Indiana. When the Friends first came to the
							United States they settled in Pennsylvania, but later on large numbers of them settled
							in North Carolina. When it was seen in the early part of the nineteenth century that
							North Carolina was determined to remain a slave state, there were thousands of these
							good Friends who left that state and emigrated to free territory. It was from North
							Carolina that the Friends in Wayne county came, and Hendricks county owes an
							everlasting debt of gratitude to North Carolina for sending to its borders some of the
							best pioneers of this county. Among the many members of this church who came to
							Hendricks county, the Chandler family were among the most prominent.</p>

						<p>William Chandler was born in Hendricks county, Indiana, on May 24, 1851. His parents
							were Jacob and Mary (Picket) Chandler. Jacob Chandler came to Indiana with his parents
							when he was four years of age and at first settled in Wayne county near Richmond.
							Shortly afterwards his parents came to Hendricks county and entered land in Guilford
							township, within the first five years after Hendricks county was organized. Jacob
							Chandler was born in North Carolina in 1819, came to Indiana in 1823 and married in
							1844. Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Chandler were the parents of three sons: John, a retired
							farmer of this township; Hadley, deceased, and William, whose history is herewith
							portrayed. By her former marriage to Joab Hadley, Mrs. Chandler had five children. Mr.
							and Mrs. Chandler both died, he in 1892 and she in 1895.</p>

						<p>William Chandler received his early education in his home neighborhood and early in
							life began to work on his father's farm. He continued to work <pb id="VAC1000-353"
								n="333"/> on the farm until his marriage, when he began to operate a farm of his
							own. During his whole career he has lived the life of the simple farmer, going through
							the daily and yearly routine which is common to every man in this occupation, and year
							by year adding to his possession, until at the present time he has a fine farm of two
							hundred and ten acres.</p>

						<p>Mr. Chandler has been thrice married, his first marriage being to Indiana Townsend on
							December 31, 1874: she died October 15, 1889, leaving no children, and on April 2,
							1891, Mr. Chandler was married to Anna Starbuck, who died October 14, 1895. He was
							married to Martha E. Hadley on November 4, 1896. She was the daughter of Amos and
							Sallie V. Hadley, and one of six children. There have been no children by any of these
							marriages.</p>

						<p>Mr. Chandler has been a life-long member of the Prohibition party, feeling that in
							the abolition of all intoxicating liquors should be found the greatest aid to the
							advancement of the welfare of our country. Mr. Chandler, as well as all of his
							ancestors, has been identified with the Friends church and to this he has always
							contributed liberally. Mr. Chandler is a man who has always been found contending; in
							fact, he would adhere to a conviction if all the world were against him. He lives in a
							comfortable home, where the spirit of genuine old-time hospitality is always in
							evidence, and because of his genial disposition and manly qualities of character he is
							held in the highest esteem by all who know him.</p>

						<p>There is no positive rule for achieving success, and yet in the life of the
							successful man there are always lessons which might well be followed. The man who
							gains prosperity is he who can see and utilize the opportunities that come in his
							path. The essential conditions of human life are ever the same, the surroundings of
							individuals differ but slightly, and when one man passes another on the highway of
							life to reach the goal of prosperity before others who perhaps started out before him,
							it is because he has the power to use advantages which probably encompass the whole
							human race. Among the well-known citizens of this county whose efforts have been
							directed toward successful agriculture, is the immediate subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>Dennis Bradley Williams is a native of this county, born August 23, 1868, in Middle
							township, southwest of Pittsboro, the son of John Dennis <pb id="VAC1000-354" n="334"
							/> and Elizabeth Jane (King) Williams, both of whom were natives of Kentucky, the
							former coming from Estill county and the latter from Fleming county. Both came to
							Hendricks county in their early childhood, being brought here by their respective
							parents. John Dennis Williams was a son of William Williams, Jr., and Margaret
							Bradley, his wife, who was born March 16, 1812, John Dennis being born in 1835. On
							February 28, 1858, he was united in marriage to Elizabeth Jane King, who was ?torn
							July 2, 1840, the daughter of Enoch Wesley King, born in 1812, and Lucy Ann (Campbell)
							King, born April 23, 1815. Lucy A. Campbell was an aunt of Leander M. Campbell, one of
							our country's greatest lawyers. Enoch King and family settled first near Brownsburg
							and later moved near Pittsboro, where his death occurred in 1872, his wife living
							until December 21, 1877. William Williams, Jr., grandfather of the immediate subject,
							was born in 1809, and was a son of William Williams, Sr. After the marriage of John D.
							Williams, father of the subject, he purchased a tract of forty acres in Middle
							township, all of which was covered with dense forest. This was immediately adjoining
							his father's farm. In order to prepare a site for his one-room log cabin, size
							eighteen by twenty feet, he was obliged to fell twenty-four trees, so thick was the
							growth. He cleared the land of the timber, fenced and cultivated it and lived there
							until about 1870, when he sold it and moved midway between Danville and Lizton, where
							he purchased a farm of eighty acres. He remained there for about ten years, when he
							traded that for another eighty-acre tract just south of Pittsboro, near his old home,
							and took up his residence there in 1881. About three years later he bought a home in
							Brownsburg, where he lived until 1895, at the same time continuing the operation of
							his farm and his business of dealing in live stock. After selling his property in
							Brownsburg he purchased another eighty-acre farm, two miles from that town, and there
							lived until his death, November 30, 1897. He took a commendable interest in community
							affairs and was for many years a faithful member of Mount Zion Baptist church. The
							widow, who had made her home with her son, William West Williams, just south of
							Pittsboro, died May 27, 1914, aged seventy-three years, ten months, twenty-five
							days.</p>

						<p>Dennis Bradley Williams, the immediate subject of this sketch, remained under the
							paternal roof until he was twenty-two years old. From his early youth he had farmed
							for himself, renting land in the neighborhood, and when his father moved west of
							Brownsburg, he then farmed that tract for him. He bought out the rights of the other
							heirs, after the death of the father, and now owns the eighty acres himself. In 1908
							he erected a new dwelling, barns, etc., near the road and has since occupied them. Mr.
								<pb id="VAC1000-355" n="335"/> Williams has been twice married, his first wife being
							Minnie B. Smith, to whom he was united in marriage on October 5, 1890. She was the
							daughter of Andrew J. and Cynthia Smith and passed from this life on January 8, 1893,
							their union having been without issue. On March 6, 1898, Mr. Williams was again united
							in marriage, his bride this time being Lucy J. Warren, who was born in Perry township,
							Boone county, this state, daughter of William H. and Rachael D. (Peters) Warren, the
							former having been born at Knoxville, Tennessee, on April 29, 1837. He was a son of
							William and Lydia (McCaslin) Warren and a brother of Calvin W. Warren, a sketch of
							whose life will be found elsewhere in this volume, giving particulars about parents
							and ancestors. William H. Warren was a boy of about ten years when the parents decided
							on making Indiana their future home. They loaded their possessions into a wagon and
							drove through. At that time there were eight children in the family. William and some
							of the larger children walked beside the wagon all the way, except when fording
							streams. He grew to manhood in Brown township, this county, and lived part of the time
							in Marion county, near Bridgeport. He married Rachael D. Peters, a native of Morgan
							county, this state, and the daughter of Presley Peters, who was a son of William
							Peters. William Peters had owned a large estate in Pennsylvania, which land is now
							thought to be covered by the city of Harrisburg, and he owned other land besides.
							After his death his son, Presley, started to prove his title to this land and died
							before he succeeded in completing his claim, and therefore the heirs failed to get
							this valuable land.</p>

						<p>After his marriage to Rachael Peters, William H. Warren farmed in Boone county until
							about 1894, when he sold his farm there and moved two miles west of Brownsburg, where
							he purchased a farm and has since resided.</p>

						<p>To the subject and his wife have been born two children, Russell E., born August 13,
							1907, and Elbert Wesley, born December 25, 1910. When John D. Williams, father of the
							subject, started in life for himself, he was wholly without funds and bought a tract
							of wild land for six hundred dollars on credit. He built a little cabin home and from
							that pushed his way onward to success. He was of a jovial and sunny disposition and
							had many friends and was widely known. He had but few advantages in the way of
							schooling when a youth, but was highly intelligent and actively interested in public
							affairs. He possessed a sound judgment which was invaluable to him and of great
							assistance to his many friends who relied on his advice. He was a man without malice,
							sociable and friendly, a devout Christian and unusually well versed in the Bible for a
							man of his educational advantages.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-356" n="336"/>

						<p>Mrs. Williams is a very methodical woman; she reads the Bible through once a year and
							has read it to her husband. She has an excellent memory and kept a written account of
							all affairs of interest.</p>

						<p>Not too often can be repeated the life history of one who has lived so honorable and
							useful a life and attained to such notable distinction as he whose name appears at the
							head of this sketch, one of the most successful and distinguished educators that the
							state of Indiana has produced. His character has been one of signal exaltation and
							purity of purpose. Well disciplined in mind, maintaining a vantage point from which
							life has presented itself in correct proportions, guided and guarded by the most
							inviolable principles of integrity and honor, simple and unostentatious in his
							self-respecting, tolerant individuality, such a man could not prove other than a force
							for good in whatever relation of life he may have been placed. His character is the
							positive expression of a strong nature and in studying his career interpretation
							follows fact in a straight line of derivation, there being no need for indirection or
							puzzling. His career has been a busy one and his name is respected by all who have had
							occasion to come in contact with him or who have knowledge of his life work. As an
							educator, President Laird stands in the front rank in Indiana. He has dignified and
							honored his profession, for his life has been one of consecration to his calling, and
							well does he merit a place of honor in every history touching upon the lives and deeds
							of those who have given the best of their powers and talents for the betterment of
							their kind.</p>

						<p>John Walter Laird, president of Central Normal College, Danville, Indiana, was born
							in Oswega, Kansas, September 2, 1871, and is the son of Alvin and Levina Rebecca
							(Somsel) Laird, both parents being natives of Ohio. His father served three and
							one-half years in the Civil War in Company H, Ninety-third Regiment Ohio Volunteer
							Infantry, and was mustered out as a corporal in his regiment. After the close of the
							war he returned to Ohio, where he engaged in farming. In 1882 he removed to Howard
							county, Indiana, and continued his farming operations there until his death in 1909,
							at the age of sixty-three years, his wife dying the same year. He was commander of the
							Grand Army of the Republic post at Galveston, and a trustee in the Universalist church
							in the same place. <pb id="VAC1000-357" n="[]"/>

								<p rend="center">JOHN W. LAIRD</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-358" n="337"/> To Mr. and Mrs. Alvin Laird were born eight children:
							D. C., a farmer living near Lucerene, Cass county, Indiana; John W., the immediate
							subject of this sketch; Charles, deceased in 1909; Frank, a carpenter of Kokomo; Lola
							R., who was the wife of Albert Downhour, of Cass county, this state, but who died in
							1913; Homer Lester, of Fullerton, North Dakota; Jennie, deceased at the age of
							sixteen, and Joseph, who died in infancy.</p>

						<p>John W. Laird was born on a ranch near Oswego, Labette county, Kansas, to which place
							his parents had moved soon after their marriage. He received his primary education in
							West Sonora, Preble county, Ohio, where his parents had removed when he was a small
							lad. His educational training was continued in the Galveston schools in Cass county,
							this state, and he graduated from the high school at that place in 1891. He
							immediately began teaching in the district schools of his county, attending the county
							normal school at Kokomo during the summer months. In the spring of 1893 he entered the
							Indiana State Normal School at Terre Haute, Indiana, and continued his studies there
							until the fall of 1895, when he accepted the superintendency of the Galveston schools.
							He continued at the head of the schools of this place for one year, when he returned
							to the State Normal School and graduated in the spring of 1897. Upon finishing his
							course he accepted the position as head of the history department at the Marion Normal
							School, where he remained until August, 1898. In September of that year he entered the
							junior class at the State University at Bloomington, and graduated in August, 1900,
							majoring in the subject of philosophy. Upon his graduation from the university he
							returned to the Marion Normal School in 1900 as the head of the history department and
							also had general charge of the department of education. He remained on the faculty of
							the normal school until August, 1906, when he left to enter Harvard University in
							order to continue his studies in history and economics under Professors Channing, Hart
							and Taussig, of that institution. After completing one year's residence in study at
							Harvard, he was elected vice-president of the Central Normal College at Danville,
							Indiana, and one year later became the acting president of the same institution. In
							1909 he was elected president by the board of trustees and has since been the head of
							the school. Professor Laird has brought to the presidency a mind and body both well
							fitted for the complex duties connected therewith, for, be it emphasized, the office
							of an institution like this is no sinecure. The growth of the Central Normal College
							since President Laird became its <pb id="VAC1000-359" n="338"/> head is the highest
							testimonial that could be paid to his ability and fore-sight as an executive and to
							his eminent standing as a broad-minded, scholarly and progressive educator. Since
							assuming the responsible position which he now holds and so signally honors, the
							advancement of the college has kept pace with the leading institutions of the kind in
							the United States. The course of study has been developed and the state board of
							education has recognized the superior quality of work which is being done in the
							institution. It has been accredited as one of the standard normal schools and also has
							an approved school of music. President Laird's slogan for the "Greater C. N. C." has
							not been used in vain, for within the short time in which he has had charge of the
							institution its growth has been truly remarkable. It is admittedly one of the best
							normal schools in the country and its work is of a standard which compares favorably
							with similar institutions everywhere. At the present time there are good prospects for
							a new building, and within the next year or so the college will enter upon a new era
							of prosperity. President Laird exercises the greatest care over the buildings and
							grounds, looks after the comfort and welfare of the students and is indeed proud of
							his school and jealous of its good name and reputation. It is easily understood why he
							enjoys such great popularity with all connected with the institution, and is well and
							favorably known to the educational circles throughout the country. President Laird has
							made special study of the subjects of history and economics and has also done wide and
							intensive reading in the field of English literature. His services are in signal
							demand as an instructor in township and county institutes, where he gives lectures on
							English literature and history. He also gives a large number of commencement addresses
							each year throughout the state. President Laird is much interested in the study of
							nature and his beautiful home is at the edge of Danville, where he makes a specialty
							of raising fine poultry and different kinds of small fruits. He now has more than
							fifty different kinds of apples on his farm. He has also made a special study of birds
							and has many different kinds nesting on his home place.</p>

						<p>John W. Laird was married on August 15, 1900, to Daisy E. Lowder, the eldest daughter
							of Dr. Lindsay Lowder, of Bloomington, Indiana, and to his happy marriage there have
							been born three children: Alice Rebecca, born 1902 and died in infancy; Mary
							Elizabeth, born in 1905, and Martha May, born in 1908. Mrs. Laird is a woman of
							gracious and charming personality and their home is the center of a large social
							circle.</p>

						<p>President Laird and his wife are members of the Methodist Episcopal <pb
								id="VAC1000-360" n="339"/> church and are earnest and faithful in the observance of
							their religious obligations and privileges. Personally, President Laird is genial and
							easily approached and enjoys to a marked degree the confidence of all who are thrown
							in contact with him. Though first of all an educator, and making his work as such
							paramount to every other consideration, he has not been remiss in his duty to the
							community in which he resides nor unmindful of his obligations as a citizen. Although
							he is a Republican in politics on national issues, he is not a strict partisan and,
							particularly in local affairs, gives his support to the best qualified candidate
							irrespective of party lines. He is a member of the Sons of Veterans and the Knights of
							Pythias, and also of the Greek-letter fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta. Though now only
							in the early prime of life, he has achieved success such as only few attain, but, not
							satisfied with past results, he is pressing forward to still wider fields and higher
							honors, although his place among the eminent men of his day and generation is secure
							for all time to come.</p>

						<p>The gentleman to whom the reader's attention is now directed was not favored by
							inherited wealth or the assistance of influential friends, but in spite of these, by
							perseverance, industry and a wise economy, he has attained a comfortable station in
							life, and is well and favorably known throughout Hendricks county as a result of the

							him as a man of sound business principles, thoroughly up to date in all phases of
							agriculture and stock raising and as a man who, while advancing his individual
							interests, does not neglect his general duties as a citizen.</p>

						<p>On the paternal side, the subject's ancestral history is traced as follows: (I) John
							Foudray, the great-great-grandfather, was born in France some time during the latter
							part of the sixteenth century, but, because of the Huguenot persecutions by the
							Catholics, he was compelled to flee from home. (II) John Foudray, the
							great-grandfather, was born in the state of Delaware about 1737, and he was the father
							of (III) John Wood Foudray, who was born on April 5, 1787. The latter married Martha
							Martin, who was born on November 2, 1787. Among their children was (IV) John Elbert
							Foudray, father of the subject of this sketch, and who was born on March 12, <pb
								id="VAC1000-361" n="340"/> 1817, his death occurring on August 27, 1878, at the age
							of sixty-one years and five months. He married Adelia Green, who was born on March 23,
							1817, the daughter of Moses and Elizabeth Green. Her death occurred on April 12, 1895,
							at the age of seventy-eight years. Of the children born to the last-named couple,
							Charlotte, who became the wife of James A. Morrison, died on January 28, 1878, and
							James Elbert died on January 16, 1910. The subject's maternal grandfather was killed
							by Indians when his daughter, the subject's mother, was but one year old.</p>

						<p>Edgar E. Foudray, the son of John and Adelia (Green) Foudray, was born in
							Indianapolis, Indiana, October 20, 1853, and received his education in the public
							schools of that city. He lived there until he was twenty-one years of age, when he
							went to Stephenson county, Illinois, where he married, and there he remained until
							1880, when he came to Hendricks county, Indiana, and settled in Washington township,
							on the farm where he now lives. While he is a farmer of more than ordinary ability, he
							has made a particular specialty of dairy cattle and conserves his energy in that
							direction. He has the most sanitary and up-to-date dairy farm in Washington township
							and one of the best in central Indiana. His products find a ready sale in Indianapolis
							and his plant and equipment has been pronounced by the state inspectors as one of the
							best in the state.</p>

						<p>Mr. Foudray was married October 20, 1874, to Emma A. Wolfe, the daughter of Michael
							and Hettie (Cable) Wolfe. Mrs. Foudray was born in Stephenson county, Illinois, and is
							one of the oldest of twelve children. They were married while Mr. Foudray was living
							in Illinois. To Mr. and Mrs. Foudray have been born eight children: Esther L., born
							September 1, 1875, and died November 2, 1881; Mrs. Ida M. Hadley, born August 11,
							1876, now living in Minnesota; Mrs. Lottie M. Davis, born November 5, 1878, now living
							in Indianapolis; Mrs. Carrie A. Miller, born July 9, 1881, now resides in Central
							City, Iowa; Mrs. Emma G. Coleman, born November 7, 1884, now living in Indianapolis;
							Mrs. Martha C. Stiles, born March 9, 1887, also a resident of Indianapolis; Edgar E..
							born December 8, 1889, who is still under the parental roof; Mrs. Marietta E.
							McClellan, born April 6, 1893, lives on a farm in Marion county, this state.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Foudray is a Democrat, and takes an active interest in the affairs
							of his party. Religiously, he and his family are faithful and consistent members of
							the Methodist Episcopal church, to which they give their active support.</p>

						<p>Mr. Foudray's life has been an active and busy one and the systematic <pb

						<p>There is no calling, however humble or exalted, but what may be productive of some
							measure of success, if enterprise and industry, coupled with a well directed purpose,
							form the motive force of the person directing the same, and in no case is this fact
							more apparent than in agricultural pursuits. This fact applies to Rollie Garner, the
							immediate subject of this sketch, who, by industry and honesty, is succeeding well in
							his chosen vocation and who, while applying himself primarily to the interests of his
							family, has so ordered his mode of life as to win the esteem of those with whom he
							comes in contact and in every 'avenue of life has proven himself a worthy citizen.</p>

						<p>Rollie Garner is a native of this county, born on April 23, 1870, in Brown township,
							the son of Harrison B. and Frances (Lowder) Garner. Harrison Garner was born in
							Kentucky, in 1828, the son of Solomon and Deborah Garner, who came to this county in
							1832 and settled on the farm near where the subject was born. They entered this land
							from the government, cleared it and established a happy home, where they lived the
							balance of their lives. Frances Lowder, mother of the subject, was a native of North
							Carolina, born in 1832, the daughter of Solomon and Sarah Lowder. In 1836 the Lowder
							family came to this county and settled southwest of Brownsburg. A few years later, her
							father started back to North Carolina on horseback, to settle an estate in which he
							was interested, and was never heard from again. The mystery of his disappearance has
							been unexplained through all these years. When the family first came here, they made
							the journey overland in wagons, and upon settling in this county they entered land
							from the government, and here the widow passed her remaining days and the family grew
							to maturity. After Harrison Garner's marriage he took up his residence on the farm
							which his father obtained in pioneer days, and died there in 1902. His wife followed
							him into the great beyond in 1907. There were nine children in the family, of whom the
							subject was the youngest and he was twenty-eight years old before there occurred a
							death in the family.</p>

						<p>In 1894, on March 4th, the subject was united in marriage with Ella Hufford, who was
							born in Lincoln township, the daughter of Gideon Franklin <pb id="VAC1000-363" n="342"
							/> Hufford and wife. For four years previous to marriage Mr. Garner had farmed his
							father's farm on shares and for two years after his marriage this same arrangement
							held good. He then moved to Washington township, one mile east of Avon, and for four
							years farmed on land given him by his father-in-law. Here he built a house and in
							September, 1900, he moved to his present location, a farm of seventy-five and one-half
							acres two miles west of Brownsburg. To Mr. and Mrs. Garner have been born ten
							children, of whom the eldest, Hazel Marie, born in 1896, passed away on February 8,
							1898. Those remaining are Edna Blanche, Bernice, Irene, Hubert Franklin, Mabel and
							Merle, twins; Harrison Harold, Inez Roberta, Lois Ernestine, Edith Frances and Johanna
							Lee.</p>

						<p>Mr. Garner's fraternal affiliation is with the Knights of Pythias, of which he has
							been a member for some time. He is a man of marked domestic traits, kind and
							considerate to his family, honest and reliable in all his dealings and a thoroughly
							good, helpful neighbor. Because of his genial disposition and genuine worth he is
							liked and respected by all.</p>

							Indiana, the excellent reputation which it bears for prosperity and a high plane of
							life among the sister counties of the state. After all, the history of a community is
							but the reflection of the lives of its leading citizens and it is such stalwart men as
							he whose sketch the biographer now takes up, who are the bone and sinew of the moral,
							material and educational life of this county.</p>

						<p>John A. Gibbs, well known farmer of Lincoln township, Hendricks county, was born in
							Brown township, this county, February 4, 1868, being the son of William Gibbs, born in
							1825, and Elizabeth (Burden) Gibbs, born in 1826. Both parents were natives of
							England, where they remained until after their marriage, when, desiring to try their
							fortunes in the New World, they left their native heath and landed on American soil
							about the year 1850. They came almost directly to Bridgeport, this state, where he
							engaged in gardening and remained there for several years. About the year 1867 they
							came to this country, locating in Brown township, where he farmed the rest of his
							life. William Gibbs departed this life on November 24, 1903, in his <pb
								id="VAC1000-364" n="343"/> eightieth year, and his wife passed away some years
							before him, on April 28, 1897, at the age of seventy-one years. He had aligned himself
							with the Democratic party upon becoming an American citizen and was d faithful member
							of the Methodist church, his wife being identified with the Baptist church.</p>

						<p>John A. Gibbs grew to manhood on the homestead in Brown township, attending the
							district schools of the locality and receiving from his father careful training in the
							secrets of successful husbandry. He has been engaged in farming all his life and
							remained in Brown township until in 1911, when he went to Marion county, this state,
							where he only remained for one year and in the spring of 1912 moved to his present
							home in the southeastern part of Lincoln township, where he has since resided. In 1891
							he was united in marriage with Catherine Hogan, who was born and reared in Brown
							township, being the daughter of Michael and Bridget (Cassidy) Hogan, both of whom were
							natives of Ireland, the former born in county Conemaugh and the latter in county
							Galway. There they grew up and were married before coming to America. This was prior
							to the Civil War and they came immediately to this county upon arriving in the country
							and here lived the remainder of their days. They owned a farm of eighty acres and it
							was here the wife of the subject was born. Michael Hogan passed from this life on June
							24, 1912, his wife having preceded him on November 27, 1911. Both were Catholic.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs have three living children, the eldest being William, who was born
							May 28, 1892. He is a graduate of the Brownsburg high school, attended the State
							Normal School at Terre Haute for two years and is at present finishing his third term
							as teacher in the schools of the western part of Marion county. The second son is
							Clarence, born July 30, 1894, who is his father's assistant in the work of the farm.
							James, who was born March 24, 1897, passed from life June 29, 1913, at the age of
							sixteen years and four months. Monica Catherine, sole daughter of the family, was born
							December 13, 1906. Mrs. Gibbs' parents settled in Brown township when it was nearly
							all timber and swamp. They first directed their efforts to making a small clearing and
							erecting a cabin home and gradually reclaimed the land from the wilderness and swamps
							and improved living conditions as rapidly as they could. By much labor and tireless
							effort, they in time had made of their land a fine farm, one fit to compare with any
							of its size in the county. During the war, Michael Hogan was drafted into the army. In
							view of the fact that he had a wife and five small children, he felt his greater duty
							was to remain beside them and by paying five hundred dollars he secured a substitute.
								<pb id="VAC1000-365" n="344"/> William Gibbs, father of the subject, was twice
							drafted. He had a wife and six children to support and, too, felt that his greater
							duty was to remain home and care for them. Each time he was forced to buy a
							substitute, costing him in all sixteen hundred dollars and so crippling him
							financially that he lost his farm.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs are both communicants of the Roman Catholic church and his
							fraternal affiliations are with the Improved Order of Red Men. His life has been one
							of unceasing industry and perseverance and the systematic and honorable methods which
							he has ever followed have resulted not only in gaining the confidence of those with
							whom he has had dealings, but he has been able to hold friends so gained throughout
							the years. He is a public-spirited man, well and favorably known throughout the
							township for his honesty and uprightness in all his business dealings.</p>

						<p>Enjoying distinctive prestige in a profession which requires of those who adopt it a
							strong mentality and painstaking preparation, together with a natural aptitude for its
							duties and responsibilities, Thad S. Adams is one of the essentially representative
							lawyers of Danville. He has built up a lucrative clientele and a wide reputation as an
							able and successful lawyer and has been connected with some of the most important
							cases in the local courts. As a public-spirited citizen he readily lends his aid to
							every cause having for its object the moral and material advancement of his
							community.</p>

						<p>Thad S. Adams is a native of Hendricks county, born in Union township November 6,
							1853, the son of Solomon and Nancy (Griffith) Adams. Solomon Adams was born in
							Nicholas county, Kentucky, in 1799,.a son of Thomas Adams. He grew up in Kentucky and
							there married Nancy Griffith, who was born in Bath county, Kentucky, in 1811, a
							daughter of Jackson Griffith. While she was a child her parents removed to Switzerland
							county, Indiana, where she grew up. Solomon Adams and wife came to Hendricks county in
							an early day, and he entered government land in Marion township, where they lived for
							some years and then removed to Union township and entered other land and established
							their permanent home. He was a life-long farmer and for many years was assessor of
							Union township. He was originally a Douglas Democrat, but from the opening of the war
							he was a Republican. He and his wife were charter members of the Christian church <pb

							<pb id="VAC1000-367" n="345"/> at Lizton. Solomon Adams died in 1863 and two weeks
							later his wife followed him in death. Of the eleven children born to Solomon and Nancy
							Adams four were in the Union army during our great civil conflict. Gabriel H. Adams
							and Joshua G. Adams were in the Fifty-first Indiana Volunteers. Dr. Thomas J. Adams
							and Hiram F. Adams were members of the Ninth Indiana Cavalry. Hiram was killed in
							Mississippi while in the service. Dr. Thorhas J. was in active service until the close
							of the war, after which he located at North Salem, Hendricks county, and is mentioned
							at length elsewhere in this volume.</p>

						<p>Thad S. Adams was but ten years old when death deprived him of his parents. For the
							following two years he lived with a brother in the state of Illinois, and then came to
							North Salem, Hendricks county, and made his home with another brother, Dr. Thomas J.
							Adams. During these years he attended the public schools and worked by the month on a
							farm until he was seventeen years of age, when he began teaching school, which enabled
							him to attend Northwestern University at Indianapolis. After leaving the university,
							he came to Danville in 1875 and took up the study of law in the office of Adams &amp;
							Cooper, the senior member of this firm being his brother, Joshua G. Adams. While
							reading law he also taught school for two or three years. About 1878 he was admitted
							to the bar on motion of the late Leander M. Campbell, who afterwards became his
							father-in-law. He has been engaged in the practice of law in Danville since that time,
							and during these years has attained to distinctive prominence and success as an able
							advocate and well fortified counselor at law. His course has been such as to retain to
							him at all times the unqualified respect and esteem of his professional brethren, as
							well as the public at large. In 1889 he was appointed by Governor Hovey prosecuting
							attorney, and his fitness for the place was so readily recognized that he was, in
							1890, nominated and elected for the regular term, thus serving in all four years.</p>

						<p>On May 6, 1880, Mr. Adams was married to Effie A. Campbell, a daughter of Leander M.
							and Matilda (Hammond) Campbell. A sketch of Leander M. Campbell appears elsewhere in
							this work. Mrs. Adams was born and reared in Danville, graduating from the Central
							Normal College with the class of 1879. To this marriage were born three children, Ruth
							Adams, L. M. Campbell Adams and Donald Griffith Adams, the two sons residing in New
							York City where they are associated with the National Surety Company. Miss Ruth is at
							home. All three of the children are graduates of Indiana University.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-368" n="346"/>

						<p>Mrs. Adams was called by death May 14, 1913. She was a woman of rare culture, active
							in civic and church affairs, and of wonderful executive ability. She took a broad and
							kindly interest in the community welfare, and she was beloved by everybody in the
							community who had known her since girlhood. She was a life-long member of the
							Christian church and active in many departments of church labor.</p>

						<p>Thad S. Adams is a prominent Mason, being identified with the Scottish Rite and the
							Mystic Shrine. He is a man who has always shown a deep and abiding interest in all
							that concerns the welfare and progress of his native county, and here he maintains a
							secure hold upon popular confidence and esteem.</p>

						<p>Among the younger agriculturists of Hendricks county, Indiana, is the subject of this
							sketch, who, while still a young man, has devoted several years to this particular
							line of effort. The younger generation of farmers have started out upon their life
							work in their chosen vocation with considerable to their advantage over the conditions
							met by their fathers and grandfathers. The advantages for education are so vastly
							superior to those enjoyed by the youth of an earlier generation, and this education
							permits the men of the present day to profit by the vast experience of others in
							scientific research work as related to farm life, whereas those of an earlier time
							were far more handicapped in their chosen work. Then, too, the men of the present day
							find the lands in the Hoosier state at least all prepared for their efforts, whereas
							the farmers of an earlier day found themselves face to face with the gigantic task of
							removing primeval forests, draining swamps, breaking the virgin soil and the thousand
							and one hardships met with and conquered by our pioneers, to whom we of a later day
							owe an unending obligation.</p>

						<p>Cecil Forrest Prebster was born on April 17, 1881, on a farm about two miles west of
							Brownsburg, this county, being land which was originally entered from the government
							by his paternal great-grandfather. He is the son of Anderson and Alice Prebster, and
							is one of a family of two children; the other is a daughter, Bertha Eleanor, who is
							the wife of Fred Smith, a farmer of this county, and the mother of two sons, Leo
							Walter and Milby Alonzo. Anderson Prebster, father of the immediate subject of this
							sketch, was born in Lincoln township, this county, in 1853, the son of <pb
								id="VAC1000-369" n="347"/> Emanuel and Mary (Milby) Hollett-Prebster. Emanuel
							Prebster was born in southern Ohio, the son of John Adam and Christina (Bartlett)
							Prebster, and John Adam Prebster was a native of Germany, who in early days, emigrated
							to this country, settling in New York state, where he met and married Christina
							Bartlett, also a native of Germany. They remained for a short time in New York, later
							coming to southern Ohio,where their son, Emanuel, was born, and there remained until
							he was about twenty-one years of age. Emanuel was the oldest of four sons, the others
							being Reuben, Frederick and Christian, and these, together with the father, came to
							this county about the year 1834, the father having entered a tract of land here the
							year previous. Frederick married Eliza Surber and lived in Lincoln township, where for
							many years he was engaged in farming. Reuben and Christian never married and spent
							their lives west of Brownsburg on land which they had entered from the government. In
							1850 Emanuel Presbter was united in marriage with Mrs. Mary (Milby) Hollett, widow of
							Mark Hollett, deceased. She was born in North Carolina and was left an orphan through
							the death of her mother while she was still small, and the loss of her father at sea.
							When about nine years old she was brought to this state by an aunt, who settled near
							Richmond. At the age of sixteen Mary Milby was united in marriage with Mark Hollett
							and they made their home near Richmond. During the forties they came to this county,
							where they made their home near Brownsburg, and they later moved to Iowa, where Mr.
							Hollett died a victim of cholera. His death left his young widow and family of five
							children among strangers, and Mr. Baxter, stepfather of Mark Hollett, made the long
							journey overland in a covered wagon to Iowa, bringing the widow and children back to
							this vicinity. Here, sometime later, she was united in marriage with Emanuel Prebster
							and they made their home west of Brownsburg on land which had been entered from the
							government by his father, of which he owned one hundred and fifty acres. His death
							occurred in January, 1899, and she died in 1907. At their death they left three
							children, Eliza Christina, Anderson and Everson. Eliza C. became the wife of John
							Henderson and lived on the home farm which she inherited from her father. She passed
							from this life February 6, 1913. Everson Prebster also lives on the home farm where
							his father died. He married Ella Harding and they have two children, Beulah and
							Lessie.</p>

						<p>Anderson Prebster remained under the parental roof until the time of his marriage in
							1880 to Alice Clark, who was born in Brown county, this state, the daughter of
							Franklin and Mary (Baker) Clark, the former of whom was born in Kentucky, where he
							grew to years of maturity. He then came <pb id="VAC1000-370" n="348"/> to this state,
							where he met and married Mary Baker, who was born not far from Indianapolis, daughter
							of Henry and Elizabeth (Caylor) Baker. Henry Baker was a native of Maryland and
							Elizabeth Caylor was born in Ohio. Franklin Clark, father of Alice (Clark) Prebster,
							was a carpenter all his life and followed his trade most of his active years in
							Indianapolis. In 1875 he moved to Brownsburg, where he spent his declining years
							quietly, and there his death occurred in 1903. For about four years during the sixties
							he had resided in Tipton, this state, and there his wife died in 1868. Immediately
							after his marriage, Anderson Prebster established his home in the log house in which
							he was born and there remained for thirteen years, when he moved to another house he
							had built on the same farm, where he remained until 1906, when he built at the edge of
							Brownsburg, where he still resides. In addition to this home, he owns ninety acres of
							farm lands, on which his children live, having disposed of part of the acreage of
							which he was once possessed.</p>

						<p>Cecil Forrest Prebster, son of Anderson Prebster and the immediate subject of this
							sketch, attended the district schools of the township when a boy, later graduating
							from Brownsburg high school. This was in 1901, and since that time he has been engaged
							in farming the land on which he was born. On March 25, 1906, he was united in marriage
							with Bertha Thompson, daughter of Jesse and Mary (Mitchell) Thompson, and born in
							Pittsboro, where she passed her girlhood with the exception of six months spent at
							North Salem. She was graduated from the Pittsboro high school in 1904. Jesse Thompson,
							father of Mrs. Prebster, was born in Madison county, Kentucky, where his mother died
							when he was still a small boy. His father remarried and Jesse remained with him until
							he grew to manhood, when he came to this state and county and here met and married
							Mary Mitchell. She was born in Starke county, North Carolina, a daughter of William
							and Rachel Mitchell, who came to this county when she was but three or four years old.
							They located near Raintown. After Jesse Thompson was married he made his home in
							Pittsboro, where he has followed various pursuits, being engineer of the mill at that
							place, also engaged in farming, etc. Mr. and Mrs. Cecil F. Prebster have a family of
							three children, Maurice Thompson, Marian Alice and Dorothy Aileen, and both are
							members of the Christian church, with which also both parents are identified. The
							Prebster family is one of the oldest and best families of the county and in the

						<p>Not all men are born to be leaders of their kind or to take a prominent part in any
							phase of life. It is the exceptional few who rise above their fellows and come to be
							known far or near as belonging to this class. Such men have the leading parts in the
							scheme of life and stand as the representatives of the great masses of honest,
							industrious and patriotic citizens who are the real stamina of national life. The
							foremost figures in our country today would lose their significance were there not
							back of them in almost countless numbers these sober, honest, quiet lives which are
							the bone and sinew of a, prosperous country. To this latter class of dutiful and
							patriotic citizens the subject of this sketch belongs.</p>

						<p>Calvin W. Warren, residing two miles northwest of Brownsburg, was born October 12,
							1842, at Knoxville, Tennessee, the son of William and Lydia (McCaslin) Warren, both of
							whom were born and reared in Guilford county, North Carolina. William Warren was a son
							of Henry Warren and Lydia McCaslin was the daughter of John McCaslin. The subject's
							parents were married in their native state before they left it and took up their
							residence in Knox county, Tennessee, where they remained until 1850. By that time they
							had a family of ten children, eight of whom they brought with them to this state,
							making the trip in a wagon. Two of the older children had made the trip the year
							before on foot the entire distance. When first coming to this state, they located in
							Brown township, Hendricks county, but later moved near Bridgeport, in Marion county,
							and there the parents passed the remainder of their lives, he dying in Marion county
							and she in Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>Calvin W. Warren grew to manhood on the home farm in this county, where he remained
							until in 1863, when, in response to the promptings of patriotism, he enlisted for
							service in the Seventeenth Indiana Battery, Light Artillery, where he remained for
							three years, during which time he saw much active service. He was stationed around the
							upper Potomac river, around Harper's Ferry and Baltimore and was in the battles of
							Winchester, Cedar Creek and Fisher's Hill. During the earlier part of the day's
							engagement at Cedar Creek, the subject and his companions were thankful to be able to
							effect a retreat from the enemy, but rallied their forces and in the afternoon the
							tables were turned and they routed the enemy to a finish. He was especially fortunate
							during his service in that he came through so many close places without even a wound.
							He was mustered out of service on July 8, <pb id="VAC1000-372" n="350"/> 1865, and
							immediately returned to this county and has been engaged in farm work near Brownsburg
							ever since.</p>

						<p>Mr. Warren has never married and makes his home with his brother William H., west of
							Brownsburg. Politically, Mr. Warren has always been identified with the Republican
							party, to which he has given his loyal support throughout the years. He is also a
							member of the Grand Army of the Republic. Mr. Warren has lived a quiet, retired life
							and has ever so conducted himself as to win the trust and confidence of those with
							whom he came in contact. He is known as a man of excellent character, sober and

						<p>Among the various peoples of the earth that go to make up the cosmopolitan population
							of these United states of ours, none have contributed to our national life more
							excellent habits and traits than those who came originally from Germany. The
							descendants of those people are distinguished for their thrift and honesty, and these
							two qualities in the inhabitants of any country will in the end alone make that
							country great. These two attributes, together with the liberal quantity of sound sense
							which is also a characteristic of the German people, will enrich any land and place it
							among the leading nations of the world. Descended from this excellent people is the
							immediate subject of this brief sketch.</p>

						<p>Gideon F. Hufford is a native of this county, born on May 13, 1836, in Washington
							township, the son of Joel and Eliza Jane (Miller) Hufford. Joel Hufford was born in
							1808 at Carlisle, Nicholas county, Kentucky, and was descended from Christian Hufford,
							who emigrated to this country from Schwartzenau, Germany. Louisa Jane Miller was born
							on December 8, 1813, in Kentucky, and was united in marriage with Joel Hufford August
							31, 1830. About two years later they came to Indiana, locating at once in Hendricks
							county. They made the trip from their native state in a one-horse wagon, which
							contained all their worldly possessions. They had belonged to families of prominence
							in Kentucky and had always been accustomed to having their work done by slaves, but
							they readily adjusted themselves to conditions in the state of their adoption, entered
							a tract of eighty acres from the government, which they proceeded to clear and convert
							into a comfortable and <pb id="VAC1000-373" n="331"/> happy home for themselves and
							family. They were excellent people and stood high in public estimation.</p>

						<p>On February 22, 1862, the subject was united in marriage with Mary Jane Stout, who
							was born on May 4, 1846, in the western part of Marion county, near Clermont, being a
							daughter of David and Joanna (Herd) Stout. David Stout and wife were both natives of
							the state of Ohio, were married there and soon went to Illinois. They remained there
							but a short time, however, when, being dissatisfied, they came back to Indiana and
							settled in Marion county, where they lived the rest of their lives. After marriage,
							Gideon F. Hufford purchased a farm about a mile and a half south of Brownsburg, this
							county, and in time became the owner of three hundred and forty acres of excellent
							land, part of it at Tilden and another tract on the Rockville road in Washington
							township. In 1895 he removed from the farm south of Brownsburg and took up his
							residence on his Tilden farm and there passed the remainder of his life, his death
							occurring January 28, 1903. He was a faithful member of the Baptist church and lived a
							life in strict conformity with the teachings of that faith.</p>

						<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Hufford were born nine children: George F., Delilah F., Carrie, Joel
							V., Theodore N., Ella, Julia, Edgar and John T. In August, 1892, George mysteriously
							disappeared and has never since been heard from. Delilah died in infancy. Carrie is
							the wife of Theodore P. Garner and lives in Brown township. Joel married Alice Hughes
							and lives in Lincoln township. Theodore died in infancy. Ella is the wife of Rolla
							Garner and resides in Lincoln township, and Julia is the wife of Edgar Beaman and
							lives in Middle township. Edgar married Effie M. Cummings on March 7, 1907, and lives
							at Tilden. They have two children, Marshall and Walter. Edgar lives on the homestead
							and manages it for his mother, who has resided there ever since the death of the
							subject. John T., the youngest son, married Tillie C. Nash in October, 1905, and they
							live one mile south of Brownsburg on the Plainfield road.</p>

						<p>A review of the life of the honored subject of this memoir is of necessity brief and

							fully into the interesting details of the career of the late Gideon F. Hufford,

						<p>The two most strongly marked characteristics of both the East and the West are
							combined in the residents of the section of county of which this volume treats. The
							enthusiastic enterprise which overleaps all obstacles and makes possible almost any
							undertaking in the comparatively new and vigorous Western states is here tempered by
							the stable and more careful policy that we have borrowed from our Eastern neighbors,
							and the combination is one of peculiar force and power. It has been the means of
							placing this section of the country on a par with the older East, at the same time
							producing a reliability and certainty in business affairs which is frequently lacking
							in the West. This happy combination of characteristics is possessed by the subject of
							this sketch. Born, reared and educated in Pennsylvania, he came to Indiana as a young
							man and Hendricks county may count itself fortunate in having him as one of its
							citizens. He came first to this county as a teacher in our schools, and his whole
							record since he has been here has been a most worthy one. From the school room he went
							into the mercantile business, and from the mercantile business he was called by his
							party to take the office of county treasurer. George Macomber is a man whom Hendricks
							county delights to honor.</p>

						<p>George Macomber, now serving his second term as treasurer of Hendricks county,
							Indiana, was born December 2, 1869, in York county, Pennsylvania. George Macomber
							familiarized himself with the life of a farmer, during his boyhood and youth, by
							working at it on his father's farm. He is the son of W. Z. and Harriett (Messersmith)
							Macomber, and is of good American ancestry. His paternal great-grandfather, Doctor
							Zenas Macomber, was a Revolutionary hero of prominence, was one of General
							Washington's horse guards, and, daring all for freedom, was carried from the
							battle-field of Paoli with nineteen wounds.</p>

						<p>From the common schools George Macomber went to high school, where he graduated.
							Entering normal college, he pursued the prescribed course to graduation and then took
							a special course in the State College of Pennsylvania. After teaching in the country
							schools, he came to Indiana about 1897, as teacher in the Indiana Boys' School at
							Plainfield in Hendricks county, and remained with his duties in that institution until
							he resigned to assume the superintendency of a similar institution in Missouri. He
							returned to Hendricks county in 1906, and engaged in the mercantile business by
							opening a hardware store in Plainfield, in the community where <pb id="VAC1000-375"

							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-376" n="353"/> he was well known and respected as a man who had made a
							success of what he tried to do. That business he continued to have personal charge of
							until he left it in a manager's hands in 1912 to take charge of the office of
							treasurer of Hendricks county, to which he had been elected. Without opposition, his
							party nominated him in their county convention to succeed himself, because he had
							shown high-grade ability, fidelity to duty as a servant of the people, and because of
							his manly and accommodating method of waiting upon those who have business with him as
							a county official.</p>

						<p>On November 2, 1899, Mr. Macomber married Mattie E. York, daughter of P. M. and
							Elizabeth (Hornaday) York, who were early residents of Hendricks county. Mr. and Mrs.
							Macomber hold their membership with the Methodist church at Plainfield, of which
							church he has been treasurer. He has had the advantages of fraternal organizations,
							and has been honored by his brothers in those orders with offices of trust and
							responsibility. He is past chancellor of the Knights of Pythias lodge at Plainfield;
							past master of the Masonic lodge; a member of the chapter and council of the York rite
							of the Masonic order at Danville; thirty-second-degree Mason of the Indiana
							Consistory, Scottish Rite, and the Mystic Shrine.</p>

						<p>Mr. Macomber's broad education and the careful method that is natural to him equips
							him in an unusual degree to do the public good service. The state board of accountants
							have highly commended the accuracy and evident methodic care shown by his official
							books.</p>

						<p>Mr. Macomber is popular as a gentleman of education and of progressive make-up, and
							has the public respect and admiration for the excellent manner in which he has
							demeaned himself as a public official, in which capacity he has been watchful,
							faithful to the county's best interests and attentive to the opportunity to bestow
							favor upon all who have had business with him.</p>

							services have been requisitioned in thirty-two states of the Union and who has
							conferred honor and dignity upon the locality where he resides in Lincoln township,
							Hendricks county, Indiana. Charles A. Cummings, the well-known builder of bridges, is
							also one of the leading farmers <pb id="VAC1000-377" n="354"/> of this county, owning
							an excellent farm of one hundred and twenty acres in the township mentioned above,
							where he engages in general farming, assisted by one of his sons. Mr. Cummings has
							attained to his enviable position through unflagging perseverance and boundless
							enterprise and among other characteristics which have contributed largely to his
							success is that rare ability to use men so as to subserve his purpose and at the same
							time assist them.</p>

						<p>Charles A. Cummings was born on April 24, 1859, in Botetourt county, Virginia, the
							son of William and Maria (Boose) Cummings, the former of whom was born in Bath county,
							Virginia, and, while it is not definitely known, it is believed that his parents were
							both natives of Scotland. Maria Boose, mother of the subject, was born in Botetourt
							county, Virginia, the daughter of natives of Germany who had first settled in
							Pennsylvania and from there went into Virginia, where they lived out the remainder of
							their lives. William and Maria Cummings lived their lives in Virginia, where they were
							engaged in farming. Their son Charles, the subject, remained with them until about
							twenty-one years old and then, in 1880, went to Springfield, Ohio, where he had a
							brother. He engaged in agricultural work for a short time, and then his brother,
							Douglass B. L. Cummings, who was engaged in the steel bridge construction business,
							took young Charles A. into partnership and so began his career in that line of work in
							which he has proved so proficient. They went to Peoria, Illinois, where they continued
							in their chosen business and after about two years went to Indianapolis. This was in
							the spring of 1883. The year previous, while in Peoria, the subject had been united in
							marriage with Emma Sweat, a native of that city and the daughter of James B. and
							Elizabeth (Hines) Sweat. The father was a native of Maine and the mother had been born
							in Ohio. After their marriage they had gone to Peoria county, Illinois, and engaged in
							farming, where they lived the remainder of their lives. At the outbreak of the Civil
							War, Mr. Sweat enlisted for service, and while at the front took sick and died. His
							widow, mother of Mrs. Cummings, passed away at her home in Illinois in 1908. After
							coming with their wives to Indianapolis, the Cummings brothers associated themselves
							with W. B. Bassett, C. L. Rose and W. W. Winslow, forming what was known as the
							Indianapolis Bridge Company. For about two years they made combination iron and wooden
							bridges and in about two years built a factory at the Bee Line tracks near East
							Michigan street. Here for about ten years they engaged in the manufacture of steel and
							combination bridges and then turned their attention to steel bridges exclusively, Mr.
							Cummings acting as superintendent of the plant most of the time. They <pb
								id="VAC1000-378" n="355"/> also took contracts for bridges, which they made and
							erected. About the year 1893 their company was succeeded by the Indiana Bridge Company
							and then the subject and his old associates separated, each carrying on bridge
							contracting independently of the others. Mr. Cummings took the contract for the
							erection of the Kentucky avenue bridge over White river in the city of Indianapolis.
							This was in 1894, during the time Coxey and his "army" made their famous march. In
							accepting the contract for the erection of the bridge, Mr. Cummings had agreed to use
							local workmen as much as possible and the unemployed came to him in such numbers and
							were so wild for work that the police department was called upon to disperse the
							crowd. There were times when there would be fully two thousand men looking for
							employment in the construction of the bridge and at that time laborers were paid only
							sixty cents a day. Now the cheapest labor he employs costs thirty cents per hour and
							some of his laborers make as much as four dollars per day. The year previous to the
							construction of the Kentucky avenue bridge, Mr. Cummings and his brother took the
							contract for the erection of the bridge over the Ohio at Wheeling, West Virginia, and
							resting on the island midstream. For awhile Mr. Cummings was associated with David
							Braden on several bridge contracts. It was David Braden after whom the subject's
							youngest son was named.</p>

						<p>It was in the year 1897 that Mr. Cummings came to this county and purchased land,
							setting himself up as a farmer. He first purchased one hundred and twenty acres in the
							southwestern part of Lincoln township and at one time owned as much as two hundred
							acres. However, he has disposed of different tracts until he now owns the same amount
							with which he first started. He still continues the bridge business and in addition
							has his farm home, where the family have been reared. There are four children, Delmar,
							Effie, Wands and Braden. Delmar was born in 1883 and married Ethel Frisbie. He lives
							on a farm near his father, and has two children, Clayton and Gertrude. Delmar was
							associated with his father in the bridge business until about two years ago when he
							became superintendent of erection for the Central States Bridge Company of
							Indianapolis. Effie, who was born in 1886, is the wife of Edgar Hufford and has two
							children, Marshall and Walter. Wands, born in 1888, married Blanche Kennedy and lives
							near his father. They are the parents of two children, Russel and Lloyd. He is engaged
							in farming. Braden, the youngest of the family, was born in 1894 and remains at home
							as the assistant of his father, both in conducting the farm and in carrying on the
							work of bridge erection.</p>

						<p>Mr. Cummings' fraternal affiliation is with the Independent Order of <pb
								id="VAC1000-379" n="356"/> Odd Fellows, of which he has been a member since 1888,
							and both he and his wife are members of the White Lick Presbyterian church. The family
							is among the leading ones of the township, broad-minded, of advanced ideas and
							delightful to meet. Mr. Cummings' business has taken him all over the United States
							and he thoroughly enjoys travel, but the trip he considers most enjoyable of all was
							one it was his privilege to take in 1912. He had been engaged in bridge work in
							Georgia and the Carolinas and Mrs. Cummings had been with him a great deal of the
							time. In the fall of that year they started to drive home in a buggy, leaving King's
							Mountain in North Carolina. They arrived at Danville, this county, seventeen and
							one-half days after, having crossed eight mountains and encountering some roads so
							rough it was necessary to hold the horse up. Roads were often only wide enough for one
							vehicle and passing would have been impossible. Mr. Cummings is a man of unusual
							strength of character and ability, one who impresses his individuality upon the
							locality honored by his residence. By a life of consistent action and thought, he has
							earned the high standing which he now enjoys and it is a pleasure to give him
							representation in a work of the scope of the one at hand.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN U. RICE.</hi></head>

						<p>The sketch which now comes before the reader is a brief review of the career of John
							U. Rice, one of the older residents of the county and a man of sterling worth, who
							through long years of residence here has so conducted his affairs of life as to win
							the honor of all. His name has been inseparably connected with the general growth of
							Hendricks county, of which he is a native and where, in fact, he has spent the major
							portion of his life. While primarily attending to his own varied interests, his life
							has been largely devoted to his fellow men, having been untiring in his efforts to
							inspire a proper respect for law and order and ready at all times to uplift humanity
							along civic and social lines.</p>

						<p>John U. Rice was born on October 25, 1839, about a half mile north of Brownsburg, the
							son of Lewis and Sophia (Harris) Rice, both of whom were natives of the state of
							Kentucky, coming from either Scott or Bourbon county, the former having been born
							January 8, 1806, and the latter on June 27, 1811, being the daughter of William and
							Nancy (Barrett) Harris. When young, she was brought to this state by her parents, who
							came direct to Hendricks county and located near Brownsburg. Lewis Rice came to this
							state <pb id="VAC1000-380" n="357"/> when twenty-one years old, locating north of
							Brownsburg, and there he met and married Sophia Harris. He was a farmer in this county
							the remainder of his life and died here on March 25, 1865, at the age of fifty-two
							years. His wife lived several years after he died, passing away on April 11, 1880, at
							the age of sixty-four years.</p>

						<p>The subject was one of a family of nine children, all of whom grew to maturity. He
							passed his boyhood on the paternal homestead north of Brownsburg, attending the early
							subscription schools of the day, and in early life was apprenticed to the carpenter
							trade. He worked at this for some time and in wagon shops in and near Brownsburg, and
							on October 21, 1864, he was united in marriage with Mahala J. Montgomery, who was born
							in this county on November 2, 1840, being the daughter of Samuel and Mary (Fox)
							Montgomery, the former a native-born Hoosier and the latter coming here from Virginia.
							Immediately after marriage, Mr. Rice went to Illinois where he spent three years at
							his trade and farming part of the time. He then returned to this county and purchased
							a portion of the old homestead and there resided until 1870. At that time he purchased
							a forty-acre tract in the southeastern part of Lincoln township and has lived there
							since. Mrs. Rice passed from this life on August 12, 1909. For years she had been a
							faithful member of the Christian church and was a woman highly esteemed by those who
							knew her. Mr. Rice has added to his original possessions from time to time, until he
							now owns one hundred acres of as excellent land as the county can boast.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Rice were the parents of two children, Etta and Everett Harland. Etta is
							the wife of George Salmon and resides in Indianapolis. Mr. Salmon is a traveling
							salesman. They have one daughter, Mary, who is the wife of Earl Hubert Duling, who was
							born on March 5, 1884, in Grant county, this state, the son of John and Lydia Duling.
							He now resides on the Rice homestead in Lincoln township and is the father of two
							sons, Byron Montgomery and Meredith Earl. Everett Harland Rice lives in Daviess
							county, this state, where he is engaged in farming. His wife was Laura Pike and they
							are the parents of three children, John Walker, Mamie Belle and Clara, all of whom are
							married. John Walter married May Stiles and they live in Los Angeles, California.
							Mamie Belle married Chester Cohee and lives at Elizabethtown, this state. She is the
							mother of a little son, Randall. Clara married Ernest Boyer and lives near Columbus,
							Indiana.</p>

						<p>Mr. Rice holds his religious membership with the Christian church in Brownsburg, of
							which his wife also was a member, and he is one of the most faithful members of that
							society. Personally, Mr. Rice is a man of clean <pb id="VAC1000-381" n="358"/>
							character and has ever exerted a healthful influence in the community, giving his
							support to every movement which promises to advance the welfare of the locality in any
							way. Because of his genuine worth he enjoys the sincere respect of all who know him
							and is eminently entitled to representation in a work of the character of the one in
							hand.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">PATRICK M. LONG.</hi></head>

						<p>It is generally considered by those in the habit of superficial thinking that the
							history of so-called great men only is worthy of preservation and that little merit
							exists among the masses to call forth the praises of the historian or the cheers and
							appreciation of mankind. A greater mistake was never made. No man is great in all
							things and very few are great in many things. Many by a lucky stroke achieve lasting
							fame who before that had no reputation beyond the limits of their neighborhoods. It is
							not a history of the lucky stroke which benefits humanity most, but the long study and
							effort which make the lucky stroke possible. It is the preliminary work, the method,
							that serves as a guide for the success of others. Among those in this county who have
							achieved success along steady lines of action is the subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>Patrick M. Long, one of the foremost agriculturists of Brown township, Hendricks
							county, Indiana, is a native of the Emerald Isle, born in county Galway on March 26,
							1856, being the son of Patrick and Bridget (Sheridan) Long, both of whom were natives
							of the same county. They emigrated to America when the subject of this sketch was but
							eight weeks old, there being one child older. The voyage was a long and tedious
							affair, it being seventeen weeks from the time they left Europe until a landing in New
							York harbor was effected. The little family remained in New York until in 1864, when
							they went to Canada, where the father secured employment in the construction of a
							railroad. They remained there but one year and then came direct to Indiana, locating
							in Marion county, where Patrick, senior, secured work on farms by the month. For three
							or four years he followed this line of activity, when he came to Hendricks county and
							leased a farm in the eastern part of Brown township, where the family resided about
							twenty-seven years. In the beginning he was to clear the land up and raise whatever
							crops he could. At the end of that time, he arranged to rent the farm and this
							contract was in force until 1890, the family residing thereon until in 1886, <pb
								id="VAC1000-382" n="359"/> when they moved to the farm where the subject now lives
							in the western portion of Brown township. Patrick Long, senior, had purchased this
							farm in 1879. It consisted of some eighty acres and this he farmed in connection with
							the rented land, which gave him in all about one hundred and eighty acres of excellent
							farming lands. He was a man deserving of the highest honor and esteem, for by his own
							unaided efforts he attained to a position of prominence and while primarily seeking
							the interests of himself and his immediate family, he so ordered his life as to win
							the esteem and respect of all who knew him. His death occurred on November 28, 1903,
							his wife having preceded him some years. She died March 28, 1881.</p>

						<p>Patrick M. Long was one of a family of seven children and lived in the old home until
							the time of his marriage, when he brought his bride to the paternal roof, where they
							have since made their home. Upon the death of his father, he came into possession of
							the homestead. Shortly before his father's death, the subject of this sketch purchased
							twenty acres adjoining the home place, which gives him a tract of one hundred acres.
							This farm is considered about the best drained land in the county and Mr. Long
							conducts his business along modern scientific methods. There is an air of prosperity
							and happiness all about the place and especially about the comfortable home, which is
							beautifully situated in a large grove of maples.</p>

						<p>On January 31, 1894, Patrick M. Long was united in marriage to Kate Tarpey, a
							daughter of James and Nancy (Dugan) Tarpey, both of whom were natives of county
							Galway, Ireland, and came to this country in 1862. They came direct to Hendricks
							county, Indiana, locating in the town of Plainfield, where they lived for some time.
							They then purchased land in Boone county, where they made their home until 1873, when
							they returned to Hendricks county, purchasing a farm about one mile south of where the
							subject of this sketch resides. It was on that farm that Mrs. Tarpey breathed her last
							on May 30, 1905, and in the following year Mr. Tarpey went to make his home with his
							daughter, wife of the subject of this sketch, and in their home his death occurred on
							November 20, 1913. To Mr. and Mrs. Long have been born six children, four of whom
							survive, namely: Delia, Thresa, Patrick Francis and James, all of whom are still at
							home.</p>

						<p>Mr. Long is a stanch supporter of the Democratic party, taking active interest in the
							affairs of same. For one term he served as township trustee, and at the time he
							assumed the office there was a large indebtedness owed by the township. When his term
							had ended, he had paid off and turned over to his successor in cash enough to reduce
							the indebtedness about one-half without <pb id="VAC1000-383" n="360"/> having
							increased the tax levy. This, Mr. Long feels, was a pretty good showing and he has
							just cause for that opinion. He also served as road supervisor for two years and was
							on the township advisory board for two years and in the discharge of the duties of
							these various offices he met with almost universal approbation. Mr. Long and his
							family are communicants of the Roman Catholic church, living strictly in accordance
							with the tenets of that faith. The family is highly respected and regarded as one of
							the leading families of the community, their hospitality being of that genuine order
							which welcomes friend and stranger alike. Mr. Long is a man of good business ability,
							strict integrity and fine personal address and because of his genuine worth and high
							character he has long enjoyed a splendid reputation in the community where he lives.
							He gives his support to all movements for the advancement of his fellow citizens and
							is numbered among the representative men of Brown township.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN P. MORAN.</hi></head>

						<p>The people who constitute the bone and sinew of this country are not those who are
							unstable and unsettled, who fly from this occupation to that, who do not know how to
							vote until they are told, and who take no active and intelligent interest in affairs
							affecting their schools, churches and property. The backbone of this country is made
							up of those families who have made their homes; who are alive to the best interests of
							the community in which they reside; who are so honest that it is no trouble for their
							neighbors to know it, and who attend to their own business and are too busy to attend
							to that of others; who work on steadily from day to day, taking the sunshine with the
							storm, and who rear a fine family to a comfortable home and an honest life. Such
							people are always welcome in any country, and in any community. They are wealth
							producers and this country is blessed with many of them, among whom is the gentleman
							whose name appears at the head of this sketch.</p>

						<p>John P. Moran, one of the county commissioners of Hendricks county, Indiana, was born
							June 16, 1861, in Marion county, Indiana, the son of Peter and Bridget (Mullin) Moran,
							both natives of Ireland. Peter Moran was born in county Waterford, Ireland, and his
							wife in Galway. From their native land they went to England before their marriage and
							in that country they were married. After the birth of two children, they came to
							America <pb id="VAC1000-384" n="[]"/>
							<figure>
								<p rend="center">JOHN P. MORAN</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-385" n="361"/> and settled in Marion county, Indiana, two miles north
							of Clermont. Here Peter Moran was living at the time of the Civil War, and, although
							he had been in the country only a short time, yet he was willing to sacrifice his life
							for his adopted country. Accordingly he enlisted on August 18, 1862, in Company F,
							Seventieth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and served until he was captured and
							placed in Libby prison. He was one of the few men who made that memorable escape
							through the tunnel which was dug by the prisoners. However, he was not as fortunate as
							some of them, for he was recaptured and again thrown into the prison, where he shortly
							afterwards died. Peter Moran and his wife were the parents of four children, Mary and
							Ellen, who were born in England, and Hannah and John, who were born in this
							country.</p>

						<p>John P. Moran was only about one year old when his father enlisted for service in the
							Union army and consequently never remembered seeing him. When he was four years of age
							his mother moved to Hendricks county, this state, and here he received his education.
							He was a remarkably bright youth and quickly forged his way to the front. While still
							a young man, he was given employment at the Boys' School at Plainfield as night
							watchman. He was promoted several times, was an officer four years and for twelve
							years was assistant superintendent of that school under T. J. Charlton. At the
							expiration of that time he went to Morganza, Pennsylvania, where he served under J. A.
							Quay for two years and eight months as first officer of the Boys' Reform School at
							that place. He then came back to Hendricks county, this state, and settled on a farm
							in Center township, where he is still living. He owns a fine farm of three hundred and
							twenty acres, which is thoroughly modern in every respect.</p>

						<p>Mr. Moran was married December 2, 1896, to Eliza Nevells, the daughter of Thomas and
							Elizabeth (Tinder) Nevells, and to this marriage has been born one son, John, who is
							still residing with his parents.</p>

						<p>Mr. Moran has been a life-long Democrat and has always taken an active part in
							politics. He is a man of education and has been frequently consulted by the leaders of
							his party in the county, his advice being usually followed. In 1912 his party placed
							him in nomination for the office of county commissioner and he was elected by a large
							majority, bringing to bear in this important office those excellent qualities which
							made him a success in his school work.</p>

						<p>Mr. Moran and his son are earnest and devoted adherents of the Catholic church and
							give to it their zealous support at all times. Mrs. Moran <pb id="VAC1000-386" n="362"
							/> is a member of the Christian church. Earnest purpose and private energy, combined
							with excellent judgment and every-day common sense, have made Mr. Moran a man of
							influence in his township and county. Starting in life with practically nothing but
							his keen mind' and willing hands, he has won a place where he is Universally regarded
							as one of the representative men of his county. He has been an active participant in
							every measure which he felt would benefit his community and has contributed in no
							small way to the growth of his township and county and to the advancement of its best

						<head><hi rend="center">JOSEPH H. AIRHART.</hi></head>

						<p>One of the most enterprising of our younger generation of farmers in Johnson county,
							who has believed from the outset of his career that the "wisdom of yesterday is
							sometimes the folly of today," and that while the methods of our grandfathers in
							tilling the soil were all right in their day, yet in the twentieth century we are
							compelled to adopt new methods and farm along different lines, in view of the fact
							that conditions of climate, soil, grains, etc., have changed since the days of the
							pioneers. He has been a close observer of modern methods and is a student at all times
							of whatever pertains to his chosen life work and he has, therefore, met with
							encouraging success all along the line. Judging from his past record, he will
							undoubtedly achieve much in the future years and take his place among the leading
							agriculturists of a community noted for its fine farms and adroit husbandmen.</p>

						<p>Joseph H. Airhart, proprietor of a fine farm of one hundred and twenty acres,
							considered one of the best improved farms in the county, located in the northwestern
							portion of Brown township, Hendricks county, Indiana, was born in Boone county, this
							state, on September 6, 1876. He is a son of Jacob and Mary E. (Gill) Airhart. Jacob
							was one of a family of six children and was brought by his parents from their native
							state of Virginia while he was still quite young. His father, Peter Airhart, was a son
							of a native of Holland who had emigrated to America in the early days and settled in
							Virginia. Upon coming to Indiana, Peter Airhart settled in Boone county, where he
							entered land from the government and lived thereon the rest of his life, and on that
							same land the subject of this sketch first saw the light of day. Mary E. Gill, mother
							of the subject, was one of a family of seven children born to Washington and Fanny
							(Gibson) Gill, and was brought to the state of Indiana from their old home in Kentucky
							while still quite a <pb id="VAC1000-387" n="363"/> small child. Her father entered
							land from the government in Boone county, near Advance, and there passed the remainder
							of his life. Jacob Airhart was twice married, his first wife being a Miss Bowman, to
							whom he was married in the early fifties. She lived for about ten years thereafter,
							leaving two children at the time of her death. He continued to live on the old home
							place after his second marriage, some time in the sixties, to Mary E. Gill, and there
							his death occurred in 1887. By his second wife he had a family of five children, of
							which the subject of this sketch is one.</p>

						<p>Joseph H. Airhart was but eleven years old at the time of his father's death and
							three years later his mother also died. From that time on until he was twenty-one
							years of age, he was practically homeless, making his home with whomsoever he could
							secure work. In 1897 he was united in marriage with Mary E. LaFollette, a cousin of
							Senator LaFollette of Wisconsin. She was a daughter of Milton and Elizabeth J.
							(Grider) LaFollette, originally from Putnam county, this state. Her father died when
							she was four years old and the mother continued to keep up the home near Shannondale,
							where the present Mrs. Airhart lived until the time of her marriage to the subject. In
							1898 Mr. Airhart purchased a tract of eighty acres near Lebanon, in Boone county, on
							which he resided for three years. He then came to Hendricks county and purchased his
							present farm of one hundred and twenty acres in Brown township, which is considered
							one of the best-cared-for farms in the county, fully attesting what up-to-date
							scientific methods in agriculture can accomplish when coupled with energy and untiring
							effort. The vocation of the farmer is coming more and more to be regarded as the ideal
							life, that in which a man has opportunity to display ability of the highest order and
							in which vocation he is more independent than in any other. Time was when, after a
							season of arduous labor, the farmer was forced to take for his produce whatever he
							could get; now he makes prices himself and so rules the markets of the world.</p>

						<p>Mr. Airhart's political preferences are with the Democratic party, of which he has
							been a stanch supporter for many years. Fraternally, he is a member of the Independent
							Order of Odd Fellows, Lodge No. 839, and the religious membership of himself and wife
							is with the Christian church, of which he is an earnest member. Mr. and Mrs. Airhart
							have one child, Fern Evadna, who remains at home. They are considered among the
							leading citizens of their community, their home extending genuine hospitality to
							friend and stranger alike. Personally, Mr. Airhart is friendly, a good mixer, and wins
							and retains friends without effort, for he is at all times a gentleman, <pb
								id="VAC1000-388" n="364"/> obliging, unassuming and honest to the letter in his
							dealings with his fellow men. His life has been one of unceasing industry and
							perseverance and the notably systematic and honorable methods he has followed have won
							for him the unbounded confidence and regard of all who have formed his
							acquaintance.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN A. ADAMS.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the leading citizens of Brownsburg, Hendricks county, Indiana, none stand in
							better repute than John A. Adams, the well-known mill and elevator man, who, by reason
							of his business qualifications, has done much to enhance the commercial life of the
							town. Also during the years of his residence there, he has taken an active part in the
							administration of civic affairs and has ever done all within his power to promote the
							moral, material and educational life of the community.</p>

						<p>John A. Adams was born on December 23, 1853, in Washington township, this county, the
							son of John C. and Sarah E. (Park) Adams, both of whom were born in Kentucky. John C.
							came from Estill county and probably Sarah E. Park did also. John C. was the son of
							James and Eleanor Adams, who came from Kentucky and located in this county near
							Danville, where they engaged in farming. John C. grew up in this county and all his
							life was engaged in farm work, owning land in Washington township, where he lived up
							to the last two years of his life. These were passed in Lincoln township, where his
							death occurred in 1865. Sarah E. Park, his wife, was a daughter of John and Malinda
							(Robinson) Park, who came from Kentucky and located in Boone county, in the early
							forties. She survived her husband a number of years, her death occurring in 1893.</p>

						<p>John A. Adams passed his boyhood days on the home farm, receiving his elementary
							education in the district schools of that locality, later attending the Central Normal
							College, at Danville. He assisted on the home farm and in 1886 became identified with
							the milling business at Brownsburg. At that time a stock company was organized, of
							which he was a member, and later he and Mr. Lingerman purchased the interests of the
							other members of the company and have since operated the mill in partnership. In 1901
							they also became owners of the elevator and in 1910 remodeled the mill, adding corn
							shellers and a cleaning apparatus. Their mill has a capacity of fifty barrels daily
							and they make an excellent grade of flour, under the trade name of "Best Imperial." In
							addition to their milling and grain <pb id="VAC1000-389" n="365"/> business, they also
							deal in coal and are numbered among the progressive business men of the town and
							county.</p>

						<p>In politics, Mr. Adams is a Republican and has shown a deep interest in the welfare
							of the town. He has been secretary and treasurer of the town, a member of the town
							board and also a member of the school board, and in meeting the obligations thus

						<p>In 1885 Mr. Adams was united in marriage with Jennie S. Wells, who was born in Middle

						<p>In preparing a review of a man's life, it is not the biographer's part to give voice
							to a man's modest opinion of himself and what he has done, but rather it is his part
							to leave upon record the verdict establishing his character, which is the consensus of
							opinion among his friends and neighbors. "Actions speak louder than words" is a true
							saying, and while a man might give voice to the most lofty principles, his life must
							be in accordance with them else the words carry no weight. The subject of this sketch
							is held in high regard by those with whom he comes in contact and it is, therefore,
							apparent that throughout the years his manner of living has been such as to win this
							high tribute.</p>

						<p>Charles Tansel was born on September 16, 1860, in the western part of Marion county,
							near the town of Clermont, being the son of Peyton and Mary (Myers) Tansel. Peyton
							Tansel was born in Kentucky in 1821 and at the age of eight years was brought to
							Indiana by his parents, who settled along Fall creek, north of Indianapolis. After
							staying there a short time, <pb id="VAC1000-390" n="366"/> they came to the western
							part of Marion county and there made their permanent home. Here it was that Peyton
							passed his boyhood days, grew to manhood and married. He was thrice married, his first
							wife being a Miss Patterson, who died in a few years, leaving a son and daughter. His
							second wife was Mary Myers, the mother of the immediate subject of this sketch, who
							died when the subject was a babe of two years. Later Peyton Tansel married Mary Moon
							and to their union were born three children, two of whom died in infancy and one son,
							Tinsley, survives. Peyton Tansel's entire life was spent in the western part of Marion
							county and there his death occurred in 1903, his widow surviving until 1906, having
							continued to live through her widowhood on the homestead.</p>

						<p>Charles Tansel remained under the paternal roof, assisting his father in the work
							about the homestead, until the time of his marriage, in March, 1899, to Emma Tucker,
							who was born in Shelby county, this state, a daughter of Cornelius Frazier and Phoebe
							(Brant) Tucker, both natives of Shelby county. Cornelius Frazier Tucker was a son of
							James Tucker, a pioneer citizen of that county who had acquired considerable land
							there and for many years before his death was regarded as one of the leading citizens
							of the community. Phoebe Brant, mother of Mrs. Tansel, was a daughter of William and
							Elizabeth (Chance) Brant, and died when her daughter Emma was six years old. Frazier
							Tucker then married Martha Blake and in 1884 moved a short distance east of Clermont,
							where they purchased a farm and lived there until 1905, when they retired from the
							active duties of farm life and went to Clermont to end their days in quietness. He
							lived but two months after leaving the farm and his widow passed away on Christmas
							day, 1912, in the city of Indianapolis. Emma Tucker remained with her father until the
							time of her marriage to the subject, and immediately afterwards they established their
							home on the farm where they now reside in Lincoln township, this county. This farm
							comprises eighty acres and on it Mr. Tansel carries on general farming and kindred
							interests. To Mr. and Mrs. Tansel has been born one son, Herbert, whose birth occurred
							in 1900. Mrs. Tansel was one of a family of three children; a baby brother died when
							two years old and the third member is Mary, wife of Oliver P. Morgan, who lives in
							Clermont.</p>

						<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Tansel are devout members of the Methodist Episcopal church and
							give liberally of their time and means to further the cause of that society. They are
							both quiet and unassuming in manner and cordial in their relations with friends and
							neighbors. Mr. Tansel stands as an <pb id="VAC1000-391" n="367"/> example of what may
							be accomplished by any man who is not afraid to work and will put brains into whatever
							he does. By honest effort and thrift he has amassed a competence and his kindliness
							and good nature have endeared him to the large number of people with whom he comes in
							contact.</p>

						<p>Among the earnest men whose enterprise and depth of character have gained a prominent

							honored subject of this sketch. A leading farmer and stock raiser of the township in
							which he resides and a man of decided views and laudable ambitions, his influence has
							ever been exerted for the advancement of his kind and in the vocation to which his
							energies are devoted he ranks among the representative agriculturists of the
							county.</p>

						<p>Lucian G. Funkhouser, who is successfully operating his farm of eighty acres in Brown
							township, Hendricks county, devoting especial attention to his excellent strain of
							Poland China hogs, is a native of this county, having been born June 22, 1867, not far
							from his present place of residence. He is the son of Joseph and Nancy E. (King)
							Funkhouser, the former of whom was a native of Virginia, coming to Indiana in his
							boyhood with his parents, who settled in Hendricks county, near the center of Brown
							township, where they purchased a farm of eighty acres. Joseph F., who was the son of
							Martin F., lived at home until the time of his marriage, when he made his home for a
							time on rented ground, later purchasing a farm, a portion of which is included in the
							farm now owned by the immediate subject of this sketch. They were the parents of seven
							children, one of whom died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Lucian G. Funkhouser remained under the parental roof until the time of his marriage,
							having received his education in the schools of Hendricks county. In 1890 he was
							united in marriage with Myra E. Crane, daughter of James and Elizabeth (Cox) Crane, of
							Boone county, and at that time built the house which has since been their home. James
							Crane, father of Mrs. Funkhouser, was a native of the Hoosier state and the son of
							Stephen and Mary (Ross) Crane. Stephen Crane was a native of Ohio and the son of John
							and Letitia Crane. Mary Ross Crane was a daughter of John Ross and was of Scotch
							ancestry. Elizabeth Cox Crane, mother of Mrs. Funkhouser, was born in the state of
							Kentucky and was the daughter of John and Rebecca (Howard) Cox, both native to
							Kentucky. Rebecca Howard was a <pb id="VAC1000-392" n="368"/> daughter of Ellen (Ford)
							Howard, of Baltimore, Maryland. James Crane served a short time in the War of the
							Rebellion. He was a member of Company A, Seventh Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and was
							in service three months. After returning home, he went to Colorado where he engaged in
							labors in the gold fields. He and his wife were the parents of four children, Myra E.
							remaining at home until the time of her marriage. To Mr. and Mrs. Funkhouser have been
							born seven children, five of whom are living. Sallie, one of the daughters, is the
							wife of Carl Herring, the son of Philip and America (Walker) Herring, of Brown
							township, where the young people reside just south of Mr. Funkhouser's home. There
							still remain under the parental roof Hazel, Mary, Loyal and Harry.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Funkhouser are both members of the Christian church and give liberally
							of their time and means toward its support. Their home is the center of an interesting
							social life and both children and parents have a wide circle of friends by whom they
							are much admired. Mr. Funkhouser is a most companionable gentleman, honorable and
							reliable in all his dealings, and he ranks among the enterprising and public-spirited
							citizens of the community in which he resides, manifesting an active interest in
							whatever pertains to the progress of his county and co-operates with others in
							forwarding all measures whereby his fellowmen may be benefited. Because of his high

						<p>An enumeration of the representative citizens of Hendricks county would be incomplete
							without specific mention of the well known and popular gentleman whose name introduces
							this sketch. A member of one of the old and highly esteemed families of this locality
							and for many years a public-spirited man of affairs, he has stamped the impress of his
							individuality upon the community and added luster to the honorable name which he
							bears, having always been actuated by a spirit of fairness in his dealings with the

							wide circle of friends throughout this part of the state.</p>

						<p>Alfred S. Lineinger, ex-county commissioner, is a native of this county, <pb

								<p rend="center">ALFRED S. LINEINGER</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-394" n="369"/> born on July 1, 1853, the son of Aaron and Margaret
							(Duzan) Lineinger, the former of whom was a native of Ross county, Ohio, born July 28,
							1822, and the eighth child in a family of twelve children. Margaret Duzan was a native
							of Kentucky, having been brought to this state when quite young. Her parents first
							settled in Monroe county, coming to Hendricks in 1825. She was born March 17, 1814, in
							Fleming county, Kentucky, and departed this life March 31, 1895.</p>

						<p>Aaron Lineinger left his boyhood home in Ohio at the age of twenty-one years and, in
							company with Jacob M. Duzan, went to Iowa. There they remained but one year, engaging
							in agricultural work, when they came eastward to Indiana and settled in this county.
							In Center township they purchased eighty acres of land in equal partnership, for which
							they paid four hundred dollars. Two years later Aaron bought out Duzan's interest for
							eight hundred dollars. Duzan left for Middle township, where he purchased eighty acres
							of land for the price he had received from Aaron Lineinger for his forty acres. Aaron
							Lineinger remained on this farm for the remainder of his life, carrying on general
							farming with particular attention paid to grain and stock. He deeded this land to the
							subject about 1902 and there his death occurred on December 22, 1912. He had been a
							helpless invalid the latter part of his life, and at his death was survived by his
							brother John, who departed this life January 14, 1914, in his ninetieth year. On July
							21, 1848, Aaron Lineinger was united in marriage with Margaret Duzan and to this union
							were born two children, Samantha, who became Mrs. Ensminger, and the immediate subject
							of this sketch. Aaron Lineinger was a man of studious habits and excellent business
							qualifications, an affectionate husband and father and a kind and helpful neighbor. He
							enjoyed the confidence and esteem of a large circle of friends and acquaintances, many
							of whom were warmly endeared to him by various acts of kindness. He was a stanch
							Republican, but was never the incumbent of any public office. His fraternal
							affiliation was with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, of which he had been a
							member since 1864. While not a member of any church, he had been reared in the faith
							of the Methodist Episcopal church and gave much assistance to that society in various
							ways. His was a well-rounded, well-balanced life. While seeking primarily the welfare
							of himself and those nearest to him, he never forgot the claims of his less fortunate
							brethren and throughout his life here he took an active part in any movement having as
							its ultimate object the betterment of the moral, educational or material life of the
							community.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-395" n="370"/>

						<p>Alfred S. Lineinger spent his boyhood days in Center township and grew to manhood on
							the farm where he now makes his home. His early education was obtained in the township
							schools, later attending the academy at Danville. On March 8, 1877, Mr. Lineinger was
							united in marriage with Sarah A. Hollingsworth, daughter of Samuel V. and Lydia
							(Mullen) Hollingsworth, of Washington township, this county. To their union have been
							born three children, two of whom died in infancy, the surviving member being their son
							Floyd, who is a farmer, living on a part of the subject's homestead. Floyd married
							Bernice Euseba Wiley, a native of this county, and their union is without issue. Mr.
							Lineinger originally owned three hundred and twenty acres of excellent land, located
							on the Danville electric line, but about one year ago sold one hundred acres of this
							at a price of one hundred and thirty dollars per acre. This was at considerable
							profit, as he paid thirty-five dollars per acre for the same land twelve years
							earlier.</p>

						<p>Mr. Lineinger is a stanch Republican, very active in local politics. He gave nine
							years' service on the board of county commissioners. He was elected in the fall of
							1900, taking his seat in January of 1902 and served until January, 1911, from district
							number two. During his years of service on the board the subject of the erection of
							concrete bridges came before that body, and several excellent bridges were constructed
							during the subject's term of office. Mr. Lineinger's fraternal affiliations are with
							the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Knights of Pythias, the Free and Accepted
							Masons, and the Tribe of Ben-Hur, being associated with these bodies through the local
							lodges at Danville. He has filled the various chairs in the first two societies
							mentioned and has also been a member of the grand lodges of those same societies. He
							is also chief of the Tribe of Ben-Hur in his local lodge. Both Mr. and Mrs. Lineinger
							are members of Bartlett chapel (Methodist Episcopal), Mr. Lineinger serving that
							society as trustee for many years. Both he and his wife are earnestly interested in
							the welfare of that society and do much toward the support of same.</p>

						<p>Like his father, Mr. Lineinger is a man of excellent business ability and sterling
							qualities of heart and mind. He stands high in public estimation by reason of his many
							years of unquestioned uprightness of life and the helping hand he is ever ready to
							extend to those in need. He is a man of genial, though quiet, temperament; active and
							progressive in all his ideas. He is one of the leading men of the county in his chosen
							vocation and both his public and private life have ever been above reproach. Needless
							to say, a man of so many engaging qualities is not only highly respected, but also is
							warmly esteemed by a large circle of friends and acquaintances.</p>

						<p>All callings, whether humble or exalted, may be productive of some measure of success
							if enterprise and industry, coupled with a well directed purpose, form the motive
							force of the person directing the same, and in no case is this fact more apparent than
							in agricultural pursuits. It is a well authenticated f ct that success comes as the
							result of legitimate and well-applied energy, unflagging determination and
							perseverance as well as the above enumerated qualities. When a course of action is
							once decided upon, these attributes are essential. Success is never known to smile
							upon the idler or dreamer and she never courts the loafer, only those who have
							diligently sought her favor being crowned with her blessings. In tracing the history
							of the prosperous and influential agriculturist whose name forms the caption of this
							biographical review, we find that the above-named elements have entered largely into
							his make-up and therefore we are not surprised at the large and ever-growing success
							which he has attained.</p>

						<p>James W. Phillips was born in Jefferson county, Indiana, on April 7, 1837, the son of
							Thomas and Susan (Wilson) Phillips, both of whom were natives of North Carolina. When
							young, they were brought to Kentucky with their parents, and later came to Indiana
							with their families, their marriage not taking place until after they had become
							residents of the Hoosier state. Thomas Phillips was killed by a tree falling on him
							while felling timber, at the time the subject of this sketch was fifteen years old.
							Being the oldest of the family, many of its burdens and responsibilities then fell
							upon his young shoulders and he remained at home for a number of years, assisting the
							mother in the care and support of the family of younger brothers and sisters. In 1861
							Mr. Phillips was united in marriage with Lydia Gray, whose death occurred in 1879. She
							was the mother of two children, namely: Charles H., who died at the age of twenty-nine
							years, never having been married, and Clarence B., who took as his wife Leoda Wilson.
							By this wife he has two children, Wilma, who makes her home with her father, and
							Harold, who has always been under the care of his maternal grandmother, his mother
							having passed away when he was only four days old. Clarence B. chose as his second
							wife Cornelia Pearcy, by whom he has one child, Otis, residing with his parents.</p>

						<p>In 1881 Mr. Phillips was united in marriage with Melvina Gray, a sister of his first
							wife, by whom he has six children. Lydia and Melvina Gray were the daughters of Hiram
							and Roxy (Young) Gray, the former from <pb id="VAC1000-397" n="372"/> Clermont county,
							Ohio, and the latter of whom was a native of New York. They were married in 1834 and
							lived for several years in Ohio. Wishing to better their fortunes, they removed to the
							state of Kentucky, where they remained for only a year and, being dissatisfied,
							returned to their former home in Ohio. They later came to Indiana and settled in
							Jennings county, where Melvina was born. When she was ten years old, the family moved
							to Missouri, making the trip overland in covered wagons. They were there eight years,
							when the death of the mother occurred, and the father brought his family back into
							Indiana and settled in Hendricks county about two and one-half miles northeast of
							Brownsburg. Here he purchased a farm, where he lived for a number of years, later
							disposing of it and purchasing property in Brownsburg, where he lived until his death.
							Of Mr. Phillips' family by his second wife, the eldest is Iva Jane, wife of Harry
							Bell, a resident of Brownsburg. They have a family of three children, Mabel, Horace
							and Grant. Mr. Phillips has three children remaining at home, Hiram, Roy and Delta.
							Susan, another daughter, married James Smith and they are engaged in agricultural work
							in Boone county. They have a family of four children, Lloyd, Esther, Kellar and Noble.
							Ruth, another daughter, is the wife of Riley Smith and they live on his father's farm,
							one mile west of the Phillips home.</p>

						<p>James WV. Phillips first came to Hendricks county in 1865 and for two years lived on
							rented farms, after which time he purchased the home where he has since resided. Mr.
							Phillips is a graduate of a military school, being second lieutenant of his company at
							the time of his graduation. During the dark days of the sixties, while not at the
							front, he was busy in the work nearer home. He did service in the Jefferson county
							militia, assisting in the pursuit of Morgan and his raiders. He also helped guard
							Confederate prisoners which were brought to Indianapolis. He had three brothers at the
							front, one of whom died while in service, having contracted a serious illness while on
							duty. He also had three brothers-in-law in the war, one of whom starved to death in
							Andersonville prison. Politically, Mr. Phillips is a strong supporter of the
							Republican party and, while not a seeker after office for himself, his influence at
							the polls is a thing reckoned with by those who do seek such honors. Mrs. Phillips is
							a member of the Methodist Episcopal church and, while Mr. Phillips does not hold
							church membership anywhere, his sympathies would seem to be with the society chosen by
							his wife, for he gave the site on which the Corinth Methodist church is erected and
							has in other ways assisted financially in its support, while Mrs. Phillips gives <pb
								id="VAC1000-398" n="373"/> much of her time to further the interests of the society.
							Mr. Phillips has ever shown himself worthy of the high esteem in which he is held. His
							life has been filled with activity and usefulness, while his untiring energy and
							ability have secured for him a conspicuous and honorable place among the citizens of
							his community. His strict integrity and unpretending bearing have elevated him in the
							confidence of his fellow citizens, and his influence has always been exerted in the
							interests of those things which have helped to elevate his fellow men socially,
							morally and educationally. Because of his successful career and his high personal
							character, he is eminently entitled to representation among the leading men of his
							county.</p>

						<p>Success is only achieved by the exercise of certain distinguishing qualities and it
							cannot be retained without effort. Those by whom great epoch changes have been made in
							the political and industrial world began early in life to prepare themselves for their
							peculiar duties and responsibilities and it was only by the most persevering and

							of the honorable gentleman whose name forms the caption of this article we find
							evidence of a characteristic that always makes for achievement-- persistency, coupled
							with fortitude and lofty traits, and as a result of such a life Mr. Nash stands today
							one of the representative citizens of Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>William J. Nash was born in this county on June 9, 1849, the son of Isaac C. and
							Cilicia (Wilson) Nash, who at that time resided about three-quarters of a mile
							northeast of Brownsburg. Isaac C. Nash was born in Ohio on March 27, 1817, and when
							small was brought to Indiana by his parents, Thomas J. Nash and wife. Cilicia Wilson,
							mother of the immediate subject of this sketch, was a native of Virginia, born on
							March 1, 1817, and was also brought to this state by her parents while still a small
							child. Both the Nash and Wilson families entered tracts of government land some three
							miles southwest of where the town of Brownsburg now is, in what was then almost a
							wilderness. It was there that Isaac C. and Cilicia grew to years of maturity, meeting
							the pleasures and privations of pioneers, and eagerly taking <pb id="VAC1000-399"
								n="374"/> advantage of the meagre opportunities for education afforded them by the
							early subscription schools, while doing their share of the work about their respective
							homes. On January 28, 1841, they were united in marriage and for about a year lived on
							his father's farm. They then secured forty acres of government land about, one mile
							northeast of Brownsburg all located in virgin forest. It took several years of
							strenuous labor to convert this tract into well cultivated fields. Their first home on
							that land was a log cabin with a nice log barn near by, and in that cabin home the
							subject of this sketch first saw the light of day. Later on a commodious frame house
							was built, and there Isaac C. Nash passed his remaining years, his death occurring
							September 25, 1897. His wife had preceded him a number of years, having passed away on
							December 24, 1860. They were the parents of nine children, those beside the subject
							being John A., Mary E., Clarinda, William J., Edward F., Alvertus, George A. and
							Cilicia.</p>

						<p>William J. Nash remained at home with his father until the time of his marriage, in
							the meantime attending the district schools of his neighborhood and receiving from his
							father careful instruction in the secrets of husbandry. On November 2, 1870, he was
							united in marriage with Elizabeth McCray, who was born November 6, 1853, the daughter
							of Richard and Sarah (Avery) McCray, the latter dying when Elizabeth was a babe of but
							six months. She was the only child of that union and after her mother's death she was
							cared for by her mother's people. Richard L. McCray and Sarah Avery both were natives
							of Indiana, having been reared in Marion county, the former the son of Samuel and
							Elizabeth (Lucas) McCray, both of whom were born in the state of Ohio. Richard L. was
							born July 7, 1828, near Connersville, this state. The parents of Sarah Avery were
							Solomon and Fanny (Hawkins) Avery. Some two years after the death of his first wife,
							Sarah Avery, Richard L. McCray remarried, going directly to Iowa, where he located
							near Prairie City. In the fall of 1862 he enlisted as second lieutenant in Company G,
							Twenty-third Regiment Iowa Infantry, and at the battle of Black's River Bridge, near
							Vicksburg, Mississippi, on the 17th of May, 1863, he was killed by sharpshooters while
							on the skirmish line. He was captain of his company at the time of his death. Shortly
							after going into service he was raised to first lieutenant, and not long after that
							was commissioned captain. Some time after his death, his widow and children returned
							to Indiana. He was a man of unusual and lovable qualities of heart and mind, looking
							at life in a sweet and serious way, as evidenced by this sketch inscribed on the
							fly-leaf of his much beloved copy of Holy Writ: <pb id="VAC1000-400" n="375"/>
							"Richard L. McCray, son of Samuel and Elizabeth McCray, born in Fayette county,
							Indiana, near Connersville, July 7, 1828. At an early period in life he evidenced a
							love of music and spent a great portion of his childhood days singing the familiar
							airs of those days. When in his sixth year, his father moved to Marion county near the
							capitol of Indiana. At the age of eighteen he left home to learn the joiners and
							framers' trade, but in this he made but little proficiency and returned at the age of
							twenty-one to the home of his childhood. In his twenty-second year he obtained this
							book of Adam Shambaugh. At the age of twenty-five he joined the Christian church at
							North Liberty, in accordance with the teachings of this Holy Book." He was a
							singing-school teacher while young, and also taught school. He was a very religious
							and good man and, in addition to carrying on the regular work of his farm, was also a
							minister of the Gospel. During his service in the army he acted in the capacity of
							chaplain of his company.</p>

						<p>After the subject's marriage he established his home on a sixty-acre farm which his
							father owned about a mile and a half northeast of Brownsburg and there they lived for
							four years. He then purchased eighty acres directly east of the Bethesda church in
							Brown township, and there the family lived for fourteen years. He then traded that for
							one hundred and twelve acres of land in Boone county, remaining there nine years, when
							he again traded that for another farm in Boone county, but never lived thereon, for he
							almost directly turned that for the one hundred and fifty acres where he now lives, a
							short distance north of Brownsburg. To Mr. and Mrs. Nash have been born four children,
							namely: Clarinda, the wife of W. J. Everitt, of Indianapolis. They have two children,
							Chauncy and Edith. The second child, Olna Isaac, married Elma Smith and they reside on
							Mr. Nash's farm about a quarter of a mile from subject's residence. They have two
							boys, Carl and Clifford. Sallie married D. F. Smith and lives a short distance
							northwest of Brownsburg. She is the mother of five children, Lester, Millie, Victor,
							Harold and June. The youngest daughter, Ova L., married Porter Phillips and lives in
							Los Angeles, California. They are the parents of two boys, Avery and William M. Mr.
							and Mrs. Nash are both members of the Christian church and the family is regarded as
							among the foremost of the community. Mr. Nash has always been regarded as a supporter
							of movements having for their object the material advancement of the community, while
							his influence in promoting the social and moral welfare of his fellow men has been

							business judgment which he possesses, coupled with his untiring energy and ceaseless

							the principles that make for strong, upright manhood. Consequently, he has the
							admiration and respect of those who know him.</p>

							county, in 1842, and whose father fought under Washington in the memorable
							revolutionary struggle to free the American colonies. On the maternal side he is the

							<pb id="VAC1000-403" n="377"/> county, in 1828 with his father, the latter entering a
							quarter section of land upon which a portion of the present town of Amo is
							situated.</p>

						<p>After finishing his common school education, Luke Duffey entered the Central Normal
							College at Danville in the autumn of 1897. He completed the course in law and was
							admitted to the Hendricks county bar August 4, 1900. While in attendance at the
							college he worked in private families for his board and took care of the office of
							Brill &amp; Harvey for the privilege of using the books and getting better acquainted
							with the routine of work in a law office; here he developed a definite knowledge of
							the statutes of descent, becoming an expert titleman and thereby developing his real
							estate talent. He later became interested in the real estate business and has since
							devoted his energies and talents to this field exclusively. His success was assured
							from the first. Extensive deals soon gained for him a reputation that reached far
							beyond the boundaries of Hendricks county, and in 1910, seeking a larger field, he
							removed to Indianapolis and established the Luke W. Duffey Farm Sales Company, with
							offices at No. 8 West Ohio street, a large and substantial enterprise, specializing in
							farm lands, though buying and selling realty of all kinds in various parts of the
							country.</p>

						<p>Mr. Duffey has probably done as much as any man living to boom his home county. He
							has laid out three of the finest additions to the town of Plainfield and constructed
							more than a score of their most beautiful and substantial homes, and to him must be
							given credit for the appearance of the great western wing of Indianapolis, which has
							sprung up like a mushroom in response to some able advertisements that he has written
							on the advantages offered in that section lying west of Eagle creek and between the
							Hendricks county line and the city proper. He has platted the Sterling Heights tract,
							Lookout Plaza, Duffey's Second Addition to Lookout Plaza, Lookout Garden, and is
							credited with having first conceived the idea of this territory as a town site, which
							has now something like two thousand homes to evidence his judgment as a far-seeing
							real estate man.</p>

						<p>Mr. Duffey is also proprietor of the famous Hotel De Hoss, the largest livery in the
							state of Indiana. He has always been interested in the live stock business and is a
							frequent speaker and judge at stock shows and conventions. He is a member of the
							Indianapolis Real Estate Exchange and was appointed vice-chairman of the agricultural
							development committee of the international Real Estate Exchange, the purpose of which
							is to co-operate with the House and Senate committees of Congress, with the Canadian
							Parliament and with the National Bankers Agricultural Committee to bring about <pb
								id="VAC1000-404" n="378"/> improved farming conditions. He is a Mason, a Knight of
							Pythias and a Modern Woodman; he holds a birthright membership in the Quaker church,
							and is an active member of the Indianapolis Commercial Club.</p>

						<p>Luke Duffey is a progressive and public-spirited citizen with a program. Poverty did
							not dishearten him, misfortune deter him, nor hardships turn him a hair's breadth from
							his course. His whole nature is dominated by the spirit of progress. He has shown
							marked executive ability and has handled his independent business with much of
							prescience and skill, so that his operations have yielded to him due returns and have
							proved of value to those whom he has served in his professional capacity. His success
							is the more gratifying to contemplate on the score that it represents the direct
							results of his own labors and ability. He has been dependent on his own resources from
							early youth, and has made his business career by his own indomitable energy, and the
							scrupulous care and honor he gives to every transaction entrusted to him as given him
							a large and growing patronage. Personally, he is genial, obliging and is universally
							popular.</p>

						<p>To write the personal record of men who have raised themselves from humble

							pleasure. Self-made men, men who have achieved success by reason of their personal
							qualities and left the impress of their individuality upon the business and growth of
							their place of residence and affect for good such institutions as are embraced in the
							sphere of their usefulness, unwittingly, perhaps, build monuments more enduring than
							marble obelisk or granite shaft.</p>

						<p>Herschel Elsworth Davis is a Hoosier by birth, born in Boone county on September 9,
							1861, the son of Speer Bruce and Mary Ann (Smith) Davis, the former of whom was born
							in Scott county, Minnesota, the latter being a native of Hendricks county, having been
							born near Brownsburg. Speer B. Davis was a young physician who came to Hendricks
							county in 1855 and took up the practice of his profession in Brownsburg and Boone
							county. At the outbreak of the Civil War he enlisted and for three years served as
							surgeon on the hospital corps. In 1858 he was united in marriage with Mary Ann Smith,
							of Boone county, whose death occurred while he was at the front. They had two little
							sons and one of them also died while the father <pb id="VAC1000-405" n="379"/> was
							absent. At the close of the war, Doctor Davis returned to his home in Boone county and
							took the remaining child, the subject of this sketch, to his former home in Minnesota,
							there to be cared for by his people. When the subject was seven years of age, he was
							again thrown on the mercies of the world owing to the complete disappearance of his
							father, who was not heard from for a great many years. In the meantime, the Smiths,
							parents of the subject's mother, sent to Minnesota and had the child returned to Boone
							county and to them, and there he remained until his marriage.</p>

						<p>On March 8, 1887, Mr. Davis was united in marriage with Anna Lumpkin, a daughter of
							George W. and Sarah (Harrison) Lumpkin, born in Boone county, Indiana, on April 30,
							1866. George W. Lumpkin was a native of Tennessee, born on December 8, 1825, while
							Sarah (Harrison) Lumpkin, daughter of Eli and Rachel Harrison, was a Hoosier by birth,
							born in Kokomo on September 2, 1828. Eli Harrison was first sheriff of Howard county,
							Indiana. George W. Lumpkin came from a family who had early settled in Tennessee and
							was a son of Richard and Rebecca Lumpkin, the former of whom was a soldier of the War
							of 1812. After his marriage, Mr. Davis continued to reside in Boone county on a rented
							farm for about a year, when he came over into Hendricks county and lived on rented
							land for four years. At that time he purchased his present farm of thirty-four acres,
							which was absolutely without improvement and in an almost primeval condition. It cost
							him thirty dollars per acre and recently he refused an offer of two hundred and
							twenty-five dollars per acre, preferring to remain on the land he has so finely
							improved and to enjoy the fruits of his labors. For ten years Mr. Davis did gardening
							and attended the city market in Indianapolis during all that time. His ceaseless
							effort and untiring energy have won him material success and while winning a
							competence he ever conducted his business in such manner as to receive the confidence
							and respect of those who knew him, as well as from his business acquaintances. Mr. and
							Mrs. Davis have one child, a daughter Emma, who remains at home. She attended
							Brownsburg high school and early displayed marked musical ability. After the
							conclusion of her high school work, she took up the study of music in Indianapolis,
							attending the Metropolitan School of Music for three years, and has made herself an
							artist of no mean ability. She now teaches instrumental music in Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Davis and Miss Emma are all members of the Christian church and take an
							active part in the affairs of same. Mr. Davis' fraternal affiliation is with the
							Knights of Pythias and in the work of that order he takes a pleasurable interest. Mrs.
							Davis is engaged in the poultry business, <pb id="VAC1000-406" n="380"/> making a
							specialty of White Wyandottes and is doing well with them, shipping more poultry and
							eggs than any one else in her community. The family is placed among the leading ones
							of the community and stand high in public estimation. Mr. Davis' career, although
							strenuous and to a marked degree progressive and successful, has always been
							characterized by honest dealing. He is well known throughout the county and highly
							respected by all because of his clean life and upright and honorable dealings with his
							fellow men.</p>

						<p>Indiana has always been distinguished for the high rank of her bench and bar. Perhaps
							none of the newer states can justly boast of abler jurists or attorneys. Many of them
							have been men of national fame, and among those whose lives have been passed on a
							quieter plane there is scarcely a town or city in the state but that can boast of one
							or more lawyers capable of crossing swords in forensic combat with many of the
							distinguished legal lights of the country. While the growth and development of the
							state in the last half century has been most marvelous, viewed from any standpoint,
							yet of no one class of her citizenship has she greater reason for just pride than her
							judges and attorneys. In James M. Odgen are found united many of the rare qualities
							which go to make the successful lawyer and jurist. He possesses perhaps few of those
							brilliant, dazzling, meteoric qualities which have sometimes flashed along the legal
							horizon, riveting the gaze and blinding the vision for the moment, then disappearing,
							leaving little or no trace behind; but rather has those solid and more substantial
							qualities which shine with a constant luster, shedding light in the dark places with
							steadiness and continuity.</p>

						<p>James M. Ogden, a successful lawyer, lecturer and author of Indianapolis, was born in
							Danville, Indiana, April 5, 1870. His parents were Jesse S. and Mary A. (Carter)
							Ogden. His father, Jesse S., was a remarkable man and the reader is directed to his
							sketch elsewhere in this volume for the story of his life. Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Odgen
							were the parents of three children, Rev. Horace G., D. D., of Jamestown, New York,
							pastor of the First Methodist Episcopal church of that place; Mrs. Adella L. Duvall, a
							prominent soprano singer of Delaware, Ohio, and James M., of Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>James M. Ogden received his elementary and high school training in the public schools
							of Danville. He was only seven years old when his <pb id="VAC1000-407" n="381"/>
							father died, and grew up without a father's care, but no mother ever looked after the
							welfare of her children more solicitously than Mrs. Ogden. After his graduation from
							the high school at Danville he taught school in the districts in Hendricks county for
							one year, and then entered DePauw University at Greencastle, making his own way
							through college, and graduated in 1894 with the degree of Bachelor of Philosophy.
							During the next two years he was principal of the high school at Kendallville,
							Indiana, and saved his money in order to enter the law school at Harvard. From 1896 to
							1899 he was in attendance at the Harvard Law School and graduated in June, 1899, with
							the degree of Bachelor of Laws. He then returned to Indiana and began the practice of
							law in the office of Judge Byron K. Elliott, and continued with him for eighteen
							months, since which time he has practiced alone with offices in the State Life
							building, Indianapolis. He is a frequent lecturer on legal topics and is one of the
							regular lecturers before the Indiana Law School in Indianapolis. He has a high
							reputation as a legal writer and in his volume on "Negotiable Instruments," published
							in 1909, he has written a book which has received the high commendation of jurists
							throughout the country. His first work in the line of legal writing was in connection
							with Judge Byron K. Elliott, whom he assisted in his four-volume edition on
							"Evidence". He has also written many special articles for encyclopedias of law. He has
							conferred a boon upon Indiana lawyers by publishing a volume entitled "Indiana
							Lawyers' Manual of Practice," a volume which should find a place on the shelves of
							every lawyer in the state. His law practice is not confined to Indianapolis and Marion
							county, but he has many clients also in adjoining counties. He is rapidly forging to
							the front as one of the men who really understand the law and are able to give a
							sympathetic reading of the same. The poetical truth concerning the tempering of
							justice with mercy finds a willing follower in him, a fact which has gained for him
							clients of a high class.</p>

						<p>Mr. Ogden has always taken a prominent part in Republican politics, and was the
							nominee of his party for the House of Representatives from Marion county in 1906.
							Although he was defeated, he led the legislative ticket, which is an indication of the
							popularity in which he is held in his county. He has frequently been urged to make the
							race for Congress and has been offered the nomination for various judgeships in
							Indianapolis, but has always declined, feeling that he could do more good in his
							private practice. For many years he has been the attorney of the foreigners in
							Indianapolis and has been highly complimented for his work in looking after their
							interests. He is a member of the Indianapolis Bar Association, and has <pb
								id="VAC1000-408" n="382"/> been officially connected, either as an officer or on its
							various committees, for the past ten years. He is a member of the Indiana Bar
							Association, and takes an active interest in the annual meetings of the
							association.</p>

						<p>Fraternally, Mr. Ogden is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons and the Modern
							Woodmen of America. While in college he was a member of the Sigma Chi Greek-letter
							fraternity, and still interests himself in this organization of his college days. He
							is now one of the board of trustees of DePauw University. He is a member of the board
							of directors of the Young Men's Christian Association, of Indianapolis, and has served
							in that capacity continuously for the past twelve years. He is also a member of the
							board of directors of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, and a member of the
							official board of the Meridian Street Methodist Episcopal church, of Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>James M. Ogden was married November 11, 1903, to Bess Alice Dean, daughter of Irving
							M. and Cora (Laycock) Dean, of Indianapolis, and to this happy union there have been
							born three children, Elizabeth Ann, deceased; Mary Ann and James M., Jr. Mr. Ogden is
							a man who is devoted to his domestic life and the Ogden home is the center of many
							hospitable gatherings of friends and acquaintances. Mr. Ogden has led a very busy and
							useful life and now he is in the prime of his usefulness to society and the future
							only can reveal what good he may yet accomplish.</p>

						<p>It is not an easy task to describe adequately a man who has led an eminently active
							and busy life, and who has attained a position of relative distinction in the
							community with which his interests are allied. But biography finds its most perfect
							justification, nevertheless, in the tracing and recording of such a life history. It
							is, then, with a full appreciation of all that is demanded and of the painstaking
							scrutiny that must be accorded each statement, and yet with a feeling of satisfaction,
							that the writer essays the task of touching briefly upon the details of such a record
							as has been that of the honored subject of this sketch, whose eminently honored and
							successful career now comes under review.</p>

						<p>Thomas J. Nash, whose entire life has been passed within the borders of Hendricks
							county, first saw the light of day on December 22, 1851. He is the son of Isaac C. and
							Cilicia (Wilson) Nash, the former of whom was a <pb id="VAC1000-409" n="383"/> native
							of Ohio and the latter a native of Virginia, both coming to Indiana from their native
							states when children. Isaac Nash was a son of Thomas Nash, who settled just south of
							Brownsburg. When he was about twenty-one years old, Isaac Nash was united in marriage
							with Cilicia Wilson, and they took up their abode on a farm of forty acres lying about
							one mile east of Brownsburg and for this whole farm he gave but one hundred and fifty
							dollars. They lived there the remainder of their lives and there reared their family
							of nine children, of whom Thomas J., the immediate subject of this sketch, was
							one.</p>

						<p>Thomas J. Nash remained under the paternal roof until in 1882, when he was united in
							marriage with Emma A. Patterson, daughter of Daniel and Sarah (McDaniel) Patterson,
							both of whom were natives of North Carolina, coming soon after their marriage to
							Hendricks county, this state. Emma A. was one of their family of four children and
							remained with her parents until the time of her marriage. Directly after their
							marriage, the subject and his wife took up their residence on a farm about a mile and
							a half west of Brownsburg, where they remained two years, when they purchased a farm
							containing one hundred and eight acres, located about three-quarters of a mile north
							of their present location. There they remained for fourteen years, when they purchased
							their present home place of one hundred and sixty-one acres, which is about one mile
							north of Brownsburg. Mr. Nash has engaged in agricultural work all his life and his
							untiring energy, combined with business ability of a high order and the employment of
							up-to-date methods in the conduct of that business, has proved him to be a man capable
							of handling affairs even more complicated than those to which he has given his
							attention. Mr. and Mrs. Nash are the parents of four children, one of whom, a son,
							Harvey, died in infancy. Lilly, a daughter, became the wife of John T. Hofford, a son
							of Frank and Mary A. Hofford of near Brownsburg, and they make their home just south
							of Brownsburg. They have two children, Floyd and Loran. Leroy, a son, married Ellen F.
							White, daughter of Ernest and Nettie (Anderson) White, of near Brownsburg. Leroy
							resides just across the public highway from his parents and they have one child,
							Leona. The only child remaining with Mr. and Mrs. Nash is their daughter Mabel.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Nash are earnest members of the Christian church, to the support of
							which they give liberally, and in their younger years gave much active service toward
							furthering the work of that society. Both Mr. and Mrs. Nash have been unsparing in
							their efforts to make their home attractive and helpful to others and a cordial
							welcome has ever awaited both <pb id="VAC1000-410" n="384"/> friend and chance caller
							alike. Mr. Nash has been a consistent man in all that he has ever undertaken and his
							career in all the relations of life has been absolutely without pretense. His actions
							are the result of careful and conscientious thought and when once convinced that he is
							right, no suggestion of policy or personal profit can swerve him from the course that
							he has decided upon. He is essentially a man of affairs, sound of judgment and
							far-seeing in what he undertakes and he has won and retains the esteem and confidence
							of all classes.</p>

						<p>William W. Gibbs is a native of the state of New York, being born near the city of
							New York on December 28, 1854, a son of William and Elizabeth (Burden) Gibbs, both of
							whom were natives of Devonshire, England, the former being the son of John and Betsy
							Gibbs. William and Elizabeth <pb id="VAC1000-413" n="386"/> Gibbs emigrated to the
							United States in 1844, settling in New York, where they resided for two or three
							years, afterward coming westward to Indiana and locating in Marion county about five
							miles south of the city of Indianapolis, and there they remained for about fifteen
							years. They then came to Hendricks county where they bought a tract containing eighty
							acres in Brown township, and on that land they passed the remainder of their
							lives.</p>

						<p>William W. Gibbs was one of a family of ten children and when he was but eleven years
							old his father was drafted for service in the War of the Rebellion, which, owing to
							his large family and their limited circumstances, worked considerable of a hardship on
							him. He felt it was out of the question for him to go to the front, leaving his wife
							and helpless little ones, and through the kindness of a brother-in-law and a Mr.
							Everitt he was provided with the necessary amount to purchase his exemption. This cost
							him thirteen hundred dollars, and this amount he repaid as rapidly as he was able.
							William W. Gibbs remained under the parental roof until the time of his marriage,
							assisting his father in the work of the home farm and also working out through the
							community by the day or month. After marriage he lived for one year on the farm where
							he now lives and then rented a tract of land in Boone county, where the family resided
							for twelve years. They then came back to the farm in Hendricks county and have
							remained thereon for over nineteen years. Mr. Gibbs is considered one of the most
							successful farmers in the county, displaying business ability of a high order in the
							conduct of his affairs. This, coupled with untiring energy and a boundless ambition,
							have placed him high in public estimation.</p>

						<p>On May 30, 1882, Mr. Gibbs was united in marriage with Mary A. Sandusky, daughter of
							James and Susan (Morgan) Sandusky, the former being a native of Kentucky. His father,
							Jacob Sandusky, was a man of considerable means and large sympathies. He owned a large
							plantation and was also a large slaveholder. He treated his people with kindness and
							consideration, being regarded as an ideal master, and at the beginning of the
							agitation of the slavery question he freed his colored people. Susan Morgan, mother of
							the wife of the subject, lived in Indianapolis at the time of her marriage and, when
							her daughter Mary was but four years old, she departed this life, leaving also a
							little son. The father took his children to Kentucky, the old home, to place them in
							the care of relatives. There they remained until the time of his second marriage, some
							two years later, when he brought his little family to the farm which his father had
							given' him in Brown township, this county. It was an unusually large farm for this <pb
								id="VAC1000-414" n="387"/> section of the country, consisting of some eight hundred
							and eighty acres, and on this estate Mary A. Sandusky lived until the time of her
							marriage to the subject. To their union has been born one child, Forest Chester, who
							remains at home. This son completed the grade schools when remarkably young and took
							up his work in high school, intending to secure an excellent education. However, ill
							health compelled him to close his books and he took up work on the farm, being his
							father's assistant and devoting his energies to the study of the best manner of
							handling crops, stock, etc., along approved scientific lines.</p>

						<p>Mrs. Gibbs is a member of the Methodist Episcopal church and the family is regarded
							as among the leading ones of the county. Mr. Gibbs has ever enjoyed the esteem and
							respect of those who know him for his friendly manner, his business ability, his

							substantial and worthy citizens of the community in which he resides. In addition to
							his regular duties, Mr. Gibbs finds time for some outside connections and is connected

						<p>To a great extent the prosperity of the agricultural sections of our country is due

						<p>Harrison Smith Barlow is a native of this county, having been born in Lincoln
							township, about three miles southwest of Brownsburg, on October 15, 1860, the son of
							Harvey Rice and Sarah Jane (Smith) Barlow. Sarah Smith was a native of the state of
							Kentucky and came to Indiana while young and it is thought possible that Harvey Rice
							Barlow also came from the same place. Sarah Smith's father, whose wife was named
							Hannah, entered a tract of land from the government, this land lying near Danville,
							this county. There they lived for a number of years, the mother saying <pb

							his life, his death occurring in 1872. The mother died in 1896. It was on this farm
							that the subject of this sketch first saw the light of day, being one of a family of
							seven children. He remained under the parental roof until the time of his marriage,
							when he purchased the farm where he was born. About 1902 or 1904, Mr. Barlow sold the
							old homestead and purchased a farm some two miles southwest of Brownsburg, where he
							lived for some six or eight years, when he purchased his present farm of fifty-two
							acres something over a mile northwest of Brownsburg. Here he carried on general
							farming and its kindred interests. At one time, Mr. Barlow gave particular attention
							to the raising of fancy vegetables, always having an elaborate display at both the
							state and county fairs.</p>

						<p>On March 15, 1882, Mr. Barlow was united in marriage with Emma B. Fogleman, a native
							of North Carolina and the daughter of William and Elizabeth (Ferguson) Fogleman, her
							birth occurring about 1865. Elizabeth Ferguson, her mother, was a daughter of
							Archibald and Sarah Ferguson. William Fogleman left his original home in North
							Carolina and removed to Missouri when Mrs. Barlow was a child of three years. They
							lived there some three years and then came eastward again, stopping in Indiana, where
							they located in Hendricks county, in the town of Plainfield. Mr. Fogleman was a
							carpenter by trade, and both he and his wife died when Emma B. was fifteen years old,
							she being one of a family of three children. After the death of her parents, she was
							taken into the home of William Hadley, a brother of Judge Hadley, and remained there
							until the time of her marriage.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Barlow have had three children, one of whom, Charley Ambrose, died when
							thirteen years of age. Gertie, a daughter, is the wife of Wilbur Lowder and they have
							two children, Herbert and Annis. Their home is about one mile north of that of the
							subject. The other child, Clara William, married Willis Pruitt and they live on a farm
							in Marion county, about seven miles northwest of the city of Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Barlow has always been identified with the Republican party, taking
							an active interest in its campaigns. He served as road supervisor for twelve years,
							and during that time did much to improve the highways of the county. His religious
							connection is with the Presbyterian church, both he and his wife being members of same
							and taking an active <pb id="VAC1000-416" n="389"/> interest in the society,
							contributing of both time and means to further the cause. His fraternal affiliation is
							with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Knights of Pythias, in the work of
							which societies he takes a keen interest; and Mrs. Barlow is a member of the women's
							degrees of these orders, being both a Daughter of Rebekah and a Pythian Sister. She
							also belongs to the Woman's Relief Corps.</p>

						<p>There is much that is commendable in Mr. Barlow's life record, for he has been found
							true to duty in every relation, whether of a public or private character, and while
							energy and. untiring industry have been salient features of his business career, he is
							equally well known for his uprightness and the honorable methods he has always
							followed and for his loyalty to any trust imposed in him. Because of his genial and
							unassuming disposition and his genuine worth, he enjoys a well deserved popularity
							throughout his county.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">ELMER L. FUSON.</hi></head>

						<p>The gentleman, to a brief review of whose life and characteristics the reader's
							attention is herewith directed, is among the favorably known and representative
							citizens of Amo, Hendricks county, Indiana. By his indomitable enterprise and
							progressive methods he has contributed, in a material way, to the advancement of his
							locality and during the course of an honorable career is fairly successful in his
							business enterprise, being a man of energy, sound judgment and honesty of purpose, and
							is thus well deserving of mention in this volume.</p>

						<p>Elmer L. Fuson, the son of R. A. and Elvira (Allison) Fuson, was born in Crawford
							county, Illinois, January 20, 1872. R. A. Fuson was educated in Crawford county,
							Illinois, and after leaving school worked, for a time, on the farm. He then began
							preaching in the Missionary Baptist church, and continued in the service of the
							ministry for the remainder of his life. He married Elvira Allison, the daughter of Mr.
							and Mrs. Harvey Allison, and to this union four children were born, Thomas C., Elmer
							L., Martha A., who married Thomas Smork, and Mary, who died at the age of seven.</p>

						<p>Elmer L. Fuson was fortunate enough to be educated in several different states, his
							father's occupation as a minister taking him to many different localities. He attended
							school in Kansas, Illinois and Indiana, and several schools in each state. Upon
							reaching mature years he took up the barber <pb id="VAC1000-417" n="390"/> trade, at
							Brownsburg, Indiana, and after he had mastered the trade, he located in Amo, this
							county, where he worked for about six years. He then took up the insurance business,
							life, fire and accident, and has continued in that line of endeavor since. He has made
							a special study of the insurance business and is now recognized as one of the
							prominent insurance men in the central part of the state. He is claim agent for the
							Farmers National Life Insurance Company, of Chicago, Illinois, an organization
							incorporated under the laws of Indiana. He has made a wonderful success as an
							insurance man and has built up a very lucrative business.</p>

						<p>Mr. Fuson was married February 14, 1894, to Flora Garrison, the daughter of Joel and
							Amanda (Bryant) Garrison, and to this union have been born four children, Madeline and
							Gwendolene, who died min infancy; Wendall and Wenfred, twins, born March 5, 1901.</p>

						<p>The paternal grandfather of Mr. Fuson was Judson A. Fuson, a native of Ohio, who came
							as a young man to Illinois, locating in Crawford county, where most of his children
							were born. He then went to Missouri, where he lived until his death, at the age of
							eighty-six years. He was a minister, in the Missionary Baptist church, during all his
							life. He was married to Elizabeth Taylor and to this union nine children were born,
							John L., Stephen A., William, George B., Roland A. (father of the immediate subject of
							this sketch), Alvin, Mary, Jane and Alice. William Fuson, the great-grandfather of
							Elmer L. Fuson, was a native of Virginia and was a minister in the Missionary Baptist
							church for sixty-five years.</p>

						<p>Mr. Fuson has been a prominent Republican and has taken an active interest in
							politics, both in local and state conventions. He was appointed deputy state oil
							inspector by Governor Frank J. Hanly and served in this capacity for three years. He
							is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons, at Coatesville, Indiana, and the
							Independent Order of Odd Fellows, being treasurer of the latter lodge. Mr. Fuson has
							made a pronounced success of his new line of work and deserves great credit for
							branching out in a new line of business. He is rapidly building up a list of clients
							in Amo and vicinity, and in the course of a few years he promises to be one of the
							most prominent and influential insurance men of the state. With his genial personality
							and cheery way of talking there is no reason why he should not continue to be as
							successful in the future as in the past. By his honest dealings he has won the
							confidence of his associates and it is confidence that spells success. His life shows
							what a young man can do who starts out with nothing, and is determined to succeed in
							spite of all obstacles and hindrances.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">LEON EATON.</hi></head>

						<p>One of the best known and most enterprising of the younger agriculturists of
							Hendricks county is Leon Eaton, now in the very prime of life and usefulness, and his
							influence as an honorable, upright citizen is productive of much good upon all with
							whom he comes in contact. His past success gives assurance of something yet to come,
							and he is evidently destined to continue a potent factor for substantial good for many
							years to come. The farm he is tending, now belonging to his mother, is one of the fine
							farms in Brown township, which he conducts in a manner that stamps him as fully
							abreast of the times.</p>

						<p>Leon Eaton is a native of Brown township, having been born here on October 1, 1881,
							the son of Henry I. and Allie (Herring) Eaton, both of whom were also natives of Brown
							township, Hendricks county, the former being the son of Greenup and Cynthia (Watson)
							Eaton and the latter the daughter of Jackson and Isabelle (Worrel) Herring, who were
							both natives of Harrison county, Kentucky. When quite small, both were brought to
							Indiana by their respective parents, both families locating near Clayton in Hendricks
							county, where the young people in question grew to manhood and womanhood and where
							their marriage was later solemnized. There were four children in their family, Allie,
							mother of the subject of this sketch, remaining under the parental roof until the time
							of her marriage.</p>

						<p>Henry I. Eaton, father of the subject, remained on his father's home, some two miles
							north of Brownsburg, until the time of his marriage in 1879, when he took up his
							residence on a farm about five miles northwest of Brownsburg, living there about a
							year and a half. After that, they made several changes in their place of residence, at
							one time residing in Indianapolis, again in Danville, where he owned a livery stable,
							which he later sold and returned to the farm. In November, 1898, he was elected
							sheriff of Hendricks county on the Republican ticket, having always taken an active
							interest in that party's affairs. He served as sheriff for two years, after which he
							received the appointment as superintendent of the Hendricks county farm. There he
							lived for eighteen months, resigning before the expiration of his term. He then became
							deputy sheriff under Sheriff Figg, serving in this capacity until September, 1904,
							when he removed to the home now occupied by his family and where he passed the
							remainder of his life, his death occurring January 20, 1906. Henry I. Eaton was a man
							of great force of character and was rightly regarded as one of the leading citizens of
							his <pb id="VAC1000-419" n="392"/> community. He was a member of the Knights of
							Pythias and, although not affiliated with any religious body, he was a loyal supporter
							of the Baptist denomination, doing all within his power to further the interests of
							that organization.</p>

						<p>Leon Eaton has lived under the paternal roof all his life, attending the schools of
							Hendricks county when a boy. In March, 1906, he was united in marriage with Edna M.
							Herring, daughter of Thomas and Tira (Watson) Herring, natives of Hendricks county,
							residing near Brownsburg. He brought his bride to his mother's home and there they
							have since resided. To their union have been born four children, Wallace Edward,
							Keller Allen, Mary Constance and Lawrence Leon. Mr. Eaton is an active member of the
							Republican party, serving as township committeeman and also serving as a deputy
							sheriff both under his father and Sheriff Figg, although never having been sworn into
							that office. His fraternal affiliation is with the Knights of Pythias, Mrs. Eaton
							being a Pythian Sister. Mrs. Eaton is a charming woman with a host of friends. She is
							a graduate of Brownsburg high school and active in social affairs of the community.
							Mr. Eaton is wide awake to the best interests of the community and gives a
							whole-hearted support to all movements for the good of his fellows. He has a wide
							acquaintance and is well liked by all who know him.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">PERRY HUNT.</hi></head>

						<p>One of the conspicuous names on the list of Hendricks county agriculturists is Perry
							Hunt, owner of two hundred acres of excellent land in Marion, Center township, a
							gentleman of high standing, to whom has not been denied a full measure of success.
							Long recognized as a factor of importance in connection with the farming and
							stock-raising industries here, he has been prominently identified with the material
							growth and prosperity of this part of the state, his life having been closely
							interwoven with the history of the county where he has been content to live and follow
							his chosen vocation throughout his life.</p>

						<p>Perry Hunt was born on August 8, 1858, on the old homestead farm in Marion township,
							this county, the son of Ithamer and Fanny Jane (Bush) Hunt. Ithamer Hunt came of an
							old American family of English ancestry. Both his grandfathers were named Hunt and
							were distantly related. Eliezer Hunt was a farmer in Guilford county, North Carolina,
							where he passed <pb id="VAC1000-420" n="[]"/>
							<figure>
								<p rend="center">PERRY HUNT</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-421" n="393"/> away at the age of eighty years. His son Asher was born
							in that county, was reared a Quaker and married Jane Hunt, daughter of Abner and Mary
							(Starley) Hunt, who was a very distant connection. Asher Hunt came westward into
							Indiana, where he settled in Sullivan county and entered about two hundred acres of
							government land, which he put into cultivation and where he lived for about sixteen
							years. At the end of that period he came to Hendricks county and purchased a farm in
							the eastern part of Marion township, where he passed the remainder of his life, his
							death occurring in his eighty-fourth year. He was twice married. His first wife died
							in Sullivan county and he again married, his second wife being Abigail Foster. Both he
							and his wives were Quakers, honorable and industrious and highly respected by all.</p>

						<p>Ithamer Hunt, son of Asher Hunt and father of the immediate subject of this sketch,
							was a Hoosier by birth, born while his father was living in Sullivan county, and was
							fourteen years of age when his father came to Hendricks county. He passed his youth
							and early manhood under his father's roof and when twenty-five years of age was united
							in marriage with Fanny Jane Bush, daughter of John and Elizabeth (Norton) Bush, the
							former of whom was one of the pioneers of this county, having come here from Kentucky
							at an early date. He was an honorable and upright citizen who did much for the
							community at that early date. He died at the age of fifty-three years. Ithamer Hunt
							was a thoroughly good man, absolutely honest both with himself and others. He lived a
							strictly religious life, adhering firmly to the principles of his life. He was a very
							prosperous man and won his way through persistent energy and excellent management. He
							was a life-long farmer and at his death owned something over six hundred acres. His
							death occurred on May 14, 1903, at his home on the New Winchester road, at the age of
							eighty-one years. He had a birthright in the Friends church for twenty-one years, but
							afterwards became a member of the Baptist church. He was a consistent and faithful
							member and a liberal contributor to all benevolent and religious objects. He never
							sued nor was sued, avoiding all controversies and litigations, and never paid a cent
							of interest, so conducting his business, which was considerable, that interest was not
							incurred. He was a devoted husband and, while a strict disciplinarian, was a kind and
							loving father and a genial and helpful neighbor. He was a thoroughly manly man and a
							devout Christian, absolutely without ostentation, cant or hypocrisy. He was a man of
							peace, quiet and unobtrusive, never used profane language nor intoxicating liquors in
							any form. In politics <pb id="VAC1000-422" n="394"/> he was a stanch Republican.
							although taking no active part in the affairs of the party.</p>

						<p>Perry Hunt grew from childhood into manhood on the homestead, remaining under his
							father's roof until the time of his marriage, in the meantime receiving from his
							father instruction in the secrets of successful agriculture and having firmly
							implanted on heart and mind the right principles of life. After marriage he came to
							his present farm, or, more properly speaking, eighty acres of it. He has increased the
							size of his farm to two hundred acres, winning his increase by persistent effort,
							untiring energy and good management. His farm is one of the best in the community,
							with excellent residence and other buildings, and all attest to the up-to-date methods
							of the owner. He is progressive in his work, putting brains as well as brawn into
							whatever he undertakes. In addition to his general work, he gives particular attention
							to two excellent strains of cattle, Polled Durhams and Shorthorns. He raises for the
							market and also breeding purposes and is now giving especial attention to a herd which
							he intends to exhibit. He is an excellent judge of stock and takes great interest and
							pride in this phase of his business.</p>

						<p>In politics Mr. Hunt is an old-line Republican and takes an interest in local
							politics, while never desiring an office. Both he and his wife are members of the
							Friends church at Hadley and contribute generously of their time and means to
							fostering the principles of that society.</p>

						<p>On August 21, 1882, Mr. Hunt was united in marriage with Loretta E. Hadley, daughter
							of Mathias and Matilda Hadley, the former of whom was a native of Hendricks county and
							died at his home in Clay township in 1895. The wife preceded him one year into the
							great beyond. Both Mr. and Mrs. Hadley were members of the Friends society and lived
							quiet, useful lives. While earnestly desiring every good for the varied life of his
							community, Mr. Hadley chose to do his share quietly. He did not care for public
							office, nor for any lodge. They were the parents of eleven children, two of whom died
							in infancy. Those beside Loretta, wife of the subject, are Leora (Mrs. Harvey);
							Alzora, who died in California, where she had made her home; Orlando, who died at his
							home near Indianapolis; Ozella (Mrs. Furnace); Orien, who lives on the homestead farm
							in Clay township, this county; Ozro, deceased, who lived in Plainfield; Orvis, who
							resides at Amo, and Elnora (Mrs. Shirley), who also lives in Clay township, just west
							of the old homestead.</p>

						<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Perry Hunt have been born five children, namely: <pb id="VAC1000-423"
								n="395"/> Fauna, who married Clay A. Vannice, a native of this county, born near New
							Maysville. He is a farmer and they reside in Center towsnhip, south of Danville. They
							have no children. Ona R. is a school teacher, teaching one year in Marion. The two
							years previous she taught in the schools of Center township. Her early education was
							received in the township schools near her home; later she attended the high school at
							Danville, from which she was graduated, and later she studied for a year at Earlham
							College, Richmond, this state. Later on, she took a twelve-weeks teachers' course at
							the Danville Normal College. Ray, the youngest of the family, remains at home.
							However, he has taken the short course at Purdue University, Lafayette. Two children
							died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Perry Hunt is a worthy son of his father and stands high in public estimation. He is
							a kind and loving husband and father and an excellent neighbor in every respect. He
							has proven himself an honorable member of the body politic, proving himself thoroughly
							worthy of confidence and esteem in every phase of life. He has never fallen below the
							dignity of true manhood nor in any way resorted to methods that have invited criticism
							or censure. As a citizen he is easily ranked with the most influential of his compeers
							and is ever looking toward the betterment of his community. His course has ever been
							such as to win from those who know him nothing but praise for his broad-mindedness and
							excellent qualities of heart and mind.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">ANDREW S. GARNER.</hi></head>

						<p>Agriculture has been the primal source of man's dominion on earth ever since the
							existence of labor and has been the pivotal industry that has controlled, for the most
							part, all of the fields of action to which his intelligence and energy have been
							devoted. Among the sturdy element of Hendricks county whose labors have profited alike
							themselves and the community in which they live is the gentleman whose name appears at
							the head of this sketch and, in view of the consistent life record lived by the
							subject, it is particularly fitting that the following short record of his career be
							incorporated in a book of this nature.</p>

						<p>Andrew S. Garner, enterprising citizen and successful farmer of Brown township,
							Hendricks county, Indiana, was born on the family homestead, the home which he now
							occupies, on March 9, 1852, being the son of Harrison and Frances (Lowder) Garner.
							Harrison was a son of Solomon and <pb id="VAC1000-424" n="396"/> Deborah Garner, who
							came originally from Kentucky. Francis Lowder, mother of the immediate subject of this
							sketch, was a daughter of Solomon and Jane (Leonard) Lowder, and was born in the state
							of North Carolina, being brought to Indiana by her parents while still a small child.
							Harrison Garner was eight years old when his parents came to Indiana and his father
							entered one hundred and sixty acres of land in Brown township, Hendricks county, part
							of which tract the subject now resides on. This land was then in virgin forest and
							Solomon Garner began the laborious task of converting his wilderness into well tilled
							fields and a comfortable home. Before his death Solomon Garner deeded the forty acres
							south of the road to his son, Harrison, who lived thereon until his death. Harrison
							Garner never had advantages in the way of schooling, and grew to manhood wholly
							untutored in the way of books. However, he was of an ambitious and inquiring turn of
							mind and after his marriage he attended a night school, where he learned to write, and
							became still more determined to educate himself. He became, through his own efforts, a
							man who was considered well read, for his time and community, and was regarded as one
							of the leading men of his day. He was an earnest advocate of the principles of the
							Democratic party, and took an active part in the administration of its affairs in his
							locality. He was one of the first road officers in Brown township, and, through his
							efforts, much was accomplished in this line. He served as road supervisor for a number
							of years. He was married to Frances Lowder, in 1851, and to their union was born a
							family of nine children, the subject of this sketch being the oldest child of the
							family.</p>

						<p>Andrew S. Garner attended the district schools of Hendricks county when a youth, and
							remained at the family home until the time of his marriage, in the meantime receiving,
							under intelligent direction of his father, the secrets of successful agriculture. His
							marriage to Marguerite Adams, daughter of John Adams, took place on February 14, 1877,
							and they took up their abode on a farm about one mile northwest of his father's home,
							residing there until the time of the wife's death in 1880. After the death of his wife
							he came back to his paternal home where he remained for ten years. In 1890 he chose as
							his second wife, Emily J. Leonard, daughter of Lindsey and Amanda (Spencer) Leonard,
							both of whom are natives of North Carolina. They came to Indiana about 1861, locating
							in Hendricks county, where Emily J. was born, near Amo, on June 2, 1872. After his
							second marriage Mr. Garner again moved to his farm and there remained until the death
							of his parents, when he came back to the old homestead and has since resided there.
							Mr. Garner has two children by his second wife, namely: Mary F., <pb id="VAC1000-425"
								n="397"/> who was graduated from the Brownsburg high school and is now studying
							music at the Indianapolis Conservatory of Music, Indianapolis. The second child is
							Walter Lee, now a student at the Brownsburg high school.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Garner is a staunch Democrat, as was his father before him, and he
							also takes an active interest in the party's work. Some years ago he was road
							supervisor and the highways, under his care, were in as excellent a state as it is
							possible to keep them. While not a member of any church, Mr. Garner is interested in
							the affairs of the Baptist church, of which his wife is a member, and to the support
							of which he contributes. Mr. Garner's career has been one of honor and trust. He has
							been a consistent man in all that he has undertaken and his actions in all the
							relations of life have been absolutely without pretense. He has ever been anxious to
							do all in his power to further the moral or material interests of his community and
							his family stand high in the regard of all who know them. He is, therefore, eminently
							entitled to representation in a work of the scope of the one in hand.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">WILLIAM PENNINGTON.</hi></head>

						<p>An enumeration of the representative citizens of Hendricks county would be incomplete
							without specific mention of the well known and popular gentleman whose name introduces
							this sketch. A member of one of the old and highly esteemed families of this locality
							and for many years a public-spirited man of affairs, he has stamped the impress of his
							individuality upon the community and added luster to the honorable name which he
							bears, having always been actuated by a spirit of fairness in his dealings with the
							world in general, and leaving no stone unturned whereby he might benefit his own
							condition as well as that of his friends and the favored section of the great
							commonwealth in which he has been content to spend his life. Straight-forward and
							unassuming, genial and obliging, Mr. Pennington enjoys the good will and respect of a
							wide circle of friends throughout this part of the state.</p>

						<p>William Pennington, who enjoys an enviable reputation in his part of the county
							because of his eminent success as a farmer, is a native of the Hoosier state, having
							been born in Boone county on August 12, 1841, the son of Isaac and Delpha (Guilliams)
							Pennington, the former of whom was a native of Kentucky, the latter being from
							Virginia. When nine years old she was brought by her parents to Putnam county, and
							from there they <pb id="VAC1000-426" n="398"/> went to Hendricks county, locating in
							the northern portion of Brown township. She was a daughter of Richard and Rosani
							(Scott) Guilliams, both natives of Germany, who came to this country while yet
							children. Richard Guilliams was a son of William and Delpha (Hunter) Guilliams, and
							was a patriot in the War of 1812. Rosani Scott Guilliams was a daughter of William and
							Christena (Sellers) Scott, William Scott also being a hero of the War of 1812. Isaac
							Pennington, father of the immediate subject of this sketch, came with his parents to
							Jamestown, Indiana, when he was about ten years old. He remained under the parental
							roof until his marriage, on September 18, 1836, when he took up his residence on a
							farm in Boone county, just west of Fayette. He was a stanch supporter of the
							principles of the Democratic party and was considered one of the leading men, of his
							community in his day. He was the father of a family of seven children, of whom the
							subject of this sketch was one.</p>

						<p>William Pennington passed his boyhood in Boone county, receiving his education in the
							district schools of that county, and later assisting his father in the work about the
							home place. In 1862, near the beginning of the Civil War, he enlisted for service in
							Company G, Seventy-ninth Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and saw much active service. He
							was in the battles of Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Perryville and other engagements.
							During the battle of Stone's River he was taken prisoner and was confined in Libby
							prison for sixty days. He was sent to Annapolis, Maryland, from there, and thence
							home. Four months after his capture he was back with his regiment and served without
							special incident until the close of the war, being mustered out of service at
							Nashville, Tennessee, in June, 1865. He returned to his father's home, where he
							remained until in 1868, when he was united in marriage to Lucinda Doyal, born October
							5, 1852, a daughter of Edward and Sarah Ann (Howard) Doyal. They were natives of Lewis
							county, Kentucky, who had come to Indiana in 1839, and settled in Hendricks county in
							the northeast part of Brown township. Edward Doyal was a son of John and Christena Ann
							(Davis) Doyal. John Doyal was a native of the state of Pennsylvania, where his father
							had settled when he emigrated from Ireland. Christena Ann Davis was a native of
							Maryland and was of French ancestry. Sarah Ann Howard, mother of Mrs. Pennington, was
							born in Kentucky, but both her parents, Samuel and Ellen (Fort) Howard, were from
							Baltimore, Maryland. After his marriage the subject of this sketch lived on a rented
							farm in Boone county for two years and at the end of that time he removed to the farm
							where he now resides, which farm was left to him by <pb id="VAC1000-427" n="399"/> his
							wife's father, Edward Doyal. There they have passed a great many years, rearing and
							educating their family of eight children, having lost but one. Charles F., the eldest
							son, took as his wife Lela Shirley, daughter of Levi and Jane (Roberts) Shirley, and,
							they make their home in the northeastern part of Brown township. They are the parents
							of two children, Ova and Hazel, both of whom are attending school in Indianapolis. Ova
							graduated from Manual Training high school in 1914. Charles F. Pennington is one of
							the leading men of his community and is at present serving as trustee of Brown
							township, the duties of which position he is discharging in a manner highly
							satisfactory to every one. He is engaged in teaching in the public schools, having
							taught twenty-five consecutive terms. Dora F., a daughter of Mr. Pennington, is a
							teacher of English in the city schools of Indianapolis, having received her higher
							education at the State Normal School, at Terre Haute, and also being a graduate of
							Indiana University at Bloomington. Ernest L. married Ava Brouhard, daughter of Marion
							Brouhard, of near Zionsville, Indiana, and lives at Wichita, Kansas, where he is a
							carpenter and contractor. He is the father of one daughter, Frances. Bertha also is a
							teacher in the public schools of the state, being stationed at present at West Baden,
							Indiana, where she is instructor in domestic science. She is a graduate of Shortridge
							high school at Indianapolis, spent three years in study at Butler College,
							Indianapolis, and took her special training in domestic science at Bradley Institute,
							Peoria, Illinois. Three of the children, Edward I., Clarence O. and Harley W., remain

						<p>There could be no more comprehensive history written of a city or county, or even of
							a state and its people, than that which deals with the life work of those who, by
							their own endeavor and indomitable energy, have placed themselves where they well
							deserve the title of "progressive," and in this sketch will be found the record of one
							who has outstripped the less active and less able plodders on the highway of life, one
							who has not been subdued by the many obstacles and failures that come to every one,
							but who has made them stepping stones to higher things and at the same time that he
							was winning his way in the material affairs of life gained a reputation for
							uprightness and honor.</p>

						<p>James L. Darnell, the proprietor of the "Yaller Front," was born in Danville, August
							25, 1854. His parents were John F. and Virginia (Dicks) Darnell, his father being a
							native of Kentucky and his mother of Indiana. John F. Darnell came to Hendricks county
							when a small boy with his mother and located in Danville. He was a carpenter by trade,
							but later went into the mercantile business, which he managed until his death, in
							1897. His wife died about four years later. Mr. and Mrs. John F. Darnell were the
							parents of eight children, six of whom are living:. Charles S., of Indianapolis,
							Indiana; Dora, the wife of A. S. Pierce, of Colorado; Kate, the widow of Frank
							Gladden, of Texas; Rhoda May Howell, of St. Louis, Missouri; Mrs. Jennie Calvert, of
							Texas, and James L., the immediate subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>James L. Darnell was educated in the public schools of Danville, and at the age of
							eighteen became a salesman in an Indianapolis clothing store, remaining there for
							eight years. He then began to indulge his desire for travel and for the next two years
							was salesman for the Famous Shoe and Clothing Company, of St. Louis. Following this he
							worked for mercantile establishments in New Orleans, Denver, Springfield, Missouri,
							and other places in the West, spending a short time working in San Francisco. He then
							returned to Indianapolis, where he remained for a short time, but the wanderlust
							seizing him, he went west again and took service with a farmer near Keokuk, Iowa, at
							fifteen dollars per month. He had the management of twenty to thirty farm hands, and
							he had the native ability to do his work well. The owner recognized his capacity and
							increased his salary to forty dollars per month and gave him the entire management of
							the farm. However, he soon returned to Indiana because of his father's declining
							health, <pb id="VAC1000-429" n="[]"/>

							<pb id="VAC1000-430" n="401"/> and for five years. before his father's death he was in
							his father's store. Upon the death of the latter he continued the grocery business and
							has been remarkably successful. He is a very popular and prosperous grocer and is one
							of the busiest and most enterprising merchants in this part of the state.</p>

						<p>Mr. Darnell was first married in 1878 to Nancy Reed, of Danville, and to this
							marriage there were born three children: Edith, the wife of C. P. Bond, of Boston,
							Massachusetts; Ralph, deceased, and Bessie, the wife of Rev. George Kline, of Glenwood
							Springs, Colorado. Mrs. Darnell died in 1891, and in 1895 Mr. Darnell was married to
							Margaret Cook, the daughter of Silas and Mary Cook, of Danville.</p>

						<p>James Darnell is a Democrat in politics, but has never taken an active part in the
							political game. Faternally, he is a member of the Knights of Pythias and, religiously,
							is affiliated with the Presbyterian church, having long held the office of deacon in
							that denomination. Mir. Darnell is one of the most active members of the Danville
							Commercial Club and is one of the most enthusiastic boosters for a greater Danville.
							He has given a great deal of thought and energy in organizing the Business Men's Club,
							of Danville, in order to bring factories and capital to his local town. He is
							interested himself in the Danville Creamery and Danville Canning Company, being a
							stockholder in both companies. He is a broad, generous and worthy business man and
							citizen. His store, familiarly known as the "Yaller Front," is rapidly becoming a
							household word in Hendricks county, and by his accommodating, genial and business-like
							way, he has built up a large business.</p>

						<p>Among the men of Hendricks county who have been important factors in the building up
							of the county is Joel B. Garrison, who, as a farmer and blacksmith, has been a
							prominent citizen of the community in which he lives for more than a half century. He
							was born in Putnam county, Indiana, December 6, 1845, the son of Jeremiah and Rebecca
							(Shaw) Garrison, both natives of New Jersey, who, after their marriage on January 24,
							1826, came to Indiana and settled in Hendricks county early in the thirties. They
							remained in this county only a short time, when they moved to Putnam county, but after
							a short stay in that county they returned to Hendricks county, where they remained for
							the rest of their lives. Jeremiah Garrison was a shoe-maker <pb id="VAC1000-431"
								n="402"/> and followed this trade all his life. He was married three times, and to
							him and his wife, Phoebe Whit, were born three children, Phoebe, Edward and Jane. His
							second wife was Ruth Erskine and to this marriage were born three children, Archibald,
							Mary J. and Sallie. His third marriage was to Rebecca Shaw and to this last marriage
							nine children were born, Ann, Eleanor, Arminda, Rebecca, Joseph, Charles W., Francis,
							Eliza and Joel. Ann married Thomas B. Borders; Eleanor died in childhood; Amanda
							married James Vermillion, and after his death, William Alley; Rebecca, deceased;
							Joseph married Susan Zearing; Charles W. married Jerush Wilcox; Francis married Josie
							Laton; Eliza married Jesse Brazer.</p>

						<p>Joel B. Garrison attended the common schools, near Stilesville, Indiana, for only a
							short time. When he was eighteen years of age he enlisted in Company B, Fifty-ninth
							Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and served from February 25, 1864, to July 7,
							1865. He then returned to his home and engaged in the blacksmithing trade, which he
							followed for about thirty-five years. He then purchased a farm and since that time has
							devoted himself to agricultural pursuits.</p>

						<p>Mr. Garrison was married January 19, 1869, to Amanda Bryant, the daughter of Silas
							and Matilda (McCormack) Bryant, and to this union were born four children: Flora
							Alice, who married Elmer Fuson, and has two children, Winifred and Wendall; Rossie
							became the wife of Osro Hadley and has one child, Ethelyn; Don A., who married Bernice
							Owen and has one child, Helen Lucile; Elsie, who married O. Harper.</p>

						<p>Mrs. Garrison's parents had a family of nine children: Lucy, the wife of Martin Sims;
							John married Ruth Sharp; Amanda, wife of Mr. Garrison; Nancy, wife of Mr. Balldock;
							Clementine, deceased; William, who married Helen Stingler; Anderson, deceased; Albert,
							and Woodford, who married Mary Clark. Mrs. Garrison's father had the distinction of
							being the first white child born in Hendricks county. His death occurred in 1899 and
							his wife died in 1913.</p>

						<p>Joel Garrison, the grandfather of the subject of this sketch, was a soldier in the
							Revolutionary War. Jeremiah Garrison, the father of Joel B., died June 5, 1857, his
							wife having died ten years previously, October 15, 1847.</p>

						<p>Mr. Garrison has been a life-long member of the Republican party, although he has
							never had any political office. He is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons and
							holds his membership in the Baptist church of Stilesville. During his long and busy
							life in this community he has so conducted himself as to win the sincere respect and
							esteem of all who know him.</p>

						<p>The two most strongly marked characteristics of both the East and West are combined
							in the residents of Indiana. The enthusiastic enterprise which overleaps all obstacles
							and makes possible almost any undertaking in the comparatively new and vigorous
							Western states is here tempered by the stable and more careful policy that we have
							borrowed from our Eastern neighbors, and the combination is one of unusual force and
							power. It has been the means of placing this section of the country on a par with the
							older East, at the same time producing a reliability and certainty in business affairs
							which is frequently lacking in the West. This happy combination of characteristics is
							possessed to a notable degree by the subject of this review, R. M. Hadley, of
							Plainfield. He is too well known to the readers of this work to need any formal
							introduction here, for he not only comes of a family whose name is deeply engraved in
							the financial, commercial, professional and industrial history of this section of the
							state, but he himself is filling a large place in the public affairs of his community.
							Recognized as a man of strong and alert mentality, deeply interested in everything
							pertaining to the welfare of the community along material and civic lines, he is
							regarded as one of the progressive and enterprising men of his city and county.</p>

						<p>Among the native sons of Hendricks county, Indiana, who have risen to a place of
							prominence in their community, there is no one who has filled a higher niche in his
							home town than R. M. Hadley, who was born November 23, 1863, in Washington township,
							this county. His parents were Hiram and Mary Elizabeth (Martin) Hadley, the father
							being a native of this county and his mother of Fulton county, this state. His father
							was a farmer by occupation and after his marriage went to Nebraska, where he lived the
							remainder of his life. Mr. and Mrs. Hiram Hadley were the parents of seven children:
							Ollie and Effie, both deceased; R. M., the immediate subject of this sketch; C. L., of
							Plainfield, Indiana; Lucinda, deceased; James G., of Plainfield, and D. F., of New
							York.</p>

						<p>R. M. Hadley was educated in the district schools of Washington township, this
							county, and spent his boyhood days when not in school working on the home farm. He
							accompanied his parents to Nebraska, and upon reaching his majority he engaged in the
							grocery business at Fairmount, Nebraska, and subsequently conducted the same business
							in Lincoln, that state, for a number of years. Later, for a few years, he traveled out
							of Lincoln for a wholesale grocery house, afterwards being transferred to
							Indianapolis, and <pb id="VAC1000-433" n="404"/> after traveling out of Indianapolis
							for six years he came to Plainfield in February, 1908. and purchased the dry goods
							store of A. J. Shaw, which he has conducted since that time. Mr. Hadley carries a
							large and well-selected stock of dry goods and kindred lines, caters to the trade and
							by his courtesy and evident desire to please his customers has succeeded in building
							up a large and lucrative patronage in Plainfield and surrounding country.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hadley was married December 31, 1885, to Adah Keith, of Fairmount, Nebraska, the
							daughter of Calvin and Abbie Keith, and to this union there have been born two
							children, Claude, deceased, and Hiram Irvin, twenty-two years of age, who is now in
							the piano business in Plainfield. Fraternally, Mr. Hadley is a member of the Modern
							Woodmen of America and, with his wife, is a member of the Methodist Episcopal church
							of Plainfield and for many years has been one of its trustees. Politically, Mr. Hadley
							is a Republican, but has been too busy a man to devote much attention to public
							affairs, though his party did elect him to the office of town treasurer, in which he
							rendered valuable service for his fellow citizens. Also he was prevailed upon to
							accept the office of town clerk and is now filling that position in a very
							satisfactory manner. In the civic life of the community Mr. and Mrs. Hadley have been
							potent factors for the development of the best interests of the people. Mr. Hadley is
							a man of pleasing address and easily makes friends with all with whom he comes in
							contact. Because of his upright character and marked ability and pleasing disposition
							he is numbered among the most popular residents of Plainfield.</p>

						<p>Among the earnest men whose enterprise and depth of character have gained a prominent
							place in the community and the respect and confidence of his fellow citizens is the
							honored subject of this sketch. A leading farmer of the township where he resides, and
							a man of decided views and laudable ambitions, his influence has ever been exerted for
							the advancement of his kind, and in the vocation to which his energies are devoted he
							ranks among the representative agriculturists of the county.</p>

						<p>Edward F. Nash, member of a family who for years have been numbered among the good
							citizens of this county, was born on December 24, 1853, and has the distinction of
							having lived his entire life within the bounds of Hendricks county, one of the favored
							regions of the state. He is a son of <pb id="VAC1000-434" n="405"/> Isaac C. and
							Celicia (Wilson) Nash, the former being a native of the Buckeye state, being born in
							Madison county on March 27, 1817, and when only eight years old he was brought to
							Indiana by his parents, Thomas and Hannah (Brown) Nash, the family locating about two
							and one-half miles south of Brownsburg. Isaac remained under the paternal roof until
							the time of his marriage, attending the early schools of Hendricks county in his
							boyhood, and later being instructed in the secrets of successful agriculture, under
							the tuition of his father. He was twice married, his first wife being Celicia Wilson,
							mother of the immediate subject of this sketch, to whom he was united in marriage on
							January 28, 1841. Celicia Wilson was a native of Virginia, born on March 1, 1817, the
							daughter of William J. and Nancy Wilson. They came to Indiana when Celicia was twelve
							or fifteen years of age, and settled on a farm some four miles south of Brownsburg,
							where they reared a family of eleven children. Celicia always resided at home until
							the time of her marriage. Her death occurred on December 13, 1860, and she left a
							family of nine children, the youngest a babe but three days old. About that time three
							deaths occurred in the Nash family, coming quite close together. At the time of the
							marriage of Isaac C. and Celicia Wilson Nash his entire family, including parents,
							brothers and sisters, moved out west, leaving him the sole representative of the
							family in Hendricks county. His parents he never saw again, their deaths occurring
							while they were residents of Missouri.</p>

						<p>On April 19, 1864, Isaac Nash was united in marriage with his second wife, Eliza Jane
							Faucett, daughter of Joseph and Rebecca N. (Hurron) Faucett. This union was without
							issue. Mrs. Nash's death occurred on July 24, 1909, lacking a short time of attaining
							her eighty-seventh year. Isaac C. Nash died September 25, 1897. He was regarded as one
							of the leading men of his community and was one of those unselfish men who did all
							within his power to advance the moral and material welfare of his friends and
							neighbors, often neglecting his own work to assist in something partaking of a public
							nature. He hauled the logs used in the erection of the first business house in
							Brownsburg, driving a yoke of oxen. In his later life he enjoyed telling of how he
							would help his neighbors all day, in rolling logs, returning home near nightfall and
							would work until midnight on his own land endeavoring to get it into proper shape for
							cultivation. He was a rigid churchman, being a member of the Presbyterian church, and
							took an active part in futhering the cause of that society.</p>

						<p>Edward F. Nash received his early education in the district schools of <pb
								id="VAC1000-435" n="406"/> his community, remaining with his father until twenty-six
							years old, at which time he was united in marriage with Sarah C. Garner, daughter of
							Harrison B. and Frances (Lowder) Garner. The Garners were originally from Kentucky,
							the Lowders coming to Indiana from the Carolinas. After marriage Mr. Nash took up his
							residence on a farm owned by his father and about three-quarters of a mile from the
							old home place, being some two miles northeast of Brownsburg. There they lived until
							1881, when they removed to the present home, about two and one-half miles northwest of
							Brownsburg. Mrs. Nash died on March 27, 1896, leaving two children: Bertha, wife of
							Benjamin C. Weddle, son of Simon and Angeline (Bishop) Weddle, of Hendricks county.
							Bertha has one son, Marion, living and a little son, Paul, died when seven years old.
							The second child of Mr. Nash is Effie, who became the wife of Thomas L. Burns, son of
							James and Rebecca (Patterson) Burns, of Hendricks county. Effie is the. mother of five
							sons, Laurel, Louis, Leroy, Norman and Aubrey.</p>

						<p>Mr. Nash's religious affiliation is with the Baptist church, the family identifying
							itself with the workings of same. He is also a member of the Brownsburg Horse Thief
							Detective Association and does all within his power to further the interests of all in
							his community. He is a man of sound practical intelligence who is keenly alert to
							everything relating to his interests and, in fact, with all that concerns the
							prosperity and advancement of his community. Because of his splendid personal
							characteristics and his genuine worth, he enjoys the confidence and esteem of all who
							know him and is eminently entitled to representation in a work of the character of the

						<head><hi rend="center">NATHAN H. KENDALL.</hi></head>

						<p>In every district we find a few sturdy families who grow up and develop with the
							country, by their industry and steadfastness adding to the stability of the community
							as a whole, becoming an integral part of the social and business life of the place,
							and by their inherent conservatism adding a dignity to those undertakings with which
							they are associated.</p>

						<p>To such a family belongs the subject of this article, Nathan H. Kendall. Long a
							resident of Liberty township, though unassuming and unaggressive, he has been closely
							associated with the educational and religious growth of the surrounding country until
							his name is well known far beyond the confines of his immediate neighborhood. He is
							the only son of Ahimaac <pb id="VAC1000-436" n="407"/> and Minerva Kendall and
							descends from a long line of sturdy, industrious tillers of the soil. Like his
							ancestors, he has established himself as a substantial member of the commonwealth,
							well known and highly esteemed.</p>

						<p>More than a century ago, before the days of steam and electricity, Mr. Kendall's
							grandparents, Nathan and Ruth Harvey, left their home in North Carolina, taking the
							long and perilous journey westward, finally selecting for their abiding place a spot
							in Parke county, Indiana. To them, in 1832, was born a daughter, Minerva, who grew to
							maturity and married Ahimaac Kendall, a young farmer. His parents, James and Sally
							(Bayles) Kendall, were also natives of North Carolina. They, too, braved the terrors
							of the long, lonely journey westward, obtaining land from the government in Morgan
							county, Indiana, near the present site of Mooresville. Here their son, Ahimaac, was
							born in 1833. Six years later they moved to Hendricks county and here their son was
							married to Minerva Harvey. Like their parents, the young people spent their days upon
							the farm, becoming substantial members of society. To them were born four children,
							Nathan H., Sallie A. (Robinson), Mary A. (Stipe), and Lydia E., single and living with
							her mother.</p>

						<p>Though he belonged to no lodges and aspired to no political office, Ahimaac Kendall
							was esteemed by all who knew him as an intelligent, loyal citizen and an influential
							member of the Friends church at Mill creek. Death came to Mr. Kendall at the ripe age
							of seventy-nine years, on November 11, 1912, he being at that time near Danville,
							Hendricks county. His widow now resides with a daughter near New Winchester. Nathan
							H., his only son, was born November 30, 1856, in Clay township, Hendricks county,
							Indiana, two miles southeast of Amo. Here Nathan spent his boyhood and received his
							schooling, and here, in 1877, he was married to Mary E. Smith. At the age of thirty
							years he came to Liberty township, his present home, where he purchased one hundred
							sixty acres of good land. This is now a beautiful country home in that most ideal
							setting, a well cultivated, liberally stocked farm. Surrounding Mr. Kendall are the
							fruits of his toil, the tangible evidence of a life well spent-- surroundings which
							say to the most casual beholder, "Within abides a man of sterling worth."</p>

						<p>That Mr. Kendall has the highest confidence of his fellow men is evidenced by the
							fact that he was selected for ten consecutive years as director of the schools of his
							district, before the present system of graded schools was introduced into the
							township. For twelve years, also, he has been an elder in the Christian church at
							Clayton, where Mrs. Kendall is also an influential member In politics, he was known as
							a Republican until the formation of <pb id="VAC1000-437" n="408"/> the new Progressive
							party, in 1912, since which time he has lent his influence to its growth.</p>

						<p>Mr. Kendall is the father of five children, Owen, Milber, Marcena, Goldie and Ethel.
							Owen, the eldest son, married Nellie Ratliff, and resides in Liberty township. He,
							too, follows the pursuit of agriculture, and has one child Villa. Milber, the second
							son, married Effie Woods, and lives on a farm two miles southwest of Pecksburg. He
							holds a position of responsibility in the First National Bank of Amo. Goldie, the
							eldest daughter, is the wife of Cecil Martin, a farmer, and lives near her father. She
							is the mother of one daughter, Audrey. Ethel is in far-away South Dakota, her husband,
							Earl Given, being instructor in the Indian school at Smithwick. Two children, Dean and
							Elenore, have been born to them.</p>

						<p>This history would not be complete without further mention of Mr. Kendall's most
							faithful ally in all his undertakings, his devoted wife, and her family. Mrs. Kendall
							was the second of nine children born to Asa and Julia (Trullinger) Smith. These were
							Emma, who married George Beemer, Mary (Mrs. Nathan Kendall), Margaret (Mrs. Hitchens),
							Frank, Catherine (Mrs. Kenneth), Theodore, Edward, Charles and Delia.</p>

						<p>Asa Smith, the father, was born in Kentucky, but while yet an infant was brought by
							his parents to Covington, Fountain county, Indiana. Here they remained until he grew
							to manhood, moving to Vermillion county and later to Danville, Illinois, when Asa was
							about twenty-five years of age, their son accompanying them. This was his home until
							death called him, October 15, 1910. He led the life of a farmer, taking no active part
							in lodges nor political affairs, giving his energies to his home and family. He and
							Mrs. Smith were both affiliated with the Missionary Baptist church.</p>

						<p>Among the citizens of Clay township, Hendricks county, Indiana, who have built up
							comfortable homes and surrounded themselves with valuable landed estates and personal
							property, few have attained a higher degree of success than the subject of this
							sketch. With few opportunities except what his own efforts were capable of mastering
							and with many discouragements to overcome he has made an exceptional success in life
							and in his old age has the gratification of knowing that the community in which he
							resides has been benefited by his presence and his counsel.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-438" n="409"/>

						<p>Henry Simpson Cox, one of the largest landowners in Clay township, Hendricks county,
							Indiana, was born in the township where he has lived for the past sixty-six years. He
							is the son of William and Lucy (Plasters) Cox, and was born on September 12, 1848.
							William Cox was a native of Morgan county, and his wife was born in this county.
							William Cox moved to this county when he was a young lad with his parents and after
							leaving school he worked on his father's farm until he was twenty years of age. He
							then married Lucy Plasters, the daughter of William and Polly (Cleveland) Plasters,
							and rented land for a few years, after which he purchased a farm in Middle township,
							where he lived until his death, April 15, 1881, his wife surviving him until 1884. To
							Mr. and Mrs. William Cox were born six children: John M., who died in childhood;
							William D., who died from injuries received from being kicked by a horse; Mary C., the
							wife of Stephen Morbley; James M., who died in infancy; Charles, who married Fanny
							Leachman, and Henry Simpson.</p>

						<p>Henry Simpson Cox attended school in the rude log structures of his day, and received
							a practical education in the three "R's," which were the only subjects in the
							curriculum at that time. He was early taught all of the ins and outs of farming life
							by his father, and when he married and started to operate a farm of his own, at the
							age of twenty-five, he was well equipped for the profession of farming. As a
							successful tiller of the soil he has few peers in the county and his farm of two
							hundred and nineteen acres bears glowing testimony to his success along agricultural
							lines.</p>

						<p>Mr. Cox was married, February 3, 1874, to Mary Frances Flynn, daughter of Alfred and
							Artemesia (White) Flynn, and to this happy marriage have been born four children: Eva,
							who married Gus Bartholomew, and they have two children, Edgar and Hazel; Jennie
							married Frank Stanley; William Dayton, who is unmarried and still at home, and Alice,
							who also is under the parental roof.</p>

						<p>Mincher Cox, the grandfather of the subject of this sketch, was one of the thousands
							of North Carolinians who came to this state. He came here as a young man and first
							settled in Morgan county, near Mooresville, where he farmed and engaged in the buying
							and trading of horses. He seemed to have been an adventurer of more than ordinary
							pretensions. We are told that on one of his numerous horse-selling trips he took a
							small pacing horse and drove it from Morgan county to Chicago, but when he reached the
							out-skirts of that city a trapper offered him twenty acres of land for the horse, <pb
								id="VAC1000-439" n="410"/> but his offer was refused. It is not related, however,
							just what he did get for the horse. Mincher Cox married in Morgan county and
							afterwards moved to Clay township, in Hendricks county, where he remained for about
							eight years. The wanderlust then seized him and he moved to Grant county, Indiana,
							where he remained until his death. He married Sarah Nichols, and to this union six
							children were born, all of whom are deceased: William, the father of Henry Simpson;
							Lydia, who married John Scharey; Harriett married Daniel Hollingsworth; Louisa became
							the wife of Austin Williams; James A., who married Lena Hathaway, and Thomas, who died
							unmarried.</p>

						<p>The mother of Henry Simpson Cox was the daughter of William and Polly (Cleveland)
							Plasters, and was one of nine children, the others being as follows: John, who married
							Rebecca Bullard; Betsy became the wife of Michael Higgins; Eveline became the wife of
							Cyrus Moore; Phoebe married Alfred Stanley; Jackson; Polly became the wife of Buckner
							Highton; William married Mary Burgner; Sallie became the wife of Bunk Burnett, and
							Lucy, who married William Cox.</p>

						<p>The father of Mrs. Henry S. Cox was Alfred Flynn, a native of Kentucky. He was reared
							on a farm in that state and after his marriage moved to Clinton county, Indiana, where
							he remained for about six years. He then moved to Hendricks county and located on a
							farm in Middle township, where he remained until his death, November 10, 1908, his
							wife having preceded him in death in 1898. He had married Artemesia White, the
							daughter of William and Polly White, and to that union were born nine children: Mary
							Frances, the wife of Henry S. Cox; John, who harried Martha Arnold; Nancy, who became
							the wife of Thomas Day; Louisa, who married Frank Burchman; George; William; Frank;
							Ella, who married William Smith; Ollie, who married Josie McCall.</p>

						<p>Mr. Cox has been a life-long Democrat and has taken an active interest in the
							deliberations of his party. Some idea of the popularity which he has throughout the
							county is shown by the fact that he was elected in November, 1912, as commissioner of
							Hendricks county, despite the fact that Hendricks is a strong Republican county. In
							this important office he has shown that he has that admirable judgment and good common
							sense which is the making of a good and efficient public official. Mr. Cox is a man of
							genial personality and numbers his friends in every corner of the county. He is a man

						<p>It is one of the beauties of our government that it acknowledges no hereditary rank
							or title, no patent of nobility save that of nature's, leaving every man to establish
							his own rank by becoming the artificer of his own fortune. Places of honor and trust,
							rank and preferment thus happily placed before every individual, high or low, rich or
							poor, to be striven for by all, but earned alone by perseverance and sterling worth,
							are most always sure to be filled with deserving men, or at least by those possessing
							the energy and talent essential to success in contests where public position is the
							prize. A. Emmett Bly, the subject of this review, affords a conspicuous example of the
							successful, self-made American, who is not only eminently deserving of the confidence
							reposed in him by his fellow citizens, but also possesses the necessary energy and
							talent that fits him to discharge worthily the duties of the responsible place with
							which he has been honored by the people of his county. A man of vigorous mentality and
							strong mental fiber, he finds those qualities the chief factor in the carving out of a
							career that has been above the, suspicion of reproach and of honor to the county which
							he so ably and acceptably serves.</p>

						<p>A. Emmett Bly, one of the most successful business men of Plainfield, Indiana, was
							born three miles southeast of Danville, Indiana, on November 24, 1878, the son of
							Joseph and Lydia (Morgan) Bly, who were both natives of this county also. His father
							is a farmer and lives north of the depot in the same house where Judge John V. Hadley,
							the editor of this work, was born. He was a huckster by trade for eighteen years, but
							within the last few years he has been operating a farm, which is owned jointly by
							himself and son, A. E. Bly. The grandfather of Mr. Bly was Joseph Bly, a native of
							Crab Orchard, Kentucky, who came to this county when a young man and settled at North
							Belleville, where he followed the occupation of a farmer all his life. He was married
							to Mary Powers, and to them were born several children, Joshua, Joseph, William, John,
							Jane, Lizzie and one child who died in infancy. Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Bly reared a very
							interesting family of eight children: Alta, the wife of Frank Stout, of Indianapolis;
							John Dott, who died November 29, 1905, at Phoenix, Arizona, had been associated with
							A. Emmett in the dry goods business for some years. They started in business together
							in August, 1896. The two brothers had been agents for the Indianapolis <hi rend="i"
								>News, Sun</hi> and <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, and their mercantile success was
							formed upon the pennies earned and saved in the sale of newspapers. They <pb
								id="VAC1000-441" n="412"/> won the state prize from the Indianapolis <hi rend="i"
								>News</hi> for the largest number of sales. John Dott Bly was born July 22, 1877,
							and was cut off in early manhood when he was, giving great promise of a brilliant
							career. He was superintendent of the Sunday school, very active in the fraternal order
							of the Knights of Pythias, and an exceptionally bright young man. The third child of
							Joseph Bly is A. Emmett, the immediate subject of this sketch; Daisy, the wife of
							Robert Copeland, of Plainfield; Ralph, assistant cashier of the First National Bank of
							Plainfield; Robert, who is employed in the Boys' Reform School at Plainfield; Okal,
							wife of Frank Waggoner, and an infant child who died at the age of three weeks.</p>

						<p>A. Emmett Bly was born on his father's farm and educated in the public schools of his
							home county and attended the Central Academy at Plainfield. At an early age he engaged
							in the mercantile business, purchasing the small stock of dry goods owned by W. E.
							Phillips, when he was only seventeen years of age. A few days later his brother, John
							Dott, eighteen years old, who had been mentioned before, came into the business as an
							equal partner and the store was a money maker from the beginning. The two youthful
							merchants seemed to have the innate ability which characterizes successful business
							men and their success was assured from the start. No more popular young men ever
							started in business in Plainfield than the two Bly brothers, and their business
							transactions were such as to win for them the confidence of their rapidly increasing
							patronage. Mr. Bly now carries a large and well selected stock of goods, valued at
							fifteen thousand dollars, and enjoys his full share of the patronage of the people of
							his vicinity in the lines which he handles. He is splendidly qualified in every
							respect for a business career, and by his unfailing courtesy and untiring and
							persistent industry, systematic and honorable methods, he has gained the confidence
							and respect of all with whom he has come in contact.</p>

						<p>A. Emmett Bly was married on June 25, 1905, to Louise Juanita Lowry, the daughter of
							Orville and Frances (Utterback) Lowry, and to this happy union there have been born
							two children, Karl Dott, born February 26, 1910, and Melba, born March 4, 1912. The
							family residence is one of the most attractive and comfortable modern homes in
							Plainfield, and here the many friends of the family are delighted to gather, where
							they are always assured of a hearty welcome and an enjoyable hour. Mrs. Bly is a woman
							of many gracious qualities of character and possesses intellectual ability of a high
							order. She is an ideal wife and mother, and her husband attributes no small amount of
							his success to the comfort and counsel of his wife.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-442" n="413"/>

						<p>Mr. Bly's remarkable success in business has brought him into close connection with
							the financial life of his community. He is now a director in the Citizens State Bank
							of Plainfield, has landed interests in Texas, Georgia, and in his home county, where
							he and his father own one hundred and four acres. His interest in education and the
							intellectual advancement of his community is shown in the fact of his live interest in
							the public library of his town. He is now a member of the library board. Officially,
							he is connected with the township advisory board of Guilford township as its
							secretary. His father was trustee of this township in 1904, and made an excellent
							record in that important office. When he took charge of the office, the township was
							in debt, and he not only repaired the roads of the township and made many
							improvements, but cleared off the indebtedness of the township and left a large
							surplus at the end of his term of office. Mr. Bly is a member of the Friends church
							and contributes generously of his means to its support. Fraternally, he is a member of
							the Improved Order of Red Men, Independent Order of Odd Fellows and Free and Accepted
							Masons. His political party has recognized his influence and ability by selecting him
							as a delegate to the state convention, and he has for many years been a delegate to
							the Republican conventions, both county and state.</p>

						<p>The success of A. Emmett Bly is a real story and needs no flattering statements to
							show what may be accomplished by a genuine lover of good, honest work. His rise from a
							country newsboy to a leading merchant and substantial citizen while yet a young man is
							a story of fact rarely equaled even in this day of phenomenal successes, and yet
							through it all he has maintained that sympathy with his fellow citizens which endears
							him to everyone with whom he comes in contact. Personally, he is a pleasant gentleman
							and is not only held in high esteem for his abilities, but for his public-spirited
							nature, his wholesome private and social life and his position is secure as one of
							Hendricks county's most influential citizens.</p>

						<p>There is no class to whom greater gratitude is due from the world at large than the
							self-sacrificing, sympathetic, noble-minded men whose life work is the alleviation of
							suffering and the ministering of comfort to the afflicted, to the end that the span of
							human life may be lengthened and a <pb id="VAC1000-443" n="414"/> great degree of
							satisfaction enjoyed during, the remainder of their earthly sojourn. There is no
							standard by which their beneficent influence can be measured; their helpfulness is
							limited only by the extent of their knowledge and skill, while their power goes hand
							in hand with the wonderful laws of nature that spring from the very source of life
							itself. Some one has aptly said, "He serves God best who serves humanity most." Among
							the physicians and surgeons of Hendricks county, Indiana, who have risen to eminence
							in their chosen field of endeavor is the subject of this review, whose career has been
							that of a broad-minded, conscientious worker in the sphere to which his life and
							energies have been devoted and whose profound knowledge of his profession has won for
							him a leading place among the most distinguished medical men of his day and generation
							in the city of his residence.</p>

						<p>Dr. Ernest Cooper, the son of William B. and Rachel (Ritter) Cooper, was born in
							Guilford township, Hendricks county, Indiana, June 8, 1870. His father was a native of
							North Carolina and his mother of Hendricks county, Indiana. William Cooper came to
							Hendricks county in 1850, when about eighteen years of age, driving through in a
							wagon. He was a farmer all his life and continued that occupation until his death,
							which occurred in 1893, at the age of sixty-one, his wife having preceded him in death
							in 1879, at the age of thirty-eight. To Mr. and Mrs. William Cooper were born twelve
							children, four of whom are living: Mrs. Etta Wolfe, of Clearwater, Florida; G. A., of
							Oregon; Everett, of Escondido, California, and Ernest.</p>

						<p>Ernest Cooper was reared on the home farm and enjoyed all the pleasures which fall to
							the lot of the ordinary farmer's boy. He secured his elementary education in the
							district schools of his township, and at the age of nineteen entered the Central
							Academy at Plainfield, this county, working his way through the four-years high school
							course. After his graduation, in 1893, he taught school in his home township for two
							years and worked on his uncle's farm in the summer seasons. While he was attending the
							school at Plainfield he slept in a doctor's office and here he got his first taste of
							medical life. Although he had but little money, he was determined to secure a medical
							education, and with that end in view he entered the Indiana Medical School at
							Indianapolis in 1895 and worked his way through, finishing with the class of 1898.
							Upon the outbreak of the Spanish-American war he enlisted as a private in the hospital
							corps of the regular army and served during the summer and fall of 1898. Within the
							first four weeks of his <pb id="VAC1000-444" n="415"/> service he was promoted to
							acting hospital steward and mustered out as such. Returning to his home county, he
							began the active practice of medicine at Plainfield as a partner of Doctor Carter and
							continued this partnership for the next seven years, since which time he has practiced
							alone. He has built up gradually a large and lucrative practice, and in 1911 he built
							his present modernly equipped office brick building, which is fully equipped for
							general practice and all kinds of surgical work. At the present time he is in charge
							of the Boys' Reform School at Plainfield, and has had this important position for the
							past five years. He has served four years on the pension board, several years as
							health officer, and is also surgeon for the Terre Haute, Indianapolis &amp; Eastern
							Traction Company at Plainfield.</p>

						<p>Doctor Cooper was married on June 12, 1900, to Eleanor Hanna, daughter of Hon. John
							Hanna, ex-congressman and one of the notable men of Indiana. Doctor and Mrs. Cooper
							are the parents of two daughters, Portia E., aged ten years, and Lucia V., aged
							seven.</p>

						<p>Doctor Cooper is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons, the Knights of Pythias and
							Improved Order of Red Men, and takes a very active interest in lodge circles, for the
							past seven years having been treasurer of the Masonic lodge at Plainfield. He is a
							member of the Hendricks County, State and American medical associations. He and his
							wife hold affiliations with the Friends church and contribute generously of their
							means to its support. He has been a life-long Republican in politics, but, in
							accordance with the usual custom of physicians, he does not take an active part in
							political affairs, deeming it better to devote all of his time and attention to the
							medical practice.</p>

						<p>Doctor Cooper has won his success only through hard work and diligent study. His life
							history is the history of a man who has struggled through his boyhood and manhood to
							attain the position which he holds today. He met with a very unfortunate mishap on
							July 22, 1910, when an accidental discharge of a shotgun so crippled his left leg that
							it was necessary to amputate it. The fortitude which he showed upon this occasion is
							characteristic of the indomitable courage of the man and stamped him as a man of
							unusual character. His whole life has been one of struggle, and now that he has
							reached a place where his practice is sufficiently lucrative to enable him to enjoy
							life he takes a supreme pleasure in helping those less fortunate. He and his good wife
							are the centers of a happy home and dispense hospitality to a large circle of friends
							and acquaintances.</p>

						<p>The office of biography is not to give voice to a man's modest estimate of himself
							and his accomplishments, but rather to leave upon the record the verdict establishing
							his character by the consensus of opinion on the part of his neighbors and fellow
							citizens. In touching upon the life history of the subject of this sketch the writer
							aims to avoid fulsome encomium and extravagant praise; yet he desires to hold up for
							consideration those facts which have shown the distinction of a true, useful and
							honorable life-- a life characterized by perseverance, energy, broad charity and
							well-defined purpose. To do this will be but to reiterate the dictum pronounced upon
							the man by the people who have known him long and well.</p>

						<p>Jacob E. O'Neal, the son of William H. and Elizabeth (Keller) O'Neal, was born in
							Putnam county, Indiana, January 18, 1863. He died August 27, 1907, and she lives with
							her children. William O'Neal was not fortunate enough to receive very much schooling,
							but was given a practical education at home. He hired out by the month until grown,
							then was married and at the beginning of the Civil War he enlisted in Company K, One
							Hundred Forty-eighth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and served until the close
							of the war. Prior to the war he married Elizabeth Keller, the daughter of John Keller,
							and to this union there were born nine children: Naomi, wife of Mahlon Sechman;
							Florence, wife of John Robinson; Lorenzo, who married Sarah Knetzer; Mary, wife of
							Phillip Masten; Robert; William S. married Ida Bryant; Julia, wife of Oliver P.
							Phillips; Nora B., wife of Dayton Kersey, and Jacob E., the immediate subject of this
							sketch.</p>

						<p>Jacob E. O'Neal received his elementary education in the district schools of Putnam
							and Hendricks counties and after leaving school worked on the farm with his father
							until his marriage. He then rented a farm and, by strict management and sound
							judgment, he was sufficiently successful to enable him to purchase his present farm of
							one hundred eight acres in 1900. As a farmer he has made a pronounced success and is
							considered one of the successful stock raisers of the county.</p>

						<p>Mr. O'Neal was married to Anna J. Harlan, the daughter of Jesse E. and Jemima
							(Robinson) Harlan, and to their marriage have been born three children, Claude E.,
							Frank H. and Sadie F. Claude, who is a professor in the Ohio Wesleyan University at
							Delaware, Ohio, married Mabel Hostetter. Frank is still under the parental roof. Sadie
							married Schuyler Arnold and will live in Stilesville.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-446" n="417"/>

						<p>Jesse Harlan, father of Mrs. O'Neal, was born in North Carolina and his wife, Jemima
							Robinson, was a native of Kentucky, and they were the parents of twelve children:
							William R., who died in infancy; Benjamin F., who married Ella Kendall; Levi, who
							married Flora Pike; Henry, who married Ella Lisby; Lydia, who became the wife of
							Willett Klein; Sarah, wife of Frank Snodgrass; Mary, who became the wife of Smith
							Harlan; Charles, who married Lora Wise; Anna, wife of Jacob E. O'Neal; Clara, wife of
							Marion Grimes; Retta, wife of Virgil Rollings; Lula, unmarried. Mr. Harlan lives in
							Clay township; his wife died on July 30, 1895.</p>

						<p>The paternal grandparents of Mr. O'Neal had a family of seven children, James,
							George, William H. (the father of Mr. O'Neal), Henry, Lavina, Elizabeth and Emmeline.
							Mr. O'Neal's maternal grandparents reared nine children, John, Steven, Jesse, Enoch,
							James, Elizabeth, Melinda, Marion and Rachel.</p>

						<p>Mr. O'Neal is a member of the Progressive party, having allied himself with that new
							organization in the fall of 1912. He is a member of the Independent Order of Odd
							Fellows and the Modern Woodmen of America, while, religiously, he and his wife are
							consistent members of the Methodist Episcopal church at Coatesville, Indiana, and are
							actively interested in the various organizations of that church. Mr. O'Neal has always
							taken an active interest in political life and has been assessor of his home township
							for four years and county treasurer for two years, performing the important duties of
							these offices in a very satisfactory manner. In his public career, as well as in his
							private life, he has been a man who conducted all of his business in a straightforward
							and upright manner, thereby winning the esteem of his fellow citizens.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">SANDERS SMITH.</hi></head>

						<p>The following is a sketch of a plain, honest man of affairs, who, by correct living
							and a strict regard for the interests of his patrons, has made his influence felt in
							Plainfield and won for himself distinctive prestige in the professional circles of
							that city. He would be the last man to sit for romance or become the subject of fancy
							sketches, nevertheless his life presents much that is interesting and valuable and may
							be studied with profit by the young, whose careers are yet to be achieved. He is one
							of those whose integrity and strength of character must force them into an admirable
							notoriety, which <pb id="VAC1000-447" n="418"/> their modesty never seeks, who command
							the respect of their contemporaries and their posterity and leave the impress of their
							individuality deeply stamped upon the community.</p>

						<p>Sanders Smith, the restaurant man of Plainfield, and one of the most public-spirited
							citizens of that little city, was born February 18, 1854, near Hall, Morgan county,
							Indiana. His parents were Henry B. and Jane (Carder) Smith, his father being a native
							of Kentucky and his mother of Indiana. Henry Smith was one of the best farmers of
							Morgan county, and spent all of his life tilling the soil in that county, his death
							occurring there May 13, 1910. Henry Smith was a Democrat of the old school and was a
							man of more than ordinary education and strength of character. He and his wife were
							loyal members of the Christian church and great students of the Bible. His wife was
							one of the best informed Bible students in the county where they lived and was a
							daughter of John Carder, who was probably the best Bible student in this section of
							the state. Mr. and Mrs. Henry Smith were the parents of nine children, five of whom
							are living: Sanders, the immediate subject of this sketch; Harvey M., of Mooresville,
							Indiana; Stephen, of New Orleans; Henry K., of Hall, Morgan county, this state; Rena
							Smith, of Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>Sanders Smith was born and reared on his father's farm and received all his education
							upon the farm and in the district schools of his home neighborhood. He continued
							working on the home farm until he was twenty-four years of age, at times working for
							farmers in the vicinity of his home for a few months at a time. He also clerked in a
							store at Hall, Indiana, for about two years, and in 1881 he came to Plainfield and
							established a restaurant and confectionery store. In 1886 he concluded he could better
							his fortunes by removing to Danville, and the next four years of his life were spent
							in that city, where he operated a restaurant and confectionery store on the east side
							of the public square. However, in 1890, he decided to return to Plainfield, and he has
							continued in the restaurant and confectionery business in that place since. He now has
							a building of his own and has one of the most complete and fully equipped restaurants
							and soda fountains in the state. He freezes his own cream by electricity and has
							installed all the latest devices for the convenience of his patrons, having an
							equipment which will compare favorably with any town of the size of Plainfield in the
							state.</p>

						<p>Mr. Smith was married March 25, 1875, to Olive L. Seaton, daughter of George W.
							Seaton, of Morgan county, this state, and to this union there has been born one
							daughter, Iva E. Seaman, the wife of Dr. H. L. Seaman, <pb id="VAC1000-448" n="419"/>
							who is now living with her father. Mrs. Seaman has one daughter, Olive Emma.</p>

						<p>Mr. Smith takes an active interest in politics and is a Democrat of the Bryan-Wilson
							stamp, believing thoroughly in the motto of having the people rule. He attended the
							Denver convention in 1908, and also the inauguration of President Wilson, in March,
							1913. His party has tried to prevail upon him to accept office, at different times,
							but he has always refused. He is well posted on all public questions of the day and
							has a knowledge of all the important issues, which makes him a very entertaining
							conversationalist. He is one of the most influential factors in the councils of his
							party in his section of the county, and his opinion is always sought during the
							campaigns. Fraternally, he is a member of the Knights of Pythias, and at present is
							master of exchequer of Plainfield Lodge No. 50. He is also a member of Uniform Rank
							No. 33, of Plainfield. He has been active in the Knights of Pythias work for many
							years and helped to build the present castle hall in his home town. Mr. Smith is one
							of the most progressive civic workers in the town and helped to get the present town
							incorporated and was one of the men who led the fight for water works and electric
							lights, sidewalks and other improvements. During his whole life in Plainfield he has
							tried to make the town a better place to live in and how well he has succeeded is very
							apparent to the casual visitor. Such men as Mr. Smith are a blessing to the community
							in which they live, and the study of the career of such a man should be of help to the
							young men who are to become the future citizens of Plainfield and the surrounding
							community. Mr. Smith is a genial man in his relations with his fellow citizens, and
							because of his high character has won the esteem of a large circle of friends and
							acquaintances which he has scattered thoroughout the county.</p>

						<p>It is proper to judge of the success of a man's life by the estimation in which he is
							held by his fellow citizens. They see him at his work, in his family circle, in
							church, hear his views on public questions, observe the operation of his code of
							morals, witness how he conducts himself in all the relations of society and
							civilization and are, therefore, competent to judge of his merits and demerits. After
							a long course of years of such daily observation, it would be out of the question for
							his neighbors not to know <pb id="VAC1000-449" n="420"/> of his worth, for, as has
							been said, "actions speak louder than words." In this connection it is not too much to
							say that the immediate subject of this sketch has passed a life of all unusual honor,
							that he has been industrious and has the confidence of all who have the pleasure of
							his acquaintance.</p>

						<p>William W. Sawyer, a life-long farmer, now living in comfortable retirement in
							Clayton, Hendricks countty, Indiana, was born on October 23, 1846, near Hazelwood,
							this county, the son of John and Nancy (Martin) Sawyer. John Sawyer was a native of
							Randolph county, North Carolina, born in 1794, and died in this county in 1869 at the
							age of seventy-five years. He received his early education in the schools of his
							native state, coming to Indiana soon after his marriage. He first settled in Marion
							county and entered land from the government in different places in the state, and some
							time in the thirties he came to this county, where he passed the remainder of his
							life. He was twice married. By his first wife he became the father of six children,
							namely: Iredel, Eli, Irena, Nathan, Elizabeth and John, Jr., all of whom have passed
							from this life. His second wife was Nancy Martin, also a native of North Carolina and
							the daughter of John B. and Jane (Cravens) Martin. She died in the winter of 1892, on
							January 21st, at the age of seventy-seven years. She was the mother of eight children,
							but one of whom besides the subject is living, Araminta. Those deceased are Eliza,
							Mary, Rhoda, Theodore, James C., and Daniel C., who died at the front during the Civil
							War. John Sawyer followed the vocation of farming all his life and was an honored man
							in the community. After the Republican party came into existence he was a strong
							advocate of its principles, but never took an active part in the administration of its
							affairs. He was a faithful member of the Methodist Episcopal church and a man of
							influence in his locality.</p>

						<p>William W. Sawyer passed the years of his early youth on the homestead, in this
							county, and at the opening of hostilities, at the beginning of the Civil War, fired
							with love for his country, he enlisted in August, 1862, for three years in Company G,
							Ninety-ninth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry. He served in the Army of the
							Tennessee under General Sherman and also, under the leadership of that great man, he
							made the famous march to the sea. He was captured en route at Statesboro, Georgia, on
							December 4, 1864, and sent to the rebel prison, at Florence, South Carolina. At the
							time of his capture he was detailed as a mounted scout and as such was taken by the
							enemy. On March 1, 1865, he was paroled and remained as a paroled prisoner until the
							close of the war, when he was mustered out of <pb id="VAC1000-450" n="421"/> service
							and received his honorable discharge, at Camp Chase, Ohio, on June 18, 1865. On August
							13, 1864, during the siege of Atlanta, he was wounded in the leg and received an
							injury in the head at the battle of Jonesboro, on September 1, 1864. However, he did
							not go to a hospital with either of these injuries. After the close of the war, Mr.
							Sawyer returned to his native county, where he engaged in farming, which line of work
							he followed all his active life, living in the vicinity of Hazelwood, Liberty
							township, this county. He has been highly successful and has owned land in both
							Hendricks and Morgan counties. In 1913 he disposed of his farming interests and, with
							his family, moved to Clayton, there to spend his remaining days in well deserved rest
							from the active duties of life.</p>

						<p>On April 16, 1867, Mr. Sawyer was united in marriage with Martha York, a daughter of
							Nathan and Rebecca (Folgeman) York, born on December 9, 1849. Nathan York was a native
							of North Carolina and came to this state, and perhaps this county, with his parents
							when but a young man. His father, Barney York, entered land from the government, in
							Liberty township, and there it was that Nathan York grew to manhood. He was born in
							North Carolina, in 1820, and died on his farm, in this county, on August 30, 1896, at
							the age of seventy-six years. In this county he met and married Rebecca Fogleman, also
							a native of North,Carolina, who had come with her parents to this state, making the
							journey overland in a cart. They settled first in Morgan county. When her grandfather,
							Barney York, arrived in this county he found himself possessed of but ten cents, not
							considering his most valuable assets in the way of unlimited energy and ambition. He
							succeeded so well in his efforts that he became possessed of considerable land and at
							his death left forty acres to each of his children. Rebecca (Fogleman) York, who was
							born in 1833, died in this county in 1884. She was the mother of twelve children,
							three of whom have passed away, being Francis Marion, Laura and Oscar. Those remaining
							besides Martha, wife of the immediate subject of this sketch, are: Amanda (Mrs.
							Richardson), Asbury, Sylvester, Lucinda Ella (Mrs. Kwitt), Mary Alice (Mrs. Rhodes),
							Louisa (Mrs. Brantlinger), Dayton and Myrtle.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer are the parents of twelve children, as follows: Jerome T., born
							in 1868, died in 1872; Ida Belle, born in 1870; Dayton M., born in 1872; Minta A.,
							born in 1874 and died the same year; Walter, born in 1875; Arlington, born in 1878 and
							died in 1881; Charles, born in 1881 and died the same year; Mary Myrtle, born in 1882
							and died in 1897; Oscar, born in 1885 and died the same year; Vonnie O., born in 1886
							and died in 1888; <pb id="VAC1000-451" n="422"/> Arthur, born in 1888, and Viola, born
							in 1891. Ida Belle, the eldest daughter, became the wife of Robert M. Kwitt, a farmer
							living close to Hazelwood, this county. They are the parents of six children, one of

						<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer are consistent members of the Missionary Baptist church at

							holding his membership in blue lodge No. 463, at Clayton, in the workings of which he
							is keenly interested. Politically, he is a Democrat and has ever had an active
							interest in local politics. Mr. Sawyer is a most agreeable man to meet, of pleasing
							personality and kindly address. These are merely the outward indications of a heart in
							tune with the world and with broad sympathies for his fellow men. He is a man well
							informed on current events of the day, both at home and abroad, and takes keen delight
							in promoting any cause having, at its ultimate object, <pb id="VAC1000-452" n="423"/>
							the uplift of mankind in any way whatsoever. Mr. Sawyer has the unqualified admiration
							and esteem of all who know him, which is a fitting tribute of which he is eminently
							worthy. To live for years in one community and steadily rise in public estimation
							indicates that the recipient of this gratifying regard has so lived as to be truly
							worthy of it. It means a life, the principles of which have been the highest along all
							lines; it means helpfulness and charity in the broadest sense for friends and

						<head><hi rend="center">REV. ROBERT NATHAN HARVEY.</hi></head>

						<p>No estimate of the immense amount of good that comes from a long, active and useful
							life like that of Rev. Robert Nathan Harvey, the well known minister of Clayton,
							Hendricks county, Indiana, can be made, for it is far-reaching in its effects and will
							continue through coming generations, like the "light that shines more and more unto
							the perfect day." Few lives have been so unselfish, so pregnated with good deeds and
							so controlled by an insatiable desire to be kind and beneficial to his fellow men,
							but, notwithstanding the unbounded influence he wields in moulding public opinion and
							of the high tributes of praise freely accorded him by a vast horde of admirers
							wherever he is known, he is entirely unassuming and unpretentious, content in the
							thought that he is continuously putting forth his best efforts in following the
							footsteps of the lowly Nazarene.</p>

						<p>Rev. Robert Nathan Harvey, a retired minister of the Baptist church, was born in
							Wayne county, Indiana, April 26, 1831, and is now living in quiet retirement at
							Clayton, Hendricks county, this state. His parents were Robert and Abigail (Sumner)
							Harvey, the father a native of North Carolina, where his birth occurred July 12, 1789,
							and his mother was born in Virginia, July 4, 1791. They were married August 25, 1814,
							and soon after their marriage they came west and settled on Noland's fork, in Wayne
							county, Indiana, where they lived until September, 1836, when they moved to Hendricks
							county. They came in wagons and drove their live stock with them. They located a half
							mile north of Pecksburg, where they bought three hundred and twenty acres of land from
							Jehu Hadley, only a few acres of which had been cleared. There they reared a family of
							seven daughters and three sons. The mother spun the flax and carded the wool to make
							the clothes for the family and was regarded as one of the experts in this line. In
							1856, at the third annual fair of Hendricks county, she won the first and <pb
								id="VAC1000-453" n="424"/> second premiums on linsey, which was woven by herself.
							The oldest son, Jonathan S., studied law and practiced for years in LaPorte county,
							Indiana, going then to Danville, where he was elected to the Legislature. He was a
							member of both the House of Representatives and the Senate and several years before
							the war was elected treasurer of state on the Whig ticket. At the time he made his
							race for this office, one of his political opponents said of him that "God never made
							an honester man than he." Robert Harvey, Sr., farmed all his life on the farm where he
							first settled in 1836, his death occurring in 1871, his wife surviving him one
							year.</p>

						<p>Rev. Robert Nathan Harvey grew up on his father's home farm and early in life learned
							the blacksmith's trade at Danville, after which he erected a blacksmith shop at
							Clayton before the town was laid out. He was at Clay ton when the town was platted and
							laid out and bought a town lot, and sometime afterward traded his town lot for
							furniture to go to housekeeping with.</p>

						<p>Mr. Harvey was married September 26, 1852, to Sarah Ann Shirley, who was born at
							Gosport, Indiana, October 20, 1833, the daughter of William and Mary (Worrell)
							Shirley. Her father and mother were both reared in Kentucky and married there. Her
							father followed the trade of a tailor until late in life. When Mrs. Harvey was seven
							years of age her parents moved to Belleville, in this county, where her father gave up
							his trade as a tailor and engaged in farming near Clayton. After his children grew up
							he went into the dry goods business at Pecksburg, and was engaged in that line of
							business until his death. After Mr. and Mrs. Harvey were married they lived on the
							farm and he farmed and operated a blacksmith shop, which occupations he continued to
							follow for the next twelve years, at which time he bought forty acres of land near the
							village of Pecksburg and on this farm lived until December 28, 1912, at which time his
							house and all its contents were destroyed by fire, causing a loss of three thousand
							dollars, with only an insurance of eight hundred dollars. At that time he bought his
							present home in Clayton.</p>

						<p>Mr. Harvey joined the Baptist church at Clayton in 1861, at a time when the church at
							Amo was being organized. He and eight others became the charter members of this church
							in 1866 at Amo, and now there are only three of the charter members of this church
							left, Mr. Harvey and his wife and Melissa Justus. On July 29, 1869, Mr. Harvey was
							ordained to the ministry of the Baptist church and was stationed at New Bethel, Putnam
							county, Indiana. From that time for the next thirty-five years he was never without a
							charge and during his entire pastorate was in charge of fourteen <pb id="VAC1000-454"
								n="425"/> of the twenty-one churches in the White Lick Association, spending eleven
							years as pastor of the Lawrence Baptist church and eight years at Brookfield. For
							twenty-three consecutive years he was moderator of the White Lick Baptist Association
							and for three years was moderator of the Indianapolis Baptist Association.</p>

						<p>Reverend and Mrs. Harvey have been the parents of three children, the youngest, Frank
							Lincoln, dying at the age of eight months, the other two children being George A., of
							Clayton, and Dr. W. D. Harvey, who is president of the Indianapolis Regalia Company.
							Doctor Harvey was a successful physician before he went into his present business, and
							is equally successful in his new profession. Doctor Harvey married Cecelia Hadley, who
							died leaving one child, and he afterwards married Lydia Theal. George Harvey, the
							oldest son of Rev. R. N. and Mrs. Harvey, was for many years a dealer in threshing
							machines and engines at St. Louis, Missouri. He now lives in Clayton and has a fine
							farm two and one-half miles southwest of that town. He was married in 1875 to Lucy M.
							West, the daughter of Columbus and Tabitha (Staley) West. Columbus West was born one
							mile south of Pecksburg, this county, and was the son of Abraham and Sina (Hadley)
							West. Tabitha Staley was born in Morgan county, Indiana, the daughter of Eli and Mary
							(Tripps) Staley, who came to Morgan county, Indiana, from North Carolina in pioneer
							times. George Harvey and wife have one child, Herbert S., born in 1877, who married
							Fannie, Harkrider, and they have one son, Raymond.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Harvey have been married over sixty-three years. All the friends of
							their youth have passed away and gone. He is the last one of the family living. During
							the course of his life of nearly four score years in this state there has never been
							raised the breath of suspicion against his name. He has taken a prominent part in
							public life during his whole career and has been county commissioner and for years was
							justice of the peace of Clay township. No case which he tried was ever appealed,
							showing that he used good judgment in his decisions. He married hundreds and hundreds
							of couples and only five of them were ever divorced. On his eighty-second birthday he
							was remembered by people from all over the United States, and one hundred and
							sixty-three cards of congratulation from his church members, showing the high esteem
							and affection in which he is regarded by his many friends. It is interesting to note
							that in all of the churches in which he has officiated there has never been any
							quarrel in the church, a fact which speaks well for his tact and good judgment in
							handling his congregations.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-455" n="426"/>

						<p>Rev. R. N. Harvey has always been interested as a public citizen in politics and cast
							his first vote in 1852 for Scott, and has never missed voting for a Republican
							candidate for President since that time and only missed two elections in the township.
							He attends all primaries and local conventions and, all in all, he is a man who has
							devoted his high talent to worthy purpose and when he "wraps the drapery of his couch
							about him and lies down to pleasant dreams," the community will have lost one of its
							best loved characters.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JESSE S. OGDEN.</hi></head>

						<p>It is eminently fitting to judge of the success of a man's life by the estimation in
							which he is held by his fellow citizens. They see him at his work, in his family
							circle, in church, hear his views on public questions, observe the operation of his
							code of morals, witness how he conducts himself in all the relations of society and
							civilization, and are therefore competent to judge of his merits and demerits. After a
							long course of years of such daily observation it would be out of the question for his
							neighbors not to know of his worth, for it has been truly said that "actions speak
							louder than words." It is safe to say that no man in Hendricks county wielded so much
							influence for a man of his age as did the late Jesse S. Ogden, who died in that county
							in 1877, at the early age of thirty-seven years. He was a man among men and "the
							elements so mixed in him that the whole world might stand up and say, This was a
							man."</p>

						<p>Jesse S. Ogden, the son of Mr. and Mrs. John Ogden, was born in West Virginia, near
							Winchester, in 1839, and died February lo, 1877, just at the time when he was at the
							height of his success and popularity. The Ogden family trace their lineage back to
							colonial times and the members of his family occupied many places of trust and
							responsibility in the history of early Virginia. John Odgen and his family came to
							Indiana and settled in Hendricks county early in its history. Jesse S. Ogden was
							educated in the public schools of Danville, the Danville Academy and the Northwestern
							Law School at Indianapolis. His education was interrupted by the opening of the Civil
							War and he laid aside his books for the musket and answered the call of Governor
							Morton for troops. He enlisted in Company H, Seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer
							Infantry, and served until he was wounded at the battle of Winchester, Virginia. After
							he was mustered out of the service <pb id="VAC1000-456" n="427"/> on account of
							disability he returned to Hendricks county, Indiana, where he continued to reside
							until his death. He completed his legal education in Indianapolis and then formed a
							partnership with Judge John V. Hadley. Immediately after the close of the war he was
							elected recorder of Hendricks county and later prosecuting attorney of his home
							county. He was always interested in the principles of the Republican party and was
							honored by being elected to the House of Representatives in 1874. He had a brilliant
							career before him and would undoubtedly have occupied a much higher place in the
							political and official life of Indiana had he not died at such an early age. He was a
							member of the Free and Accepted Masons, and in his church affiliations was identified
							with the Methodist Episcopal church. His widow is still living and makes her home with
							her son, Rev. Horace G. Ogden, at Jamestown, New York.</p>

						<p>Jesse S. Ogden was married to Mary A. Carter, of Danville, and to this union were
							born three children, Rev. Horace G., D. D., of Jamestown, New York, who is now pastor
							of the first Methodist Episcopal church of that place; Mrs. Adella L. Duvall, of
							Delaware, Ohio, who has won renown as a soprano singer, and James M., a successful
							lawyer of Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>That Jesse S. Ogden was a remarkable man in more ways than one, is indicated in the
							striking document which he wrote a short time before his death. When he was told that
							he did not have much longer to live, he accepted the inevitable decree like a martyr,
							and, looking calmly into the face of death, he composed a creed for the guidance of
							his little children, whom he was about to leave. In all the range of literature and in
							all the annals of Philanthropy there may not be found a more comprehensive summary or
							a stronger code of morals than he composed under such strange conditions, and it is
							safe to say that this document, teeming with a father's love, has fulfilled the
							mission for which the fond father wrote it. In view of the exquisite beauty of
							language and the lofty purity of thought which are embodied in this remarkable
							document, and believing that future generations may profit by the words, it is
							reproduced here just as it was given to his children on January 18, 1877, less than
							one month before his death.</p>

										<salute>"My Dear Children:</salute>

										<p>"If I were to undertake to tell you how much I love you and how solicitous I
											am for your welfare and happiness in this life and in the life to come, you
											could not understand me, for you are too young to comprehend it. It was my
											sincere wish to live long enough to superintend your education <pb
												id="VAC1000-457" n="428"/> and see you fairly started on the perilous
											journey of life. This coveted pleasure will be denied me. You will never know
											what it is to have a father to assist and guide you. You will be compelled to
											struggle unaided and alone, against the many vicissitudes and hardships of
											this life without light or counsel from me. I can not leave you any great
											patrimony and even if I could it might prove to you a curse rather than a
											blessing. Since I leave you nothing more substantial, I thought it prudent to
											cull out of my own limited wisdom and experience some plain and simple maxims
											which, if practiced, I am sure will make you estimable citizens of society and
											prepare you for that eternity whose shadow ever encompasses your
											footsteps.</p>

										<p>"First of all, revere God and keep his commandments.</p>

										<p>"Unite with some church whose tenets accord nearest with your conscience, and
											attend faithfully to your religious duties.</p>

										<p>"Avoid all pomp and bigotry in religion. All true religion is embodied in one
											word-- Charity: charity that embraces God with one arm and all humanity with
											the other. All else is counterfeit.</p>

										<p>"Now let me call your attention more particularly to some plain rules of
											conduct in your relations to society, and for your own personal guidance.</p>

										<p>"Above all things be truthful. And if you are truthful, then you will be
											honest-- and these two constitute the cardinal virtues of a good life.</p>

										<p>"Again, be industrious. Labor assiduously, and complete with thoroughness
											whatever you undertake. Indolence is the mother of poverty, unhappiness and
											crime.</p>

										<p>"Be independent and self-reliant. Learn some independent trade or profession
											where you can receive the rewards of your own industry.</p>

										<p>"Practice economy, without being miserly. Give according to your means to
											worthy objects of charity-and be sure they are worthy.</p>

										<p>"Pay as you go. I repeat it, pay as you go! This is the true secret of all
											substantial success. The percentage of your creditor will make you a bankrupt
											if you run in debt.</p>

										<p>"If possible, secure for yourself a competency, without striving to become
											rich. Get no wealth at the expense of conscience. If fortune should favor you,
											in your prosperity do not forget the poor and needy.</p>

										<p>"Be courteous. Politeness is the highway to popularity and station.</p>

										<p>"Seek the society of the pure and learned; avoid the low and vulgar. Your
											position and standing in society depend on the observance of this rule.</p>

										<p>"Read good books, such as have received the commendation of competent
											critics. Do not stuff yourselves on the current trash of the day-- it is <pb
												id="VAC1000-458" n="429"/> as reprehensible as gluttony. Time is the best
											critic. The books that survive his touch deserve to be studied.</p>

										<p>"Be temperate in all things. Touch not the intoxicating bowl. It is full of
											vice, violence, misery and poverty. I beg you touch it not.</p>

										<p>"Govern your temper. It is a fiery steed, and, unless put under severe
											discipline, will carry you into all manner of difficulties. Coolness is the
											ballast of a wise head.</p>

										<p>"Be cleanly and dress neatly, without ornamentation. The sloven carries with
											him the highest evidence of his thriftlessness and ill breeding, while on the
											other hand the brainless fop is equally abhorrent.</p>

										<p>"Avoid all affectation and dissimulation. Be natural and sincere. Have the
											courage to say 'no' where your honor or integrity might suffer.</p>

										<p>"Economize your time; do not procrastinate. Remember that you can not recall
											a single moment of your lives. There are no pauses in the steady, ceaseless
											revolutions of the ponderous wheel that hurries you on to the end. Make sure,
											then, of each moment, and out of it extract something for your moral,
											intellectual or financial progress. Recreate your minds with manual labor,
											your bodies with study.</p>

										<p>"Remain at home at night. Let me entreat you not to mingle with the vile
											gossiping crowd on the street corners or in some den of iniquity. It is in
											such company that bad habits are contracted and moral depravity has its
											origin.</p>

										<p>"Obey your dear mother in all things. She understands your rights and duties,
											and will make no unreasonable demands of you. Strive to make her life pleasant
											and happy.</p>

										<p>"Last of all, revere your country and obey her laws. Cherish her institutions
											of freedom and the rights of man. If these should be threatened, sacrifice
											your lives rather than see them perish.</p>

										<p>"I might multiply indefinitely the minor duties of life; but I hope by the
											observance of these maxims, you will be actuated by higher motives, a higher
											faith, a broader philanthropy and a sublimer patriotism than myself. God knows
											how sincerely I yearn for such a consummation. If I only knew you would grow
											up into perfect manhood and womanhood I would die content.</p>

										<p>"On each recurring anniversary of my death, I desire you to read this and
											resolve that you will observe these simple precepts with renewed fidelity. As
											you read them, may they be to you as a message direct from my home in that
											celestial city where I expect to take up my everlasting abode.</p>

										<pb id="VAC1000-459" n="430"/>

										<p>"May God bless and preserve you from all harm and save you finally in heaven,
											is my parting benediction. Farewell.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">D. MONROE REYNOLDS, M. D.</hi></head>

						<p>It is not always easy to discover and define the hidden forces that move a life of
							ceaseless activity and large professional success; little more can be done than to
							note their manifestation in the career of the individual under consideration. In view
							of this fact, the life of the successful physician and public-spirited man of affairs
							whose name appears above affords a striking example of well-defined purpose, with the
							ability to make that purpose subserve not only his own ends but the good of his
							fellowmen as well. Doctor Reynolds holds distinctive prestige in a calling which
							requires for its basis sound mentality and intellectual discipline of a high order,
							supplemented by the rigid professional training and thorough mastery of technical
							knowledge, with the skill to apply the same, without which one cannot hope to rise
							above mediocrity in ministering to human ills. In his chosen field of endeavor, Doctor
							Reynolds has achieved a notable success and an eminent standing among the medical men
							of his county. In addition to his creditable career in one of the most useful and
							exacting of professions, he has also proved an honorable member of the body politic,
							rising in the confidence and esteem of the public, and in every relation of life he
							has never fallen below the dignity of true manhood nor in any way resorted to methods
							that have invited criticism or censure.</p>

						<p>D. Monroe Reynolds was born at Georgetown, Illinois, on August 28, 1877, the son of
							William P. and Angeline (Holliday) Reynolds, the former of whom was born at
							Bloomingdale, Parke county, this state, in 1844, and was the son of Mahlon and
								<milestone unit="typography" n="-------"/>(Reubottom) Reynolds, who came to Indiana
							from North Carolina and passed the remainder of their lives in Parke county. William
							P. Reynolds grew to manhood on his father's farm, in Parke county, and later went to
							Vermillion county, Illinois, where he purchased a farm and also worked at the
							carpenter's trade. It was there he <pb id="VAC1000-460" n="431"/> met and married
							Angeline Holliday, who was a native of that county and a daughter of William and
							Elizabeth (Hayworth) Holliday. Her parents came to Illinois from North Carolina.
							William P. Reynolds and wife remained in Illinois for a number of years and about the
							year 1904 they returned to Indiana and located near Mooresville, where they now
							reside.</p>

						<p>D. Monroe Reynolds passed his boyhood days on the homestead in Illinois, attending
							the township schools, where he received his elementary education, and later attending
							the Vermillion Academy, at Vermillion Grove, that state. Having decided to make the
							practice of medicine his life work, he matriculated in the Indiana Medical College, at
							Indianapolis, from which seat of learning he was graduated in the year 1900. For one
							year after graduation he was an interne at Saint Vincent's Hospital, in Indianapolis,
							and after completing his course there he located in Clayton, Hendricks county,
							Indiana, where he has since resided in the practice of his chosen profession. In 1902
							Doctor Reynolds was united in marriage with Joanna Buchanan, born at Huntington, this
							state, a daughter of Samuel Buchanan and wife. She passed her girlhood in her native
							town, attending its schools and, being a young woman of intelligence with a broad
							outlook on life, decided to enter the ranks of trained nurses. She was received for
							training in Saint Vincent's Hospital, Indianapolis, and it was there she and Doctor
							Reynolds first met. Doctor Reynolds and wife have one son, Russell Perry, a remarkably
							interesting child of four years. In addition to his professional duties, Doctor
							Reynolds gives attention to the operation of a farm, comprising two hundred acres,
							which he owns near the town of Mooresville, this state. Up-to-date methods of
							agriculture are followed in handling the business of this farm. Doctor Reynolds is
							also interested in the People's Bank, at Clayton, which he assisted in organizing in
							the fall of 1912. Doctor Reynolds' career, since locating in Clayton, has not only
							been successful from a scientific standpoint, but he has gained for himself the
							sincere regard and confidence of the entire community. A high order of skill in his
							calling, a broad-minded sympathy with the sick and suffering and an earnest desire to
							help others, have combined to make him unusually successful and he is held in the
							highest esteem by his brother physicians because of his genuine worth. Genial and
							cheerful, he carries sunshine and comfort into every sick-room which he enters,
							winning at once the confidence and co-operation of his patients. Indeed, he is a
							welcome visitor in any company which he chooses to enter, for he possesses to an
							eminent degree those qualities which commend a person to the good will of others.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-461" n="432"/>

						<p>Fraternally, Doctor Reynolds is affiliated with the Free and Accepted Masons, having
							attained the Royal Arch degree in the York Rite bodies, has the thirty-second or
							Scottish Rite degree and is a Noble of the Mystic Shrine. Doctor Reynolds was reared
							in the Quaker faith, his father being a member of the Old-Style church and his mother
							of the progressive branch, but in 1913 Doctor Reynolds identified himself with the
							Presbyterian church, of which Mrs. Reynolds also is a member, both taking an active
							part in the affairs of the church and doing all within their power to forward its
							work. Doctor Reynolds is still a young man and his useful life, as one of the world's
							workers, has been one of devotion to his calling, with an earnest desire to assist in
							the betterment of his community along moral, educational and material lines as well.
							The opening vista of years holds much of promise for him and, through him, for the
							community honored by his residence.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">WILLIAM COSNER.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the men who have been material factors in the development of Hendricks county,
							there is no one who occupied a more prominent position than the late William Cosner.
							In every community there are some men who are known for their upright lives, strong
							common sense and moral worth rather than for their wealth or political standing, and
							among such men was Mr. Cosnr, who was not only a progressive man of affairs,
							successful in business pursuits, but a man of modest and unassuming demeanor, a fine
							type of the reliable, self-made American, a friend to the poor, charitable to the
							faults of his neighbors and ready to unite with them in every good work and active in
							the support of laudable purposes. He was a man who in every respect merited the high
							esteem in which he was universally held, for he was a man of public spirit,
							intellectual attainment and exemplary character.</p>

						<p>William Cosner was born in Wayne county, Indiana, August 25, 1835, and died in Clay
							township, Hendricks county, Indiana, April 3, 1912. His parents were Anthony and
							Catherine (Phillips) Cosner, both of whom were born and reared in North Carolina.
							After their marriage they moved from that state to Indiana, settling in Wayne county,
							where they lived for five years, at the expiration of which time they moved to
							Hendricks county and located near Amo. Anthony Cosner here entered government land and
							started to carve out his fortune from the virgin wilderness. He built a log <pb

								<p rend="center">MR. AND MRS. WILLIAM COSNER</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-463" n="433"/> cabin, cleared the land and started to make a
							comfortable living for his large family. To Anthony and Catherine Cosner were born
							nine children: John, who married Eliza Whicker and, after her death, Louise Rolly;
							Mahlan married first, Catherine Boswell, second, Susan Weavel, and after her death,
							Elizabeth Bloom; Samuel, who married Nancy Walls; Lucinda, who became the wife of
							Moses Stanley, and after his death married Austin Williams; Sarah married William Page
							and, after his death, William Wilhite; Ann and Elizabeth died in infancy. The paternal
							grandparents of William Cosner reared a family of seven children, Anthony, father of
							the subject of this sketch, Mary, Hannah, Lovey Peggy, Elizabeth, William and Sarah.
							Anthony Cosner died in 1889, while his wife died in 1873.</p>

						<p>William Cosner received his education, which was very limited indeed, in the schools
							of his home township. While still a small boy he started to work on his father's farm,
							where he continued to labor until his father's death, in 1889. However, before that
							date he built a home of his own and his father made his home with him.</p>

						<p>William Cosner married Sarah E. Hine, the daughter of Winfield and Catherine (Reed)
							Hine. They were married during the Civil War, in April, 1862, and to this union were
							born two children, Elma Leota and Alda Ketura. Elma Leota married Phineas Purcell, and
							has two children, Roy and Flora; the latter lives with her grandmother; Roy married
							Elizabeth Miller and has three children, Max, Elma L. and Dorothy. Alda married Walter
							Moon and has three children, Wilbur, Adna and Larue.</p>

						<p>Mrs. Cosner's parents came from North Carolina to this state and first located near
							Coatesville in 1852. After remaining there for a short time they moved to Franklin
							township, this county, where they lived until their death. They were the parents of
							nine children: Sarah, the wife of Mr. Cosner; Mary, wife of Scott Askren; Loren
							married Nettie Wilcox; Leroy, deceased in infancy; Emma, wife of Albert Masten;
							Lucinda, wife of Milton Patterson; Jane, wife of James Hollowell; Laura and Roxey, who
							are unmarried, live in Danville. The mother of these children died January 17, 1899,
							and the father two days later. Mr. Cosner's maternal grandparents reared a family of
							eight children, Joseph, Winfield, Eli, Nathaniel, Louis, Roginia, Nancy and Jane.</p>

						<p>Mr. Cosner was a life-long Republican and cast his first vote for John C. Fremont in
							1856. He never asked his party for public office, being content to serve as a private
							in the ranks, doing what he did in the local caucuses <pb id="VAC1000-464" n="434"/>
							and primaries. His religious faith was that of the Baptists and throughout his long
							life he was a strong believer in the teachings of that denomination and lived
							according to these doctrines. His life was characterized by its Christian beauty and
							character and it should be a model for coming generations in Hendricks county.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN HENRY HALL.</hi></head>

						<p>Clearly defined purpose and consecutive effort in the affairs of life will inevitably
							result in the attaining of a due measure of success, but in following out the career
							of one who has attained success by his own efforts there comes into view the intrinsic
							individuality which makes such accomplishment possible, and thus there is granted an
							objective incentive and inspiration, while at the same time there is enkindled a
							feeling of respect and admiration. The qualities which have made Mr. Hall one of the
							prominent and successful men of Clayton, have also brought him the esteem of his
							fellow townsmen, for his career has been one of well directed energy, strong
							determination and honorable methods.</p>

						<p>John Henry Hall, who is living in comfortable retirement from the active duties of
							life, in his commodious home in Clayton, was born in 1837, at Zanesville, Ohio, the
							son of Greeneberry and Lydia (Thomas) Hall. He was a posthumous child, his father's
							death having occurred before his birth and he had the misfortune to also lose his
							mother before he was three years old. At his mother's death he was taken into the home
							of his maternal grandfather, Joseph M. Thomas, who was born and reared in Reading
							county, Pennsylvania. When the subject was about three and one-half years old, his
							grandfather moved to McConnellsville, Morgan county, Ohio, where he followed his trade
							of carpenter and millwright. There they remained until the subject was sixteen years
							of age, when the family removed to Clayton, where the years intervening until the
							outbreak of the Civil War were passed in quiet pursuits. Fired with a love of country,
							late in August, 1861, Mr. Hall enlisted in Company B, Seventh Regiment Indiana
							Volunteer Infantry, and was with that regiment all through the three years service. In
							the winter of 1862 he was for several weeks confined in Windmill Hospital, and in
							June, 1864, at the crossing of the North Anna river, in Virginia, he was wounded while
							starting a skirmish line, running onto a rebel enforced skirmish line. He engaged in
							many of the leading battles of the war, among them being Green Brier, in West
							Virginia, Kernstown (generally called the battle <pb id="VAC1000-465" n="435"/> of
							Winchester), and Port Republic. He was then placed in the Army of the Potomac and with
							that division was in the engagements at Fredericksburg, Cedar Mountain, the second
							battle of Bull Run, under General Pope, South Mountain and the battle of Antietam. He
							also was at Gettysburg and after that spent the winter in Virginia and on May 5th
							their division was brought into the battle of the Wilderness, that seven days of
							terrific fighting. He was also at Petersburg when the "Crater" was blown up and
							distinctly saw the explosion, being comparatively near at the time. In the latter part
							of September, 1864, he was mustered out of the service and came back to his home in
							Clayton, having come through his severe experiences in an exceptional manner. While
							still a youth and prior to his service in the army, he had learned the painter's trade
							and had worked at it for about three years. After his return home from the front, he
							engaged in the sewing machine business for a couple of years and then became connected
							with a Philadelphia publishing house, for whom he was on the road for about
							twenty-five years. They were publishers of maps, and his work took him all over the
							eastern, central and middle western states, preparing new maps and making corrections
							in ones then existing. After he severed his connection with his firm, on account of
							failing health, he settled down at Clayton again, where his home and family had always
							been.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hall's political sympathies were with the Republican party and after quitting the
							road he began taking an active interest in local politics and was elected township
							trustee, which position he held for five years, the term having been extended by a
							Democratic Legislature, although he was of the opposition party. Then for six years
							thereafter he served as president of the county council and otherwise served his
							party. He was engaged in the coal business for four or five years and about the year
							1908 retired from active business. Mr. Hall is one of the most highly esteemed
							citizens of Clayton, a broad-minded man, well posted on current events and with a
							far-reaching influence for good in his community.</p>

						<p>In October, 1867, Mr. Hall was united in marriage with Angeline Sherman, born in Fall
							Creek township, Hamilton county, this state, near the town of Fortville. She is the
							daughter of Alonzo D. and Sarah (Hammond) Sherman and grew to womanhood on the place
							where she was born, but was living with her uncle, George Hammond, at the time she met
							Mr. Hall. To their union was born one daughter, Ora May, who passed from this life in
							1891, at the age of twenty-two years. Both Mr. and Mrs. Hall are devout members of the
							Christian church and give liberally toward the support of the <pb id="VAC1000-466"
								n="436"/> local organization. Mr. Hall's fraternal affiliations are with the
							Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Grand Army of the Republic. Mr. Hall is
							widely known as one of the most sagacious business men of his community and as a
							citizen of much public spirit, always interested in the common good. He has many
							friends and is a pleasant, sociable gentleman. He has always stood for progressive
							ideas, wholesome living and patriotism, and although his life has been without
							incident of a marked unusual nature, it has shown that steady, consecutive endeavor,
							coupled with honesty of purpose, will accomplish large results in the end.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">ROBERT A. EDMONDSON.</hi></head>

						<p>It is the progressive, wide-awake man of affairs that makes the real history of a
							community and his influence as a potential factor of the body politic is difficult to
							estimate. The examples such men furnish of patient purpose and steadfast integrity
							strongly illustrate what is in the power of each to accomplish and there is always a
							full measure of satisfaction in adverting, even in a casual way, to their achievements
							in advancing the interests of their fellowmen and in giving strength and solidity to
							the institutions which make so much for the prosperity of a community. Such a man is
							the worthy subject of this sketch, and as such it is proper that a review of his
							career be accorded a place among the representative citizens of the town and county in
							which he resides. Additional interest attaches to his career owing to the fact that
							his entire life has been passed within the bounds of this county.</p>

						<p>Robert A. Edmondson was born on December 18, 1860, about two miles south of Clayton,
							the son of Benjamin G. Edmondson. When he was six or seven years old they moved to
							within a short distance south of Clayton, and there he grew to manhood, attending the
							schools in Clayton, where he received his elementary education, and later studying at
							the Central Normal College. After completing his studies at Danville, he taught school
							for two terms. On April 22, 1883, he was united in marriage with Della Appleby, born
							in Owen county, this state, the daughter of John and Rachael (Reitzel) Appleby, both
							of whom were reared in Hendricks county and were descendants of some of the earliest
							pioneer families of this locality. John Appleby was a farmer and lived for a time in
							Owen and Greene counties, later returning to this county about the year 1880. For one
							year he lived on the John <pb id="VAC1000-467" n="437"/> V. Hadley farm, also resided
							near Belleville and later near Plainfield and finally purchased a farm near Avon,
							where he passed the remainder of his life, his death occurring there, where his widow
							continues to live.</p>

						<p>After marriage, Mr. Edmondson went to farming for himself, spending about twelve
							years in Morgan county, where he purchased one hundred acres of land to begin with and
							has since added fifty-four more. He also owns more land adjoining it on this side of
							the county line. In the fall of 1895 he purchased a farm of thirty-six acres about a
							half mile south of Clayton, near where his boyhood days were passed, and there he
							erected a comfortable home right in the midst of a beautiful walnut grove, where he
							has since resided. Later he added eighty-five more acres to this tract and in all is
							possessed of some three hundred and fifty acres of land, all in an excellent state of
							cultivation, each acre attesting to the ability of the owner and marking him as one of
							the most up-to-date agriculturists of the county. In addition to his farming
							interests, Mr. Edmondson finds time to devote to other lines and since 1888 has been a
							notary public and has served several times as executor or administrator of estates.
							During the summer of 1912 he took an active part in organizing the People's Bank and
							Trust Company of Clayton, which institution he has served as president since its
							organization. This company opened for business October 16, 1912, Clement Earl Kelley
							having been largely instrumental in bringing it into existence. The officers of the
							company are R. A. Edmondson, president; Amos L. Mitchell, vice-president; C. E.
							Kelley, cashier. The directors are R. A. Edmondson, Amos L. Mitchell, William G. Peck,
							W. F. Martin, Charles B. Worrell and Charles M. West. The company does a regular
							banking business and also acts as administrator, executor or trustee, sells insurance
							and deals in real estate, etc. The capital stock is twenty-five thousand dollars,
							fully paid up, and the total assets in September, 1913, were nearly ninety thousand
							dollars. It owns its own building, built expressly for its occupancy and being a
							thoroughly modern business block.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Edmondson is a Democrat and active in local politics. In 1900 he was
							elected trustee of Liberty township, this county, which office he held a little over
							four years, his term expiring January 1, 1905. He was the first Democrat to be elected
							trustee of that township, receiving a majority of sixty-five votes, when previously it
							had been going to the opposition by a majority of something near two hundred. Mr.
							Edmondson, therefore, was entitled to feel some elation over his victory, which was a
							distinct tribute to the popularity which he so richly deserves.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-468" n="438"/>

						<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Edmondson have been born five sons, the eldest, Clarence Virgil, who
							married Mary Hopkins, residing two miles south of Clayton on the national road, where
							he is engaged in farming. He has two children, Walter and Esther. John Benjamin
							married Pearl Richardson and lives on the southern line of this county, where he owns
							a home of his own and is engaged in farming. He graduated from the agricultural
							department of Purdue University in 1911, and spent one year under the state geologist
							in soil survey work in Owen and Morgan counties and for one year was assistant editor
							of the <hi rend="i">Farmers' Guide</hi>, a periodical published at Huntington, this
							state. Ralph W. married Osie Scott and lives on the subject's farm in the northern
							edge of Morgan county, which farm he operates in connection with his father. He is the
							father of one son, Lowell Robert. Samuel is attending Purdue University and will
							graduate in the spring of 1914 from the agricultural department, and Roy is also
							taking the agricultural course at the same university.</p>

						<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Edmondson are members of the Presbyterian church at Clayton, to
							which they contribute liberally of their means, having a sincere desire in seeing the
							rapid advancement of that society. Fraternally, Mr. Edmondson is affiliated with the
							Independent Order of Odd Fellows, in the workings of which order he takes a quiet
							interest. He is a man of excellent business ability, strict integrity and fine
							personal address and, because of his genuine worth and high character, he has long
							enjoyed a splendid reputation in the community honored by his residence. He gives his
							support to all movements for the advancement of his fellow citizens and is today
							numbered among the representative men of Hendricks county.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-469" n="439"/>

						<p>Columbus F. Edmonson is a native of Hendricks county, having been born in 1854 about
							two miles south of Clayton, the son of Benjamin G. Edmonson and wife, the sketch of
							whose lives appear at length elsewhere in this volume. The subject remained on the
							home farm until the time of his marriage on September 9, 1877, to Amy Thrift. She was
							born near Mount Ayer, Ringgold county, Iowa, the daughter of James and Sarah Jane
							(Brown) Thrift. Both her parents were born and reared in North Carolina, being natives
							of Randolph county, and were married before coming to the Hoosier state, where, in
							1856, they located in Hendricks county in Eel River township, near North Salem. James
							Thrift was a son of David and Lydia (Parsons) Thrift, and his wife, Sarah Jane Brown,
							was the daughter of William and Susan Brown, all of whom were natives of North
							Carolina and came to this county at the same time. The Browns located near Avon and
							the thrifts in Eel River township. James Thrift and wife moved to Iowa after a short
							residence here, but returned because of his mother's failing health. After his
							mother's death, they returned to Iowa, where he purchased a farm and passed the
							remainder of his life, his death occurring in 1899. His widow returned to this county
							and made her home with the subject and wife until the time of her death, March 13,
							1913. Mrs. Edmonson remained with her parents in Iowa until the time of her marriage
							to the subject, after which event they began farming for themselves on a farm owned by
							Mr. Edmonson's father, which was located about two and one-half miles south of
							Clayton. There they remained until 1879, when they bought the Mitchell farm of one
							hundred and seven acres on the National road, where they remained until 1905, at which
							time they moved to Clayton, where they have since resided. Mr. Edmonson has been
							signally successful in his endeavors and has acquired considerable real estate. He has
							in all about two hundred and eighty acres in his homestead south of Clayton, he owns
							two hundred and sixty acres in Henry county near New Castle and is also interested in
							the Coldwater Land Company, which corporation owns cotton lands in the Mississippi
							delta. In addition to his general farming, he for many years bought and shipped live
							stock and became widely known in this connection. He is now actively interested in
							lumber yards located at Amo and Ben Davis, this county.</p>

						<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Edmonson have been born four children. Alva, the eldest, married
							Florence Hanna, of Plainfield, daughter of Congressman Hanna. They reside in Chicago,
							where he is associated with the White Steamer Automobile Company as a salesman. He
							received his early education in the schools of Liberty township, later graduating from
							Plainfield <pb id="VAC1000-470" n="440"/> Academy. He then entered the mechanical
							engineering department of Purdue University, having been graduated therefrom in 1904,
							when he immediately became associated with the automobile company above mentioned. He
							is the father of one little daughter, Cornelia. Blanche, eldest daughter of Mr.
							Edmonson, attended Milliken University at Decatur, Illinois, after graduating from
							Plainfield Academy. She is the wife of Walter Thompson and lives on a farm on the
							National road. She is the mother of two children, Elizabeth and Luanna. Frank, who was
							graduated from Purdue University in 1909, is also engaged in farming, being located
							about two and one-half miles southwest of Clayton. He married Ollie Swearingen, of
							Mooresville. Ruth, the youngest daughter, is at present attending high school at
							Clayton.</p>

						<p>The family is one of the most highly esteemed of the community, being known as people
							of broad minds and laudable ambitions, and many are the influences for good which
							radiate from their home circle. The family is identified with the Presbyterian church,
							of which both Mr. and Mrs. Edmonson are members and to the support of which they
							contribute generously. Mr. Edmonson's fraternal affiliation is with the Independent
							Order of Odd Fellows, of which he has been a member for some time. He is aligned with
							the Democratic party and takes a keen interest in the administration of that party's
							affairs. While not desiring office for himself, he is known to wield a definite
							influence at the polls and is, therefore, reckoned with by those seeking the honor of
							public service. Mr. Edmonson has always been regarded as a man of high principles,
							honest in every respect and broad-minded. A man of good character, kindness of heart
							and ever willing to aid in any way any cause for the betterment of the community and
							the public with whom he has to deal, he is held in high favor and the utmost respect

						<p>That the plenitude of -satiety is seldom attained in the affairs of life is to be

							ultimate end realized, if such be possible, apathy must follow. Effort would cease,
							accomplishment be prostrate, and creative talent waste its energies in inactivity. The

							<pb id="VAC1000-472" n="441"/> gained for him a position of desirable prominence in
							the agricultural circles of Hendricks county, and his energy and enterprise have been
							crowned by a gratifying degree of success.</p>

						<p>John H. Bunten, Jr., one of the most prominent stock breeders in central Indiana, was
							born September 2, 1869, in the township where he has resided all his life. His parents
							were John and Rebecca (Call) Bunten, his father being a native of Kentucky, coming to
							this county with his parents when he was five years of age. John Bunten, Sr., was born
							in 1818, and when his parents came to Marion townhip, this county, in 1823, his
							father, William Bunten, entered six hundred and forty acres of land from the
							government, where John H. now lives. John Bunten, Sr., married Rebecca Call, the
							daughter of John and Julia Call, who also were natives of Kentucky. They came to this
							township early in its history and entered a large tract of land here. John Bunten,
							Sr., died in 1895, and his wife passed away at the age of eighty. They reared a family
							of twelve children, eight of whom are still living: Mrs. Anna M. Wright; Laura B.;
							Elmer, deceased; Oliver M., deceased; John H., the immediate subject of this sketch;
							Nora M., deceased; Thomas O.; Edgar, deceased; Alice R.; Obediah; Roscoe G., and one
							who died in infancy. Laura B. Bunten is a successful breeder of pure-bred Buff Rock
							and Buff Orpington chickens.</p>

						<p>John H. Bunten has never married and now lives with his sister, Laura B., on the old
							homestead farm. He received his common school education in the district schools of
							Hendricks county, and has spent his entire life on the farm where he was born. He has
							made a fine reputation as a breeder of fine live stock and makes a specialty of
							Poland-China hogs, handling only the best and purest breeds. He also handles
							Shropshire sheep and keeps his herd to a high state of efficiency. For several years
							he also kept pedigreed Shorthorn cattle, but recently disposed of his herd and now
							deals only in hogs and sheep. He has yearly sales for his stock, at which there are
							large crowds of buyers present and high prices are paid for his stock. He advertises
							his sales widely and thus brings together prominent buyers from all parts of the
							state, who are anxious to secure some of his well bred stock. Mr. Bunten is considered
							an expert judge of hogs and is a member of the National Association of Poland-China
							Breeders. On his farm of two hundred acres he raises considerable grain and other
							crops, but his main attention is devoted to live stock. Mr. Bunten is Republican in
							politics, but has never taken an active interest in the affairs of his party. He has
							never felt inclined to indulge in the various political fights which feature
							campaigns, preferring to devote his <pb id="VAC1000-473" n="442"/> attention to his
							live stock and other interests. He is well known throughout the county and is regarded
							everywhere as a man of his word and one whose integrity is never questioned in the
							slightest degree. He is a quiet, unassuming and genial man and has many warm personal
							friends throughout the county. His sister, who lives with him, is also interested in
							the success of her brother and has contributed in no small measure to his success.
							They are very hospitable people and are highly esteemed by every one in their

						<p>Although not an old man in years, the gentleman whose life record is herein outlined
							has in no uncertain manner stamped his individuality upon the locality where he
							resides, being an excellent representative of that type of the much-heralded American
							business man-the type that does things. Hie is one of the most progressive
							agriculturists of the county, conducting his business along lines approved by science
							and good usage. He believes that for a greater amount of money invested in a business
							and properly managed, one earns a greater per cent. of profit, and, therefore, all
							facilities for the conduct of his business are the most up-to-date obtainable. There
							are individuals in every community who, by reason of pronounced ability and force of

							their fellow men. Characterized by perseverance and a directing spirit, two virtues
							that never fail, such men always make their presence felt and the vigor of their
							strong personality serves as a stimulus and incentive to the young and rising
							generation. To this energetic and enterprising class the subject of this review very
							properly belongs.</p>

						<p>Amos L. Mitchell was born on October 21, 1871, in Liberty township, this county, the
							son of William C. and Elizabeth (Wills) Mitchell. William Mitchell was a native of
							Tennessee and when five years old was brought to this state by his parents, Samuel and
							Polly Mitchell. The family settled in Liberty township, where Samuel engaged in
							farming. He was also a minister of the Presbyterian church and preached in Hendricks
							and Carroll counties. He later moved to Carroll county and there his death occurred as
							a result of injuries received in a runaway accident. His son William, father of the
							immediate subject of this sketch, passed the days of his boyhood and youth in Liberty
							township and all his life was engaged in farming. During the dark days of the sixties
							he gave three years of service to the Union. He <pb id="VAC1000-474" n="443"/>
							enlisted as lieutenant of Company C, Seventieth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry,
							and a short time after enlistment was made captain. His regiment was part of the
							division known as the Army of the Potomac and went all through the various engagements
							of the Cumberland campaign, later going with General Sherman on the famous march to
							the sea. He received his honorable discharge from the army in July, 1865, and
							immediately returned to his home in this county, where he gathered up the threads of
							life where he had laid them down to answer the nation's call. He owned a farm of two
							hundred and forty acres and there lived out the remaining number of his days. In this
							farm the subject of this sketch now owns a half interest. William Mitchell's death
							occurred in 1897, in his sixty-third year. He was the father of seven children. Those,
							beside the subject and a little son Alva, who died in infancy, are: Mary L. (Mrs.
							Candy); Charles, deceased; Nanny Garrison (Mrs. Reid), who is now a widow; Howard, and
							Belle, who married Vinson S. Hamlin and lives west of Clayton. In his early manhood
							Mr. Mitchell had united with the ancient order of Freemasonry, in which order he kept
							his membership until a short time before his death. He was also a member of the Grand
							Army of the Republic and his religious affiliation was with the Presbyterian church.
							Politically, he was a Democrat, but had never taken an active interest in
							politics.</p>

						<p>Amos L. Mitchell spent his early days on his father's farm, learning from him the
							secrets of successful husbandry and in his boyhood days attended the district schools
							of the township, where he received his elementary education. Later in life he took the
							three-year philosophical course at DePauw University, Greencastle, this state. He
							chose farming as his life's vocation and all his efforts have been expended along this
							and kindred lines. In addition to his home farm, located a short distance north of
							Clayton and comprising some hundred and twenty acres, he also owns three hundred acres
							of cypress timbered land in Obion county, western Tennessee. About one hundred and
							sixty acres of this is now under cultivation, the entire acreage being turned to the
							production of cotton. His home farm is in perfect condition, showing the master mind,
							and all buildings, etc., are in the best possible condition and thoroughly modern. On
							this farm is what is considered the best barn in the county. In it is every possible
							convenience, including two large silos and a modern machine milker. Mr. Mitchell
							operates a fine Holstein dairy, having sixty-six head of partly pure bred stock. On
							January 1, 1914, he purchased at Toledo, Ohio, a number of these fine bred cattle,
							which came to him from one of the famous homes of the breed in Canada. In addition <pb
								id="VAC1000-475" n="444"/> to his dairy herd, he is also a breeder and has some fine
							specimens of this excellent breed to dispose of. Mr. Mitchell is progressive in every
							sense of the word and this, coupled with his untiring energy and high ambition, marks
							him as a business man of unusual ability. He is a man of genial temperament and a most
							delightful companion. He is a friend to all and gladly extends a helping hand wherever
							he sees an opportunity to do good. Any cause having as its object the promotion of the
							moral, social or educational life of the community finds in him an earnest advocate
							and, needless to add, such a man stands high in public estimation, while by a large
							number of close friends he is held in warm regard.</p>

						<p>On October 2, 1896, Mr. Mitchell was united in marriage with Myrtle Rains, daughter
							of Hiram and Sarah (Owen) Rains. She is the granddaughter of Hiram Rains and is his
							adopted daughter, having been adopted by him at the age of nine months. To Mr. and
							Mrs. Mitchell have been born two sons, Owen and Richard. Both Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell
							are earnest and sincere members of the Presbyterian church at Clayton and give
							liberally toward the support of the -local society. Mr. Mitchell is a Democrat, but
							does not find much time to devote to his party, having his hands well filled with his

						<p>Mark M. Short was born on May 22, 1879, in Center township, this county, the family
							at that time residing just north of Clayton, and is the son <pb id="VAC1000-476"
								n="445"/> of Benjamin Franklin and Lydia Jane (Coble) Short, the former of whom
							first saw the light of day on June 24, 1834, at Centerville, Wayne county, this state,
							and the latter being a native of this county, born on March 31, 1843, on what used to
							be known as the Coble farm, located about three miles east of Stilesville. Benjamin
							Franklin Short was the third in a family of seven children, and, when a small child,
							was taken by his parents to Missouri, where for a year they resided near Hannibal.
							However, being dissatisfied with the conditions of that region, they returned to the
							Hoosier state, this time taking up their residence in Hendricks county, where the
							family since resided. He attended the early subscription schools of his day, pursuing
							his search after knowledge alone and unaided through many difficult subjects, and when
							a young man he labored as an instructor of youth, beginning first at Hall, Morgan
							county, in 1857 and later teaching at the Lake David, Christie and Spicklemire school
							houses, all being old educational landmarks. He later gave his attention to farming,
							at which he passed the majority of his years, and a few years before his death he
							retired from active labor on the farm and became a citizen of Clayton, there to pass
							his remaining years in quietude. He passed from this life on October 2, 1908, being in
							the seventy-fifth year of his age. He was twice married, his first wife being Mary A.
							Stephenson, to whom he was united on September 2, 1858. She died at Danville on
							February 15, 1872, their union being without issue. On April 13, 1873, Mr. Short was
							again united in marriage, his bride being Lydia J. Coble. To their union were born
							three children, namely: Otis William, now living in Missouri; Charlees Young, who
							lives in Coatesville, this county, and the immediate subject of this sketch. At his
							death these three sons and the widow survived. For many years he had been a devout
							member of the Christian church and ordered his life in accordance with the tenets of
							that faith.</p>

						<p>Lydia Jane Coble, mother of the subject, was the youngest in a family of ten
							children, being the daughter of George and Mary Coble. She was of a quiet, retiring
							disposition and of great strength of character. When young she availed herself of all
							possible opportunities for improvement and acquired a good general education as well
							as skill in all the arts and duties that fall within the sphere of a devoted wife and
							mother. On December 4, 1865, she united with the Cherry Grove Methodist Episcopal
							church, later transferring her membership to the Clayton church when they took up
							their residence there, and remained a devout and faithful member of the church
							militant until her passing away. After the death of her husband, she remained in her
							home in Clayton until failing health made her dependent on <pb id="VAC1000-477"
								n="446"/> the loving care of children. She died March 17, 1911, in her sixty-eighth
							year. She had lived to see her sons established in life, and, happy in their
							happiness, had been content to go the way of all mankind. She was also survived by a
							brother, Elihu Coble, of Stilesville, and a sister, Mrs. John Worrell, of Clayton.</p>

						<p>Mark M. Short spent his boyhood days on the homestead farm in Center township, near
							the Liberty township line. He attended the district schools of that locality, where he
							received his elementary education, finishing his studies at Clayton. In 1895 he left
							Center township and moved north of Clayton, where he farmed for about one year, when
							he disposed of his holdings and moved to Clayton. On September 11, 1901, Mr. Short was
							united in marriage with Ruth A., daughter of Thomas J. and Tilitha (Tudor) Miles.
							After marriage he took up his residence on the farm where he now makes his home and
							carries on general farming in addition to operating a dairy. He owns in all about
							three hundred acres of land, seventy-five of this being in his residence farm. In
							addition to his farm duties, he owns and operates the health resort known as Camp
							Short, located on his farm about three miles northeast of Clayton. This is a beautiful
							spot, in an ideal stretch of country, and is known for its sparkling spring of
							artesian water of rare qualities. There are many visitors to this place throughout the
							year who come for the waters and Mr. Short now has a summer home there. It is a very
							attractive place and especially conducive to recreation during the summer season.</p>

						<p>Mr. Short's fraternal affiliations are with the Free and Accepted Masons and also the
							Independent Order of Odd Fellows, holding his membership in these two bodies through
							the local lodges at Clayton. In politics, Mr. Short is a "stand-pat" Republican and an
							earnest advocate of the principles of that party, although not taking any active part
							in the administration of his party's affairs. He is a man of quiet and retiring
							disposition, but genial and friendly and counts his friends and acquaintances in great
							numbers. The family is regarded among the first of their community, a charming family
							circle wherein the two children, Paul M. and Helen L., are being trained so as to fit
							them for useful and happy lives when they come to years of maturity. Mr. Short is a
							man of sterling honesty and strict integrity who has the trust and confidence of all
							with whom he comes in contact. His past record and personal character justify the
							belief that the future holds in store for him far greater success than he has already
							achieved and a wider range of usefulness to mankind than has yet been his
							privilege.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">THOMAS HOWARD MITCHELL.</hi></head>

						<p>Almost all of the great men of history come from the farm. Few heroes have come from
							the slums and fewer still from palaces. To call a man a farmer is to class him in the
							same scale as George Washington, our first President; Abraham Lincoln, our martyred
							President, or any one of a dozen governors of Indiana. It is plain common folk who
							have characteristics. In cultured, select society every one is alike; they all appear
							to have been poured into the same mold. In a wealthy club all men's clothes are new,
							they all look alike, and especially since they are all cut by the most fashionable
							tailors, while among people who have but one week-day suit the garment becomes creased
							and molded to the body. Indeed, it is the farmer who is to save our nation today, as
							his is the hand which holds the purse-strings of the land.</p>

						<p>Thomas Howard Mitchell, the son of Columbus and Elizabeth (Wills) Mitchell, was born
							May 22, 1869, on the National road south of Clayton, Hendricks county, Indiana. Since
							the family history of the Mitchells has been traced in the sketch of Amos Mitchell, a
							brother of Thomas H., in another part of this volume, the reader is referred to that
							sketch for the genealogy of the Mitchell family.</p>

						<p>Thomas H. Mitchell has lived all of his life on the farm where he was born. He
							received a good, common-school education and early began the life of a farmer, and is
							now the owner of one hundred and twenty acres of land which he has well improved in
							every way. While raising all the crops common to this locality, he has made a
							specialty of the dairy business. He keeps thoroughbred Holstein cattle for his dairy
							herd, and has a barn which has been built especially for dairy purposes. It is
							equipped with all the modern conveniences and contrivances for the sanitary protection
							of milk. He has patent milking machines installed in his barn and this is the only
							dairy in the township which has them. His equipment in the barn is run by gas engines.
							In addition to his farming and dairying, he also manages a threshing machine outfit
							during the summer season, and for the past four years has added not a little to his
							annual income from the operation of this outfit.</p>

						<p>Mr. Mitchell was married September 30, 1891, to Ella Givan, the daughter of George M.
							and Ann Givan. George Givan was born June 19, 1827, in Dearborn county, Indiana, and
							was a lifelong farmer and carpenter. His parents were Gilbert T. and Sarah (Merrill)
							Givan, who were natives of Maryland and Virginia, respectively. They came to Dearborn
							county, Indiana, early in its history and lived on a farm there for over fifty years
								<pb id="VAC1000-479" n="448"/> George Givan died May 29, 1906, his wife having
							passed away several years previous, on November 11, 1902. Mr. and Mrs. George Givan
							were the parents of eleven children, John F., Mrs. Mary Bell Bruce, Sanford E., Mrs.
							Harriet J. Smith, Sarah E., Mrs. Eva A. Farquer, Charles M., Mrs. Ella J. Mitchell
							(the wife of Thomas H. Mitchell), Harry R., Erving, deceased, and Mrs. Cora A.
							Slater.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell have one child, Carl Columbus, born April 26, 1894, who is
							still with his parents. The family are all members of the Presbyterian church at
							Clayton, Indiana, and Mr. Mitchell has been an elder in the church for the past ten
							years. Politically, he is a Democrat, but has never been inclined to take a very
							active part in politics. Fraternally, he is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons
							and is now serving his fourth year as master of the lodge at Clayton. He is a man of
							splendid characteristics which have won for him a wide circle of friends in the
							community where he has lived his whole career.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">SAMUEL BARBER.</hi></head>

						<p>A review of the life of the honored subject of this biographical sketch must of
							necessity be brief and general in its character. To enter fully into the interesting
							details of the career of Mr. Barber, touching the earnest and persistent efforts of
							his earlier years and successes of later days, would far transcend the limits of this
							article. He has filled a large place in the ranks of the enterprising and
							public-spirited men of his day and has been an important factor in the growth and
							development of North Salem's industrial and commercial interests.</p>

						<p>Samuel Barber, a prominent retired business man of North Salem, Indiana, was born
							April 25, 1840, in Montgomery county, this state, the son of John and Annie
							(Cunningham) Barber, both of whom were born in Botetourt county, Virginia, where they
							grew up and where they were married. Shortly after their marriage, they came to
							Indiana and entered government land near Ladoga, Montgomery county, where they lived
							for about thirty-five years. Some years before the Civil War they came to Hendricks
							county and settled about one and one-half miles north of North Salem, but after a
							short time they went back to Montgomery county, and still later went to Boone county,
							this state, where they located on a farm near Jamestown, <pb id="VAC1000-480" n="[]"/>
							<figure>
								<p rend="center">SAMUEL BARBER</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-481" n="449"/> where they lived for the remainder of their lives. John
							Barber and his wife were the parents of two children, Samuel and Eliza. Eliza married
							Roland Alexander and died about the year 1878.</p>

						<p>Samuel Barber lived with his parents until his marriage, at the age of twenty. He was
							married September 9, 1860, to Mary Ann Robbins, a native of North Carolina. Her
							parents, Jacob and Barbara Robbins, came from North Carolina and settled three miles
							south of North Salem when Mrs. Barber was only about one year old. After his marriage
							Mr. Barber operated a farm near North Salem for about fifteen years, after which he
							engaged in the lumber business at North Salem, which he followed for the rest of his
							active life. He was in partnership with F. M. Davis until the latter's death, which
							occurred in 1887, and from that time until 1909 he managed the business alone. In the
							latter year Smith Davis became a partner and the business is still continued under the
							firm name of Barber &amp; Davis. In addition to his lumber interests, Mr. Barber owns
							a farm of eighty acres north of North Salem, and also formerly owned two hundred acres
							of good land in addition, which he gave to his daughter, Annie, the only child of his
							first marriage. The first wife of Mr. Barber died July 9, 1908, and on February 2,
							1910, Mr. Barber married Mrs. Mary Jane Cusick, the widow of Joseph Cusick, who was
							born at Freeburg, near Belleville, Illinois, the daughter of George W. and Martha
							(Smith) Smith. In 1865 her parents moved to Douglas county, Illinois, where she grew
							to womanhood and married Mr. Cusick. After her marriage she lived at Terre Haute until
							her husband died, in July, 1907, after which she moved to Newman, Illinois, where she
							remained until her marriage to Mr. Barber. Annie, the only child of Mr. Barber,
							married Elbert Hays, and has one daughter, Hattie. Mr. and Mrs. Hays live on the home
							farm of Mr. Barber which he bought.</p>

						<p>Mr. Barber has been a life-long Republican in politics, and has always taken an
							active part in the councils of his party. He and his wife are consistent members of
							the Christian church and he is a member of the board of trustees. For a man of
							seventy-four years, Mr. Barber is remarkably well preserved and active, and would
							easily pass for a man twenty years younger. His long life in this community has made
							him an influential factor in the growth of the town and vicinity and because he has
							always been ready to lend his aid and support to all laudable measures and enterprises
							for the welfare of his community, he is very popular with the people of his town and
							vicinity.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN C. RYNERSON.</hi></head>

						<p>It is always pleasant and profitable to contemplate the career of a man who has won a
							definite goal in life, whose career has been such as to command the honor and respect
							of his fellow citizens. Such, in brief, was the record of the well-known agriculturist
							whose name heads this sketch, than whom a more whole-souled or popular man it would be
							difficult to find within the limits of Hendricks county, where he maintained his home
							and where he labored not only for his individual advancement and that of his immediate
							family, but also for the improvement of the entire community, whose interests he ever
							had at heart.</p>

						<p>John C. Rynerson, whose death occurred on May 17, 1914, was born on March 7, 1835, in
							Liberty township, this county, the son of John and Elizabeth (Cunningham) Rynerson,
							the former of whom was a native of Salt River, Mercer county, Kentucky, and was a
							life-long farmer. He was born in Kentucky in 1795 and died in Owen county, this state,
							in 1864, at the age of sixty-nine years. When he first came to Hendricks county it is
							thought that he probably entered government land about one mile northeast of Clayton.
							He later returned to Kentucky, but after a short time again came to Indiana, this time
							locating in Belleville, this county, at the time when the immediate subject of this
							sketch was four years old. In addition to his duties as a farmer, he was a minister in
							the Missionary Baptist church, devoting all the time possible to the work of the
							Gospel in different counties in the state. He took an active part in politics during
							the dark days of the Civil War and was an extremist against slavery. He was a stanch
							Republican, being among the first to affiliate with the party at its birth. He never
							held any offices, but was at one time active in the race for delegate to the
							constitutional convention. He did not belong to any secret orders, giving all his time
							to his ministerial labors and the work of conducting his farm. He had an excellent
							farm in Liberty township, which he had wrested from the grasp of the wilderness. He
							was twice married, his first wife being Elizabeth Cunningham, by whom he became the
							father of eleven children, namely: William L., deceased, as are also James H. and
							Thomas Christopher. The fourth child was Ary Adeline (Mrs. Willis) and the fifth child
							in order of birth was the immediate subject of this sketch. Mary Ann (Mrs. Worrell),
							Sarah Frances (Mrs. Worrell), Laura (Mrs. Goss), and Elizabeth (Mrs. Moon), all
							deceased. Two other daughters are Jane (Mrs. Worrell) and Martha (Mrs. Cooper). The
							first Mrs. Rynerson was <pb id="VAC1000-483" n="451"/> a native of Mercer county,
							Kentucky, and died at the age of forty-one years, in 1853. Her parents were also
							natives of the same county in Kentucky.</p>

						<p>Mr. Rynerson chose as his second wife Sarah Goss, daughter of George and Mary (Goss)
							Goss, both of whom were natives of Owen county, this state. To this union were born
							five children, three of whom are dead. These are Justin, Jessie (Mrs. Eaton) and Eddie
							(Mrs. Goss) ; the surviving members of the family are Merlin and George.</p>

						<p>John C. Rynerson received his schooling in the township schools of this county and
							when quite young began to take an active interest in the home farm. He has devoted the
							entire efforts of his life to the vocation of farming and is unusually well informed
							along this line. He owns one hundred and three acres of excellent land located close
							to the Pennsylvania railroad tracks in Liberty township, this county.</p>

						<p>On October 24, 1860, Mr. Rynerson was united in wedlock with Sarah Jane, daughter of
							James and Salinda (Darnell) Ferguson, the former of whom was a native of Virginia and
							the latter born at Mount Sterling, Kentucky. He was a carpenter and also farmed some.
							When but fourteen years of age, he came with his father from their native state. He
							was born in 1816 and died in Liberty township in 1872. With his parents he settled
							about two miles northeast of Clayton. On February 28, 1839, he was united in marriage
							with Salinda Darnell, whose parents had come to the Hoosier state from Mount Sterling,
							Kentucky. Her death occurred in 1863 on the homestead in Liberty township. They were
							the parents of nine children, the eldest of whom was Sarah Jane, wife of the immediate
							subject of this sketch; Martha A. (Mrs. Jackson), Frank C., Mary (Mrs. Robinson),
							Alonzo, all of whom are living. Those who have passed away are Louisa E. (Mrs.
							Haynes), Alice (Mrs. Thompson), Emma, who died when seven years old, and one babe
							which died in early infancy.</p>

						<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Rynerson have been born a family of seven children, two of whom, John
							Lucien and Jennie Belle, died when young. Viola, the eldest daughter, married Milo
							McCormick, who is a farmer and trader and resides in Clayton. They have no family.
							Minnie became the wife of Ora Mountain (now deceased), a hardware and implement
							merchant at Clayton. He died in 1913, leaving two children, Paul and Carl, both of
							whom reside at home and Paul now manages the business for the widow. Elizabeth is the
							wife of John Lucas, of Des Moines, Iowa. He is now retired from active labors, but has
							filled various offices for the past sixteen years, being ex-treasurer of his county.
							They are the parents of two children, Noble and Chester. William took as his wife Anna
							Downing and they have <pb id="VAC1000-484" n="452"/> two children, Hazel and Calvin.
							He is an operator for the Western Union Telegraph Company and is at present stationed
							somewhere in Colorado. Ernest married Maude Pruitt and lives on his father's farm in
							Liberty township. He is the father of one son, Max.</p>

						<p>Mr. Rynerson's political affiliation was for many years with the Republican party.
							His first vote after reaching his majority was cast for Fremont, the Republican
							nominee for President in 1856, and during his earlier manhood he was a most
							enthusiastic Republican, but of later years he has been rather independent in his
							politics, choosing the man in preference to the party or platform. Mr. Rynerson is a
							member of the Christian church at Clayton and, together with his wife, does all within
							his power to promote the cause of the church. He has served his society as deacon for
							many years. His fraternal affiliation is with the ancient order of Freemasonry, being
							a member of Lodge No. 463 at Clayton. Mr. Rynerson is a man of unusually fine
							character, standing "four-square to every wind that blows." His is a well-rounded and
							useful life, showing true blue in all his relations with his fellow men. He is quiet
							and unassuming, a man of sterling qualities and well grounded principles, and during
							the years of his residence here he has endeared himself to a great circle of friends
							and acquaintances who regard him with all confidence and esteem. While Mr. Rynerson
							has exceeded man's allotted span of three score years and ten, being seventy-nine
							years old at this time, he is hale and hearty, unusually well preserved both bodily
							and mentally.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">DAVID B. WILLS.</hi></head>

						<p>David B. Wills belongs to that class of men who win in life's battles by sheer force
							of personality and determination, rather than by the influence of friends or freak of
							fortune, and in whatever he has undertaken he has shown himself to be a man of ability
							and honor, true to whatever trusts have been imposed in him. Mr. Wills was born in
							Clayton, Hendricks county, Indiana, on October 25, 1856, the son of Amos Stewart and
							Lucinda (Tateman) Wills.</p>

						<p>Amos S. Wills was born in Montgomery county, Kentucky, in 1809, and came to Hendricks
							county in 1831 where he settled north of Clayton and entered land from the government.
							He had received a fairly good education in his native state and was by natural ability
							a leader among men. He was a stanch advocate of the principles of the Republican party
							and a devout <pb id="VAC1000-485" n="453"/> member of the ancient order of
							Freemasonry, of which order he became a member soon after attaining his majority.
							Prior to coming to this state, he was united in marriage with Lucinda Tateman, born in
							his native county on May 8, 1815. Shortly after coming to Hendricks county, Mr. Wills
							was elected to the office of justice of the peace, which office he held for sixty
							consecutive years, a truly enviable record. So wise and impartial was he in his
							administration of justice that in all his years of service he had never had a decision
							of his reversed on appeal. His death occurred at Clayton in 1892, and was a distinct
							loss to the community. In every community some men are known for their upright lives,
							strong common sense' and moral worth, rather than for their wealth or political
							standing. Their neighbors and acquaintances respect them, the younger generations heed
							their examples and when they "wrap the drapery of their couch about them and lie down
							to pleasant dreams," posterity listens with reverence to the story of their quiet and
							useful lives. Among such men of a past generation in Indiana was the late Amos Stewart
							Wills, who was not only a progressive man of affairs, but a man of modest and
							unassuming demeanor, a fine type of the reliable, self-made American, a friend to the
							poor, charitable to the faults of his neighbors and who always stood ready to unite
							with them in every good work and active in the support of laudable public interests.
							He was proud of the grand state of Indiana and zealous of its progress and prosperity.
							He was a man who in every respect merited the high esteem in which he was universally
							held, for he was a man of public spirit, intellectual attainments and exemplary
							character. During the latter years of his life, both he and his good wife made their
							home in Clayton with the immediate subject of this sketch, and there she, too, passed
							away in 1897. While Amos S. Wills never united with any church, yet throughout his
							life he lived the life of a devout Christian and no communicant could order his life
							more carefully nor more in conformity with the principles laid down by the Master than
							did he. He was a regular attendant on the services of the Christian church and
							contributed liberally of both time and means to further the great cause. In all his
							activities in this direction he was ably assisted by his devoted wife. They were the
							parents of thirteen children, one of whom, William Henry Harrison, died in infancy and
							Lena Leota passed away at the age of sixteen years. Several others of the family have
							passed away, being James Irwin, Elizabeth (Mrs. Mitchell), John W., Parker, Mary Ruth
							and another infant. Those remaining, in addition to the immediate subject of this
							sketch, are Eldridge, Nancy Jane (Mrs. Garrison), Taylor Allen and Lilly Belle (Mrs.
							Farquer).</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-486" n="454"/>

						<p>David B. Wills passed the -years of his early boyhood on the home farm, attending the
							township schools and assisting in the home work. Deciding against the vocation of
							farming as his life work, at the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to the carpenter's
							trade, which he followed for nearly thirty years, confining his efforts largely to
							work within the limits of this county. About 1901 he associated himself with a partner
							and engaged in the lumber business, later purchasing his partner's interest. He has
							continued alone in this enterprise and by his ability and energy has built up a large
							and thriving business. Mr. Wills is a worthy son of his excellent father and has come
							to his position as one of the leading business men of Clayton through the practice of
							the principles implanted in him during his childhood. Mr. Wills' religious affiliation
							is with the Presbyterian church, of which he is an active and devout member. His
							fraternal affiliation is with the Free and Accepted Masons, being a member of Lodge
							No. 463 at Clayton. Politically, he is a Republican with decidedly progressive views.
							His integrity has ever been unassailable, his honor unimpeachable, and he stands now,
							as he has stood in the past, one of the successful men and representative citizens of
							the day and generation. He is a busy man, but he finds time and opportunity to take an
							interest in matters pertaining to the progress and growth of his community and county
							and keeps abreast of the times on all questions of vital interest. Mr. and Mrs. Wills
							are the parents of seven children, three of whom have passed away. These are Carl,
							Esther and Helen, who died in infancy. The others are Eva, Luella, George and Frank,

						<head><hi rend="center">LEANDE~R M. CAMPBELL.</hi></head>

						<p>The gift of life is so mysterious that when that other mystery which we call death
							interrupts the current of human hopes and aspirations, we know not in what new channel
							the spirit may be turned, but if the life has been characterized by uprightness and
							honor everything that it has touched in its onward passage must have received a
							beneficent inspiration.</p>

						<p>In the various relations of life the late Leander M. Campbell, of Danville, gave to
							the world the best of an essentially strong, noble and loyal nature; his life was
							guided and governed by the highest principles of integrity and honor; he was
							humanity's friend and his nature was attuned to tolerance and sympathy. Mr. Campbell
							was a pioneer member of the Hendricks <pb id="VAC1000-487" n="455"/> county bar, and
							for a long lapse of years he was recognized as one of the leaders of his profession,
							figuring prominently in nearly all the important litigation of the county. His fine
							capabilities and upright character endeared him to a large circle of friends, and he
							was honored by a lucrative clientele and called to positions of high official trust,
							being at different times a member of both houses of the Indiana Legislature.</p>

						<p>Leander M. Campbell was a native of Lewis county, Kentucky, born February 12, 1833,
							and he was a son of Lewis and Susan Campbell, both of whom died in the state of
							Kentucky. Leander was educated in the common schools of his community, and studied law
							with his brother in Maysville, Kentucky. He came to Indiana before attaining his legal
							majority, and settled on section 17 in Middle township, Hendricks county, in 1852. He
							was too young to be admitted to the bar, and so he taught school for a few years,
							being at one time principal of the Belleville school. A few years later he was
							admitted to the bar and was actively engaged in the practice of his profession up to
							the time of his death. As a lawyer he showed abilities of the most solid and definite
							order, gaining success by close application and the effective employment of his
							talents, and ever observing those unwritten ethics through whose influence the dignity
							and honor of the profession are maintained. He was not long in attending high prestige
							as one of the representative members of the bar of Hendricks county, a bar notable at
							the present time, as in the past, for the professional brilliancy and marked
							precedence of its general personnel. Broad and comprehensive knowledge of the law and
							a distinct facility in its application, both as a trial lawyer and a counselor,
							enabled him to build up a very substantial practice. This success in the work of his
							profession was cumulative and his prestige grew apace, so that at the time of his
							death he stood in the front ranks as a lawyer.</p>

						<p>As a citizen Mr. Campbell occupied an equally high place in the community, being ever
							mindful of those moral obligations that the highest citizenship entails. His long
							residence in the county gave him an extensive acquaintance and endeared him to many
							people who will be moved to appreciation and admiration of this brief tribute to a man
							essentially simple and unostentatious in his tastes and habits, one of the world's
							faithful and productive workers whose success was worthily won.</p>

						<p>Leander M. Campbell was first married September 19, 1852, to Matilda Hammond, by whom
							he had four children, only one of whom is now living, Mrs. Cora Campbell Barnett, of
							Indianapolis. On June 15, 1867, he was married to Lucinda Hamrick, a daughter of A. D.
							and Eliza (Simpson) Hamrick, both natives of Mason county, Kentucky. The Hamrick
							family is one of the most prominent families of Putnam county, Indiana, members of <pb
								id="VAC1000-488" n="456"/> the family figuring largely in the political and civic
							life of the county for several generations. A. D. Hamrick was a prosperous farmer and
							lived to the venerable age of ninety-two. He was a prominent politician and Republican
							party worker, being a special friend of Governor Oliver P. Morton. His father was in
							the Revolutionary War.</p>

						<p>Leander M. Campbell was a stalwart in the camp of the Republican party, and he was an
							effective exponent of its principles and policies. Fraternally, he was a prominent Odd
							Fellow. Mr. Campbell died at his home in Danville June 16, 1890. Mrs. Campbell, a
							woman of rare culture and charming personality, still resides in the Danville home, a
							home endeared to her by the associations of the past, long known for its generous and
							refined hospitality.</p>

						<p>Viewed in its clear perspective, the life of Leander M. Campbell counted for much. He
							made for himself a secure place in popular confidence and esteem, and while he now
							rests from his labors, his name is graven deeply in the hearts of a legion of friends

						<p>In placing the late Jonathan F. Phillips in the front rank of the leading men of his
							community, justice is rendered a biographical fact universally recognized throughout
							the locality long honored by his citizenship by those at all familiar with his
							history. Although a quiet and unassuming man, with no ambition for public position or
							leadership, he contributed much to the material, civic and moral advancement of his
							community, while his admirable qualities of head and heart and the straightforward,
							upright course of his daily life won for him the esteem and confidence of the circles
							in which he moved, and, although he is now sleeping the "'sleep of the just," his
							influence still lives and his memory is greatly revered.</p>

						<p>Jonathan F. Phillips, who was the owner of one hundred and fifty acres of fine
							farming land in Clay township, this county, was born in the township where his entire
							life was spent, on April 16, 1840, and died in the home where he spent so many happy
							years, October 28, 1907. He was the son of Samuel and Rachel (Newman) Phillips, his
							father being a native,of North Carolina, his birth having occurred there on July 6,
							1808, while his mother also was born in the same state on March 16, 1818. When Samuel
							Phillips was a young man he and his parents came to Wayne county, Indiana, where <pb

								<p rend="center">JONATHAN F. PHILLIPS</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-490" n="457"/> they remained until the death of his father, which
							occurred about one year later. He, with his mother, came to Hendricks county, settling
							in Clay township, where he remained until his death, which occurred July 31, 1880.
							Samuel Phillips was married to Rachel Newman, daughter of John and Elizabeth (Pool)
							Newman, and to this union were born nine children: Jonathan, the immediate subject of
							this sketch; Susannah, born November 11, 1841, who married Enoch Harlan; Albert
							Lorenzo, born March 27, 1844; Lewis, born December 12, 1846, married Rozella Masten;
							Samuel E., born November 5, 1849, deceased; Sallie, born July 10, 1852, married
							William Shirley; John N., born June 24, 1855, married Joanna Ratcliff; Oliver P., born
							October 28, 1858, first married Ella Swain, and after her death he married Addie
							O'Neal: Emery, born November 3, 1863, first married Rosa Justice, and after her death,
							Martha Parker.</p>

						<p>Jonathan F. Phillips received all of his common school education in the district
							schools of Clay township, and when still a very young man he began to work on the
							farm. He continued to reside on the home farm, helping his father, until his marriage,
							which occurred on March 23, 1868, at which time he was married to Makina Couch, who
							was a daughter of Samuel and Lydia (Hunt) Couch, and to this union were born five
							children: Alma C., who is a teacher and a very cultured woman; Lora, the wife of
							Milton West; Aldus W., who married Edna Atkins and has three children, Myron A., Mary
							M. and Edith Alma; Amanda died at the age of twenty-two years; Olney W. is unmarried
							and at home with his mother.</p>

						<p>The parents of Mrs. Phillips were both natives of North Carolina, where they lived
							all their lives. They reared a family of five children: Tilghman, who married Eusebia
							Stanley; Steven, who married Rena Nowlin; Makina, the wife of Mr. Phillips; George
							married Mary Peratt, and Walter, who is unmarried. Mrs. Phillips' father died in 1847
							and her mother in 1893.</p>

						<p>Mr. Phillips was a life-long Republican and, while favoring the principles of that
							party, he was not a partisan to the degree that blinded him to the faults of local
							candidates on his own party ticket. He always reserved the right to cast his vote in
							local elections for the best candidate, irrespective of party. He was always a loyal
							member of the Grand Army of the Republic, having served for sixteen months during the
							Civil War in Company B, One Hundred Seventeenth Regiment Volunteer Infantry. His
							service was eminently satisfactory and upon an honorable discharge from the service he
							returned to Hendricks county. He and the members of his family were loyal and devoted
							adherents of the Methodist Episcopal church, and during his <pb id="VAC1000-491"
								n="458"/> life he was a regular attendant on the services of that denomination. He
							was always a sympathetic and ready helper in all enterprises which had for their
							object the welfare of the community. His upright and manly life won for him a large
							circle of friends throughout the township who sincerely mourn his loss.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">MORDECAI CARTER.</hi></head>

						<p>A review of the life of the honored subject of this biographical sketch must of
							necessity be brief and general in its character. To enter fully into the interesting
							details of the career of Mr. Carter, touching the earnest and persistent efforts of
							his earlier years and successes of later days, would far transcend the limits of this
							article. He has filled a large place in the ranks of the enterprising and
							public-spirited men of his day and has been an important factor in the growth and
							development of Danville's industrial and commercial interests. Within the past few
							years he has become identified with banking and other financial institutions in
							Indianapolis, although he still retains a part of his interests in Danville.</p>

						<p>Mordecai Carter, vice-president of the Continental National Bank and president of the
							State Savings and Trust Company, both of Indianapolis, was born near Plainfield,
							Hendricks county, Indiana. His parents, Newlin and Beulah (Hunt) Carter, were both
							natives of this county, his father living the life of a farmer until his death, in
							July, 1912. Mr. and Mrs. Newlin Carter reared a family of eight children, seven of
							whom are living: Dr. Amos Carter, of Plainfield; Mrs. Lydia H. Cope, of Plainfield;
							Mordecai, the immediate subject of this sketch; Mrs. Sarah S. Gilbert, of Grand
							Junction, Colorado; Caleb H., vice-president of the American State Bank of
							Indianapolis; Mrs. Margaret Mills, of West Newton, Indiana; Alonzo J., of Yorba Linda,
							California, and Rachel Elina, who died in February, 1912. Mr Carter was born on his
							father's farm and lived there until he was nearly grown. He received his common-school
							education in the district schools of his home township and then entered the high
							school at Plainfield. Immediately after leaving high school he engaged in the hardware
							and lumber business at Plainfield, where he remained for two years. He then went into
							the implement and buggy business, which he followed for the next two years, at the
							expiration of which time he was appointed deputy auditor of Hendricks county under
							John Kendall and served in that capacity from 1885 until 1888. <pb id="VAC1000-492"
								n="459"/> Upon retiring from this position, he was offered the position of general
							book-keeper in the First National Bank of Danville and served in that capacity until
							1895, when he succeeded Capt. B. F. Thomas as cashier of the bank. He proved to be a
							close student of the banking problem and such was the confidence of the directors of
							the bank in his ability that in 1899 he was elected president of this institution. He
							was also elected secretary of the Danville Trust Company, which positions he held
							until 1909, when he was instrumental in the organization of the Continental National
							Bank, of Indianapolis. Since the organization of the latter institution he has become
							its vice-president and is occupying that important position at the present time. In
							1913 he was elected president of State Savings and Trust Company, which was organized
							in June of that year. The directors chose Mr. Carter on account of his ability and
							practical banking experience. He was the first secretary for two years of the Indiana
							Bankers' Association upon its organization in 1897. He is also president of the
							Lindhurst Realty Company, of Indianapolis, and a director and one of the incorporators
							of the Klondyke Milling Company, of Danville.</p>

						<p>Mr. Carter has always taken a great interest in public affairs and has allied himself
							with the Republican party. In 1908 he was elected to the lower house of the
							Legislature from Hendricks county, and was re-elected in 1910. While in the
							Legislature he was appointed one of the four commissioners to investigate and report
							on a state penal farm.</p>

						<p>Mr. Carter was married in 1888 to Laura Kellum, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Wesley
							Kellum, of Friendswood, Indiana. They have two children, Lucile, who is now a student
							in the University of Illinois, and Leland K., who is a student at Westtown,
							Pennsylvania. Mrs. Carter died on March 15, 1895.</p>

						<p>Mr. Carter has been a life-long member of the Friends church and contributes
							liberally to the support of that denomination. In his fraternal affiliations he is a
							member of the Free and Accepted Masons, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the
							Knights of Pythias. Socially, he is a member of the Columbia and Marion Clubs of
							Indianapolis. He is also a member of the Chamber of Commerce and is a member of the
							board of directors, and of the finance and house committees. While living in Danville
							he took an active part in every movement which had to do with the welfare of the town.
							He has been for many years a trustee and one of the stanchest friends of the Central
							Normal College. He was one of the organizers and prime movers of the movement to get
							the Carnegie library in Danville, and was <pb id="VAC1000-493" n="460"/> appointed by
							the court as one of the trustees of the library. He was president of the Indiana
							Library Trustees' Association in 1911.</p>

						<p>It is readily seen that Mr. Carter has been a very busy man all of his life and yet,
							in spite of the multitudinous activities of his life, he has never allowed the pursuit
							of wealth to warp his kindly nature. He is indeed a representative of that sterling
							type of the world's workers who have furnished much of the bone and sinew of the
							country and added to the stability of our country and its institutions. He has
							preserved his faculties and the warmth of his heart for the broadening helpful
							influence of human life and is a kindly genial friend and a gentleman whom it is
							always a pleasure to meet.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">GEORGE T. PATTISON.</hi></head>

						<p>The life history of him whose name heads this biographical sketch has been for many
							years closely identified with the history of Hendricks county, Indiana. Throughout the
							years his life has been one of untiring activity and it has been crowned with success
							both as an instructor in school and college, and as a lawyer. Years of conscientious
							work as a lawyer have brought with them not only increase of practice and reputation,
							but also that growth in legal knowledge and that wide and accurate judgment the
							possession of which constitutes marked excellence in the profession. His life affords
							a splendid example of what an American youth, plentifully endowed with good common
							sense, energy and determination, can accomplish when accompanied by good moral
							principles. From the beginning, he has been intensely methodical and unswervingly
							persistent in search of the true light and of the essentials of the legal foundation
							and sources of legal conception and thought, holding devoutly to the highly
							embellished record of equity and the sure, certain, invincible methods of
							practice.</p>

						<p>George T. Pattison, one of the leading attorneys of Danville, was born in Henry
							county, this state, July 18, 1857. His parents were William B. and Susan A. (Colville)
							Pattison, both of whom were natives of Kentucky. His father is still living with his
							son, George T., at the advanced age of eighty-nine years, while his mother's death
							occurred in 1912, at the age of eighty-four. Mr. and Mrs. William B. Pattison were the
							parents of four children, two of whom are living, Mrs. Keturah Keitner, of
							Indianapolis, and George T.</p>

						<p>George T. Pattison received his education in the district schools near <pb
								id="VAC1000-494" n="461"/> Elwood, Indiana, and later attended school in the city of
							Elwood, his father having moved from Henry county to Madison county, Indiana, during
							his boyhood. Subsequently he attended the National Normal University at Lebanon, Ohio,
							for eighteen months, after which he taught school for three years, making a successful
							record in that profession. In 1883 he entered the Central Normal College at Danville,
							Indiana, and graduated from that institution two years later. He then engaged in the
							teaching profession and followed it continuously and successfully for the next twelve
							years, all of his teaching being in the Central Normal College. He had full charge of
							the commercial work in the college until he began the study of law and abstracting in
							1897. In 1904 he began to devote his entire time to his law practice and associated
							with Judge J. L. Clark until Judge Clark went on the bench.</p>

						<p>Mr. Pattison was married in August, 1886, to Jennie M. Downard, the daughter of Mr.
							and Mrs. Robert Downard. Mr. and Mrs. Pattison have three children: Marion, the wife
							of Carl Hawley, of Toledo, Ohio; Albert, who is now attending the Central Normal
							College, and Ruth, who is a student in the high school at Danville.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Pattison are devoted and consistent members of the Methodist Episcopal
							church of Danville, and for many years Mr. Pattison has been a member of its official
							board. He is also secretary of the college board of trustees and has held that
							important position for many years. Fraternally, he is a member of the Independent
							Order of Odd Fellows and is at present the district deputy of the district in which
							the Danville lodge is situated. He was a member of the school board of Danville for
							nine years and was no small factor in building up the schools of the city to their
							present high standard. Politically, Mr. Pattison has been a life-long Republican, and
							has taken more or less interest in local campaigns. However, he has not held any
							public positions at the hands of his party.</p>

						<p>Mr. Pattison's life has been a busy and useful one and his career fully exemplifies
							what can be accomplished by a man who is filled with the determination to succeed in
							life. As a public school teacher for many years and later as a college professor, he
							was a factor of great power in molding the lives of young people. In his official
							capacity as a member of the school board he was instrumental in employing high grade
							teachers in the city schools of his resident town and in every way he encouraged the
							educational life of the community. Whether his work has been in the school room, the
							lodge room, in his law practice or wherever he has been found, it can be truly said of
							him that he was always animated by high ideals and the desire <pb id="VAC1000-495"
								n="462"/> to treat his fellow man with exact justice. He has attained to an enviable
							standing in the legal profession of his county and his reading of the law is always
							characterized by that fine sympathy which is the true mark of great advocates. He is a
							man of genial personality and makes friends with all with whom he comes in

						<head><hi rend="center">ELMER HODSON.</hi></head>

						<p>The student interested in the history of Hendricks county does not have to carry his
							investigations far into its annals before learning that Elmer Hodson has long been one
							of its most active and leading citizens in its agricultural and stock-raising
							interests and that his labors have been a potent force in making this a rich
							agricultural region, for through several decades he has carried on general farming,
							gradually improving his valuable place, and while he has prospered in this he has also
							found time and ample opportunity to assist in the material and civic development of
							the county.</p>

						<p>The subject's ancestral record, in brief, is as follows: On the paternal side, the
							great-great-grandparents were George and Mary (Thacher) Hodson; great-grandparents,
							Robert and Rachel (Mills) Hodson; grandparents, Jesse and Mary (Wilson) Hodson, whose
							children were Robert W., Jesse W., Jeremiah W., Eli W., Elizabeth W., Rachel W., Mary
							W., and Joel W. Mary Wilson was a daughter of Jeremiah and Elizabeth (Saferight)
							Wilson. On the maternal side, the grandparents were Samuel and Rebecca (Binford)
							Parker, the former being a son of Joseph or Josiah and Martha (Peel) Parker, and the
							latter a daughter of James and Hannah (Crew) Binford. To Samuel and Rebecca Parker
							were born the following children: Silas, John, James, Josiah (died in young manhood,
							single), Hannah Jane (mother of the subject), Martha Ann, and Angelina, who married a
							Mr. Brown and died about a year later, leaving a baby girl who died about six weeks
							after her mother's death.</p>

						<p>Elmer Hodson, the son of Joel and Hannah Jane (Parker) Hodson, was born in the house
							in which he is now living on June 15, 1866. His father was born in North Carolina on
							August 3, 1817, and came to this state with his parents in 1831. They located in Mill
							Creek settlement, but after a year's residence there, they entered land in Clay
							township in 1832. A few years later Joel Hodson entered six hundred and forty acres of
							land in Iowa, and held it for a number of years, and when he sold it at a good price
								<pb id="VAC1000-496" n="463"/> he invested the proceeds in land in this county. He
							spent his whole life in this county from the time he came here in 1831 until his
							death, which occurred June 3, 1911. His first wife was Charlotte Brown, and to this
							marriage was born one child, Brazeldon B., who married Ann Bryant. After the death of
							his first wife, Joel Hodson married Sarah A. Hill, and to this marriage there were
							born three children: John R., who married Ella Masten, and after her death, Mrs. Lydia
							Jessup; Jesse C. married Ruth Masten; Jennie married James Kendall, and after his
							death, Samuel Pitts. After the death of Mr. Hodson's second wife he married Hannah
							Jane Parker, and to this union there were born four children: Mary, wife of Samuel
							Atkins; Rebecca became the wife of Jesse Branson; Martha married Nathan Carter, and
							Elmer, the immediate subject of this sketch. Hannah Parker, the mother of Elmer
							Hodson, was born in Rush county, Indiana, February 17, 1829, and died in Clay
							township, this county, May 3, 1904.</p>

						<p>Elmer Hodson received his education in the schools of his home township and early in
							life started to work on his father's farm. When he became of age his father gave him a
							farm of his own, and on this place he has spent his entire career. He is recognized as
							one of the most scientific farmers of the county, keeping abreast of all the latest
							methods in agriculture and having his farm well supplied with all the necessary
							farming machinery and accessories.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hodson was married to Luella Hadley, the daughter of Samuel J. and Locadia
							(Brown) Hadley, and to this marriage has been born one child, Vera Jane, who is now
							attending Earlham College, and will graduate in June, 1914. The parents of Mrs. Hodson
							were both natives of this state, her father's birth having occurred in Morgan county,
							where he spent his entire life. He was a farmer and at the time of his death he was
							the owner of two hundred and forty acres of land. To Mr. and Mrs. Samuel J. Hadley
							were born six children: Cornelius, who first married Elsie King, and after her death,
							Mattie <milestone unit="typography" n="-------"/>, and after her death, Marcella
							Clark; Elva married Joshua Hunt; Sarah Jane married Harry Thompson; Luella, the wife
							of Mr. Hodson; Vinton, deceased; Elizabeth married Alva R. Shirley, of
							Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hodson has been a Republican in politics from conviction, feeling that in the
							principles set forth by that party the welfare of the nation would be best conserved.
							His interest in politics has been that of the public-spirited citizen, who has a civic
							interest in his country's welfare, but is not particularly concerned in holding,office
							himself. He is a member of the Friends church <pb id="VAC1000-497" n="464"/> at Mill
							Creek and Mrs. Hodson belongs to the society at Amo, both being interested in all
							matters pertaining to the welfare of the community in which they live. Mr. Hodson's
							upright life and courteous dealings have won for him the esteem of a wide concourse of
							friends throughout the locality in which he has spent his life.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">ROBERT OPIE CHRISTIE.</hi></head>

						<p>The history of many Indiana families takes us back into colonial times, and it is a
							source of satisfaction to trace the history of a family from the seventeenth century
							up to the present time. The Christies of Hendricks county trace their ancestry back to
							colonial times, where they have found that the original founder of the family was
							educated for a Catholic priest. However, his relatives objected so vigorously to his
							espousal of the Catholic faith that he left England and came to this country, where he
							could worship as he pleased. He settled in Virginia and in the course of time married
							a woman of refinement and culture who lived in the city of Philadelphia. To this
							marriage there was born one son, James, who, in turn, married and became the father of
							William, the founder of the Hendricks county branch of the Christies. James Christie
							enlisted in the Revolutionary War when a very young man and served for seven years.
							James married Sarah Lemond and settled in Franklin county, Virginia, on the James
							river, where he lived until 1803. He then moved to Lincoln county, Kentucky, and a
							year later he moved with all his family to Shelby county, in the same state, where he
							taught school until his death. William was the third of the ten children born to James
							Christie and wife.</p>

						<p>William Christie was born in Virginia, August 25, 1786, and was sixteen years of age
							when his parents moved to Kentucky. Therefore, he had but little chance for schooling,
							although his father taught all of his children to read and write at home. He acquired
							a fair knowledge of law and, being a wide reader, he was well versed in the topics of
							the day. On August 15, 1805, when only nineteen, he was married to Sarah Miles, who
							died a year later, leaving an infant daughter, Mary. On February 20, 1810, William
							married Elizabeth Miles, a cousin of his first wife. At the opening of the War of 1812
							he enlisted and served throughout as the captain of a pack-horse company. After his
							return from the war he lived on a farm in Kentucky and <pb id="VAC1000-498" n="[]"/>

							1878. He died in the faith of the Regular Baptist church, to which he had belonged for
							nearly seventy-five years.</p>

						<p>Robert Opie Christie, the great-grandson of William Christie, was born December 4,
							1872, in Marion township, Hendricks county, Indiana. His parents were James P. and
							Amantha Ann (Yowell) Christie, his father being born in this county on November 19,
							1844. James P. was married in 1871 to Amanthis Ann, the daughter of Walker and Eliza
							(Duvall) Yowell. Walker Yowell was a native of Virginia and came west to Kentucky with
							his parents when he was a small boy. He grew to manhood and married in that state. In
							1854 he came to Hendricks county and located on the farm in Marion township where
							James Christie now lives. He lived on this farm of eighty acres until his death, in
							1902, at the age of eighty-four, having been born in 1817. His wife was born in
							Kentucky and died in Marion township, this county, in 1885, at the age of
							fifty-six.</p>

						<p>James P. Christie was the second son of eight children born to John and Lucinda
							(Bush) Christie. John was a native of Kentucky, being born in that state January 15,
							1816, and dying in this county October 8, 1888. He was farmer and carpenter all his
							life, and took quite an interest in public affairs. He was a Democrat and was elected
							supervisor several times in his township. His wife was a native of Kentucky, but came
							to this county when a small girl with her parents and was reared in the county. She
							died in 1891. Mr. and Mrs. John Christie were the parents of eight children: William
							P., James, Thomas J., Sarah Elizabeth (deceased), Lemon M., John Wesley (deceased),
							Frank Douglass and George Washington.</p>

						<p>James P. Christie spent his boyhood days on his father's farm, receiving his
							schooling in the district schools of the neighborhood. He worked on his father's farm
							until he was twenty-eight and then moved to his present farm of one hundred and
							eighteen acres. He has been a road supervisor for the past thirty years. His wife,
							Amanthis Ann Yowell, was born in Kentucky in 1851 and has lived in this county since
							she was four years of age. To James P. Christie and wife have been born three
							children: Robert O., the subject of this sketch; Mrs. Beatrice Hadley and Herbert
							D.</p>

						<p>Robert O. Christie was educated in the schools of his home township and then spent
							three terms in the Central Normal College of Danville. He started farming on his
							present farm, which is a part of the old homestead <pb id="VAC1000-500" n="466"/>
							farm. In addition to a general system of farming, he specializes in cattle breeding,
							raising Shorthorn and Durham cattle for the market. He has a fine herd on hand at all
							times and is an expert judge of cattle. He is regarded as one of the best stock
							raisers in central Indiana, and is rapidly coming to the front as one of the leading
							cattle experts of the state.</p>

						<p>Mr. Christie was married on October 9, 1895, to Clara Rogers, the daughter of Chilin
							and Sallie (Clay) Rogers. Her parents are natives of this county and are now living
							retired at Amo, Indiana. Mr. and Mrs. Christie have had two children, but both died in
							early childhood, Gladys R. at the age of six and Ruth at the age of two and a
							half.</p>

						<p>In his political relations, Mr. Christie has always voted the Democratic ticket,

							Dean, was born July 25, 1770, and died at the age of one hundred and three at Salem,
							North Carolina, and to this union there were born six children: Sarah, born April 10,
							1780; Benjamin, June 20, 1784; William, March 1, 1789; James, January 13, 1791;
							Frederick, April 3, 1794; Eli, July 23, 1803. John Cosner, the maternal grandfather of
							C. C. Whicker, was born May 8, 1768, and died December 15, 1849. He married Abigail
							Pike, who was born October 3, 1770, and died January 1, 1861. To Mr. and Mrs. John

							1811; Peggy, May 21, 1814.</p>

						<p>Frederick Whicker received his common school education in the district schools of his
							township and worked on his father's farm until the latter's death, which occurred when
							the son was nineteen years of age. He then went to farming for himself and soon
							afterward bought a farm of forty acres in Clay township, this county. He was a very
							successful farmer and in the course of a few years had one hundred and sixty acres of
							good farming land. In the spring of 1861 he moved to Ben Davis, remaining there until
							October, 1875, when he returned to Franklin township, Hendricks county, and again
							resumed farming, and here he continued to reside until twelve years before his death,
							when he retired from active work and removed to Stilesville, this county, where he
							died November 22, 1913. In the spring of 1858 Frederick Whicker married Louisa S.
							Duley, and to this union there were born two children, Clarence C., the subject of
							this review, and Franz F., of Franklin township. The subject's maternal
							great-grandparents were Zadock and Susanna (White) Duley, whose families had been
							located in Virginia for two and a half centuries. Eventually they moved to Fleming
							county, Kentucky, <pb id="VAC1000-502" n="468"/> where their deaths occurred. Their
							children were as follows: John, single; Hiram, who married Sophia Northcut; Charley,
							who also married Sophia Northcut; Henry married Martha Mershon; Susan, the wife of
							Henry Sweet; Jane, single; Ann, the wife of James Wilson; Polley, the wife of Thomas
							Money. Of these, Henry Duley, the subject's grandfather, was born April 4, 1800, and
							died July 2, 1846. On January 6, 1825, he married Martha Mershon, who was born January
							11, 1804, and died July 16, 1881, and their children were as follows: America, single;
							John C., born September 7, 1828, who married Heba Hord; Louisa S., the subject's
							mother; Frances, wife of Philip Pratt; Henry C., born September 26, 1836, married
							Athalinda Redmond; William, born July 14, 1830, married Malinda Wood. Daniel Mershon,
							the father of Mrs. Martha Duley, was of French Huguenot descent, though a resident of
							Virginia, where he married Effie Hamilton. Their children were as follows: Susan
							married Jesse Turner; Martha married Henry Duley; Sallie married James Jones; Eliza
							became Mrs. Allsup; Fannie married Washington Wills; Benjamin married Miss Gorganay;
							Eli married Miss Bell; James married and died young; Cornelius died young. In 1868
							Mrs. Louisa Whicker died, and subsequently Mr. Whicker married Martha A. Robinson, the
							daughter of John and Martha Robinson, and to this union one child was born, Mildred
							Mary, who died October 10, 1881. Mrs. Martha A. Whicker was a daughter of John and
							Martha A. (Hughes.) Robinson, of Kent county, England. She was born at Covington,
							Kentucky, September 9, 1844, and died at Stilesville May 10, 1914, in the seventieth
							year of her age. She joined the Methodist Episcopal church in 1886 and, until her
							health failed, was a regular attendant of church and Sunday school.</p>

						<p>Clarence C. Whicker attended his first school in Marion county, Indiana, near Ben
							Davis, but his school advantages were very limited. However, he has kept apace with
							modern improvements in agricultural work and on the current topics of the day, so that
							he is now able to discuss intelligently the leading current events. He worked on his
							father's farm until 1897, when he married and began farming on his own account,
							locating then on his present place, known as the John Grimes farm, on the Amo and
							Stilesville road. He first bought one hundred and sixty acres in 1892, to which he
							added one hundred acres in 1896, and all but about thirty-five acres is in a high
							state of cultivation. In 1910 he built the splendid fifteen-room residence and has
							made many other permanent and substantial improvements. He carries on general farming
							operations, also giving proper attention to live stock. In addition to a diversified
							system of farming he engaged in stock raising and was successful from the first in
							this line of work.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-503" n="469"/>

						<p>Mr. Whicker married Iva Wallace on April 20, 1897, the daughter of Thomas L. and
							Alamanza (Kirkham) Wallace, of Tipton county, this state, and to this union there have
							.been born two children, Louis and Clarice Crista. Mrs. Whicker's parents are natives
							of Indiana, her father having been born in Tipton county, and her mother in Morgan
							county, and they were the parents of three children, Victoria, the wife of Orin L.
							Osborne, and they have two children, Carodine and Blythe; Cora married Elvin
							McClelland, and has two children, Emil and Doris.</p>

						<p>Mr. Whicker has allied himself with the new Progressive party because he feels that
							it offers the best solution for all those evils which beset our nation today. He and
							his wife take an active interest in the various affairs of the neighborhood in which
							they live which seek the public welfare. Mrs. Whicker is a loyal and consistent member
							of the Methodist Episcopal church at Stilesville. As a farmer Mr. Whicker has been
							very successful, having devoted all his energies to agricultural pursuits and has met
							with the success which he merits. He is a practical and methodical farmer and has
							always given his personal attention to the various details of his farm work with the
							result that he has an enviable standing in the community because of his ability and
							success in his chosen vocation. He has been successful in the accumulation of material
							wealth, being the owner of two hundred and sixty acres of fine farming land in
							Franklin and Clay townships in this county.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN J. DUGAN.</hi></head>

						<p>It has been often said that the versatility and virility of the American people have
							been brought about largely by the continual introduction of new elements through the
							assimilation of the better class of our immigrant population. One small country beyond
							the seas has furnished its full quota of desirable citizens, and the brilliant thought
							and quick wit of these gentlemen are proverbial. Not a few of our most brilliant
							statesmen and men of affairs have been either natives of "Ireland, the Beautiful Isle
							of the Sea," or were descended from sturdy Hibernian stock. One of the conspicuous
							successes of this character in Hendricks county is John J. Dugan, the son of Michael
							and Margaret (Hughes) Dugan.</p>

						<p>In some respects a true son of Erin, he is none the less a loyal American and a
							Hoosier, being widely known and generally respected in the community in which he was
							born and bred. He, himself, is a native of Hendricks <pb id="VAC1000-504" n="470"/>
							county, having first seen the light of day upon his father's farm in Middle township,
							on the 4th day of March, 1882, and since that day he has lived in and worked loyally
							for the interests of this county. His father, Michael, and his mother, Margaret Dugan,
							were both natives of Galway, Ireland. They came to America in their youth, Michael
							being but nineteen years of age when he reached this country. He immediately found an
							abiding place on a farm near Brownsburg, Lincoln township, this county. Later he came
							to Middle township and, by hard work as a farmer and frugal habits, came into
							possession of a large tract of land about four miles north of Pittsboro. Here the
							remainder of his life was spent, toiling diligently and intelligently for the
							sustenance of himself and his family, and also looking forward to his later years when
							he need no longer toil for necessities, but could enjoy the fruits of his labor. His
							faithful wife was an unfailing source of help and strength and to her efforts, in no
							small measure, his success is due. To them were born eight children, seven of whom are
							still living to carry out into the world, for generations to come perhaps, the name
							and teachings of their father. These children are Martin, Katherine (Collins), Ellen,
							Delia, Mary, Patrick, John J., and Anna, whom death called. The devoted mother still
							enjoys the home of her youth, ably assisted in its management by her children. Michael
							Dugan was a firm adherent of the tenets of Jefferson, always voting the Democratic
							ticket. Though very progressive in his ideas and active in affairs touching the public
							welfare in his community, he aspired to no political office, finding ample field for
							his abundant energy in his immediate surroundings.</p>

						<p>His son, John J. Dugan, is one of the thoroughly progressive, representative men of
							the county. Abreast of the times and thoroughly informed on all questions pertaining
							to the public welfare, his judgment is largely relied upon by many of the neighboring
							citizens. His education was received in the schools of the township, but he has never
							ceased to study. Like his father, he is a stanch Democrat, and was elected to the
							Legislature on this ticket at the election in 1912, which office he has filled with
							great credit, devoting his energies to the service of the people as conscientiously as
							he has always worked for his own success.</p>

						<p>Mr. Dugan is one of the very successful farmers of the locality, caring for the
							homestead of his childhood, a tract of one hundred and sixty acres, which by its
							appearance shows the intelligent care it has received. Here he engages in general
							farming, devoting considerable attention to the breeding of live stock, particularly
							hogs, a large number of which are marketed by him yearly.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-505" n="471"/>

						<p>Mr. Dugan is unmarried and has taken no interest in fraternal affairs. lie is a
							prominent member of the Indiana Democratic Club, and also a member of the St. Malachy
							Catholic church at Brownsburg. A man of wide acquaintance, sound judgment, decisive
							and straightforward in all his dealings, he stands as an exemplary citizen, one of the
							truly representative men of the county.</p>

						<p>There is no more important factor in the history of a town than the newspapers, and
							it is often true that it is the newspapers of a town which are largely responsible for
							its prosperity. The influence of a good newspaper cannot be over estimated. In it the
							people read from week to week not only of the happenings of their own county and
							state, but news from all over our country and the world as well. Every weekly
							newspaper in every town of Indiana gives the main facts of the world's history from
							week to week. It places in the hands of the readers the most important events which
							happen any place in the world. No great invention is made which is not exploited in
							the newspapers. Every newspaper now which depends upon the rural districts for much of
							its support prints from week to week a special page for the farmer. Among the
							newspapers of Hendricks county which are doing their full share in advancing the
							interest of the state, there is no paper doing more brilliant work for the good of the
							county than the <hi rend="i">Brownsburg Record</hi>, which is now owned and edited by
							Virgil S. Watson.</p>

						<p>Mr. Watson, the son of Thomas J. and Amanda (Wright) Watson, was born November 4,
							1869, in Camden, Preble county, Ohio. His parents were both natives of Hendricks
							county, Indiana. The parents of both families came directly from Kentucky and were
							among the earliest settlers of this county. Thomas J. Watson was a successful farmer
							in this county and was largely interested in the buying and selling of stock. He and
							his wife were the parents of three children, Virgil S. being the only one of the
							children now living.</p>

						<p>Virgil S. Watson was educated in the common school of Middle township, in this
							county, and being a young man of intellectual ability it was natural that he should
							take up school teaching. He taught school in this county for three years and in the
							meantime he attended the Central Normal College, at Danville, in order to equip
							himself for more successful work in the school room. However, in compliance with the
							wishes of his parents, he <pb id="VAC1000-506" n="472"/> abandoned the school room,
							and remained at home to assist in looking after the business of his father's farm,
							where he remained until he was forty years of age, when he went to Lebanon, Indiana,
							where he became engaged in newspaper work, for the <hi rend="i">Indianapolis
							News</hi>. A year later he bought the <hi rend="i">Brownsburg Record</hi>, assuming
							the management of the newspaper on June 10, 1912. In politics he is a Republican. He
							runs a modern job printing plant in connection with his newspaper, and adds not a
							little to his annual income by his job work. He is prepared to do all sorts of job
							printing on short notice, and the excellence of his work brings him a continually
							increasing amount of business.</p>

						<p>Mr. Watson was married, June 29, 1904, to Angie Belle Herring, daughter of Phillip B.
							and America (Walker) Herring, and they are the parents of two children, Hazel Bernice
							and one son who died in infancy. They are members of the Methodist Protestant church
							and contribute liberally of their substance to its support.</p>

						<p>Mr. Watson is a man of high character and is giving the people of his community a
							paper which stands for the best interest of Brownsburg in every respect. He advocates
							all measures and movements which he feels will redound to the credit of his home town
							and be of benefit in any way to the citizens of the community.</p>

						<p>Among the citizens of Hendricks county who have built up comfortable homes and
							surrounded themselves with large landed and personal property. none have attained a
							higher degree of success than Allen Whicker. With few opportunities except what his
							own efforts were capable of mastering and with many discouragements to overcome, he
							has made an exceptional success of life and in his old age has the gratification of
							knowing he has the respect of the community in which he has resided all his life, and
							that it has been benefited by his presence and counsel. He is a link between the old
							days and the new, for his boyhood days were spent in truly pioneer conditions.
							Settling in a virgin wilderness, he helped his father to clear the forests, drain the
							fields and raise the first crops on some of the best land in Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>Allen Whicker, the son of Fred K. and Elizabeth (Kosmer) Whicker, was born two miles
							southeast of Amo, Hendricks county, Indiana, March 20, <pb id="VAC1000-507" n="[]"/>

							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-508" n="473"/> 1837. His grandfather, James Whicker, was in the
							Revolutionary War. His grandmother, on his mother's side, was Abigail Pike, who lived
							to he ninety-six years of age. She was a great patriot during the Revolutionary days,
							and when the subject of this sketch was a small boy she told him many stories of the
							dark days of the Revolution. Her husband was a native of Germany. Mr. and Mrs. James
							Whicker, the grandparents of Allen Whicker, lived all their lives in North Carolina,
							and it was in that state that Fred K. Whicker was reared and married. Mr. and Mrs.
							Fred K. Whicker reared a large family of twelve children, six of whom were born in
							North Carolina and six in Indiana. They moved from North Carolina to Indiana shortly
							before Allen Whicker, the subject of this sketch, was born and located in the virgin
							wilderness south of Amo. Here they built a cabin of logs, with a puncheon floor and
							riven door, the entire building being erected without a nail. Wild game of all kinds
							was abundant in the woods, turkeys, squirrels, deer and all kinds of fur-bearing
							animals. In order to prepare the land for cultivation they cut down the magnificent
							oak, walnut and hickory trees and piled them in big heaps and burned them. Timber
							which was burned in those early days would now be worth several hundred dollars per
							acre at the present price of lumber. Fred K. Whicker died at the age of sixty-one and
							his wife at the age of seventy-eight.</p>

						<p>Allen Whicker is the eleventh child in order of birth and the only one living of the
							twelve born to his parents. He has spent his whole life in this county. He attended
							the subscription schools in his boyhood days and received a limited education at the
							three-months terms, which was the length of the school year in his time. He continued
							to live and work on the homestead farm until he was twenty-five years of age, when he
							married and bought forty acres of land of his own adjoining the homestead farm. He has
							been remarkably successful as a farmer and from time to time has added to his
							possessions until he is now the owner of five hundred and fifty acres of as fine land
							as can be found in the county. He has for many years made a specialty of cattle
							feeding and is recognized as one of the largest cattle feeders of the county. He has,
							in addition to his raising of cattle, also raised large numbers of horses and hogs for
							the market.</p>

						<p>Mr. Whicker was married October 30, 1861, to Amanda West, of near Amo, and to this
							marriage there have been born six children: Mary, the wife of John Bunny, of Amo;
							Lina, the wife of William Lewis Beasley; Nora, the wife of Frank Bersbow; Simon, a
							merchant at Amo; Dennis, who lives near Indianapolis, and Otto, who now operates the
							home place. Mr. <pb id="VAC1000-509" n="474"/> Whicker retired in 1913 from active
							farm life and divided his land among his children and now lives in Amo. His first wife
							died in 1901, and on May 25, 1903, he was married to Mrs. Ruth (Masten) Shirley, who
							is a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Masten. Mrs. Whicker had a son, Walter Hodson, by a
							former marriage, who resides in Clay township, west of Mr. Wicker's place.</p>

						<p>Mr. Whicker is a loyal member of the Baptist church of Amo and is a liberal supporter
							of its various activities. He is a man of sound judgment and sterling integrity and
							has made his success in life by strict attention to business, starting out with small
							capital, but a stout heart and willing hands, and he has risen to a place of
							prominence among the representative citizens of his county. Although he has been very
							successful in accumulating a goodly share of this world's goods, he has not neglected
							those finer and higher things in life, but has always identified himself with all
							movements which tend to elevate the general welfare of the locality in which he has
							lived for so many years.</p>

						<p>Franz F. Whicker, the son of Frederick and Louisa (Duley) Whicker, was born in Marion

						<p>Frank F. Whicker attended the common schools in Franklin township, this county, and

						<p>Mr. Whicker married Anna Stark, the daughter of W. J. and Amanda (Adams) Stark, and

						<p>The prosperous farmer whose history is here portrayed is a man who, by his own
							efforts, has worked his way from a modest beginning to a position of influence in his
							community. His life has been one of unceasing industry and perseverance, and the
							systematic and honorable methods he has followed have won for him the confidence of
							his fellow citizens in Hendricks county, whose interests he has ever had at heart and
							which he has always labored to promote. -As township trustee and as county
							commissioner for many years, he rendered faithful and efficient service to the
							citizens of the county. As a farmer he has shown by example what can be accomplished
							by scientific agriculture, and his farm today may fairly stand as one of the best
							farms in every way in the county.</p>

						<p>Elbert M. Murphy, a fine type of the modern farmer, was born February 6, 1863, in
							Franklin county, Indiana. His parents were Henry W. and Elizabeth (Howell) Murphy, his
							father being a native of Franklin county, his birth having occurred there in 1833.
							Henry W. Murphy married Elizabeth <pb id="VAC1000-511" n="476"/> Howell, who was also
							a native of Franklin county, and they continued to live in that county until 1864,
							when they moved to Decatur county, this state. After a residence of sixteen years in
							that county, they moved to Marion county and settled on a farm south of Indianapolis,
							where they have since continued to reside.</p>

						<p>Elbert M. Murphy was reared in Marion county, Indiana, and married there in 1884 to
							Mary J. Miles, the daughter of John and Rosanna (Fowler) Miles. Her father was a
							farmer of Marion county and died there when she was about six years of age. Her mother
							continued to reside on the farm until Mary, the wife of Mr. Murphy, grew to womanhood,
							and then moved to Indianapolis, where she now lives. To Mr. and Mrs. Murphy was born
							one child, Gladys E., in 1892, who died in 1893, at the age of ten months.</p>

						<p>After his marriage Mr. Murphy bought ninety-one acres of land near North Salem in
							this county and from time to time added to his holdings until he is now the owner of
							three hundred and sixty-eight acres in this county. When he first started farming in
							the county there were few improvements on his farm and they were of small value. He
							gradually improved his farm, built a fine, large barn and other outbuildings and has
							made a scientific study of farming efficiency, in order to accomplish the most with
							the least amount of labor. In other words, he uses his brains as well as his muscle,
							and the result has been very gratifying to him. He now has a fine home which compares
							very favorably with the best country homes in the state and adds greatly to the
							appearance as well as to the value of his farm. While he carries on a general system
							of farming, he makes a specialty of feeding live stock and has found this a very
							lucrative diversion from his regular farming.</p>

						<p>Mr. Murphy has been a life-long Republican, taking an intelligent interest in all
							political matters and an indication of his popularity in his township is shown by his
							election, in the fall of 1894, to the office of township trustee, an office which he
							held for five years five months. In 1901 he was nominated by his party for
							commissioner of his district and was elected without any trouble whatever. Following
							his election, he was appointed on November 1, 1901, to fill out the unexpired term of
							his predecessor, and then held office until the end of his term. He gave such
							excellent satisfaction that he was twice re-elected and held the office of county
							commissioner continuously for ten years, his last term expiring January 1, 1912. For
							this long period of ten years he advocated every movement which would benefit his
							county and fought against any measure which he thought would be detrimental to the
							best interests of his county. Mr. and Mrs. Murphy are <pb id="VAC1000-512" n="477"/>
							members of the Methodist Episcopal church of North Salem and take an active interest
							in all kinds of church work. Mr. Murphy is a trustee of the church and of the
							Methodist Episcopal Hospital of Indianapolis, and has been no small factor in the
							erection of that memorial to the Methodists of the state. Fraternally he is a member
							of North Salem Lodge No. 142, Free and Accepted Masons. He is universally regarded as
							one of the most prominent and progressive farmers of the county and, judging by his
							achievements of the past, he promises to maintain his reputation for many years yet to
							come. He is well informed on all the current topics of the day and is a broad-minded
							genteel, highly respected man who has always stood high in the community of his

						<p>The history of Hendricks county, as an integral part of the great commonwealth of
							Indiana, reveals the handiwork of many a great and noble soul who wrought heroically
							and unselfishly. Her splendid homes, her high-grade institutions, her happy,
							prosperous people speak volumes of some one's steadfastness of purpose, of some one's
							strength of arm, courage of heart and activity of brain. Among the men of this county
							who have been actively identified with the commercial life of Lizton for many years,
							is Jacob O. Burgan, the present postmaster. Today we have a division of labor which
							was not dreamed of fifty years ago and in a small village there are frequently as many
							as two score occupations represented. Each man fills his particular part and the
							minister is no more important than the blacksmith, the teacher is of no more intrinsic
							value to the community than the section boss, and the barber performs as useful a
							mission in life of the community as any of the others. Society needs all of these
							professions and it would be impossible to determine the approximate value of each one
							to the general welfare of the community.</p>

						<p>Jacob O. Burgan, postmaster and merchant of Lizton, was born June 17, 1865, in Eel
							River township, Hendricks county. His parents were Alexander and Pernetia (Toney)
							Burgan. Alexander Burgan was born in Floyd county, Virginia, January 20, 1825. The
							Burgan family originally came from Sweden and probably have as complete and detailed a
							family genealogy worked out as any family in Hendricks county. At the present they
							have the ancestral tree traced back to eight generations. The first Burgan of whom
							they have definite record was Jonathan, who was born in Sweden in <pb id="VAC1000-513"
								n="478"/> 1560. He had one son, John or Jonnie, who was also born in Sweden in 1601.
							John married in due course of time and had one son, Yerick, who was born in the land
							of his father in 1640. Yerick went to Germany, where he married and had one son,
							Jacob, who was born in that country in 1695. Jacob grew to manhood, married and had
							one son, by the name of James, who was born in Germany in 1744. James was the first
							one of the family to come to this country and settled in Maryland about the last
							quarter of the eighteenth century, where he married and had one son, Isaac, born in
							1786. Isaac grew to manhood, went to Virginia, married and had one son by the name of
							Alexander. Alexander came to Hendricks county, Indiana, married here and became the
							father of Jacob O. Burgan, whose history is herein. portrayed.</p>

						<p>Alexander Burgan spent his boyhood days upon the farm which his father entered in
							Union township and, upon his marriage to Prenetia Toney, moved to his own farm of
							forty acres adjoining the old homestead farm. He lived on two or three different farms
							in the township and five years before his death he moved to Lizton, where he remained
							until he passed away September 28, 1879. Alexander Burgan and wife were the parents of
							five children: John Wesley, who died in 1883; Tranum, of Indianapolis; Harvey, of
							Indianapolis; Jacob O., the subject of this review, and Mrs. Almanda Swift, of Kokomo,
							Indiana.</p>

						<p>Jacob O. Burgan was given a good practical education in the schools of his township
							and when twelve years of age moved to Lizton with his parents, where he has spent the
							remainder of his life. While still a young man he learned the barber trade and for
							sixteen years operated a barber shop in Lizton. He then engaged in the retail meat
							market and mercantile business which he continued up until his appointment as
							postmaster in 1904. He has been postmaster at Lizton for the past ten years, during
							which he has given conscientious attention to the duties of this official
							position.</p>

						<p>Mr. Burgan was married September 10, 1902, to Margaret, the daughter of John and Sue
							(Vandever) Halfaker. John Halfaker was a native of Johnson county, Indiana, but
							several years ago moved to Hendricks county and settled in Middle township where he
							owns a fine farm about two miles north of Pittsboro. Mrs. Halfaker is a native of
							Boone county, Indiana. Mr. and Mrs. Halfaker are now living at Pittsboro.</p>

						<p>Mr. Burgan is a member of the Knights of Pythias and he and his wife are members of
							the Pythian Sisters. He was also a member of the Improved Order of Red Men.
							Politically, he has always been a Republican and has <pb id="VAC1000-514" n="479"/>
							been interested in the activities of his party. He and his wife are both members of
							the Christian church of Lizton, to which they give freely of their means. Mr. Burgan
							has lived a successful and honorable life and has exercised those qualities of

						<p>To write the personal records of men who have raised themselves from humble
							circumstances to positions of responsibility and trust in a community is no ordinary
							pleasure. Self-made men, men who have achieved success by reason of their personal
							qualities and left the impress of their individuality upon the business and growth of
							their place of residence and affect for good such institutions as are embraced in the
							sphere of their usefulness, unwittingly, perhaps, built monuments more enduring than
							marble obelisk or granite shaft. Of such we have the unquestionable right to say
							belongs the gentleman whose name appears above.</p>

						<p>George Orf, the son of Adam and Catherine Orf, was born in Hamilton county, Ohio,
							September 24, 1863. His parents died when he was very young and he was reared in an
							orphans' home and for this reason knows very little of his family history. He came to
							Hendricks county when a small boy of five years and made his home with Addison Hadley,
							remaining there until he was nineteen years of age. He then went to Butler county,
							Ohio, where he worked on a farm for three years, after which he returned to Hendricks
							county, Indiana. Until 1910 he rented farms, being very successful as a renter and
							making a very satisfactory tenant. In 1910 he purchased his present farm of forty
							acres in Clay township, which he is now improving in every way and bringing to a high
							state of cultivation.</p>

						<p>George Orf was married September 11, 1890, to Hattie Henderson, the daughter of
							Alpheus and Maria (Lancaster) Henderson, and to them have been born the following
							children: Lucy, Claude, Elizabeth, Chloe, Vera, Kenneth, Dorcas, Ruth, Ernest A.,
							deceased, and Georgia. Lucy is the wife of Hurley Rector and has one child, Mark. Mrs.
							Orf's parents had a family of six children, William, Hattie, James C., Sarah, Jesse
							and Mary A. William married Minnie Cassidy; Hattie is the wife of the subject of this
							sketch; Joseph married Eva Kersey; Jesse married Mattie Sanders; <pb id="VAC1000-515"
								n="480"/> Sarah died in infancy; Mary became the wife of Fred Cassidy. Mrs. Orf's
							father died May 23, 1907. Mrs. Orf's grandparents were both natives of North Carolina
							and had a family of three children, James Alpheus, Marinda and Clark.</p>

						<p>Mr. Orf is a Republican and takes an active interest in local politics, although he
							has never been a candidate for any public office. He is a member of the Improved Order
							of Red Men and in his religious faith is an adherent of the Friends church of
							Danville. He is a fine example of the self-made man, who, starting out with nothing,
							by the sheer force of will and determination rears a family to a life of usefulness
							and becomes an important factor in the welfare of the community. This he has
							accomplished because he has been upright in all of his dealings and willing to do his
							share in the life of the community and because he has done this he has won the respect
							and sincere regard of all of those with whom he has been associated.</p>

						<p>The best title one can establish to the high and generous esteem of an intelligent
							community is a protracted and honorable residence therein. Jacob L. Kurtz, one of the
							best known and most highly esteemed men of Hendricks county, Indiana, has resided in
							this locality all his life and his career has been a most commendable one in every
							respect, well deserving of being perpetuated on the pages of a historical work of the
							nature of the one in hand. Like his sterling father before him, he has been a man of
							well-defined purpose and never failed to carry to successful completion any work or
							enterprise to which he addressed himself. Beginning life in a new country and under
							many unfavorable auspices, he let nothing deter him and before the lapse of many years
							he had a fine farm under cultivation. Knowing that the country was destined to take a
							high rank in the productive and rich localities of the North, he applied himself very
							closely to his work and waited for the future to bring its rewards, and today he is
							one of the substantial men of his county.</p>

						<p>Jacob L. Kurtz, who is now living retired in Danville, was born on July 22, 1854, in
							Putnam county, this state, the son of Henry F. and Margaret (Vannice) Kurtz, both of
							whom were natives of Kentucky. Henry F. Kurtz came to Putnam county, Indiana, with his
							father from Kentucky, and <pb id="VAC1000-516" n="[]"/>

								<p rend="center">JACOB L. KURTZ</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-517" n="481"/> lived in that county until his marriage and in
							Hendricks county the remainder of his life. Henry Kurtz served in the Civil War as a
							member of the Ninety-ninth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry and gave three years of
							his life to that memorable struggle. On July 22, 1864, on the tenth birthday of his
							son, Jacob L., he was taken prisoner and was held seven months, four months being
							spent amid the horrors of Andersonville prison. Upon his return from the war he
							settled in Marion township, this county, where he lived until his death, June 10,
							1913. His wife died on May 28, 1913. Mr. and Mrs. Henry Kurtz were the parents of
							eight children: Caroline Francis, the wife of John F. Underwood, of Danville; Jacob
							L., the immediate subject of this sketch; Eliza, the wife of James A. Hadley, of
							Darnville; William H., who died in infancy; Jennie, the widow of Charles Hadley, of
							Danville; Charles, whose present home adjoins the old homestead in Marion township;
							Oscar, a farmer of the same neighborhood in this county, and Wilbert, who died in
							infancy.</p>

						<p>Jacob L. Kurtz received his common school education in the district schools of Marion
							township and lived the life of the ordinary farmer's boy until he grew to manhood. He
							worked on his father's farm until he was twenty-five years of age, when he married and
							began to farm for himself on the farm adjoining his father's farm. Here he continued
							to live until his removal to Danville, on August 15, 1913. Mr. Kurtz was very
							successful in his farming operations and when he left the farm in the fall of 1913 he
							left behind him a record of fifty years' splendid service as one of the leading
							agriculturists of the county. He kept apace with modern methods of agriculture and
							introduced the latest improved machinery and as a result his farm was one of the most
							highly improved and best equipped farms in the county.</p>

						<p>Jacob L. Kurtz was married January 12, 1881, to Lucy Tinder, of this county, daughter
							of William and Catherine Tinder, and to this union there were born five children,
							three of whom are living, Everett, an attorney in Miami, Florida, and Asa and John,
							farmers of this county. His first wife died December 9, 1886, and on August 15, 1888,
							Mr. Kurtz was married to Jennie Tinder, a sister of his first wife, and to this union
							there has been born one son, Lawrence Stanley, who is now a student in the high school
							at Danville.</p>

						<p>Mr. Kurtz has always been affiliated with the Republican party, but has never taken
							an active interest in the deliberations of this party. In his religious faith he has
							adhered to the Presbyterian church, and at the present time <pb id="VAC1000-518"

							Regular Baptist church. Fraternally, Mr. Kurtz is a member of the Knights of Pythias,
							holding his membership at North Salem. Mr. Kurtz. who is now in the evening of life,
							can look back upon a career which was well spent in every particular. He can have the
							satisfaction of knowing that he has never done anything which would bring upon him the
							censure of his fellow citizens. Personally, he is genial and unassuming and easily
							makes friends. He is a man of good habits and kindly impulses and is deservedly
							popular in the community where he has spent his whole life.</p>

						<p>Among the representative citizens and prosperous farmers of Hendricks county,

							estate in Marion township, and is carrying on the various departments of his
							enterprise with that discretion and energy which are sure to find their natural

							man of economical habits, and, being fortunately situated in a thriving farming
							community, it is no wonder that he stands today in the front rank of the
							agriculturists of this favored locality.</p>

						<p>John F. Stevenson, the son of Patton and Elizabeth (Ragland) Stevenson, was born in
							1852 in Marion township, Hendricks county, Indiana. His father's birth occurred in
							Kentucky in 1798, and after reaching maturity he came to Hendricks county, Indiana,
							settling in Marion township, near New Winchester. Patton Stevenson was married three
							times, his first marriage occurring before he came to Indiana, and to this union there
							were three children born, all of whom are deceased, Vincent, Mrs. Sallie N. Pierson
							and Morgan. After the death of his first wife, Patton Stevenson married Catherine
							Brandenburg, and to this marriage were born three children, Tolliver, deceased; Squire
							and Mrs. Susan Ann Graham. His second wife died and he afterwards married Elizabeth
							Ragland, a native of Kentucky, and to his third marriage were born six children,
							Patton, deceased; Elsie Jane, deceased; Mrs. Pattie Graham; George Howard; Mrs.
							Cassandra Flynn, deceased, and John F., the immediate subject of this sketch. Patton
							Stevenson was a quiet, hard-working farmer, who accumulated an estate of over three
							hundred acres of excellent land in Marion township. He was a member of the Missionary
							Baptist church and in his church affiliations he was <pb id="VAC1000-519" n="483"/>
							both consistent and faithful. Politically, he was a Democrat, but was never active in
							the councils of his party.</p>

						<p>John F. Stevenson received his early education in the district schools of his home
							neighborhood and lived at home until his marriage, which occurred in 1875, at which
							time he was united to Paulina Harris, the daughter of Thomas W. and Eliza Jane
							(Stephenson) Harris. Her father was a native of Kentucky and came to Putnam county,
							Indiana, with his parents at the age of four years, settling in Jackson township.
							William Harris came from Kentucky at an early date and entered a large tract of land
							from the government in Putnam county, and his son, Thomas W., spent his entire life on
							this farm, his death occurring January 5, 1910. He was one of the largest land owners
							in the county and had over one thousand acres at the time of his death. His wife is
							still living on the old homestead farm in Putnam county at the advanced age of
							eighty-four. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas W. Harris were the parents of three children,
							William, Paulina, wife of Mr. Stevenson, and Melinda, deceased.</p>

						<p>Mr. Stevenson began farming one mile south of his present farm and lived there for
							thirty-two years, coming to his present place on October 16, 1907. His farm of nine
							hundred twenty acres, two hundred of which is in Putnam county, is one of the largest
							individual farms in central Indiana. He has brought it to a high state of cultivation
							and has improved it in every way until it is one of the model farms of the county. It
							is needless to say that he has been a successful farmer, since his place will bear
							witness to his ability along agricultural lines. He still has active charge of the
							management of his farm and takes an active interest in everything which pertains to
							the conduct of his large estate.</p>

						<p>Mr. Stevenson has long been a member of the Democratic party, but has never held any
							public office or evinced any desire along that line. His extensive land holdings have
							necessitated his concentrating his attention upon his property interests with the
							result that he has had little time to mingle in politics. He and his wife are loyal
							and consistent members of the Missionary Baptist church at New Winchester, and are
							generous and willing contributors to its support. Mr. Stevenson has always been a hard
							worker, and although he has been very successful along material lines he has never
							allowed his success in worldly affairs to blind him to the higher duties which he owes
							to society. Thus he has always been a supporter of all public-spirited movements in
							his community and all worthy enterprises enlist his hearty cooperation. Consequently
							he is highly esteemed by all of those with whom he has been associated.</p>

						<p>It is not an easy task to describe adequately a man who has led an eminently active
							and busy life and who has attained a position of relative distinction in the community
							with which his interests are allied. But biography finds its most perfect
							justification, nevertheless, in the tracing and recording of such a life history. It
							is, then, with a full appreciation of all that is demanded and of the painstaking
							scrutiny that must be accorded each statement, and yet with a feeling of satisfaction,
							that the writer essays the task of touching briefly upon the details of such a record
							as has been that of the honored subject whose life now comes under review.</p>

						<p>John E. Vestal, the son of Benjamin and Anna Vestal, was born in Hendricks county,
							Indiana. His father also was a native of Hendricks county, his grandfather having come
							from North Carolina in the early history of the state. The Vestals trace their
							ancestry back to colonial times and have even traced a direct descent back to the
							Vestals of old England. The mother of John E. Vestal was born in Hendricks county, and
							both his father and mother are still living at the hearty age of eighty years, making
							their home with their son, John E. Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin Vestal were the parents of
							five children: Willis S., born May 11, 1858, and died October 8, 1875; Mrs. Alice
							Mills, born April 9, 1866, the wife of Elwood Mills, a farmer of this county; Benjamin
							Corydon, a farmer and stock raiser of Washington township, married Cora Belch; Charles
							Louder, born January 18, 1873, a farmer of Guilford township, married Sallie Parks and
							has one daughter, Esther.</p>

						<p>John E. Vestal received his early education in the district schools of his township,
							and early in life began to follow the occupation of a farmer. There is no angle to the
							agricultural profession which he does not understand, and has always made it a point
							to keep in close touch with all the latest ideas on farming. A glance at his fields of
							corn and wheat will convince the casual onlooker that he has been a successful farmer.
							On his farm of three hundred and sixty acres he raises all of the crops of this part
							of the state as well as a large amount of stock annually for the market. However, he
							has made a specialty of stock raising, as his father did before him; his father had
							the reputation of being one of the best stock raisers in the central part of the
							state. His son is following in the footsteps of his father.</p>

						<p>Mr. Vestal was married December 28, 1887, to Antoinette Moore, the daughter of Mr.
							and Mrs. John S. Moore, of Plainfield.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-521" n="485"/>

						<p>Mr. Vestal is a member of the Friends church and a generous supporter of its various
							activities. In his political relations he has always adhered to the Republican party,
							but has never been a seeker for any public office. However, he was treasurer of
							Hendricks county in 1904 and 1905. Mr. Vestal is a man of vigorous mentality and
							strong moral fiber, and has achieved great success in his calling and is eminently
							deserving of the esteem in which he is held in the community where his entire life has
							been spent.</p>

						<p>It is always pleasant and profitable to contemplate the career of a man who has won a
							definite goal in life, whose career has been such as to command the honor and respect
							of his fellow citizens. Such in brief is the record of the well known farmer whose
							name heads this sketch, than whom a more whole-souled man it would be difficult to
							find within the limits of Hendricks county, where he has long maintained his home and
							where he has labored not only for his own individual advancement and that of his
							immediate family, but also for the improvement of the entire community, whose
							interests he has ever had at heart.</p>

						<p>John T. Lee, well known farmer of Brown township, Hendricks county, Indiana, who was
							born in this county on April 19, 1864, about three miles north of Plainfield, is of
							Irish parentage, being the son of John and Catherine (Dugan) Lee, both of whom were
							natives of county Galway, Ireland. John Lee (father of the subject) was bereft of both
							parents while still a boy and emigrated to America when twenty years old, landing at
							Quebec in Canada. He remained in the Dominion for one year, when he came direct to
							Hendricks county, Indiana, where he passed the remainder of his life. When first
							coming here he worked out among the farmers of the county by the month, and for three
							or four years after his marriage, in 1861, continued this mode of employment. Then,
							with the aid of a brother, he purchased a forty-acre farm near Tilden. There he lived
							for perhaps a couple of years, when he disposed of that land and bought the forty-acre
							tract where the subject of this sketch now makes his home. John Lee was energetic,
							thrifty and prosperous and to his original forty acres he added from time to time
							until at the time of his death he had accumulated one hundred and fifteen acres of
							excellent farming land. His death occurred on July 4, 1879, preceding his wife by a
							number of years, as her death took place on June 26, 1904.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-522" n="486"/>

						<p>John T. Lee, subject of this sketch, received his education in the schools of
							Hendricks county. He was one of a family of six children and remained under the
							paternal roof until the time of his marriage, in 1902, to Ellen E. Flynn, born in
							Marion county, Indiana, on April 15, 1870, the daughter of Patrick and Mary (Kelley)
							Flynn, both of whom were natives of Ireland, the former coming from county Roscommon
							and the latter from county Galway. They both came to this country when about seventeen
							or eighteen years of age, both landing in New York City. Patrick Flynn worked in New
							York for a few months and then went into New Jersey, where he was employed on a truck
							farm for seven and one-half years. Mary Kelley went direct to Philadelphia, upon
							landing in this country, where she worked for a short time and then went to Woodbury,
							New Jersey. It was there she and Patrick Flynn met and were married. They came to
							Indiana in 1857, settling in Marion county, where they remained one year, and then
							removed to Hendricks county, southeast of Plainfield, where for four years he worked
							on various farms for a share of the crops. He then returned to Marion county, where he
							purchased a farm and lived there the balance of his life, his death occurring February
							18, 1901. He outlived his wife, who passed away on July 13, 1888. It was on this
							homestead in Marion county that Ellen E. Flynn was born in an old log cabin, and there
							she lived until the time of her marriage, with the exception of one year spent in the
							city of Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>After Mr. Lee's marriage, he took his bride to his old home where he and his mother
							had lived for several years and where the subject is living at the present time. The
							farm is about six miles northeast of Brownsburg and is in an excellent state of
							cultivation. Mr. Lee, in addition to general farming, pays considerable attention to a
							good grade of live stock, it being his belief that no strain is too good for general
							purposes.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Lee has always given his support to the Democratic party, in the
							affairs of which he has always taken an active, though quiet, part. His fraternal
							affiliation is with the Ancient Order of Hibernians and both he and his wife are
							communicants of the Roman Catholic church. Mr. and Mrs. Lee have but one child, a
							daughter, Mary Catherine, who remains at home with them. The family is one of the most
							highly respected in the community and Mr. Lee does his full duty as a citizen in all
							the affairs of the locality affecting the moral, social or material welfare of his
							fellow citizens. He is a man who makes friends and holds them by reason of his
							sterling worth. He is well known in Hendricks county and is eminently deserving of
							mention in a book of the scope intended in the present work.</p>

						<p>In touching upon the life history of the subject of this sketch the writer aims to
							avoid fulsome encomium and extravagant praise; yet he desires to hold up for
							consideration those facts which have shown the distinction of a true, useful and
							honorable life-- a life characterized by perseverance, energy, broad charity and
							well-defined purpose. To do this will be but to reiterate the dictum pronounced upon
							the man by the people who have known him long and well.</p>

						<p>Arthur Spears, a progressive farmer of Eel River township, was born February 28,
							1865, on the farm where he is now residing, two and one-half miles northeast of North
							Salem, Hendricks county, Indiana, the son of Robert K. and Jane (Trotter) Spears.
							Robert Spears was born near Danville, Boyle county, Kentucky, in 1834, and came to
							this county with his parents, John and Martha Spears, the year following. They located
							about two miles northeast of North Salem, where John Spears entered a large tract of
							government land and farmed for the remainder of his life. He started in as a pioneer
							in every sense of the word, built a rude log cabin in the woods, cleared his ground
							and opened the way to civilization in this part of the county. He was a Whig in
							politics until the Republican party was formed in 1856, and then voted for the
							Republican candidates until his death. Robert K. Spears was reared on this farm under
							these primitive conditions, and upon reaching manhood was married to Jane Trotter, the
							daughter of Isaac and Lucy (Simms) Trotter, natives of Virginia, who had come to this
							county in an early day. After his marriage Robert K. Spears followed the vocation of
							farming the rest of his life on the farm where Arthur now lives. He was a Republican
							in politics, was a trustee of his township and an active member of the Methodist
							Episcopal church. He died September 15, 1910, while his wife's death occurred January
							10, 1891. Mr. and Mrs. Robert K. Spears reared four children, Adelia, deceased, who
							was the wife of William Dean, of North Salem; Arthur; Annie, deceased, who was the
							wife of Nathan Tucker, and Omar, who died at the age of thirty-two years.</p>

						<p>Arthur Spears has spent his entire life upon the farm where he is now living, with
							the exception of about ten years when he was a molder. At the age of twenty-three he
							went to Indianapolis and learned the molder's trade, and for the next ten years was
							employed at that trade in that city, Cincinnati and St. Louis. He has also been in
							California for two years on a fruit ranch, but has always considered this county his
							home. He is the owner of <pb id="VAC1000-524" n="488"/> one hundred and eighty-seven
							acres of excellent farming land in this township, two residences on his farm,
							excellent barn and silo, and all of the modern improvements, machinery and accessories
							which constitute the successful farmer's equipment.</p>

						<p>Mr. Spears was married September 13, 1896, to Anna Walton, who was born at Winterset,
							Iowa, on a farm, the daughter of Amos and Letitia (Gowin) Walton. Mrs. Spears' mother
							was born in this county and her father in Ripley county, this state. Her parents were
							married in Hendricks county and then went to Iowa, where they lived the remainder of
							their lives. The father is deceased, and her mother is now living at Adel, in that
							state. Mr. and Mrs. Spears are the parents of two children, Gerald and Mary. Mr.
							Spears is a man of progressive ideas and tendencies and has made a decided advancement
							in the location to which his energies have been devoted for so many years. As a
							citizen he is wide-awake and enterprising and a typical representative of the large
							and intelligent class of yeomanry which give character and stability to the body
							politic, and to which Indiana is so largely indebted for the proud position which she
							today occupies among her sister states.</p>

						<p>Among the successful, self-made men in Hendricks county whose efforts and influence
							have contributed to the material upbuilding of the community, Joseph S. Carter
							occupies a conspicuous place. Being ambitious from the first, but surrounded with none
							too favorable environment, his early youth was not especially promising, but,
							resolutely facing the future, he gradually surmounted the difficulties in his way and
							in due course of time rose to a prominent position in the commercial, agricultural and
							financial circles of his community, besides winning the confidence and esteem of those
							with whom he comes in contact, either in a business or a social way, and for years he
							has stood as one of the representative men of the locality honored by his
							citizenship.</p>

						<p>Joseph S. Carter, the son of William K. and Mary (Crouch) Carter, was born in
							Davidson county, North Carolina, August 30, 185 I. His grandfather was Richard Carter,
							a native of Scotland, who married Sarah Tigg. His maternal grandfather was Richard
							Crouch, a native of Germany. Richard Carter came to America from Scotland when he was
							a lad of sixteen and <pb id="VAC1000-525" n="489"/> settled in North Carolina. He was
							one of four brothers, and was a pioneer school teacher in North Carolina, dividing his
							time between farming and teaching. He was in the War of 1812 and also in the Black
							Hawk War in 1832, and lived to be over eighty years of age. The school building in the
							county in which he taught for so many years is still known as the Carter school,
							although there have been several buildings erected on the same ground, the present
							building being a structure of four rooms. Mr. and Mrs. Richard Carter were the parents
							of eight children, five sons and three daughters. At the time of the discovery of gold
							in California three of the brothers removed to that state, where they have since made
							their homes. They have married, reared families in that state and have been very
							successful. Some of them have made visits back to the old home. William K. Carter, the
							father of the immediate subject of this sketch, took part in the Mexican War, after
							which he returned to his home in North Carolina, where he followed the occupation of a
							farmer. He was for a number of years the overseer for a large plantation owner by the
							name of Joseph Spurgeon, and had seventy-five negroes under his charge. He did not
							marry until after he came back from the Mexican War, and after a number of years as
							overseer he engaged in farming on his own account. At the opening of the Civil War he
							enlisted in the Confederate army in Company I, Forty-second Regiment North Carolina
							Infantry, and served throughout the war. He took part in scores of battles in many
							states, having fought in the West at the battle of Vicksburg and in the East in the
							battle of the Wilderness. He was severely wounded in one of the last engagements of
							the war and never fully recovered from the effects of this disability. After the close
							of the war he returned to his home in North Carolina and lived there until he was
							about fifty years of age, a highly respected farmer. Mr. and Mrs. William Carter were
							the parents of nine children, only two of whom are now living, Joseph S., the
							immediate subject of this sketch, and Mrs. Margaret Everhardt, of Thomasville, North
							Carolina.</p>

						<p>Joseph S. Carter was reared in North Carolina and received his education at the
							Carter school, which has been mentioned, and Piney Grove and Wautown, a suburb of Old
							Salem, North Carolina. At the age of nineteen he started out to seek his fortune and
							came to Hendricks county, Indiana, arriving at Amo on the 24th day of November, 1869.
							He took employment with the farmers of the neighborhood and worked in this line for
							about three years, after which he bought forty acres of land south of Stilesville,
							this county, <pb id="VAC1000-526" n="490"/> but did not move onto this farm. Later he
							purchased forty acres one and one-half miles south of Amo, and to this small beginning
							he has added acreage from time to time until he is now the owner of four hundred and
							fifty-five acres of fine farming land in the county. He has made a remarkable success
							as an agriculturist, and has gained a reputation as a feeder of stock which cannot be
							excelled in the county. He has made a specialty of raising corn and hay and then
							feeding all of it on his farms. At one time he, in partnership with Jacob Phillips,
							had seven hundred hogs, which they were fattening for the market. This was in the year
							1874, at the time of the famous grasshopper plague in Kansas, when they were able to
							buy hogs in that state at their own price. Mr. Carter has exercised wonderful judgment
							in all his financial transactions, with the result that he is now recognized as one of
							the most substantial farmers of Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>Mr. Carter was married on January 26, 1873, to Sarah J. Masten, of this county, the
							daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Manuel Masten, and to this union there have been born four
							children: Arthur L. married Maude Underwood, and now lives on a farm of one hundred
							sixty acres west of Amo; Charles Burton married Nellie Hazlett and resides on a farm
							one-half mile south of Amo; Lewis, who died in infancy, and Ada, who married William
							Everett Atkins, and they have one son, Howard Carter, four years old, who is the
							delight of his grandfather's heart.</p>

						<p>Mr. Carter now resides on the Masten property adjoining Amo on the south, where he
							has a fine modern home, with all the conveniences of the city. He was unanimously
							elected as a member of the town council of Amo and has taken a very active interest in
							the affairs of the town. He is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons and the
							Independent Order of Odd Fellows. In his church relations he is affiliated with the
							Methodist Episcopal church of Amo and contributes liberally of his means to its
							support.</p>

						<p>Mr. Carter is a fine type of the self-made man, and although he only had twenty-five
							dollars when he landed in this county, in 1869, he has, by thrift and economy,
							accumulated a very comfortable fortune. In addition to his heavy landed interests, he
							has a large amount of money loaned on mortgages. Mr. Carter is a genial man, pleasant
							to meet and has a host of friends throughout the county. He helped organize the First
							National Bank at Amo, Indiana, being a charter member and was a director.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">ROBERT BELL.</hi></head>

						<p>That the plenitude of satiety is seldom attained in the affairs of life is to be
							considered a most beneficial privation, for where ambition is satisfied and every
							ultimate end realized, if such be possible, apathy must follow. Effort would cease,
							accomplishment be prostrate and creative talent waste its energies in inactivity. The
							men who have pushed forward the wheels of progress have been those to whom
							satisfaction lies ever in the future, who have labored continuously, always finding in
							each transition stage an incentive for further effort. Mr. Bell is one whose well
							directed efforts have gained for him a position of desirable prominence in the
							agricultural circles of Hendricks county, and his energy and enterprise have been
							crowned by a gratifying degree of success.</p>

						<p>Robert Bell is a native of this county, born on February 28, 1845, in what is now
							Lincoln township, being the son of Moses and Jane (Harbison) Bell, both of whom were
							natives of Ireland, coming to the United States from county Down about 1832. They
							entered eighty acres of government land about one mile south of Brownsburg, and after
							a few years they purchased from a Mr. Dunn forty acres which joined their farm on the
							east. Later on they purchased another eighty-acre tract about two miles south of the
							land they first owned, where Moses Bell passed the remainder of his life. Moses Bell
							was the son of John Bell, who died in Ireland, and it is thought his mother's maiden
							name was Jane Troutman, but this is not known positively. Moses Bell was one of the
							leading citizens of his day and community and deserved much credit for the station to
							which he attained. He arrived in Hendricks county a stranger from another land,
							without means, and at the time of his death he occupied an enviable place in the
							regard of those who knew him and had amassed considerable of this world's goods. He
							ever conducted himself so as to win the confidence and esteem of those with whom he
							came in contact, and throughout his life in this section he was always glad to endorse
							any movement having for its ultimate aim the betterment of the moral or material good
							of the community. He was a stanch supporter of the Republican party and took an active
							interest in the administration of that party's affairs. He filled one or two minor
							offices at different times, discharging his duties in a manner satisfactory to
							all.</p>

						<p>Robert Bell was one of a family of five children, himself being the only one
							remaining out of the family. John died in infancy and Isabelle, Eliza J. and Mary A.
							died later in life. Robert Bell's mother died when he was <pb id="VAC1000-528" n="492"
							/> but nine years of age, when the eldest sister assumed the duties of the home-keeper
							and acted in this role until her death. After that, the father made his home with the
							subject. Mr. Bell remained at home until the time of his marriage, on September 26,
							1868, receiving under the careful guidance of his father instruction in the labor of
							husbandry. After marriage, he continued to live on the home farm until the father's
							death, when he purchased property in Brownsburg and has since divided his time between
							the home in town and the farm.</p>

						<p>Mrs. Robert Bell was Miss Mary A. Barlow before her marriage, a daughter of
							Theophilus and Susan A. (Moberly) Barlow. The Barlow family were originally from
							Kentucky, but came to Indiana at a very early date in the state's history and settled
							in Hendricks county. They at one time owned a very large tract of land about three
							miles south of Brownsburg. Mrs. Bell was one of a family of nine or ten children and
							remained under her father's roof until the time of her marriage. To Mr. and Mrs. Bell
							have been born ten children, three of whom died in infancy. Clyde W. married Mary Cook
							and died February 7, 1905, leaving one child, a boy, Faye. A little daughter, Melvina,
							had preceded him into the life beyond. Lloyd S. went to Canada when a young man and
							there married a young lady who died when their child Robert was a year or two old.
							Lloyd and his son Robert are living on a homestead in British Columbia. Grace J. and
							Ernest E. were twins; the latter never married and lives in Brownsburg. Grace J. met
							her death when her father's home was destroyed by a fire caused by exploding gasoline.
							She left a young son Vance, who lives with his grandfather and is a promising boy,
							attending high school in Brownsburg. Charles H. married Ida Phillips, daughter of
							James and Melvina (Gray) Phillips. They reside in Brownsburg and have a family of
							three children, namely: Mabel Elizabeth, Horace and Thomas Grant. Nellie S. has been
							twice married. Her first husband was Thomas Anderson and when a widow she married
							Walter Roach. She was the mother of four children, one only by the first husband, and
							all have passed away except one son, Lawrence Roach. Myrtle Z., another daughter of
							Mr. Bell, died when twenty-one years of age, and Estella C. and Clara P. were the
							names of two little daughters who died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Mr. Bell's religious affiliation is with the Presbyterian church, of which he is an
							active and consistent member. He is a man of generous impulses and genial disposition,
							who readily makes friends and retains them. He has been a stalwart Republican ever
							since attaining his majority and for his <pb id="VAC1000-529" n="493"/> party has
							served as road superintendent and road supervisor at different times. His
							conscientious discharge of the duties thus devolving upon him met the approval of all
							concerned. In addition to the general farming conducted by Mr. Bell, he has given
							particular attention to the breeding of short-horn cattle, and has been the most
							active stock buyer and shipper in the township for the past twelve years. For seven
							years he was in the farm implement business in Brownsburg and prides himself on the
							fact that his sales for one season have never been equalled in that town. Among other
							implements, sold that season, he disposed of thirty-eight binders and twenty-eight
							mowers, an enviable record truly. In common with all men of affairs, Mr. Bell has met
							with reverses at different times, but he has not permitted himself to be permanently
							handicapped by them, but has with renewed effort set himself to repair the breach. At
							the time of the death of his daughter, Grace, his town house was destroyed, at a loss
							of eighteen hundred dollars, and the same spring the house on the farm was also
							destroyed by fire. These material losses were small indeed to him when compared with
							the great loss which could not be replaced. Mr. Bell is a man of sterling qualities of
							character, patient and scrupulously honest in all the relations of life, hospitable
							and charitable, and he has gained the approval and high esteem of his fellow citizens
							because of his upright life. Because of his earnest character and business success he
							is eminently entitled to representation in a work of the character of the one at
							hand.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">THOMAS KINNEY.</hi></head>

						<p>A man's reputation is the property of the world, for the laws of nature have
							forbidden isolation. Every human being either submits to the controlling influence of
							others or wields an influence which touches, controls, guides or misdirects others. If
							he be honest and successful in his chosen field of endeavor, investigation will
							brighten his fame and point the way along which others may follow with like success.
							The reputation of Thomas Kinney, one of the leading citizens of Brown township,
							Hendricks county, Indiana, having been unassailable all along the highways of life,
							according to those who have known him best, it is believed that a sketch of his career
							will be of benefit to the reader, for it has not only been one of honor but of
							usefulness also.</p>

						<p>Thomas Kinney, one of the most successful farmers of the county, was <pb
								id="VAC1000-530" n="494"/> born not far from his present home on April 4, 1869, the
							son of John and Bridget (Mullin) Kinney, both of whom were natives of county Galway,
							Ireland. They emigrated to America early in their married life and came directly to
							Indiana, where for a short time they lived in the city of Indianapolis. John Kinney
							then secured work on a farm in Marion county and in this way passed about seven years.
							By judicious saving he was able, at that time, to invest in a farm and found a tract
							of forty acres on the Hendricks-Boone county line that was what he desired, the farm
							being located in Hendricks county. The family lived there for two years, and it was
							during that period that the subject of this sketch was born. That tract was then
							disposed of and a farm of one hundred and ten acres in Brown township, Hendricks
							county, was then purchased, being the land on which subject now resides. John Kinney
							was a man eminently deserving of a great amount of credit, for through his own
							perseverance and untiring energy he was able to accumulate a considerable property, at
							the same time making a good living for his family, and so ordering his life as to win
							the confidence and respect of his fellow men. His death occurred in 1909, his wife
							having preceded him by ten years. They reared a family of three children, only one of
							whom married. Thomas Kinney has remained unmarried, and so has his sister Delia, the
							two of them making their home in the old homestead. Owing to the ill health of Miss
							Delia Kinney, her brother has a man and his wife to assist them about the place, the
							wife looking after the housework and the husband doing the duties about the farm, Mr.
							Kinney acting merely as an overseer.</p>

						<p>Mr. Kinney conducts his business in such a manner as to attest his excellent business
							ability and in addition to the general farming carried on, he also gives particular
							attention to his stock, believing that care and attention to this phase of farm work
							greatly repays the time and labor expended. He also takes great pride in the quality
							of grain produced and to this end is a student of proper methods of agriculture along
							modern scientific lines and the proper rotation of crops. His farm shows the thought
							and care put into it and is one of the up-to-date farms of the county.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Kinney is an ardent supporter of the Democratic party and ever since
							attaining his majority he has taken a deep interest in public affairs. While not
							desiring offce for himself, his influence has ever been considered by those seeking
							that honor, as he has ever been desirous of seeing the right party in the right place.
							Both he and Miss Delia are communicants of the Roman Catholic church and their lives
							are consistent with <pb id="VAC1000-531" n="495"/> its teachings. Mr. Kinney is quiet
							and unassuming in his manner and because of his success in the material affairs of
							life, his influence in local matters and the unblemished character which he bears,
							there is accorded to him the fullest measure of popular confidence and esteem
							throughout the community.</p>

						<p>Though several years have passed since the subject of this sketch was transferred
							from the life militant to the life triumphant, his personality is still fresh in the
							memory of many of the citizens of Hendricks county, and especially Brownsburg, where
							the latter years of his life were spent. Because of his many excellent personal
							qualities and the splendid and definite influence which his life shed over the various
							communities in which he lived and which he labored so earnestly to upbuild in any way
							within his power, it is particularly consonant that specific mention should be made of
							him in a work containing mention of the representative citizens of the county. A man
							of high moral character, unimpeachable integrity, persistent energy and excellent
							business judgment, he stood "four square to every wind that blew" and throughout the
							locality where he lived he occupied an enviable position among his fellow men, by whom
							he was universally esteemed.</p>

						<p>John Walsh was born in county Galway, Ireland, in March, 1835, being the son of John
							and Hannorah Walsh, both of whom were natives of that county and passed their lives
							therein. The subject came to America in 1863, coming direct to Hendricks county and
							locating at Plainfield, which he considered his home for many years, while hiring out
							at farm work. He later purchased eighty acres of land three miles north of Brownsburg,
							where he lived for ten years. He then disposed of that tract and rented a farm two
							miles south of Brownsburg, where he made his home for two years, later purchasing
							property in the town of Brownsburg, where he passed the remainder of his life, his
							death occurring September 7, 1910. After locating in Brownsburg, he engaged in the
							grocery business and later in the saloon business for some time, continuing therein
							until his retirement from active business pursuits.</p>

						<p>On February 14, 1874, Mr. Walsh was united in marriage with Mary Ann Fahy, who was
							born March 17, 1862, in Franklin county, Ohio, being a daughter of Edward and Margaret
							(Hart) Fahy, both of whom were born in county Galway, Ireland. Edward Fahy first came
							to America about the <pb id="VAC1000-532" n="496"/> year 1853, and after living here
							for a while he returned to his native land, where he remained for six years. He then
							returned to the United States and located in Brown township, this county, where he
							purchased a farm and passed the remainder of his life. Mary Ann Fahy was one of a
							family of eight children, the others being Martin, Thomas, Margaret, Kate, Edward,
							Patrick and Bridget.</p>

						<p>To John Walsh and wife were born a family of seven children, namely: Nora, who is
							employed as saleswoman in a store in Brownsburg; Margaret, who is Mrs. James Tarpey
							and lives on a farm in Brown township, this county. She is the mother of three
							daughters, Fanchon, Mary and Martha. The third child of the family was Mary, who died
							when small. Catherine is a teacher in the public schools of Hendricks county, being
							stationed at present in Brownsburg. John is an undertaker and is associated with the
							Evans undertaking establishment in Brownsburg. Two children out of this family, Edward
							and Vina, remain at home with the mother. The entire family are communicants of the
							Roman Catholic church, and stand high in public estimation by reason of their sterling
							worth and many excellent qualities. While John Walsh's life on earth has closed, he
							still lives through the lives of the children he sought in every way to rear to
							perfect manhood and womanhood.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JACOB LOCKHART.</hi></head>

						<p>The gentleman to a review of whose life the reader's attention is here respectfully
							directed is recognized as one of the energetic, well-known farmers of Hendricks
							county, who by his enterprise and progressive methods has contributed in a material
							way to the advancement of the locality where he lives. As a mere lad of sixteen he
							joined the army during the Civil War and served his country gallantly and faithfully
							for two years. In the course of an honorable career he has been successful in the
							manifold lines to which his efforts have been directed and, enjoying distinctive
							prestige among the representative men of his community, it is eminently proper that
							attention be called to his achievements and due credit be accorded to his worth as an
							enterprising citizen.</p>

						<p>Jacob Lockhart, probably the youngest soldier who went to the front during the Civil
							War, and now a prosperous farmer of Eel River township, was born April 14, 1847, one
							mile east of Martinsville, Morgan county, Indiana. His parents were Jorman and Leah
							(Robbins) Lockhart, the father <pb id="VAC1000-533" n="[]"/>
							<figure>
								<p rend="center">JACOB LOCKHART</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-534" n="497"/> a native of Kentucky, who came to Indiana with his
							parents, who settled near Martinsville. His father had at one time been a man of means
							in Kentucky, but lost a great deal of his wealth by trying to help some of his
							friends. When Jorman Lockhart became of age in Morgan county he entered forty acres of
							land from the government and there lived and died. Jacob, whose history is here given,
							was but three years of age when his father died. Leah Robbins, the mother of Jacob,
							was born in 1825, in North Carolina, the daughter of Jacob and Barbara Robbins. Her
							parents came to Indiana from North Carolina, making the overland trip in wagons, and
							about the year 1830 settled in the north part of Marion township, Hendricks county,
							where her father bought forty acres of land with a log house on it, and on this farm
							he died, leaving his widow and their children.</p>

						<p>After the death of Jorman Lockhart his widow was left with four children, William
							Thomas, Jacob, James M. and Sarah E. Mrs. Lockhart then moved to her father's farm in
							Marion township, this county, and here they lived until after the war. William Thomas
							served in the war in Company H, Seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, until
							June, 1864, when his arm was shot off in the battle of the Wilderness and he was
							compelled to return to his home. He died in 1873. James farmed in Eel River township
							until his death, in 1913. Mrs. Lockhart died about 1894.</p>

						<p>Jacob Lockhart was reared in Hendricks county, and when a stripling youth of sixteen
							he enlisted on November 25, 1863, in Company I, Ninth Indiana Cavalry, One Hundred and
							Twenty-first Regiment, under General Wilson, and participated in all the marches and
							engagements under his command until his final muster in 1865. His service extended
							through Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi and, although he was never wounded, he had
							many a narrow escape from being captured.</p>

						<p>After the close of the war Mr. Lockhart returned to his home in Hendricks county and,
							although still only a boy of eighteen, he bought a little patch of ground of about
							five or six acres, on which he worked for two years, selling out in 1867. Afterwards
							he bought thirty-two acres near his present home and a part of his present farm. Here
							is where the fine qualities of Mr. Lockhart are made manifest. He showed indomitable
							courage and pluck, which is characteristic of successful men and which has brought him
							that prosperity which he now enjoys. He went into debt for the thirty-two acres, but,
							with heart to work, saved his money and, by good management, persevering industry and
							thrift, soon had the farm paid for and had <pb id="VAC1000-535" n="498"/> purchased
							more land adjoining. He now married and he and his good wife worked hand in hand, Mr.
							Lockhart attributing no small part of his success to the faithful help which his wife
							rendered him in their early struggles. He kept adding to his land holdings until he is
							now the owner of six hundred and eighty-one acres of fine farming land. This does not
							include the eighty acres which he gave to his son. He raises a large amount of live
							stock and pays especial attention to sheep and cattle, having at one time had nine
							hundred sheep and lambs on his farm.</p>

						<p>Mr. Lockhart was married on March 5, 1870, to Adeline Davis, the daughter of Walter
							Davis. Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart are the parents of four children, Oscar and Ruby, who are
							still with their parents, and twins, who died in early childhood. The family are
							members of the Christian church. Mr. Lockhart is a loyal and faithful member of the
							Grand Army of the Republic, which was organized in 1866 at Decatur, Illinois. It is
							interesting to note that the first national encampment of the Grand Army of the
							Republic was held at Indianapolis in 1866, and that today there are more than five
							thousand Grand Army posts in the United States. Mr. Lockhart believes that a good
							recipe for success is to attend strictly to one's own business, keep your credit good
							and refrain from intoxicating liquors and tobacco of all kinds. He has endeavored at
							all times to live such a life as to keep himself free from the censure of the world.
							He has been a man of domestic tastes and has been devoted to his wife and family, and
							yet has taken his full share in the life of the community in which he has lived.</p>

						<p>Fealty to facts in the analyzation of the character of a citizen of the type of
							Albert L. Webb is all that is required to make a biographical sketch interesting to
							those who have at heart the good name of the community, because it is the honorable
							reputation of the man of standing and affairs, more than any other consideration, that
							gives character and stability to the body politic and makes the true glory of a city
							or state revered at home and respected abroad. In the broad light which things of
							repute ever invite, the name and character of Albert L. Webb stand revealed and secure
							and, though of modest demeanor, with no ambition as a leader of men, his career has
							been signally honorable and it may be studied with profit by the young entering upon
							their life work.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-536" n="499"/>

						<p>Albert L. Webb, for sixteen years postmaster for the town of Brownsburg, Hendricks
							county, Indiana, was born January 29, 1863, the son of Ira C. and Lorinda (Shirley)
							Webb. Ira C. Webb was born in New York state and when about sixteen years old came
							westward, with his mother, to live with a brother of hers who had located near
							Pittsboro, this county. There he made his home until the time of his marriage to
							Lorinda Shirley daughter of William P. and Lydia (Pugh) Shirley, both of whom were
							natives of North Carolina who had located in Marion county, this state. Albert L. Webb
							was the only child of this union and when one year of age was taken to live with his
							mother's parents, where he remained until his marriage on February 7, 1883, to
							Florence Messick.</p>

						<p>After their marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Webb farmed for a year or two and in 1897 Mr. Webb
							was appointed postmaster at Brownsburg, which position he held until July 1, 1913. In
							1904 he opened and operated Brownsburg's first hotel, which was located in the Hunter
							block, he and wife operating it in connection with the postoffice. At the end of four
							years, they disposed of this hostelry and Mrs. Webb took charge of a stationery store
							which had been run in connection with the postoffice. In 1913, after giving up the
							postoffice, Mrs. Webb enlarged her store when the postoffice was moved across the
							street from its former location. She deals in stationery and notions and is succeeding
							admirably. Mr. Webb is a painter and paper-hanger by trade and has followed that
							occupation for the past thirty years in addition to his business interests
							elsewhere.</p>

						<p>Mrs. Webb was born November 11, 1864, in Greencastle, Indiana, the daughter of Samuel
							and Armilda (Lynch) Messick. They were both natives of the Hoosier state, Samuel being
							born in Ladoga, a son of John Messick, who was an extensive landholder near Ladoga.
							Mrs. John Messick died when her son, Samuel, was quite a small infant. Armilda Lynch,
							mother of Mrs. Webb, was a daughter of Colonel John and Lucy Lynch and was twice
							married. Her first husband was John McGinnis and to their union were born four
							children, William, Lucy, Elizabeth and Ella, the first born dying in infancy. William
							McGinnis was operator for the Big Four Railroad Company in Brownsburg for eight years.
							After the death of John McGinnis, his widow married Samuel Messick, by whom she had
							one child. Florence, the present Mrs. Webb. When Florence was fifteen years old, her
							mother departed this life. To Mr. and Mrs. Webb have been born five children, namely:
							Raymond A., who is engaged in insurance business; Eugene, who graduated from high
							school in 1913 and now operates a tailoring and pressing establishment in Brownsburg;
							Neil, who is still in school; <pb id="VAC1000-537" n="500"/> Chester, the second
							child, died at the age of nineteen months, and the fourth child died when twelve weeks
							old, having never been named.</p>

						<p>Mr. Webb is a member of the respected order of Freemasonry and is also affiliated
							with the Knights of Pythias. He is interested in the welfare of the Christian church,
							of which Mrs. Webb is a member, and takes a very active part in the affairs of the
							church. She also belongs to the Order of the Eastern Star, the Daughters of Rebekah
							and the Pythian Sisters. She filled the chair of district deputy grand chief in the
							last named order. Mrs. Webb is a woman of many excellent qualities and no small
							business ability and numbers her friends on a large scale. She is a lady of splendid
							personal qualities of character and liked by all who know her. Mr. Webb has become
							well and most favorably known throughout the community for his loyalty to the truth,
							his uprightness in business, his public spirit and his friendly disposition. He and
							his wife are among the most influential and popular citizens of their community, being
							abreast of the times in every way and always willing to give their time and substance,
							if need be, to further any movement looking to the betterment of the locality where
							they reside, religiously, socially or educationally.</p>

							Company C, Sixty-second Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, serving throughout the
							rebellion. Previous to becoming a soldier, he took as his second wife Maggie L.
							McPherson. When the subject of this sketch was seven years old, his father bound him
							out to one Charles VanNatta, of Perry county, Ohio. Mr. VanNatta was a good master to
							him, permitted him to go to school whenever possible, and gave him good training in
							agricultural work. When he became of age and the period of his bound service was over,
							he received from Mr. VanNatta the customary compensation. This was the gift of a
							horse, saddle and bridle or its equivalent in money. Mr. Ruse chose the money,
							receiving one hundred and twenty-five dollars. For a year thereafter he worked for one
							of the farmers in that community and at the end of that time was married and came to
							Indiana, locating in Marion county. He was there but a short time, when he removed to
							Hendricks county where he rented the Arbuckle farm, an eighty-acre tract, and lived
							thereon for four years. He then moved in with the Prebster brothers on their farm a
							mile and a half west of Brownsburg. They were unmarried and too old to work their farm
							and Mr. and Mrs. Ruse cared for them and their farm for four years. During that time
							they bought one hundred and six acres adjoining the Prebster land and built a home on
							it and after the four years with Prebsters spent three years on their own farm. They
							then moved back with the Prebster brothers and remained with them for thirteen years,
							a total of seventeen years, or until the death of Christian Prebster. They then moved
							onto their own farm, taking Reuben Prebster into their own home and cared for him
							until his death, a year and a half later. In consideration of the care given by Mr.
							and Mrs. Ruse. Reuben left the Prebster farm to Mrs. Ruse. Mr. Ruse then bought
							property in Brownsburg and built thereon a comfortable home where he has since
							resided.</p>

						<p>After the close of the war, George Ruse, father of the subject of this sketch, came
							to Indiana and settled in Marion county for a time, later coming to Hendricks county.
							He took up his residence near Brownsburg and there passed the remainder of his life,
							his death occurring on September 21, 1906.</p>

						<p>On January 28, 1880, Mr. Ruse was united in marriage with Jennie Nixon, daughter of
							George and Elizabeth (Diller) Nixon, both being natives of Ohio. Her mother died when
							Mrs. Ruse was a little girl of six years and she remained in the care of an elder
							sister until her tenth year, when she <pb id="VAC1000-539" n="502"/> went to make her
							home with an aunt, remaining there four years. She then began earning her own way in
							the world, but continued to make her home with her sister until the time of her
							marriage to Mr. Ruse: To their union has come one child, George E., born February 4,
							1883. He is married, his wife being Elva Lowder, daughter of James Lowder, of Brown
							township, this county, and they have two interesting children, Raymond L. and Lois
							Irene. The subject takes just pride in these two children, dividing his time between
							them and the work of his farm. He has always been considered one of the best farmers
							in his section, conducting his business in a manner to win and retain the respect and
							confidence of his fellow men, and the success he has won has come to him as a result
							of untiring energy and wise management.</p>

						<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Ruse are members of the Methodist Episcopal church, being
							considered among the most earnest of its members. They give liberally of both time and
							means to further the cause of that society. Mr. Ruse takes an intelligent interest in
							the affairs of the community as affecting the educational, moral and material welfare
							of the people and gives his support to every worthy benevolent or charitable object.
							He has lived and labored to worthy ends and is one of the sterling citizens and
							representative men of his community.</p>

						<p>It is proper to judge of the success of a man's life by the estimation in which he is
							held by his fellow citizens. They see him at his work, in his family circle, in
							church, hear his views on public questions, observe the operation of his code of
							morals, witness how he conducts himself in all the relations of society and
							civilization, and are, therefore, competent to judge of his merits and demerits. After
							a long course of years of such daily observation, it would be out of the question for
							his neighbors not to know of his worth, for, as has been said: "Worth makes the man"
							and "Actions speak louder than words." In this connection it is not too much to say
							that the subject of this sketch has passed a life of unusual honor, that he has been
							industrious and has the confidence of all who have the pleasure of his friendship.</p>

						<p>John F. Brown, well known citizen of Brownsburg, Hendricks county, Indiana, was born
							in Brown township, this county, in the part now known as Lincoln on November 4, 1854,
							being the son of Daniel and Polly N. <pb id="VAC1000-540" n="503"/> (Ballard) Brown,
							both of whom were natives of the state of Kentucky and were brought to Indiana in
							their childhood by their respective parents. Daniel Brown was the son of Daniel Brown,
							Sr., whose wife, Elizabeth (Short) Brown, was a native of Delaware. The father of
							Polly Ballard, mother of the immediate subject of this sketch, was Beverly Ballard,
							originally from Kentucky, a man well known in his community. Upon coming to Indiana,
							Daniel Brown, Sr., settled in Hendricks county, where he acquired government land in
							Brown township, about three miles east of Brownsburg, and there he passed the
							remainder of his life. He was one of two brothers who came at the same time to this
							locality and from them the settlement which became the town of Brownsburg got its
							name. Daniel Brown, Sr., was the father of a family of eleven children, among them
							being Daniel, Jr., father of the immediate subject of this sketch. Daniel Brown, Jr.,
							remained under the parental roof, assisting his father in the work about the home
							place, until the time of his marriage. He then took up his abode on a farm near that
							of his father, and passed the remainder of his life there, his death occurring in
							February, 1862. The widow continued to live on the home place, surrounded and assisted
							by her children, and there her death occurred on March 23, 1883. She was the mother of
							eight children, four of whom died in infancy.</p>

						<p>After his mother's death, John F. Brown continued to reside on the home place and in
							1886 was united in marriage with Dora B. Gore, daughter of Silas and Sarah (Barnes)
							Gore, the former of whom was a native of Virginia and the latter a Hoosier by birth,
							having been born in Shelby county. In 1904 Mr. and Mrs. Brown arranged to rent out
							their farm and took up their residence in Brownsburg. At that time he also purchased a
							farm on the edge of the town, three acres of which were within the corporation, and
							there they lived for nine years, building their present home on Main street in 1913.
							Mr. and Mrs. Brown were the parents of two children, one of whom died in infancy, the
							other being Grace, wife of Byron Ayres, son of John L. and Ella (Gorham) Ayres. Byron
							Ayres was born in Brownsburg and has lived in or near there all his life, at present
							residing on the Gorham farm one mile east of Brownsburg. He and his wife have one
							child, Agatha Leona.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. 3Brown gives his support to the Democratic party and takes a deep
							and commendable interest in public affairs. He served as a member of the advisory
							board for a number of years, discharging the duties of that position in a way
							satisfactory to all. Mrs. Brown is a member of the Presbyterian church, in the affairs
							of which Mr. Brown also takes an <pb id="VAC1000-541" n="504"/> interest, although not
							being a member himself. All throughout his life, Mr. Brown has given evidence of
							unflagging energy and ambition and has won for himself a competency, being possessed
							of his excellent home in Brownsburg and one hundred, and thirty acres of the old
							homestead. He is a man of many praiseworthy traits of character, being scrupulously
							honest in all his dealings with the world, generous and pleasant, possessing rare
							fortitude and good judgment, advocating clean policies, wholesome living and honesty
							in business. Needless to add that such a man has a host of friends and stands high in
							the estimation of all who know him.</p>

						<p>Conspicuous among the representative men and public-spirited citizens of Hendricks

							remembered by those with whom he was closely associated. His life had been interwoven
							with the interests of the community in which he resided and his efforts were always

							life he led gained him the respect and admiration of all of his fellow citizens and
							the heritage he leaves to his widow and children is that of a life well spent in the
							service of his fellow men.</p>

						<p>Gabriel Nicholas Rudd was born May 9, 1873, in this county and died January 8, 1913,
							his death being the result of injuries received in a railroad wreck at Terre Haute,
							Indiana. His parents were Jehu and Sarah (Lasley) Rudd, both of whom were natives of

						<p>Mr. Rudd was married on September 28, 1895, to Luella Kendall, the daughter of Harry
							and Mary Kendall, and to this union were born three children, Lottie Verenia, who died
							at the age of seventeen months; Eloise and Theodore. Mr. Rudd was very much attached
							to his family and was essentially a domestic man in his tastes. He was never happier
							than when seated by his own fireside, and the joys of conjugal bliss were made
							complete by the chatter of his little children and the gentle voice of his loving
							wife.</p>

						<p>Mr. Rudd was affiliated with the Republican party, but was never actively engaged in
							the campaigns of his party. He was a member of the Free and Accepted Masons at
							Indianapolis, belonging to Center Lodge. He and his wife were members of the Methodist
							Episcopal church at Amo, Mr. Rudd being a trustee at the time of his death. He always
							took an active interest in religious affairs, believing the church was the greatest

						<p>Clearly defined purpose and consecutive effort in the affairs of life will inevitably
							result in the attaining of a due measure of success, but in following out the career
							of one who has attained success by his own efforts there comes into view the intrinsic
							individuality which made such accomplishment possible, and thus there is granted an
							objective incentive and inspiration, while at the same time there is enkindled a
							feeling of respect and admiration. The qualities which have made Mr. Hardin one of the
							prominent men of Brownsburg have also brought him the esteem of his fellow townsmen,
							for his career has been one of well-directed energy, strong determination and
							honorable methods.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-544" n="506"/>

						<p>James F. Hardin, the present postmaster of Brownsburg, was born in Boone county, this
							state, on August 29, 1865, the son of William Elliott and Hannah Elizabeth (Lackey)
							Hardin, both of whom were natives of this state. William Elliott was born in Marion
							county and Hannah Elizabeth Lackey was born near Red Key. William Elliott Hardin was a
							son of Isaac J. Hardin, of Kentucky, and was one of a family of six children. The
							father was engaged in agricultural pursuits and young William Elliott remained at home
							until the time of his marriage, in the meantime receiving from his father instructions
							in the secrets of agriculture. After his marriage he lived in Marion county for a time
							and then moved to Boone county, where he had purchased an eighty-acre farm in the
							southeastern part of that county and there they lived for a few years. It was on that
							farm the immediate subject of this sketch was born and, when he was five or six years
							old, William Elliott Hardin traded that tract for a farm of sixty acres located about
							two miles north of the town of Lebanon. There he lived for some five or six years,
							when he moved to Lebanon and later back to Marion county to the farm of Isaac, his
							father, where they lived for some three or four years, or until the death of Isaac
							Hardin. William Elliott Hardin then moved to Clermont, near Indianapolis, when he
							remained for six years, engaged in the sawmill business. After selling that business,
							he moved to Brownsburg, where he passed the remainder of his life. His death occurred
							on October 25, 1893, being killed while working about a clover seed huller. He was a
							man of quite a mechanical turn of mind and after moving to Brownsburg he purchased a
							complete threshing outfit, in which he seemed to take much pleasure aside from the
							profit derived from the operation of same. His wife, Hannah Elizabeth, passed from
							this life in August, 1909.</p>

						<p>James F. Hardin was one of a family of seven children, the others being Isaac,
							Matilda J., Anna, Ella, Kinkley and Claude. James F. remained at home until the time
							of his marriage, assisting his father in his various ventures. After marriage he made
							his home in Brownsburg, but for ten years was on the road for the McCormick Harvester
							Company. He decided to settle down to a business which would permit him to be more at
							home, and decided upon the jewelry and optical business. He went to Indianapolis to
							learn his trade, often walking the distance in order to save the expense of travelling
							otherwise. He was diligent in his work and in a remarkably short time felt justified
							in attempting business on his own responsibility, and opened up a business in
							Brownsburg where he has continued until the present, making for himself an excellent
							reputation in his chosen field of endeavor.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-545" n="507"/>

						<p>On November 3, 1895, Mr. Hardin was united in marriage with Maggie L. Cook, who was
							born November 23, 1871, in Brownsburg, the daughter of Nathan and Mary J. (Moses)
							Cook, both natives of Ohio, having been born near Hillsboro. When but fifteen years
							old, during the nation's hour of trial in the early sixties, young Nathan J. Cook
							enlisted as a drummer boy in Company A, Fifth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and served
							until the close of the war. However, he never served in the capacity in which he
							enlisted, for, being large for his age, he shouldered a musket and went to the front.
							Soon after the close of the war he was married in his native Ohio and not long after
							that brought his wife to Indiana, coming direct to Brownsburg where he was connected
							with the sawmill and lumber business. On October 12, 1898, the boiler in his sawmill
							exploded, killing him outright. The same explosion also blew out one side of the
							residence occupied by the subject of this sketch. Mrs. Nathan Cook lived some years
							after her husband, her death occurring on October 19, 1910. They had a family of six
							children. Those besides the wife of the subject are Cora, Glenn, Eveline, Lottie and
							Walter. Maggie L. remained at home with her parents until the time of her marriage to
							subject. Nathan Cook was considered one of the leading men of the town in his day and
							did much to advance its best interests, both morally, educationally and materially. He
							was active in local politics and served as town trustee for a term or two. His manner
							of life was such as to win the friendship of his fellow men and he retained their high
							regard.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hardin have one son, James Gordon, who attends the grade school of
							Brownsburg. Mr. Hardin's political affiliation is with the Democratic party, in the
							administration of whose affairs he has ever had a keen interest. He has been one of
							the town's trustees for two terms and was town marshal for one term, serving seven
							years in all, and in the discharge of the duties this devolving upon him he showed a
							spirit of equity and broad-mindedness that stamped him as a worthy citizen. On July 1,
							1913, Mr. Hardin received the appointment as postmaster of Brownsburg, which position
							he now occupies. While not a member of any church, Mr. Hardin has been active in
							religious circles, and has done much to assist the local society of the Methodist
							Episcopal church, of which Mrs. Hardin is an earnest and consistent member. In all the
							elements of good citizenship, Mr. Hardin is all that a man should be and because of
							his genuine worth and the high personal character he possesses, he enjoys a well
							deserved popularity throughout the county.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">THOMAS MORAN.</hi></head>

						<p>It was remarked by a celebrated moralist and biographer that "there has scarcely
							passed a life of which a judicious and faithful narrative would not have been useful."
							Believing in the truth of this opinion, expressed by one of the greatest and best of
							men, the writer of this review takes pleasure in presenting a few facts in the career
							of a gentleman, who, by industry, perseverance, temperance and integrity, has worked
							himself from an humble station to a successful place in life and won an honorable
							position among the well known and highly esteemed men of the locality in which he
							resides.</p>

						<p>Thomas Moran, well known farmer of Lincoln township, Hendricks county, Indiana, was
							born in Franklin county, this state, on January 27, 1870, the son of John and Bridget
							(Haley) Moran, both of whom were from county Galway, Ireland. As was quite a custom
							among young Irish sweet-hearts years ago, they would decide to try their fortunes in
							the new world, being unable to see much in the way of opportunity ahead of them in
							their native land. The young man would come to America first, and after he had
							attained a competence, or saw an opportunity for his sweetheart to make her own way
							for a while, he would send for her and they would usually marry soon after her
							arrival. In this way John Moran and Bridget Haley became emigrants to America. The
							former came direct to Hendricks county where he worked out by the day among the
							various farmers around Brownsburg. After his marriage, he moved to Franklin county for
							a couple of years, and it was while they lived there that the subject of this sketch
							first saw the light. John Moran had saved all the money he possibly could aside from
							actual living expenses, and was enabled to purchase a small farm in Hendricks county,
							where he lived the remainder of his life, his death occurring in July. 1905. The wife
							still lives, making her home with her son, Patrick C. Mr. Moran was a stanch Democrat,
							having aligned himself with that party upon acquiring American citizenship, and the
							family were communicants of the Roman Catholic church. They had a family of five
							children. Besides the subject, there were Morton, Patrick, Sarah and Delia.</p>

						<p>Thomas Moran remained under the parental roof until sixteen years of age, having
							attended the 'schools of their home district, and at that time hired out as a day
							laborer. He continued in this line of work for about sixteen years, when he purchased
							sixty acres of land, making a payment of nine hundred dollars down on same. On that
							property he lived for about five years, when he traded it in on his present farm of
							one hundred and <pb id="VAC1000-547" n="509"/> sixty acres, situated about three and
							one-half miles east of Brownsburg. There he engaged in general farming, raising about
							the average crops, devoting particular attention to thoroughbred short-horn cattle and
							Poland China hogs, in all of which he is signally successful.</p>

						<p>On February 16, 1909, Mr. Moran was united in marriage with Bridget Corliss, born
							February 1, 1868, in this county. She is a daughter of Thomas and Julia (Collins)
							Corliss, both of whom emigrated from county Galway, Ireland, when young and unmarried.
							He came first to this county and after their marriage they bought eighty acres of land
							near Brownsburg and to this they added from time to time until at their death they
							were possessed of some three hundred acres. Mrs. Moran remained with her parents until
							she was about twenty-five years of age, when she entered domestic service and
							continued to make her own way in the world until the time of her marriage. To Mr. and
							Mrs. Brown has been born one child, a daughter, Marguerite Mary. Both Mr. and Mrs.
							Moran are communicants of the Roman Catholic church and, politically, Mr. Moran is
							affiliated with the Democratic party.</p>

						<p>On his farm Mr. Moran is enjoying life to the full, realizing, as the public at large
							is realizing more than ever, that the farmer today is to be envied rather than his
							condition deplored, as was at one time the case. Mr. Moran's life has been one of
							unceasing activity and perseverance and the notably systematic and honorable methods
							he has followed have won for him the unbounded confidence and regard of all who have
							formed his acquaintance. He has worked his way from an humble beginning to his present
							station, which fact renders him the more worthy of the praise that is duly accorded
							him by his fellow men.</p>

							interests, but also largely contribute to the moral and material advancement of the

						<p>Smith R. Davis, than whom no resident of North Salem, Hendricks <pb id="VAC1000-548"
								n="510"/> county, Indiana, enjoys a higher degree of popular confidence and regard,
							is a native of Hendricks county, born in Eel River township on the 29th day of July,
							1845, and is the son of Benjamin Franklin and Jane (Russell) Davis, being their only
							child. Benjamin Franklin Davis came to Hendricks county in 1829, when six years of
							age, with his parents, Enoch and Nancy (Hart) Davis. They came from near Mount
							Sterling, Kentucky, to which locality Enoch Davis' father had gone from his native
							state of Virginia, taking with him his bride. Enoch Davis was the father of a family
							of nine children, of whom Benjamin Franklin was one. After coming to Hendricks county,
							he obtained a tract of government land about a mile and a half northwest of North
							Salem, where he passed the remainder of his life. In this same locality his son,
							Benjamin Franklin Davis, settled at the time of his marriage to Jane Russell in 1844,
							purchasing a tract of land near his father's home. However, he did not remain on this
							place long, but during his life bought and sold several pieces of ground in and around
							North Salem, in which town his death occurred in 1909. Jane (Russell) Davis, his wife,
							was a daughter of Silas Russell and was one of a family of nine children. She was a
							native of Kentucky and in 1842 came to Hendricks county with a neighbor, thereafter,
							until the time of the marriage, making her home with her brother, Smith Russell, who
							came to this county some time before.</p>

						<p>Smith R. Davis remained under the parental roof until the time of his marriage to
							Jane C. Brown, in 1866, shortly afterwards purchasing the farm adjoining his home.
							Jane C. Brown was the daughter of George M. and Martha (Dermott) Brown, and her death
							occurred in 1873. She left one child, Benjamin Marshall Davis, who is professor of
							nature study and agriculture at the Miami University at Oxford, Ohio. Benjamin
							Marshall Davis is married and had one daughter, Catherine L., who died at the age of
							eighteen years. In 1875 Mr. Davis took as his second wife Martha (Robbins) Kesler,
							daughter of John and Lydia (Parsons) Robbins, and to their union has been born one
							child, Lydia Jane, who is now the wife of Urbin L. Williams, son of Alexander M. and
							Martha (Griggs) Williams. Lydia Jane and Urbin L. Williams have one child living,
							Rodger Davis Williams. All are residents of North Salem.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Davis gives his loyal support to the Republican party, being active
							in the affairs of same. He was appointed as township trustee of Eel River township and
							served for two terms, 1887 to 1889, and was again elected, serving from 1900 to 1905.
							Since removing to North Salem he has been active in the party's affairs, as related to
							that city, and is at present serving as town clerk and treasurer of North Salem. His
							fraternal <pb id="VAC1000-549" n="511"/> affiliations are with the time-honored body
							of Free and Accepted Masons and also the Knights of Pythias. Both Mr. and Mrs. Davis
							are members of the Order of the Eastern Star, and both hold church membership with the
							Christian church, doing all within their power to further the interests of that
							society. It was in 1890 that Mr. Davis removed his family to North Salem and disposed
							of his farm holdings in 1900, since which time he has devoted his time and energies to
							the political work devolving upon him and in the conduct of the affairs of his
							home.</p>

						<p>Mr. Davis is a veteran of the Civil War, having served toward the close of the war as
							a corporal in Company H, One Hundred and Thirty-second Regiment Indiana Volunteer
							Infantry. His father, who was also an officer, being lieutenant in Company F,
							Fifty-fourth Regiment Indiana Volunteers. However, the father, Benjamin Franklin
							Davis, was not able to finish the campaign, having contracted pneumonia soon after the
							company went into service and being thus incapacitated.</p>

						<p>Mr. Davis is a man whom to know is to admire, for he has led a most exemplary life,
							and has sought to do his duty in all relations with his fellow men, being a man of
							honor, public spirit, charitable impulse and unswerving integrity and enterprise;
							consequently, he is eminently deserving of mention in a history of his county, along

						<p>The history of banking in Indiana goes back to the year 1814, when the Territorial
							Legislature of Indiana passed an act providing for a central bank, with fourteen
							branches. The Constitution of 1816 provided for a bank, part of whose stock should be
							held by the state of Indiana, and this continued in effect until the adoption of the
							new Constitution of 1851, since which time the state has had no interest in any bank.
							The banks of Indiana have passed through many crises and during the internal
							improvement era of Indiana, many of them were forced to surrender their charters.
							Since 1851 the Legislature of the state has passed many laws providing for the
							organization of banks and at the present time the banking system of Indiana is founded
							upon as good a statutory basis as can be found in any of the states of the Union.</p>

						<p>The Brownsburg State Bank was organized April 1, 1908, with the following officers:

						<head><hi rend="center">WILLIAM H. SHIELDS.</hi></head>

						<p>One of the conspicuous names on the list of Hendricks county agriculturists is
							William H. Shields, proprietor of a fine farm in Franklin township, a gentleman of
							high standing to whom has not been denied a full measure of success. Long recognized
							as a factor of importance in connection with the farming and stock raising industries
							here, he has been prominently identified with the material growth and prosperity of
							this part of the state, his life having been closely interwoven with the history of
							the county where he has been content to live and follow his chosen vocation for over a
							half century.</p>

						<p>The Shields family is one of the oldest and most highly respected families in
							Hendricks county and has for nearly three-quarters of a century been a prominent
							factor in the material welfare of this section. The Shields family came from Tennessee
							early in the history of the state and first settled in Owen county, Indiana, the
							paternal grandfather, Henry Shields, dying in Putnam county. John H. Shields, the
							father of the subject of this sketch, was born in Putnam county, Indiana, January 16,
							1834. His parents were Henry and Jane (Dick) Shields, both of whom were natives of
							Tennessee. <pb id="VAC1000-551" n="[]"/>

							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-552" n="513"/> Henry Shields came to Putnam county in 1829, where he
							immediately entered eighty acres of land from the government and proceeded to make his
							home in this wilderness. He settled in the heavy timber near Greencastle, clearing the
							land and erecting a hewed-log cabin. He was active and industrious, became widely
							known and stood high in the esteem of those who knew him. Mr.. Shields resided in this
							county until his death, in 1889. His wife, Jane Dick, the daughter of Jacob Dick, was
							a woman of more than ordinary intelligence and took a great deal of pride in her
							children. Mr. and Mrs. Henry Shields were the parents of eight children: Jacob, who
							married, first, Mary Elrod, and after her death, Ann (McCarty) Cox; William, whose
							death occurred in his twenty-second year; Harriett, the wife of Harrison Elrod; Mary,
							wife of John Phillips; Louisa, wife of Jacob Phillips; Elvina, wife of Joseph Elrod;
							James, who married Mary Gibbons; John H., the father of the subject of this
							sketch.</p>

						<p>John H. Shields married Phoebe Garrison, the daughter of William and Lavina (Reese)
							Garrison, and to this union there was born one son, William Harrison, the subject of
							this sketch. After the death of his first wife, John H. Shields married Amanda J.
							Mason, the daughter of Anselmn and Alice (Shouse) Mason. The parents of the first wife
							of John H. Shields reared six children, Mary, Elizabeth, Harriett, Phoebe, John and
							Pickney; the parents of the second wife had eight children, Harriett, Eliza,
							Josephine, Amanda, John, Merritt. Weekly and Wickliff.</p>

						<p>As a boy of ten years, John H. Shields assisted his father in driving stock from
							Putnam county to the market at Lafayette, and also hauled wheat to that place,
							receiving fifty cents a bushel for it.</p>

						<p>John H. Shields is one of the oldest and most successful farmers in the county, and
							his farm of one hundred and ninety-eight acres, partly in Franklin township and partly
							in Putnam county, has the reputation of being one of the best improved and most
							productive of the farms in central Indiana. He has been a life-long Democrat in
							politics and always casts his ballot for the candidates of that party. He and his wife
							are loyal members of the Methodist Episcopal church at Coatesville, and contribute
							liberally of their means to its support.</p>

						<p>William Harrison Shields, proprietor of two hundred and fifty-one acres of land in
							Franklin township, this county, is the only son of John H. Shields. He received his
							education in the Putnam county schools, and when a small lad started to work on his
							father's farm. Upon his marriage, in 1884, he bought a farm in Hendricks county and
							began a very successful career as an <pb id="VAC1000-553" n="514"/> agriculturist in
							this county. Before his marriage he attended school for a time in Valparaiso
							University and since leaving college he has always been interested in the current
							events of the day. He also makes it a practice to keep in touch with the latest
							improvements in farming methods, and the result is that he is now one of the most
							progressive farmers of the county.</p>

						<p>William H. Shields was married to Julia A. Newman, the daughter of John L. and Maria
							(Phillips) Newman, on October 1, 1884, and to this marriage there have been born two
							children, Stella and Callie, both of whom are still under the parental roof. Mrs.
							Shields' parents were both natives of Randolph county, North Carolina, her father's
							birth having occurred in 1820. He came to Hendricks county, Indiana, when he was
							eighteen years of age and settled on land which his father had previously entered from
							the government. He married Maria Phillips, daughter of Eli and Elizabeth (Lanous)
							Phillips, and to this union there were six children born: Laura, who died at the age
							of six years; Jane, the wife of G. Robinson and the mother of three children. Edward,
							Joseph and Cordelia; Mary, wife of Frank Johnson, who has two children, Clarence and
							Luna; Martha married Frank Masten and has three children, Hezzie, Aldie and one who
							died in infancy; George, who died at the age of sixteen years. The father of Mrs.
							Shields died on February 20, 1892, her mother having passed away in 1886.</p>

						<p>William H. Shields has been a prominent factor in the material, social and moral
							welfare of the community in which he has lived for so many years. In his religious
							relations he has been identified with the society of Friends and takes an active
							interest in the affairs of his church. Politically, he is allied with the Democratic
							party, although he has never been active in local politics. He is interested
							financially in the First National Bank of Coatesville and is a director in that
							institution at the present time. Mr. Shields and his wife have always been interested
							in all movements which seek to elevate the general welfare of the locality in which
							they live, and all movements looking to this end find ready and sympathetic helpers in
							them.</p>

						<p>Charles H. Jordan is a native of Hendricks county, being born about four miles east
							of Danville, on September 2, 1849, the son of Joseph W. and Anna M. (Faucett) Jordan,
							the former of whom was born in Preble county, Ohio, the son of Joseph Jordan. Joseph
							W. Jordan, father of the immediate subject of this sketch, came to Indiana when a
							young man and soon after arriving in Hendricks county he met Anna M. Faucett, their
							marriage taking place soon thereafter. They resided east of Danville until about the
							year 1850, when they removed to the farm where Charles H. Jordan now lives. Anna
							Faucett was the daughter of Joseph and Rebecca (Ross) Faucett, who it is thought came
							to Indiana from Ohio, their native state. To Joseph WV. and Anna M. (Faucett) Jordan
							were born five children, three of whom died in infancy. Joseph W. Jordan rendered
							valuable services to his country at the time of the Civil War. At the beginning of
							hostilities, he enlisted in Company I, Seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, in
							which he served but three months, when he returned home and organized Company K of the
							Seventy-ninth Regiment of Indiana Volunteers, being commissioned captain of same by
							Governor Morton, and in this capacity he served until near the close of the war, when
							he returned home owing to ill health. Joseph W. Jordan's death occurred in 1885 and
							his wife died in 1904. He was considered one of the leading men of his day in his
							community and was a man greatly honored and respected by a vast number of
							acquaintances.</p>

						<p>Charles H. Jordan received his elementary education in the district schools of
							Hendricks county, later spending two years in study at Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio.
							All the business efforts of his life have been devoted to agricultural pursuits and he
							is an advocate of modern methods in farming. In 1881 Mr. Jordan was married to Arlen
							F. Glidewell, a daughter of Leander and Hannah (Hightshue) Glidewell, both of whom
							were natives of the Hoosier state. Leander is the son of Lewis and Nancy (Talbert)
							Glidewell, and Hannah Hightshue was the daughter of Nicholas and Jane (Runnells)
							Hightshue. To the subject and his wife were born four children, namely: Cassie B., the
							wife of Chester Brunes. They reside three <pb id="VAC1000-555" n="516"/> miles
							southeast of Danville and have a family of three children, Mildred, Glendon and Cecil.
							Harry C. took as his wife Lilly Lemon, and they live on a farm four miles northwest of
							North Salem with their two children Joe and Fern. Estella Ruth remains under the
							parental roof and is a teacher of music. She is a graduate of the Central Normal
							College at Danville. Joseph C. also remains at home.</p>

						<p>Mr. Jordan's fraternal affiliations are with the honored body of Free-masonry, in
							which he has advanced to the chapter, or Royal Arch, degree and to the council of
							Royal and Select Masters. Both Mr. and Mrs. Jordan are members of the Order of the
							Eastern Star. Although not a member of any church society, Mr. Jordan's religious
							sympathies are with the Methodist Episcopal church, of which Mrs. Jordan is an earnest
							and active member. Quiet and unassuming in his relations with his fellow men, Mr.
							Jordan has applied himself to the business of his farm and the care of his home and
							family. His career has been a consistent and honorable one, and because of his staunch
							integrity he is entitled to and holds the sincere confidence and good will of all who
							know him. He has been one of those solid men of brain and substance so essential to
							the material growth and development of a community and whose influence has been
							willingly extended in behalf of every deserving enterprise that has for its object the
							advancement of the moral welfare of the community.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">ORA COCKERELL.</hi></head>

						<p>For thousands of years, since the earliest days of civilization, the work of the
							carpenter has been a necessity among men and has been honored by numbering among its
							ranks some of the brightest lights of history. Since the multitudes of mankind have
							forsaken tents of skin and huts of clay and have sought for their shelter houses built
							of wood, the carpenter has plied his trade, advancing and perfecting the details of
							building as the centuries have passed, until the primitive houses of our ancestors
							have given place to the present type of building, and our homes, stores and public
							buildings are marvels of convenience and luxury. Many new inventions in machinery and
							tools have come to facilitate the work in recent years, and yet, in many of the
							essentials, the fundamental principles of carpentry have not changed since the days
							when the Lowly Nazarene stood at his bench in Nazareth, and dignified for all time the
							profession of carpentry. Today the builder finds <pb id="VAC1000-556" n="517"/> his
							opportunities unlimited, and his profession numbers among its thousands many men of
							education, ability and wealth.</p>

						<p>In our midst we have one member of this profession who is well known and holds an
							enviable position in the community, Ora Cockerell, the son of a carpenter, was bred to
							the use of tools. He was born December 8, 1872, in Middle township, Hendricks county,
							the son of Andrew Jackson and Mary Jane (Griffith) Cockerell.</p>

						<p>Andrew Jackson Cockerell was a native of Carroll county, Kentucky, but emigrated to
							Hendricks county in 1856, making the journey alone and taking up his abode in Middle
							township. Here he followed the carpenter's trade, building some of the stanch,
							heavily-timbered houses which still stand as evidence of the thorough workmanship done
							upon them. Later he learned to be a wagon-maker, but devoted comparatively little time
							to this work. He was married to Mary Jane Griffith, a native of Hendricks county, who
							proved a devoted wife and mother. To them were born nine children, as follows:
							Benjamin Thomas, who died in 1902; Henry Marshall, James Wesley, Willis Elmer, Eva
							Jane (Pounds), Rosa (Hicks), Ora, the immediate subject of this article, Nettie Marie,
							who died in January, 1887, and Alice (Davis). In the year 1887 death deprived Andrew
							J. Cockerell of the companionship of his faithful wife, leaving him a large family of
							children to rear without her aid and encouragement. He proved himself a kind, patient
							father, teaching by example as well as precept, and instilling the principles of
							temperance, sobriety and industry into his boys. He was a member of no church and took
							no active part in politics, although a consistent adherent of the Democratic party,
							finding his associations and limiting his outside activities to the local lodge of
							Independent Order of Odd Fellows, of whch he was a member, and to the various social
							affairs of the neighborhood. He died in 1906, leaving a large, respected family to
							perpetuate his name and teachings, and many friends who revere his memory.</p>

						<p>Ora Cockerell spent his boyhood days in Middle township, Hendricks county, attending
							the elementary schools of the township, and at the early age of fifteen years learning
							the carpenter's trade. On December 23, 1896, he married Alta Estella Roseboom, and to
							them have been born four children, three sons, Paul Gilbert, Charles Harold and Frank,
							all of whom the all-wise Father saw fit to take unto himself in their childhood; and
							one daughter, Genevieve May, who is the constant companion of her mother and the
							source of inspiration to her father.</p>

						<p>Mr. Cockerell is a man of few words, quiet and unassuming, but his judgment in
							business affairs is unquestioned, and his advice in public affairs <pb
								id="VAC1000-557" n="518"/> at all times carries great weight with his associates.
							His life has been one of accomplishment for himself and the community. Starting in
							life with little capital save his own knowledge of his chosen trade, he has worked
							conscientiously and well, first as a good carpenter and later as a successful
							contractor, upon whose word clients can safely depend. His own home is visible
							evidence of his ability as a builder, being a beautiful, modern structure, thoroughly
							equipped with every convenience for the comfort of the family and to facilitate the
							work of the home. The fact that he has twice been elected a member of the town board
							of Pittsboro, serving two terms in this capacity (from 1906 to 1908 and from 1911 to
							1913), speaks more eloquently of the high esteem in which he is held by his fellow men
							than any words of ours could do.</p>

						<p>Firm in his convictions and unswerving in adherence to principle, his political
							affiliations have not always been with the most popular party; but he has worked
							diligently for and looked forward to the abolishment of the liquor traffic and its
							attendant evils in his own community and throughout the nation, and to this end has
							consistently allied himself with the Prohibition party. Fraternally, he is a member of
							the Pittsboro Lodge, Independent Order of Odd Fellows; the Knights of Pythias, at
							Brownsburg, and the Improved Order of Red Men at Lizton. He is a member of the Baptist
							church of Pittsboro, while Mrs. Cockerell has her membership in the Methodist
							church.</p>

						<p>The K. of P. building at Lizton, the Sawyer block and Hayworth block at Pittsboro,
							and numerous other buildings throughout the county speak of his ability as a builder,
							while his reputation for strict integrity, honor, industry and the performance of all
							good works in his power for the community at large, speak of a life of service, well
							spent and productive of marked results for himself and his neighbor.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOSEPH G. WALTER.</hi></head>

						<p>The pursuit of agriculture in itself seems to make a peculiar appeal to those
							characteristics in mankind which tend toward and develop the true and sincere in
							character. Nearer, in his daily life, to the beautiful heart of nature than any other
							man, witnessing in all around him the wonders which the Almighty daily performs;
							seeing in the sprouting of the seed, the purling of the brook and the habits of live
							creatures the miracles which are hidden <pb id="VAC1000-558" n="519"/> from the cliff
							dweller of the crowded city, is it small wonder that he is uncontaminated by the
							petty, mean things of life. And as he sees these things in his daily life and work,
							his nature deepens and truth and sincerity become his natural attitude toward life and
							his fellow men.</p>

						<p>It is of such a man we wish to speak in this article. Joseph G. Walter was born
							January 29, 1848, in Middle township, Hendricks county, the son of William Eli and
							Caroline (Reynolds) Walter. His boyhood was spent upon the farm of his father, and
							here he roamed the fields and learned the fundamental principles of his vocation. He
							attended the schools of the township, assisting his father with the work of the farm
							in his spare time.</p>

						<p>In 1872 Mr. Walter was married to Virginia Dickerson, but in the year 1880 death
							called her from him. In 1891 he again married, Azzie Pierson, the daughter of Thomas
							and Elizabeth (Jones) Pierson, becoming his wife. Three children have come to bless
							this union, all of whom are still at home with their parents.</p>

						<p>During his early life, Mr. Walter was at one time seized with the desire for a
							change, and this wanderlust led him to seek new scenes and new faces and new
							occupations in the far West. The beautiful state of Colorado eventually became his
							goal and there, for five years, he engaged in the work of mining silver, but the love
							of home and the memories of the green fields of his native county were strong within
							him and he finally turned his back upon the glories of the beautiful Rockies and
							returned to the Hoosier state. Here he has since remained, eventually purchasing a
							farm of about sixty-four acres, lying both in Middle and Union townships, and this
							tract, with its comfortable house and well-kept buildings, is one of the well known
							homesteads of the locality.</p>

						<p>The subject's father, Eli Walter, was a native of Fauquier county, Virginia, but
							emigrated while still a young man, to Hamilton county, Ohio, remaining in this place
							about two years. A residence of about five years in Wayne county followed, and there
							he met and married Caroline Reynolds, a native of the state of New Jersey. Eleven
							children were born to them, as follows: Sarah, John W., Nancy Rachel, Lucy Jane
							(Anderson), Alexander, Joseph G., Martha C. (Thompson), George, Benjamin, William and
							an infant who lived but a few hours. Of these children but three survive, Joseph G.,
							Lucy Jane and Martha C. Mr. Walter entered land from the government in St. Joe county,
							and also in Tipton county, this state, but it was in Hendricks county that he chose to
							spend his days and rear his family. He was untiring in his efforts upon the farm,
							giving his time and <pb id="VAC1000-559" n="520"/> energy to the successful
							cultivation of the soil, drawing therefrom sustenance for his large and growing
							family. The faithful wife and mother was called from this earth to her final rest in
							1857, and for thirty-three years thereafter he found his comfort in his home and
							children, until death called him in 1890.</p>

						<p>In manner, Joseph G. Walter is quiet and unassuming, yet sociable withal and a man to
							inspire confidence. His reputation for honesty and veracity is unquestioned and his
							friends speak of him as a man "whose word is as good as his bond." He is a firm
							believer in the tenets of the Republican party; a member of the Independent Order of
							Odd Fellows, at Pittsboro, and is also affiliated with the Masonic order of that
							place. He has aspired to no political office, devoting his energies to his home, his
							farm and the improvement of his surroundings, but in all questions touching the
							welfare of the community at large he shows a vital interest. Though not an active
							member of any church, his sympathies are with the Christian denomination. Both he and
							his wife are devoted to their three children and are popular with the young people in
							their vicinity.</p>

						<p>A man of large acquaintance, many friends and a host of well wishers, his life has
							been a source of uplift to those with whom he has come in contact, and the community
							at large is the better for his having lived in it. Thus has he fulfilled man's highest
							mission in life, to so live that when he is called from hence he shall leave the world
							better than he found it.</p>

						<p>One of the best farmers of Hendricks county, who by virtue of his strong individual

							always keeps well informed upon all the latest methods of agriculture and comes as
							near being a scientific farmer as any one in the county.</p>

						<p>Cyrus H. Masten, the proprietor of one hundred and thirty acres of fine land in

								<p rend="center">MR. AND MRS. CYRUS H. MASTEN</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-561" n="521"/> he has lived his entire life. His parents were John and
							Sarah (Harvey) Masten, his father being a native of North Carolina, while his mother
							was born in Ohio. John Masten came to Hendricks county, Indiana, at the age of five,
							with his parents, who were farmers, and, after a limited education in the subscription
							schools of that period, he started to work on his father's farm. While still a young
							man he married Sarah Harvey, the daughter of Nathan and Ruth (Jones) Harvey, and to
							this union there were born eight children: One who died in infancy; Ruth, who first
							married Clark Hodson, and after his death, WV. R. Shirley, and later Allen Wicker:
							Emory, who married Emma Mendenhall; Elmer and Anna, both unmarried and living in Amo;
							Sarah, deceased; Milo, deceased, and Cyrus, the immediate subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>Cyrus H. Masten was interested in education from the time that he took his first
							reader to school, and before he completed his education he had finished the common
							school course and also the courses at Valparaiso University and the Indiana State
							Normal School at Terre Haute. With this preparation he started to teach in the public
							schools of his county and for the next ten years he was one of the most successful
							teachers in the county. The teaching profession lost an able instructor when he
							decided to retire from the school room and engage in farming. He had taught two years
							before he graduated. As a farmer he has been no less successful than as a teacher, and
							the same qualities which brought him success in the school room have been of benefit
							to him in his agricultural career.</p>

						<p>Mr. Masten was married to Laura E. Hadley, the daughter of Jehu and Jerusha (Stiles)
							Hadley, and to this union there were born five children, Verne, Ray I., Floy (who
							married Ralph Shields and has one child, Donnas Lucile), Earl H. and Eva. The parents
							of Mrs. Masten were prominent citizens of this county, and raised an interesting
							family of ten children: Nancy, wife of William Daggy; Mary, wife of Dr. H. Gibbons;
							Henry, unmarried; George, deceased; Sybil, wife of W. Wilson; Marcus, deceased; Alice,
							wife of D. B. Matlock; Laura, wife of the subject; Jerusha, wife of Edward Ragland:
							Jehu, who married Olive Wilhite. The latter two are twins. The mother of Mrs. Masten
							died in 1899, and her father in 1894.</p>

						<p>Mr. Masten is a Progressive in politics, having joined that party upon its
							organization in the fall of 1912, because he felt that in the principles advocated by
							that party there was a splendid opportunity for improving the condition of the
							community at large. He and his wife are devoted members of the Christian church at
							Stilesville, Indiana, and are interested in all <pb id="VAC1000-562" n="522"/> of its
							various activities. Mr. Masten has always been active in all movements looking toward
							the welfare of his locality. He has always been a sympathetic and ready helper of all

						<p>The following is the sketch of a plain, honest man of affairs, who by correct methods
							and a strict regard for the interests of those with whom his business interests

							contemporaries and their posterity and leave the impress of their individuality deeply
							stamped upon the community.</p>

						<p>Elmer Smith was born May 2, 1873, in Pike township, Marion county, Indiana, the son
							of Elijah and Evelin (McCurdy) Smith. the former of whom was born in Brown township,
							Hendricks county, on September 29, 1846. He was the son of Thomas D. and Susan (Ford)
							Smith, natives of Kentucky, who, soon after their marriage, came to Indiana, making
							the journey on horseback. Thomas D. was the son of Isaac Smith, who was a native of
							North Carolina and went to Kentucky with his father when a boy. He later moved to
							Indiana and settled about four miles southeast of Brownsburg in Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>Elijah Smith, father of the subject, was one of a family of nine children and lived
							at home until the time of his marriage, being in the meantime instructed by his father
							in the proper methods of agriculture. After his marriage, he took up his residence in
							Marion county, this state, where he had rented a farm on Eagle creek. There he made
							his home from 1870 to 1900, having purchased one hundred and forty acres of land
							thereabouts. In 1900 he disposed of a portion of this land and removed to Brownsburg,
							where he purchased property and now resides. In 1870 Elijah Smith was <pb
								id="VAC1000-563" n="523"/> united in marriage with Evelin McCurdy, daughter of David
							and Nancy (Hill) McCurdy, and in July, 1902, she died, leaving two children, the
							subject of this sketch and his brother, Alvin A.</p>

						<p>Elmer Smith remained at his father's home until the time of his marriage, having
							received his education in the district schools of Marion county. After his marriage he
							took up his residence on a farm he had purchased adjoining that of his father. He
							remained there until 1903, when he removed to Brownsburg, where he resided for about
							nine months, and in August of that year he took up his residence on a farm which he
							had purchased in Brown township, this county. There he lived for three years, when he
							returned to Brownsburg. In the spring of 1907 he engaged in the retail hardware
							business in Brownsburg, and remained in that connection until the spring of 1910, when
							he disposed of his business and engaged in the sale of real estate. For two years he
							worked at this line and in March, 1912, opened up the first garage in town, known as
							Smith's garage. He also has the distinction of having started the first hardware
							business in the town, and on February 1, 1914, he again opened up a hardware business
							in connection with his garage. Mr. Smith has been eminently successful in the various
							business ventures in which he has engaged and in addition to his present thriving
							business, owns forty acres of land on the eastern edge of Brownsburg besides the
							property adjoining his residence, also another house and lot and five lots in the

							times owned different pieces of property in the town, as well as farms in both Marion
							and Hendricks counties, all of which he has handled in a way to his own rightful
							advantage. While engaged primarily in fostering his own interests, Mr. Smith has ever
							so ordered his principles of private life and business as to win the confidence and
							respect of those with whom he comes in contact.</p>

						<p>On December 29, 1897, Mr. Smith was united in marriage with Maud E. Delong, born
							February 3, 1882, daughter of F. A. and Mollie (Matthewes) Delong, at present residing
							near Traders Point, this state. Mrs. Smith, however, was born in Michigan. Her father,
							F. A. Delong, came originally from Boone county, this state, being the son of David

							his fraternal affiliations are with the time-honored body of Free and Accepted Masons,
							the Independent Order of Odd Fellows <pb id="VAC1000-564" n="524"/> and the Knights of
							Pythias. Both Mr. and Mrs. Smith are members of the Order of the Eastern Star and the

							race for county commissioner in 1914. Mr. Smith has always been regarded as a man of
							high principles, honest in every respect and broad-minded. A man of depth of
							character, kindness of heart to the unfortunate and ever willing to aid in any way any
							cause for the betterment of the community and the public with which he has to deal, he
							is, consequently, held in high favor and the utmost respect by all who know him.

						<p>In the early days, when our state was young and sparsely settled, the riches of the
							earth seemed inexhaustible, and after the arduous labor of clearing away the grand old
							forests which covered so much of the ground was accomplished, the pioneer farmer found
							the land fallow and black, ready to produce bountiful harvests each season, without
							the necessity for specialized training in the science of food production. But
							gradually, as the magnificent tracts of forest land became more and more scarce and
							population increased, more was demanded of the soil. And gradually, also, pests of
							various kinds multiplied to interfere with the growth and blight the maturity of the
							fruits of the land, until now, agriculture has become a science in itself, and men of
							high intelligence and broad education find a profession worthy of their utmost effort.
							This condition of affairs has brought prominently to the front the broad minded,
							highly educated, specialized agriculturist of today, and with such a man our sketch
							has to deal.</p>

						<p>Jonathan Lowe, son of Nathan B. and Sarah (Coffin) Lowe, is a splendid example of
							this class of progressive, up-to-date farmer. Himself a product of Hendricks county,
							he was born October 4, 1880, in Middle township. Here he spent his boyhood on the farm
							of his father, attending the township <pb id="VAC1000-565" n="525"/> schools, and
							after graduating there, taking the full course in the high school at Lizton. This was
							followed by two terms in the Central Normal College at Danville.</p>

						<p>Mrs. Jonathan Lowe is also a member of a well-known family, being the daughter of
							William H. Walter, one of the early inhabitants of the county, a successful farmer,
							and the father of eleven children, as follows: Mrs. Martha Carrie Overstreet; Orrie,
							deceased; George Elvin and Charles, twins, the latter of whom death claimed in 1912;
							Mrs. Mertie Keeney; Mrs. Mary A. West; Mrs. Elizabeth Alice Leak; John A.; Jessie
							Mable, the wife of the subject; Ernest R., and Marion, who died in infancy. Mr. Walter
							was a member of Company B, One Hundred and Thirty-ninth Indiana Volunteers, enlisting
							shortly before the close of the war and remaining in the service until peace was
							declared, being mustered out at Indianapolis in July, 1865. He was married in the year
							1866 to Anna Eliza Talbert, a native of Hendricks county, and found in her a faithful
							helpmate and a devoted mother to the children which she bore him. Mr. Walter passed
							away April 20, 1907. His widow still survives, a well-known and respected resident of
							Middle township, this county.</p>

						<p>Jonathan Lowe and his wife are widely known for their broad mindedness, activity in
							church and social affairs and the progressive spirit which dominates their
							undertakings. Mr. Lowe takes great pride in the upkeep of his buildings and the
							improvement and development of his farm of forty acres, which is a part of the tract
							of six hundred and forty acres entered from the government by his. maternal
							grandfather. The famous old beaver dam is located on the south part of this ninety
							acres, and although it is now mostly filled in, it is an interesting landmark, having
							formerly been considered the best in the county.</p>

						<p>On October 4, 1908, Mr. Lowe was married to Jessie Mable Walter, who also is a native
							of Hendricks county, and one year later the young couple began their residence on the
							farm which they now occupy. Two sons, Joel Walter and James Elvin, have come to
							brighten their home. Mr. Lowe is of Scotch-Irish descent, through his father, Nathan
							B. Lowe, the son of William and Grace Lowe, of Backcreek township, Randolph county,
							North Carolina, honest, sturdy adherents of the Quaker church. In 1860 Nathan Lowe
							migrated to Rush county, Indiana, and a year later came to Hendricks county, where he
							remained until the day of his death, the 3d day of January, 1903. He was a
							well-informed, broadminded man, a successful farmer and a useful member of the
							community. <pb id="VAC1000-566" n="526"/> Early in life he was married to Sarah
							Coffin, a native of Hendricks county, and to them were born six children: Lydia J. and
							James (both deceased), Elizabeth Grace, Joseph C., Jonathan and Sarah Alice. His wife
							was the youngest daughter of Joseph I. Coffin, a large land owner, aggressive in
							business affairs, though quiet and conservative in manner. One of the early settlers
							in the county, he entered from the government six hundred and forty acres of land, and
							by his diligent efforts this and much surrounding land was provided with adequate
							drainage, greatly enhancing its value and rendering much of it available for valuable
							farming land which otherwise could not have been cultivated. An inherent trait of
							character was the desire to use the very best methods of work, and to this end he made
							the first plows which were used in Hendricks county. This trait is still evident in
							his descendants.</p>

						<p>The most modern methods of work are sought and used in all departments of Mr. Lowe's
							work, supplementing his own energy and practical foresight by the use of modern tools
							and machinery. He is interested in the breeding of live stock, which he considers an
							essential feature on the successful, modern farm. He is a consistent Republican voter
							and has taken an active part in politics, while his influence is felt in all movements
							touching the general welfare of the community. Strictly honest, clean cut and decisive
							in his dealings, he enjoys the fullest confidence of his associates. The Methodist
							church at Lizton, of which he and his wife are active members, has shown its faith in
							his integrity by electing him trustee and treasurer of its board of finance.
							Altogether he stands for what is highest and best in the life of the modern
							agriculturist.</p>

						<p>Few farmers in the locality of which this history treats seem to understand better
							the way in which to manage Indiana soil in order to get the largest returns from it
							than John A. Leak, of Union township, a man who has succeeded because he has given his
							exclusive attention to his individual affairs, studied carefully the relation of soil
							to crops, climate and all the phases relating to improved farming.</p>

						<p>John A. Leak was born January 28, 1858, in the township where he has lived his whole
							life. He is the son of Landrum and Sarah (Leach) Leak, both his father and his mother
							being natives of Kentucky. Landrum Leak <pb id="VAC1000-567" n="527"/> was born in
							1818 and came to this county with his parents, James and Elizabeth Leak, in 1835, when
							he was seventeen years of age. He grew to manhood under pioneer conditions and became
							a successful farmer in the township. He was twice married, his first marriage being to
							Evaline Martin, and the second marriage to Sarah Leach. There was one son born to the
							first marriage, James M., who died in 1888. To the second marriage were born four
							children: Mrs. Evaline Jeger, of New Mexico; William L., of Anderson, Indiana; John
							A., whose history is herein delineated, and George B., a twin brother of John A., who
							died about 1902. Landrum Leak died in 1890 on a farm in Union township.</p>

						<p>John A. Leak received such education as was afforded by his home school in Union
							township and the two years before his marriage in 1885 he spent in Tennessee. Upon his
							marriage, Mr. Leak moved to Johnson county near Greenwood, where he farmed for six
							years; he then went to Kokomo and entered the grocery business and followed this for
							the next four years, after which he moved back to Hendricks county and settled on the
							old homestead farm which he rented for two years. He then bought twenty-seven acres
							one mile south of his present farm, and lived on it three years, when he bought sixty
							acres where he now lives and later added another forty acres, a total acreage now of
							one hundred acres. Mr. Leak has been sufficiently progressive to keep abreast of the
							latest developments in agricultural methods and has won a full measure of prosperity
							in his present location. He has not only been an important factor in the agricultural
							life of his community, but he has also been interested in the Citizens Bank at Lizton,
							in which he is a stockholder and director at the present time.</p>

						<p>Mr. Leak was married February 25, 1885, to Nevada Leak, the daughter of James M. and
							Mary (Dickey) Leak. The biography of James M. Leak, given elsewhere in this volume,
							gives the ancestry of that branch of the Leak family to which Mrs. John A. Leak
							belongs. Mr. and Mrs. John A. Leak have two very promising sons living; one son,
							Warren, died in infancy, the other two sons being Roy and Glenn. Both of the boys
							graduated from the Lizton high school and later spent two terms in the Central Normal
							College of Danville. After they began to teach, they spent one year in the State
							Normal School at Terre Haute in order to qualify themselves for better work in the
							school room. Roy is now teaching at Stilesville, this county, and Glenn teaches in
							Marion county, near University Heights.</p>

						<p>In his fraternal relations, Mr. Leak is a member of the Knights of Pythias at Lizton,
							while politically he has long been identified with the <pb id="VAC1000-568" n="528"/>
							Democratic party, but has never been a candidate for any public office, preferring to
							devote his attention to his agricultural interests. He has a fine residence, which he
							has recently remodeled and improved in many ways, a large barn, good outbuildings and
							various other improvements which render his farm a very attractive place. Mr. Leak is
							a self-made man in every respect and has been a hard worker all of his life. He is a
							pleasant man to meet, congenial in all of his relations with his fellow men and has
							always make it a point to identify himself with all worthy public measures.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">WILLIAM HENRY APPLEBAY.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the old and highly respected farmers of Hendricks county there is no one who
							stands higher in the esteem of his fellow citizens than the gallant old veteran whose
							name forms the caption of this sketch. His three-score and ten years have been spent
							within the limits of this county with the exception of the two years when he served
							his country so nobly at the front. For the past fifty years he has been actively
							engaged in agricultural pursuits in this county and the years of his residence here
							have but served to strengthen the feeling of admiration on the part of his fellow men,
							owing to the honorable life he has led and the worthy example he has set the younger
							generation.</p>

						<p>William Henry Applebay, one of the youngest soldiers who enlisted from this county
							for service in the Civil War, was born in Center township, Hendricks county, Indiana,
							December 2, 1844. His parents were William and Sebith (Sears) Applebay, the father
							being a native of Lincoln county, Kentucky, born in 1815, and his mother a native of
							Clark county, Kentucky, born in 1818. The grandparents of William Henry Applebay were
							Philip and Mary (Walker) Applebay, who reared a large family of ten children. After
							the death of his first wife Philip Applebay married Susan Dancer and to this second
							marriage were born seven children. William Applebay, father of the subject of this
							sketch, came to Hendricks county, Indiana, in 1839, locating in Danville, where he
							remained for the succeeding eighteen years. He then moved to Franklin township, this
							county, where he remained until his death, which occurred on May 11, 1863. To Mr. and
							Mrs. William Applebay were born twelve children: Wesley, who married Sarah Fisher, and
							they were the parents of three children; Mary, who married William H. McCloud, and
							they are both deceased, and to this marriage were born <pb id="VAC1000-569" n="[]"/>
							<figure>
								<p rend="center">WILLIAM H. APPLEBAY</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-570" n="529"/> nine children; Maria died unmarried; William H., the
							immediate subject of this sketch; Mariah, Milton, Susan, David and Nancy, twins,
							Martha, Amanda and Isabelle. Nancy, Martha and William H. are unmarried and living
							today.</p>

						<p>When the Civil War broke out William H. Applebay wanted to enlist at once, but on
							account of his age the local recruiting officer would not take him in. As soon as he
							reached the age of eighteen he enlisted in Company E, Seventy-eighth Regiment, under
							Captain A. J. Lee, and served two months. Later he enlisted in Company B, of the
							Fifty-ninth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, under Captain J. M. Lee, and was
							immediately transferred to General Sherman's Twentieth Corps in eastern Kentucky. He
							was in the eastern part of Tennessee and in March, 1864, started with General Sherman
							on his memorable march to the sea. He was in all the battles from Resaca, in the
							northwestern corner of Georgia, through Dalton, Atlanta to Savannah, which was reached
							on the 25th of December, 1864. He was in the rear and around Atlanta during the months
							of June and July of that summer. In the spring of 1865 his company was attached to the
							brigade which went north with Sherman to South Carolina and North Carolina, and he was
							headed for Greensboro to the surrender of General Johnson to General Sherman in April,
							1865, at Greensboro, North Carolina. He served one year and a half in a creditable
							manner, after which he was mustered out at the close of the service and returned to
							his home in Hendricks county, Indiana.</p>

						<p>When Mr. Applebay enlisted in the army his mother was a widow with a large family of
							small children. He was their main support, for they were poor and owned no land. He
							fixed up an old log cabin for them to live in during his absence, but while he was in
							the service the owners of the cabin put the mother and children out of their little
							home. However, she bravely struggled to keep the family together, spinning and weaving
							and making their clothing and doing a man's work as far as was necessary. She was a
							woman of strong character and reared her children to honorable and respected manhood
							and womanhood.</p>

						<p>For the past half century Mr. Applebay and his two sisters have lived in Franklin
							township. None of them has ever married, their affection for each other being such
							that they have always led a very happy existence in their home life together. Here on
							his farm Mr. Applebay has lived the simple, plain and unostentatious life of a farmer,
							doing all that came in <pb id="VAC1000-571" n="530"/> his way in the best possible
							manner. Year in and year out he has taken his part in the community's affairs, has
							been a factor in local politics, although he has never held any office aside from that
							of district central committeeman. He has always been a factor in the church at
							Stilesville. In fraternal affairs he has been a Mason for forty years and is one of
							the best informed men on Masonry in the county. He has passed through all the chairs
							of the lodge from tyler to worshipful master. It is needless to say that he is a loyal
							and enthusiastic member of the Grand Army of the Republic, and the Greencastle Post
							has no more loyal member than Mr. Applebay. He is one of those genial, whole-souled
							men who always meets every one with a smile. It is his habit to always see the silver
							lining of the darkest clouds, and his optimistic nature has made him a general
							favorite with all in the community where he has spent his threescore and ten years. It
							will not be many years before he will answer the last roll call and when his hearty
							voice is no more heard in the streets there will have been gone one friend who figured
							largely in the daily life of this locality. His whole life has been characterized by
							honesty, truthfulness and all those qualities which mark him as a true citizen.</p>

							Each county has its share in the story, and every county can lay claim to some

							chapters or startling incidents, but it is merely the record of a life true to its

						<p>Eli H. Ross, the son of Alexander and Bethiah (Hurain) Ross, was born March 13, 1848,
							on the farm in Washington township where he is now residing. Alexander Ross was born

							his parents to Warren county, Ohio, in 1808. After remaining there a short time, they
							moved to Hendricks county, Indiana, in 1832, where Alexander Ross bought a farm from
							Benjamin Abbott Hurain, who had entered same from the government several years before.
							The wife of Alexander Ross was born August 22, 1809, in Warren county, Ohio, and died
							June 1, 1884. Alexander Ross, who died in 1858, was a farmer and was an earnest member
							of the Methodist Episcopal church. His father, John Ross, was in the War of 1812, and
							his father, Alexander Ross, great-grandfather of the subject, was a soldier in the
							Revolutionary War. John Ross had fourteen grandsons in the Union army during the Civil
							War. He was a resident of Hendricks county and a farmer by vocation.</p>

						<p>Eli Ross received his common school education in the schools of Washington township
							and early in life began to work upon his father's farm. That he was an apt student
							under his father's tutelage is shown by the fact that he is today one of the most

							daughter of Robert and Dorcas Barker, of Hendricks county. Mrs. Ross was born in this
							county November 23, 1852. Mr. and M-rs. Ross are both consistent and faithful members
							of the Wesley Methodist Episcopal church at Avon. Mr. Ross is a member of the

						<p>Whether the elements of success in life are innate attributes of the individual or
							whether they are quickened by a process of circumstantial development, it is
							impossible to clearly determine. Yet the study of a successful life, whatever the
							field of endeavor, is none the less interesting and profitable by reason of the
							existence of this same uncertainty. So much in excess of those of successes are the
							records of failures or semi-failures, that one is constrained to attempt an analysis
							in either case and to determine the measure of causation in an approximate way. But in
							studying the life history of the well known resident and popular citizen of Amo, whose
							name forms the caption of this sketch, we find many qualities in his makeup that
							always gain definite success in any career if properly directed, as his has <pb
								id="VAC1000-573" n="532"/> evidently been done, which has resulted in a life of good
							to others as well as in a comfortable competence to himself.</p>

						<p>John W. Figg, the proper and efficient superintendent of the Plainfield schools, was
							born in Putnam county, Indiana, December 13, 1859. His parents were Robert P. and
							Abigal (Layton) Figg. His father was born in Kentucky in 1837 and came to Indiana with
							his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Francis (Asbury) Figg, in 1848 and settled in Putnam county.
							His mother came from Pennsylvania with her parents to Ohio and later the family
							settled in Putnam county, this state, where she met Robert Figg. When the Civil War
							opened, Robert Figg enlisted, in December, 1861, in the Sixty-second Regiment,
							Illinois Volunteer Infantry, and died in March, 1862, at the age of twenty-four,
							leaving his widow and three small children. John W. Figg, the leading subject of this
							sketch, was only three years of age at the time. The other two children were
							Elizabeth, who died at the age of twenty-two, leaving her husband, Joseph Warren, and
							one son, and Rebecca Olive, who married Myron Stanley. She died at the age of
							twenty-one, leaving one daughter, Elizabeth.</p>

						<p>John W. Figg was reared by his grandfather, Francis Asbury Figg, in Putnam county,
							and was given a good common school education. As a lad he showed promise of future
							ability along educational lines, and his grandfather sent him to the Central Normal
							College at Danville and after that he taught eight years in Putnam county. Then, in
							order to better prepare himself for teaching, he entered the State Normal School at
							Terre Haute in 1895 and graduated in 1901. Later he went back and took post-graduate
							work there. In 1894 he was elected county surveyor of this county, and was re-elected
							in 1896, but resigned in April, 1898, to take additional work in the State Normal
							School. In August, 1898, he was elected county superintendent of schools and served in
							that capacity for three years. In May, 1912, he was selected superintendent of the
							Plainfield schools and has served in that capacity ever since. As a public school
							superintendent he has been a success, having all of those qualities which a successful
							superintendent should have. Under his management the schools have increased their
							enrollment, broadened their curriculum and become an increasingly important factor in
							the life of the community.</p>

						<p>Professor Figg was married in 1883 to Isabell Allee, and after her death, in 1894, he
							married Osie Stuart, on June 3, 1896. Mr. and Mrs. Zeno Stuart, the parents of

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Figg are consistent members of the Methodist Episcopal <pb

							wielded a potent influence in this community, while as a public-spirited citizen he

							for him the sincere regard of all who know him. His mind is rich with the fruits of a

						<p>Improvement and progress may well be said to form the keynote of the character of
							Charles Roark, a well known and influential farmer and present trustee of Washington
							township, and he has not only been interested in the work of advancing his individual
							affairs, but his influence is felt in upbuilding the community. He has been an
							industrious man all his life, striving to keep abreast the times in every respect, and
							as a result every mile post of the years he has passed has found him further advanced,
							more prosperous, and with an increased number of friends.</p>

						<p>Charles Roark, the present trustee of Washington township, was born in 1868 in the
							country where he has always resided. His ancestry is Irish, his grandparents having
							been born in Ireland, and coming to this country early in the nineteenth century. They
							first settled in Pennsylvania and later in Butler county, Ohio, from whence they came
							to Franklin county, Indiana. Caleb and Emily Roark, the parents of Charles, were born
							and married in Franklin county, Indiana, and came to this county shortly after their
							marriage, where they reared a family of four children: Fletcher, who is married and a
							street car motorman in Indianapolis; Jones, who is married and a farmer in Washington
							township, this county; Charles, single, who is at present the trustee of Washington
							township; Mary, who is single, and is now keeping house for her brother Charles on the
							old home place.</p>

						<p>Charles Roark received his education in the district schools of his neighborhood and
							early in life began to work upon his father's farm. For four years he has been farming
							the Roark homestead place and has improved the farm in many places, putting in
							ditches, building fences and improving the outbuildings He is regarded as one of the
							professional farmers of the township and a man of wideawake and progressive ideas. An
							indication <pb id="VAC1000-575" n="534"/> of the esteem and regard with which he is
							held by his fellow citizens is shown by the fact that he was elected trustee of his
							home township, an office which he has been filling to the entire satisfaction of all
							of the citizens of the township, irrespective of party affiliations. He is a member of
							the Knights of Pythias lodge at Plainfield, and also a member of the Salem church in
							his home township. Politically, he is a Democrat. He has hosts of warm friends
							throughout the township and, because of his reputation for honesty and integrity, he
							is esteemed by everyone with whom he is associated. As township trustee he has had
							management of the schools of the township and has been very much interested in
							securing the best teachers possible and keeping the schools up to the highest state of

							been the result of constant effort and unremitting diligence. At the age of nineteen
							he left home and until he was twenty-five years of age worked at odd jobs, most of the
							time doing farm work of some kind. When he was twenty-five years of age he started in
							the huckster business, and for the next thirty-seven years he operated a huckster
							wagon in connection with a store at Friendswood. His personality and general
							reputation for honesty and integrity has always given him the confidence of his fellow
							citizens and he has occupied many public and private positions of honor and trust. He
							was agent for the Vandalia railroad at Friendswood for fourteen years, and has been
							agent for the Terre Haute, Indianapolis &amp; Eastern Traction Company for the past
							five years. He was postmaster for eight years, serving during Cleveland's
							administrations. In fact in everything in which he has engaged he has been signally
							successful, and his every action has denoted the man who inspires confidence because
							of his uprightness and frankness in dealing with his fellow men. He has a general
							store at Friendswood, in which he carries a large and selective stock of up-to-date
							goods such as are found in stores of this kind, and has a very extensive and lucrative
							trade in the town and surrounding country. He also has holdings in real estate in the
							town and county, and is now recognized, after many years of toil, as one of the
							successful men of the community.</p>

						<p>Frederick Beeler was married December 7, 1873, to Ella Jewell, the daughter of Basil
							and Mary (Wier) Jewell. Her father was a farmer of Sullivan county and a lieutenant in
							the Civil War. To Mr. and Mrs. Beeler have been born three children: Arthur, born
							September 11, 1875, who has been married twice, his first wife being Sadie Mull, and
							his second wife Lulu Rush. There was one daughter, Louisa, born to the first marriage.
							Arthur is a contractor in Irvington; Charles J., born November 1, 1876, is now with
							his father in his store at Friendswood. He married Elizabeth Van Cleve; Orpha, born
							April 6, 1879, who married O. K. Osborn, a druggist of Martinsville; they have one
							son, Frederick V. Osborn, who is named after his mother's father.</p>

						<p>Mr. Beeler is a stanch Democrat, and has always been interested in politics, taking
							an active part in both local and state campaigns. He has <pb id="VAC1000-577" n="536"
							/> been well rewarded for his services to the party by being appointed post-master of
							Friendswood under both of Cleveland's administrations, and the service which he
							rendered to his fellow citizens showed that he was well worthy of the position. He is
							a valued member of the Free and Accepted Masons of West Newton, and also of the
							Independent Order of Odd Fellows, Morgan Lodge No. 211, Mooresville. He and his wife
							are members of the Methodist Episcopal church, and have been regular attendants for
							more than thirty years. Mr. Beeler has always been very much interested in church
							affairs and is now a class leader in his church. He is a worthy representative of that
							type of self-made man who have been important factors in every community of our
							commonwealth. During his long and industrious career, he has not only gained the
							confidence of his fellow citizens, but as a man of force of character he has gained
							the respect and admiration of all of those with whom he has come in contact.</p>

						<p>It is with marked satisfaction that the biographer reverts to the life of one who has
							attained success in any vocation requiring definiteness of purpose and determined
							action. Such a life, whether it be one of calm, consecutive endeavor or of sudden
							meteoric accomplishments, must abound in both lesson and incentive and prove a guide
							to young men whose fortunes and destinies are still matters for the future to
							determine. The subject of this sketch is distinctively one of the representative
							agriculturists of Hendricks county. For a number of years he directed his efforts
							toward the goal of success and by patient continuance in well-doing succeeded at last
							in overcoming the many obstacles by which his pathway was beset, and is today
							considered one of the foremost farmers of the county.</p>

						<p>Alpheus Osborn, the son of Charles and Asenath (Hyatt) Osborn, was born in Randolph
							county, North Carolina, November 27, 1841. Charles Osborn received only three months'
							schooling, but from early boyhood was compelled to work early and late upon the farm.
							Upon his father's death he inherited the home farm and continued the operation of this
							tract until his marriage. In the fall of 1850, when Alpheus was only nine years of
							age, the father came to Indiana, settling in Clay township, Hendricks county. He had
							learned the blacksmith's trade in his -native state and had followed this vocation for
							some time, but when he came to Hendricks county he <pb id="VAC1000-578" n="[]"/>

							<pb id="VAC1000-579" n="537"/> discontinued the blacksmithing business and devoted all
							of his attention to his agricultural interests, which he continued to follow until his
							death. He married Asenath Hyatt, the daughter of Cuthbert and Hannah Hyatt, and to
							this union there were born five children: Elizabeth, the wife of Robert B. Reynolds;
							Hannah, who became the wife of John Newman; Cuthbert, who married Minerva Grime, and,
							after her death, wedded Asenath Carter; Martha Sybil, the wife of Jonathan Carter, and
							Alpheus.</p>

						<p>Alpheus Osborn received some education in North Carolina and completed his
							educational training in this county, having come with his parents to Indiana when he
							was nine years of age. He worked on the farm with his father until he was twenty-one
							years of age.</p>

						<p>Mr. Osborn was married to Emily L. Wheeler, the daughter of Alfred and Lydia Wheeler,
							on August 25, 1866, and to this union there were born five children: Allen E., who
							married Ella Phillips, and after her death, Leona Smith, and is the father of one
							child, Dewy H.; Senith E. is the wife of Elmer Wells, and they have two children,
							Ernest and Alpheus; Lydia J. is the wife of Morton Rudd, and they are the parents of
							three children, Albert, Lewis and Cecil: Albert married Blanche Wymer, and has one
							child, Lydia, who first married Roy Cooper and second Marshall Adams, and has one
							child, Leslie by the first marriage, and two children, Mildred and Josephine, by
							second marriage; Cecil married Ruth Gladstone; Mary, the fourth child of Mr. and Mrs.
							Osborn, married Arelius Dilwvorth, and has two children, Elsie and Edith; Elsie
							married Hulbert Keys, and has two children, Herman and Mary; Charles, the youngest
							child of Mr. and Mrs. Osborne, married Helen Daniels.</p>

						<p>The father of Mrs. Osborn was born in Guilford county, North Carolina, where he
							married Lydia May, also a native of that state, and in the fall of 1864 they came to
							this county and located in Clay township, where they reared a family of ten children:
							Mary, the wife of Peyton Cox; Malissa died at the age of twenty-seven; Lula married
							Frank Beard; Alonzo married Matilda Smith: Emma, the wife of Mr. Osborne; Irene,
							deceased; Francis, deceased; Alfred, deceased; Addison, deceased; Corina married first
							John Burk and later John Pate. who is dead. The paternal grandparents had seven
							children: Jesse, who married Lydia Bales; Charles, father of Alpheus Osborne; Samuel
							and Nathan, deceased; Daniel married first Lydia Walker and after her death Lydia
							Anthony and Rachel and Lydia, deceased. The paternal grandparents reared a family of
							nine children: Austin, who married Miss Armfield; Manloe, who married Phoebe Beard;
							William married Ruth <pb id="VAC1000-580" n="538"/> Beard; Elijah married Miranda Fry;
							Alfred, who married Lydia Macy; John, who married Miss Tucker; Mary became the wife of
							Dicks Coffin; Cynthia, the wife of Isaiah Dillon; Kazia, who married William
							Davis.</p>

						<p>Mr. Osborn has been a Republican ever since the founding of the party, having cast
							his first vote for Abraham Lincoln. Although he has been a Republican for a half
							century he has never appealed to his party for an office. He is a member of the
							Friends church and takes an active interest in all of the work of the church. His has
							been a useful life and one which reflects credit upon himself, and through all the
							years in which he has lived in this county his record has been such as to win him a
							place among the representative men of Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>The gentleman to whom the reader's attention is now directed was not favored by
							inherited wealth or the assistance of influential friends, but in spite of these, by
							perseverance, industry and a wise economy, he has attained a comfortable station in
							life, and is well and favorably known throughout Hendricks county as a result of the
							industrious and honorable life he has lived. He is a modern and scientific
							agriculturist, thoroughly up-to-date in all his methods and, while advancing his
							individual interests, he does not neglect his duties as a citizen.</p>

						<p>Alva A. Ross, the son of Joseph and Susan Ross, was born at Avon, Indiana, in
							Hendricks county, May 21, 1857. His parents were born and reared near Cincinnati,
							Ohio, and moved to Avon, Indiana, several years before the War of the Rebellion and
							remained there until Alva A. was about ten years of age, when they moved to the farm
							where Mr. Ross is now living.</p>

						<p>Alva A. Ross received his education in the common schools of Washington townshp and
							started early in life to learn the practical side of farming. That he is well
							acquainted with all of that store of information which the successful farmer must have
							at his fingers' ends, is shown by his well-kept farm of today. While he carries on a
							general system of farming, he has made a specialty of raising black and white Crested
							Black Polish chickens and white Indian Runner ducks. He has not only found this a
							pleasure, but a profit as well, and is now recognized as one of the leading poultry
							fanciers of Indiana. He has won several prizes of silver cups at <pb id="VAC1000-581"
								n="539"/> Indianapolis at poultry shows and in 1911, 1912 and 1913 won the silver
							cup for his Indian Runner clucks at Danville.</p>

						<p>Mr. Ross was married on November 5, 1879, to Emma Swank, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

							subsequently, in 1894, Mr. Ross married Ida Keith, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry
							Keith.</p>

						<p>Fraternally, Mr. Ross is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows at
							Danville, while religiously, he and the members of his family are faithful and
							consistent members of the Regular Baptist church. He was a Republican until 1912, but

						<head><hi rend="center">ELIEL NEWBY.</hi></head>

						<p>Dependent very largely upon his own resources from his early youth, Eliel Newby, of
							Guilford township, has attained no insignificant success, and though he may have, like
							most men of affairs, encountered obstacles and met with reverses, he has pressed
							steadily forward, ever willing to work for the end he had in view. His tenacity and
							fortitude are due, no doubt, in a large measure, to the worthy traits inherited from
							his sterling ancestors, who were among the early pioneers of Hendricks county. The
							first Newbys resided in Hendricks county more than eighty-five years ago, and during
							all of these years the Newbys have been influential in the material and civic
							advancement of their county, and by their high ideals and good principles have ever
							thought to perpetuate the proper views of life.</p>

						<p>Eliel Newby, the son of Harmon and Rebecca (Hyatt) Newby, was born in Guilford
							township, this county, November 5, 1862. Harmon Newby was born in this county on the
							same farm which was pre-empted by his father in this township in the year 1828,
							thereby giving the Newby family <pb id="VAC1000-582" n="540"/> eighty-six years of
							history in this county. Harmon Newby left Hendricks county for Kansas in 1881 and
							lived and died on a farm which he purchased in that state. Mrs. Harmon Newby was born
							in Randolph county, Indiana, and met her husband in Hamilton county, where she moved
							with her parents. Mr. and Mrs. Harmon Newby were parents of five children: William, a
							farmer in the state of Washington, married and has two children; Stephen, a blacksmith
							of Jasonville, who is married and has three children; Jesse, a farmer of Hamilton
							county, who is married and has six children; Eliel, whose history is herein presented;
							Thomas Emory, of Kansas, who is married and has one child. Harmon Newby and his wife
							both died in Kansas in 1899.</p>

						<p>Eliel Newby attended the district schools of Guilford township, and at an early age
							decided that he wished to become a farmer. Until his marriage he worked on his
							father's farm and on the other farms in the immediate neighborhood, with the result
							that when he was married he was already one of the best farmers in his township. In
							this day of specialization it is becoming increasingly customary for farmers to have
							some hobby, and with Mr. Newby it is fruit raising. Some years ago he became
							interested in the culture of small fruits and has now under cultivation several acres
							of his farm in fruits of various kinds, and has found it a very lucrative addition to
							his regular income from his farm. He owns ten acres of land, of which five are in
							orchard.</p>

						<p>Mr. Newby was married February 19, 1889, to Mary A. Zimmerman, of Washington
							township, the daughter of Joel and Elizabeth (Cole) Zimmerman. Mrs. Newby's father was
							a wagon builder by trade and reared a family of seven children. Mr. and Mrs. Zimmerman
							are both dead. He died on December 25, 1904, and she on April 15, 1902. There have
							been five children born to Mr. and Mrs. Newby: Jessie Mae, born April 10, 1890, who is
							the wife of Charles A. Johnson, of Indianapolis; Florence E., born April 30, 1892, who
							is still at home; Horace E., born November 18, 1894; Fred E., born April 18, 1896;
							Lester J., born May 9, 1901. The members of the Newby family are adherents of the
							Friends church. Mr. Newby has achieved success, because he has given attention along
							right channels and has been an advocate of honest living and dealing with his fellow
							men. Though never animated with great ambition for public honor, he has ever lent his
							aid in serving the general interests of his locality, and is well fortified in his
							convictions, being at all times public spirited in his attitude towards all things for
							the benefit of the locality in which he lives. Politically, he supports the Republican
							party, while, religiously, he is a birthright member of the Friends church.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">THOMAS BRITTON KINNAN.</hi></head>

						<p>The following is a sketch of a plain, honest man of affairs, who, by correct methods
							and a strict regard for the interests of his fellow men, was for many years one of the
							prominent residents of Hendricks county. As postmaster of one of the important towns
							of the county and as recorder of Hendricks county, he won for himself distinctive
							prestige in the history of the locality. He would be the last man to sit for romance
							or become the subject of a fancy sketch, but nevertheless his life presents much that
							is interesting and valuable, and may be studied with profit by the young, whose
							careers are yet to be achieved. He is one of those whose integrity and strength of
							character have forced themselves to the front and as a result he has commanded the
							respect of all those citizens of his county who have known him so many years.</p>

						<p>Thomas Britton Kinnan was born near Vernon, Jennings county, Indiana, April 27, 1846.
							He is one of nine children born to Thomas and Katherine Ellen Kinnan. His father was a
							native of New Jersey and his mother of Maryland. They first settled in Jennings
							county, Indiana, about 1845. He went to Iowa in 1852, from Wayne county, Indiana, and
							died in 1852. The mother died in Marion county, Indiana, in 1885.</p>

						<p>Thomas B. Kinnan was educated in the common schools of Marion and Hendricks counties
							and when a young man came to Plainfield, Hendricks county. Here he was married March
							2, 1869, to Mary Barker Conarroe, and to this union have been born two children, Harry
							Joel and Daisy Britton. Harry J. was born June 23, 1871, and was married on May 30,
							1908, to Rose Althea Myers, and lived at St. Paul, Minnesota, where he was a seedsman
							until he removed to Indianapolis, Indiana. The daughter, Daisy Britton, was born July
							8, 1881, and was for many years a teacher in the public schools. She was married on
							January 17, 1907, to Robert Clark Coffy, of Indianapolis, and has one daughter,
							Katherine, who was born May 22, 1910. Mr. and Mrs. Coffy are now living in Tacoma,
							Washington.</p>

						<p>Mr. Kinnan was appointed postmaster at Plainfield by President Arthur in 1883, and
							served until the incoming Democratic administration of Cleveland. In 1886 he was
							elected recorder of Hendricks county on the Republican ticket and served in that
							office for four years. His son, Harry J., was chief deputy under his father during his
							full term of office. As postmaster and as recorder Mr. Kinnan was an efficient
							official and administered the duties of his important offices with judgment and
							ability. Mr. Kinnan lived <pb id="VAC1000-584" n="542"/> in Hendricks county until
							1904, when he moved to Indianapolis, and in the fall of 1910 removed to Guilford
							township, where he bought six and one-half acres of land.</p>

						<p>Mr. Kinnan is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons, the Independent Order of Odd
							Fellows, the Knights of Pythias and the Grand Army of the Republic. He and his wife
							are members of the Christian church, of which they are faithful and loyal supporters.
							Mr. Kinnan has led a busy and useful life, and as a public official and as a private
							citizen he has lived such a life as to merit the esteem in which he is held by his
							fellow citizens. He enlisted on August 10, 1862, in Company C, Seventieth Indiana
							Volunteer Infantry, under General Harrison, for eight months and re-enlisted in
							Company I, Sixty-third Indiana Volunteer Infantry. He was discharged April 10, 1866,
							and is a member of the Grand Army of the Republic at Danville, Indiana.</p>

						<p>In his special line of effort, probably no man in central Indiana has achieved a more
							phenomenal success or a larger record than Horace Reeve, who is not only a farmer of
							large importance, but is also a dairyman of high reputation. For a quarter of a
							century he has given his particular attention to the dairy business and because of the
							eminent success which he has achieved he has gained a reputation which extends far
							beyond the borders of his own locality. Sound judgment, wise discrimination and good
							common sense have so entered into his make-up as to enable him to carry on his
							business along lines that have insured his success. Because of his splendid record and
							his high personal qualities, he is eminently deserving of representation in the annals
							of his county.</p>

						<p>Horace Reeve, the youngest of six children of Charles and Malinda (Jessup) Reeve, was
							born in Guilford township, this county, November 7, 1853. The other five children of
							the family were: Jonathan F., deceased; John J.; Sarah; Hadley, deceased, and Mary.
							Charles Reeve was born in New Jersey in 1816 and came with his parents to this county
							in his youth. His parents first settled in Marion county, near Indianapolis. Charles
							Reeve was a man of more than ordinary ability and before he reached his majority he
							was engaged by the local authorities to teach school in his own township, <pb
								id="VAC1000-585" n="543"/> and for the next three years he followed this profession
							and was still teaching when he was married. His wife was the daughter of John and Ruth
							Jessup, of Guilford township; she died at the age of forty-two. Charles Reeve lived on
							the farm on which he moved in 1858, until his death, in 1897.</p>

						<p>Horace Reeve received a good education at home at the hands of his worthy father and
							in the subscription schools, which were conducted in his neighborhood. After
							completing his common school education he worked for his father on the home farm.</p>

						<p>Mr. Reeve was married February 4, 1881, to Flora E. Allen, and to this union was born
							four children: Alice M., deceased at the age of nine; Wendell A., born September 26,
							1884, a graduate of Earlham College and now with the Utah Copper Mining Company at
							Bingham, Utah; J. Evelyn, of Indianapolis, who married Lawrence H. Barrett, a member
							of the Evans Milling Company, has two children, John R. and Barbara; Wilma, born in
							1890 and a graduate of Earlham College. The first wife of Mr. Reeve died April 1,
							1898, and on May 28, 1900, he was married to Olma Hadley, the daughter of Atlas and
							Elizabeth Hadley. His second wife died July 11, 1905.</p>

						<p>Mr. Reeve has been a life-long supporter of the Republican party, but has never been
							active in politics. His interests for the past twenty years have been centered in his
							dairy, and he has at the present time one of the most expensive and successful dairies
							conducted by any farmer in central Indiana. The state board of inspection has
							complimented him upon the arrangement and equipment of his dairy and upon the sanitary
							manner in which it is managed. Mr. Reeve takes an interest in every department of
							public life which affects his fellow citizens and the general advancement of the
							community and has been an efficient influence in its progress and achievement. He is a
							faithful member of the Friends church, as are the other members of his family and
							takes a deep interest in the spiritual work of the church. His career has been a
							consistent and honorable one throughout. Because of his integrity and accomplishment,
							he is entitled to the sincere confidence and good will of all who know him. He and his
							good wife have raised a family which is an honor and credit to them, and in these
							children may be seen the influences which have molded their characters and made them
							the valuable members of society which they are today. The family residence is one of
							the most charming homes in the community, being substantially built of brick and
							surrounded by a spacious and well-kept lawn and beautiful forest trees.</p>

						<p>Among the enterprising and progressive citizens of Hendricks county none stands

							this county and the years of his residence here have but served to strengthen the
							feeling of admiration on the part of his fellow men owing to the honorable life he has
							led and the worthy example he has set to the younger generation, consequently the
							publishers of this biographical compendium are glad to give such a worthy character
							representation in this work.</p>

						<p>Solomon D. Edwards, the son of John and Beulah (Perkins) Edwards, was born in Clay
							township, Hendricks county, Indiana, on August 27, 1847. His father was a native of
							North Carolina and came to Indiana in 1833, settling near Coatesville, in this county,
							and here he met his wife and after their marriage he entered some government land,
							which he cleared and improved upon until about 1861, at which time he purchased a farm
							of one hundred and forty acres near Plainfield, which he sold after a few years and
							went to Oregon. There he settled near Newberg and divided some of the land adjoining
							that town into town lots and sold them. He remained in Newberg, Oregon, until his
							death, becoming one of the substantial citizens of that town. To John and Beulah
							(Perkins) Edwards were born seven children: Asa, who married Lavina Kenworthy; John,
							who married Lucinda Hodson; Nathaniel; Abagail, wife of Henry Ballinger; Lorriane,
							wife of Fred Downing; Nancy, wife of Levi Crews, and Solomon D.</p>

						<p>Solomon D. Edwards attended school in the district schools of his home township and
							after leaving school he worked on his uncle's farm until the latter's death. On
							January 4, 1866, he married Mary Hornaday, who was born February 4, 1847, the daughter
							of Daniel and Delilah (Farmer) Hornaday, and to this union were born six children:
							Minnie B., the wife of W. O. Brown, is the mother of four children, Harold, Harley,
							Hildred and Hallie; Roscoe, who married Bertha Kendall and has three children,
							Christian, Kenneth and Bernard R.; Charles E., who married Ida Job, and they have two

							wife of L. Marten. Mrs. Edwards died on April 13, 1914.</p>

						<p>Mr. Edwards is allied with the new Progressive party, believing that in the
							principles advocated by it will be found a solution of most of the great political
							questions before the American people today. Fraternally, he is a member of the Knights
							of Pythias, while in his religious faith he holds to the Friends church, and is
							interested in the efforts of his church to better the condition of the community in
							which he lives. Mrs. Edwards was a member of the Methodist Episcopal church. Mr.
							Edwards has lived nearly three-score and ten years in this county, and during all of
							that time his influence has ever been on the right side of all civic and moral
							questions pertaining to the welfare of the community. For this reason he is rightly
							regarded as one of the representative men of Hendricks county, and is well worthy a
							mention in this biographical volume.</p>

						<p>From an obituary published at the time of Mrs. Edwards' death, the following
							beautiful words are quoted: <q><p>"No mother could have been more kind and loving; her
									thoughts were always for others and self was forgotten; always ready to lend a
									helping hand to those in need. She had been looking forward to the time when
									life's work would be over and expressed herself as waiting for the summons and
									that the change would be a happy one. When alone much of her time was spent in
									singing the sweet songs of Zion and talking to Jesus.</p>
								<p>"She wanted her flowers while here that she might enjoy them, and this desire was
									realized by the kind and affectionate devotion of her dear ones.</p>
								<p>"She leaves a husband, six children and thirteen grandchildren, one sister and
									many friends who will sadly miss her. The family circle is broken, mother has
									passed into the beyond, and her voice no more you will hear; her memory will ever

						<p>Prominent in the affairs of Hendricks county and distinguished as a citizen whose
							influence is far extended beyond the limits of the community honored by his residence,
							the name of Henry D. Barlow stands out a conspicuous figure among farmers of the
							locality of which this volume treats. All of his undertakings have been actuated by
							noble motives and high resolves and characterized by breadth of wisdom and strong
							individuality and his success and achievements but represent the result of fit
							utilization of innate talent in directing effort along those lines where mature
							judgment and rare discrimination lead the way.</p>

						<p>Henry D. Barlow, the son of James M. and Sarah E. Barlow, was born September 9, 1874,
							in Brown township, this county. His father was born September 13, 1845, in Washington
							township, Hendricks county, Indiana, the son of Harvey R. and Sarah E. (Smith) Barlow.
							Harvey Barlow and wife were the parents of eight children: Hannah Jane, deceased;
							James M., whose sketch is presented elsewhere in this volume; Ruth Ann Osborn; Mrs.
							Myra Alice Medsker, deceased; Harrison S.; Harvey M., and two who died in infancy. The
							great-grandfather of Henry D. Barlow was Enoch Barlow, whose father was a
							Revolutionary soldier. Enoch Barlow came to Indiana in 1828, settling near Brownsburg,
							in this county, where he spent the remainder <pb id="VAC1000-590" n="547"/> of his
							life, dying there November, 1837, his widow surviving him some years, her death
							occurring in June, 1856.</p>

						<p>Henry D. Barlow was accorded such education as was given in the district schools of
							his township, and at an early age began to work upon his father's farm. He has lived
							on the place where he is now residing since he was ten years of age. He has improved
							his farm and stocked it with modern farming implements and all the necessary
							accessories for successful farming, and as a tiller of the soil he has been one of the
							most successful and progressive of his township. He combines the raising of grain with
							the buying and selling of live stock and thereby, by the use of good judgment, he has
							been more than ordinarily successful.</p>

						<p>Mr. Barlow was married September 9, 1896, to Minnie M. Douglass, daughter of John H.
							and Mary S. Douglass, of Guilford township, this county. She was born November 17,
							1876, in Plainfield, and was educated in the common schools and academy of that place.
							Mr. and Mrs. Barlow are the parents of six children: Josephine Barlow, born May 11,
							1897, died August 18, 1899; Milton Paul, born April 16, 1901, and now a pupil in the
							Plainfield schools; Helen, born April 18, 1905; Marjorie, born October 13, 1907, died
							July 23, 1909; Mary Elizabeth, born June 19, 1911; Frank Phillips Barlow, born May 21,
							1914. Mr. and Mrs. Barlow are very proud of their children and are giving them every
							educational advantage in order to equip them for useful careers in their later
							life.</p>

						<p>Mr. Barlow is a member of the Independent .Order of Odd Fellows, both subordinate and
							encampment, and also of the Knights of Pythias, both lodges being at Plainfield. Mr.
							Barlow is a man whom to know is to admire, for he has led a most exemplary life and
							has sought to do his whole duty in all relations with his fellow men. He is a man of
							honor, public spirit, charitable impulses and unswerving integrity and enterprise, and
							is consequently deserving of mention in a history of his county.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">WILLIAM ALLEN MILLS.</hi></head>

						<p>Fealty to facts in the analyzation of the character of a citizen of the type of
							William Allen Mills, a well-known and successful resident of Guilford township, is all
							that is required to make a biographical sketch interesting to those who have at heart
							the good name of the community honored by his residence, because it is the honorable
							reputation of the man of standing <pb id="VAC1000-591" n="548"/> and affairs, more
							than any other consideration, that gives character and stability to the body politic.
							While advancing his individual interests, he has never lost sight of his obligations
							to the community in general, where for many years he has held a high place in popular
							confidence and esteem.</p>

						<p>The state of Ohio has often boasted that it has furnished some of the best citizens
							of every state west of it, and the history of Hendricks county shows that many of the
							best citizens of this county were born in the good old Buckeye state. William Allen
							Mills, the son of James and Ruth (Walton) Mills, was born in Ohio on September 20,
							1849. James Mills was born in 1818 in Ohio and died in this county July 31, 1903. His
							wife was born in Ohio in 1826 and died April 30, 1901, in this county. A few years
							after James Mills was married he and his family came to Hendricks county and settled
							in Washington township on one hundred and sixty acres of land, which is now the home
							of Edward Mills, the brother of William Allen.</p>

						<p>William Allen Mills received his early education in Richmond, Indiana, and early in
							life showed an aptitude for books. Before reaching his majority, he started to teach
							school and for three years followed this noble profession. In the meantime he attended
							Earlham College at Richmond, in order to better prepare himself for teaching. However,
							upon his marriage, in 1874, he decided to leave the school room and engage in farming
							and in 1875 he moved on to the farm where he now lives. The experience gained in the
							school room has not been amiss upon the farm, and the same perseverance and attention
							to details which made him a successful teacher has brought a full share of success to
							him in his agricultural pursuits.</p>

						<p>Mr. Mills was married October 28, 1874, to Eliza Candace Spray, the daughter of J. W.
							and A. W. Spray. Mr. Spray died in 1902, and his widow is still living, aged
							eighty-seven years, and now makes her home with Mr. and Mrs. Mills. Five children have
							been born to Mr. and Mrs. Mills: Walton, of Indianapolis, who is married and has one
							daughter; Abbie, of Indianapolis, who married Ernest Hawkins, a nurseryman, and has
							three children, Clarence, Mary and Catherine E.; Clarence, deceased; Maurice, a
							nurseryman of Indianapolis; James, who will graduate from a veterinary college,
							Indianapolis, in 1914; John, who was born in 1894 and attended the Plainfield Academy.
							He intends to follow the occupation of his father.</p>

						<p>Mr. Mills gives his support to the Republican party and takes an interest in the
							political issues of the day, although he has never been a candidate for any political
							office. He and the members of his family are adherents of the Center Friends church,
							Marion county. He lends his support to <pb id="VAC1000-592" n="549"/> all public
							enterprises which are for the public welfare of his community and is known as a
							public-spirited man whose influence is always on the right side of every public
							question. During his long residence in this township he has always been regarded as a
							man of upright principles, kind-hearted to those in need. Few in this community are
							better or more favorably known than he.</p>

						<p>The history of the loyal sons and representative citizens of Hendricks county would
							not be complete should the name that heads this review be omitted. When the fierce
							fire of rebellion was raging throughout the Southland, threatening to destroy the
							Union, he responded with patriotic fervor to the call for volunteers and in some of
							the bloodiest battles for which that great war was noted proved his loyalty to the
							government he loved so well. During a useful life in the region where he lives he has
							labored diligently to promote the interests of the people, working earnestly and with
							little regard for his personal advancement or ease. He has been devoted to the public
							welfare and in all of his relations his highest ambitions have been to benefit the
							community and advance its standard of citizenship.</p>

						<p>John Tucker, a worthy farmer and gallant veteran of the Civil War and son of a
							Civil-war veteran, was born January 16, 1845, in Guilford township, this county. His
							parents were Thornton and Margaret (Bryant) Tucker, the father being a native of
							Virginia and his mother of Kentucky. Thornton Tucker came to this county from Virginia
							with his sister when he was fourteen years of age and lived here the remainder of his
							life. After his marriage he located on a farm which he purchased from John Pritchett.
							Upon the outbreak of the Civil War Thornton Tucker was forty-four years of age, his
							two oldest sons, William and John, were less than twenty, but before the close of the
							war the father and two sons enlisted in the service. The father enlisted in Company D,
							Twenty-ninth Regiment, Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and was discharged June 28, 1865.
							He died in October of the same year from disease which he contracted in the army. John
							enlisted February 28, 1863, in the Second Indiana Battery of Field Artillery, and was
							discharged July 3, 1865. He was with Banks in the Red River campaign in the Southwest
							and in all of the campaigns of the West during the last two years of the war, being
							also at the battle of Nashville. Mr. and Mrs. Thornton Tucker were the parents of ten
							children: William; John, <pb id="VAC1000-593" n="550"/> whose history is briefly
							reviewed in this article; Mary A., deceased; George, deceased; Harriett E., deceased;
							Louisa J., deceased; Milo A.; Florence E.; Clara D., deceased; Hiram D., who died in
							infancy.</p>

						<p>The mother of these children died December 30, 1895. Immediately after the close of
							the war John Tucker returned to his home county and started in life as a farmer, and
							has continued at that occupation all his life. He was married August 25, 1869, to
							Margaret J. Almond, the daughter of James and Emily (Wier) Almond. Mr. Almond was a
							farmer in Guilford township and he and his wife reared a large family of ten children.
							Mr. and Mrs. John Tucker have long been faithful members of the Christian church and
							to that denomination they render generous support in all its activities. He has been a
							life-long Republican and is interested in the various political features of the day.
							He keeps well informed on important questions of the hour and is able to give reasons
							for his views on the various questions which are today confronting the American
							people. Because of his sterling work, uncompromising integrity, courteous manners and
							congenial disposition, he has won and retained the warm regard of all with whom he
							associates.</p>

						<p>The true measure of individual success is determined by what one has accomplished. An
							enumeration of those men of a past generation who were successful in their life work
							and at the same time left the impress of their strong personalities upon the
							community, men who won honor and recognition for themselves, and at the same time
							conferred honor on the locality in which they resided, would be incomplete were there
							failure to make specific mention of the gentleman whose name initiates this paragraph,
							for, although Erasmus D. Thomas is now sleeping the sleep of the just, his influence
							still pervades the lives of those who were so fortunate as to enjoy his acquaintance
							and his name is deeply engraved on the pages of Hendricks county's history. His life
							was a busy one, for he never allowed anything to interfere with his Christian
							obligations or the faithful performance of his church duties, so that his entire
							religious life was a steady effort for the worth of Christian doctrine, the purity and
							grandeur of Christian principles and the beauty and elevation of Christian character.
							Pure, constant and noble was the spiritual flame that burned in and illumined the
							mortal tenement of the subject of this memoir, and the superficial observer can have
							but small appreciation of his <pb id="VAC1000-594" n="551"/> intrinsic spirituality.
							His faith was fortified by the deepest study, and the Christian verities were with him
							the matters of most concern among the changes and chances of this mortal life.</p>

						<p>Erasmus D. Thomas, one of the grand old men of Hendricks county, was born in Fayette
							county, Indiana, November 13, 1821, and died near Danville, Indiana, June 16, 1907. He
							was the son of David S. and Phoebe (Cole) Thomas, both natives of New York, where they
							were reared and married. They came to Indiana shortly after their marriage, settling
							in Fayette county, where they entered land from the government before Indiana was
							admitted to the Union in 1816.</p>

						<p>Erasmus D. Thomas secured a very limited education in the schools of Fayette county,
							and when a young man resided a short time in Tipton county. He helped lay out the town
							of Tipton while that county was a wilderness, and was one of its first town officers,
							in pioneer times. He moved from there to Hancock county, then settled near Acton for a
							short time. In 1864 he moved to Hendricks county, and lived on a farm northwest of
							Danville in Center township. His whole life was spent in the service of God and man,
							either as a minister of the Gospel or as a teacher of the youth. For more than fifty
							years he was in the active service of teaching the glad tidings of salvation. Before
							entering the ministry he was engaged in teaching in the public schools for a time.
							Forty-four years of his ministry were in Danville, where he had charge of the Baptist
							church. The good that such a man can do is incalculable. He preached in a period when
							ministers were very poorly paid indeed, and when it was thought that they should live
							even as did the disciples of Biblical times.</p>

						<p>Rev. E. D. Thomas was twice married, his first wife being Mary G. Thompson, of
							Fayette county. To this first marriage there were born eight children, all of whom are
							living: John, of Winnepeg, Canada; Mrs. Phoebe E. Morgason, of Bedford, Iowa; Charles,
							of Enterprise, Oregon; Lewis E., of Ashley, Ohio; Mrs. Hattie Tinder, of Fairchild,
							Washington; William W., living between North Salem and Montclair; Albert M., of Marion
							county, Indiana; Erasmus W., pastor of the Baptist church in Danville, who succeeded
							his father as pastor of this church; Edward D., of Seattle, Washington, and Marshall,
							of Cordelle, Georgia. His first wife died in 1870, and, in 1871, Mr. Thomas was
							married to Mrs. Mary E. (Rosborough) Holcombe, of Gibson county, Indiana, and she is
							still living with her daughter in Indianapolis. She was a daughter of James and Sarah
							(Waters) Rosborough, a highly respected family of Gibson county in this state. To this
							second marriage were born six children: Dr. Harvey C., of Indianapolis; <pb
								id="VAC1000-595" n="552"/> Joseph, who died in infancy; Frank W., of Sacramento,
							California; Mary T., the wife of Dr. A. C. Pebworth, of Indianapolis; Raymond D., of
							Indianapolis; Mrs. Nellie Mitchell, with whom the mother makes her home in
							Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>The life of the late Rev. E. D. Thomas was indeed a busy one, and during more than
							three score years he served his God and his fellow men faithfully in the pulpit and in
							the school room. Always calm and straightforward, when he believed he was on the right
							path nothing could swerve him from it, and to him home life was a sacred trust, and
							his greatest enjoyment was in his children and his children's children. His life was a
							blessing and a benediction to the community in which he spent so many of his years,
							and his memory will long be revered by his many friends and acquaintances.</p>

						<p>The career of William C. Osborne, the president of the First National Bank, of
							Danville, presents many interesting incidents, but in this brief record it will not be
							profitable to go into his life in detail. Prominently identified with banking
							interests of Danville and Hendricks county for twenty years, he has made his influence
							felt in the financial circles of his community during that time. His father and
							grandfather were identified with the First National Bank of Danville early in its
							history, and some member of the family has been connected with this institution for
							the past half century. In the course of the half century which has elapsed since this
							bank was established Danville has grown from a mere village to a prosperous little
							city, with well paved streets and beautiful residences. During all of these years the
							bank has constantly enjoyed the fullest measure of public confidence, passing through
							every period of general financial stringency with stability unshaken and credit
							unimpaired. The bank conducts all the departments of commercial banking, making loans,
							discounts, the buying and selling of government bonds and exchange, issuing foreign
							drafts, letters of credit and making commercial loans. The safe deposit vaults are
							equipped in the most approved and modern manner and afford excellent facilities of the
							safe keeping of papers and valuables.</p>

						<p>William C. Osborne, the son of Edmund and Martha (Cook) Osborne, was born January 16,
							1865, on a farm near Kokomo, in Howard county, Indiana. His father was a native of
							Orange county, this state, but came to <pb id="VAC1000-596" n="[]"/>

							<pb id="VAC1000-597" n="553"/> Hendricks county when a young lad with his parents and
							lived here until after his marriage, when he moved to Howard county, where he followed
							the occupation of a farmer for many years, and late in life moved to Hendricks county,
							where his death occurred. Edmund Osborne and wife were the parents of five children:
							John H., deceased; William C.; Rosaltha; Lindley M., and Emma, deceased.</p>

						<p>William C. Osborne received his education in the common schools of Howard and
							Hendricks counties, this state, and then entered the Westtown Schools, near
							Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a school under the management of the Friends church. After
							leaving school he began teaching and for several years followed this profession,
							during which time he taught in several states in the Union. He incidentally carried on
							farming to some extent while teaching. In 1895 he permanently located in Danville and
							became associated with the First National Bank as bookkeeper. He rapidly acquired the
							rudiments of banking and in the course of ten years has risen from the position of
							bookkeeper to that of the presidency of the bank. He was made cashier in 1899, and in
							1909 was elected president, which position he still holds. Mr. Osborne is an able and
							far-seeing financier, being progressive and conservative and has had for officers men
							of the highest integrity and business ability. The policy of the bank is conservative
							and its business is largely confined to commercial banking, a very large percentage of
							its deposits being individual and mercantile deposits with sufficient bank deposits to
							furnish an excellent par list for all of its customers.</p>

						<p>Mr. Osborne was married October 24, 1900, to Christine Rogers, daughter of Jonathan
							and Anne (Valentine) Rogers, natives of Wayne county, Indiana, but living in Georgia
							at the time of the marriage of their daughter. Mr. and Mrs. Osborne are the parents of
							five children, Anne Martha, Florence, Elizabeth, Miriam E. and Edmund R., all of whom
							are still at home with their parents.</p>

						<p>Mr. Osborne takes an active interest in everything pertaining to the civic, moral,
							intellectual and commercial welfare of his county, city and community. A Republican in
							politics, Mr. Osborne has always taken an active interest in political affairs, but
							has never felt that he could spare the time from his banking interests to take an
							active part in political campaigns. He is a member of the board of trustees of the
							Central Normal College of Danville, an educational institution which has the name of
							doing good work in its chosen field. He is also president of the board of trustees of
							Earlham College Endowment Fund. He was president and one of the organizers of the
							Indianapolis, Danville &amp; Western electric line, the company which built the
							present road <pb id="VAC1000-598" n="554"/> between Danville and Indianapolis, and
							much of the success of that early company was due to his untiring efforts.
							Fraternally, he is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, while he and all
							of his family are earnest members of the Friends church, to which they contribute
							generously of their time and substance. Mr. Osborne is a man of good business
							abilities, sterling integrity and fine personal address, and the history of his county
							would not be complete without a record of his achievements.</p>

						<p>When such men as Joel Newlin die, not only the public heart is filled with sadness
							and abiding sense of loss, but there is within the sanctuary of his own household a
							depth of sorrow that cannot be fathomed, for with all his business ability and public
							usefulness, it was perhaps in his domestic life and social relations that Mr. Newlin
							appeared to the best advantage. According to those who knew him best, no one ever
							heard a whisper against his integrity. He was a temperate, well-controlled man and the
							idol of his family; he was of a genial, social nature, full, at times, of a quaint,
							homely, simple humor, that had about it the freshness of childhood; he loved his
							children and young folks in general, and many a young man was helped and encouraged by
							him in starting out in life. He was a very agreeable companion, manifesting a desire
							to please those with whom he came in daily contact and he left to his friends, as his
							choicest legacy, the remembrance of a character without a stain.</p>

						<p>Joel Newlin, one of the best loved men of Hendricks county, was born August 26, 1824,
							in Clinton county, Ohio, and died in Guilford township, Hendricks county, Indiana,
							January 21, 1913. His parents were John and Esther (Stubs) Newlin, he being one of
							twelve children, all of whom are now deceased. John Newlin came from North Carolina
							and settled in Ohio, where he lived his whole life. After the death of John Newlin in
							Ohio, his widow and the family came to Hendricks county, settling in Guilford township
							March 31, 1834. In the fall of 1835 the widow of John Newlin bought the farm where the
							family have since lived.</p>

						<p>Joel Newlin, thus early bereft of a father's love and care, helped to assume the
							responsibility of caring for the family, and the strength of character which was thus
							developed proved of very much assistance to him in his later life. He received only a
							meagre education and upon reaching <pb id="VAC1000-599" n="555"/> young manhood he was
							married, on August 13, 1846, to Mary Osborn, and to this union were born six children,
							Anna, Addison, Elias, David, Martha and Calvin.</p>

						<p>Calvin Newlin, the youngest of the six children born to his parents, was born on
							February 5, 1863. He was reared on the homestead farm and received his education in
							the schools of his township. He was married on August 13, 1885, to Lenora Haworth, the
							daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Richard M. Haworth, of Clinton county, Ohio. Mr. and Mrs.
							Calvin Newlin are the parents of six children: Bertha, born in October, 1886; Ada M.,
							born May 7, 1890; William McKinley, born February 7, 1892; Edna, born May 15, 1895;
							Grace, born March 29, 1897; Evelyn, born December 23, 1904. Calvin Newlin. as well as
							all the members of his family, is a member of the Friends church, and to which they
							give freely of their means. Mr. Newlin has always farmed on the old home place on
							which his father lived for seventy-eight years. The subject carries on general farming
							on one hundred and fifty-seven acres of land. He never aspired for office and votes
							the Republican ticket. His father was an old-line Whig and later a Republican.</p>

						<p>Success in what are properly termed the learned professions is a legitimate result of
							merit and painstaking endeavor. In commercial lines one may come into possession of a
							lucrative business through inheritance or gift, but professional advancement is gained
							only by critical study and consecutive research. It has only been within the last few
							years that special attention has been paid to the diseases of live stock, but now
							there are scores of colleges which have special chairs devoted to diseases of horses,
							cattle, swine, etc. In large cities there are men who do nothing else but minister to
							canine ills, and feline doctors who cater only to the special diseases of cats. Dr.
							Emmett T. Davis has the honor of occupying the first chair in any veterinary college
							in the United States on diseases of swine. The study of equine diseases has only
							recently been reduced to a scientific standard and gradually scientists are
							classifyying and describing the treatment for diseases of domestic animals of all
							kinds. There is no greater preventive of disease which has a wider use today than the
							serum which is being manufactured by Dr. Davis &amp; Son for the prevention of hog
							cholera. This remedy has proven of inestimable value to the farmers of the United
							States.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-600" n="556"/>

						<p>Dr. Emmett T. Davis was born in 1868 in Belleville, Indiana. His parents were David
							W. and Amanda (Newby) Davis. The father of David Davis was born in North Carolina and
							came to Indiana territory before 1816, and as soon as the United States government
							acquired what is known as the New Purchase in central Indiana he entered one thousand
							acres of land in what is now known as Hendricks county. David W. Davis and wife were
							the parents of four children: Alva Eugene, Arthur M., Emmett T. and Evon B. David
							Davis, who was born in Hendricks county, and here followed farming, is now living near
							the gulf coast in Alabama.</p>

						<p>Doctor Davis received his elementary education in the common schools of his county
							and early in life became interested in the diseases of animals, particularly the
							diseases of horses and hogs, and has made it his life work, specializing upon the
							diseases of swine. For many years he was the leading practitioner in his line in
							central Indiana and when the Indiana Veterinary College was established, at
							Indianapolis, the chairs of swine diseases and diseases of cattle and their treatment
							was created for his occupancy. A serum, which he has produced after many years of
							experimenting, for the prevention of hog cholera, has made his name known throughout
							the United States by men who are interested in the raising of swine. He has associated
							with him in his practice his sons, Dr. LaRue and Roger. However, he devotes a great
							deal of time as an instructor in the veterinary college at Indianapolis and to the
							manufacture of the hog cholera serum. He has a well-equipped hospital where the best
							of care is given to hogs, cattle, horses and other animals.</p>

						<p>Doctor Davis was married August 18, 1889, to Clarice Deacon, the daughter of John and
							Catherine (Larue) Deacon. His wife was born January 3, 1869, in Shelby county,
							Indiana. She came to this county with her parents when she was a small child. Mr. and
							Mrs. Davis have two children. Larue, who is following in the footsteps of his father
							and is already recognized as an expert in the diseases of animals, was born January
							13, 1890, and was married on October 28, 1911, to Hortense Reeder, who died ten months
							later. Roger, the second son of Doctor and Mrs. Davis, is studying in the Indiana
							Veterinary College, and will join the firm of Emmett T. Davis &amp; Son upon his
							graduation.</p>

						<p>Politically, Doctor Davis is a Progressive; fraternally, is a Mason, Odd Fellow and

							and Anna (Buchannon) Lawler, the latter being a native of the Blue Grass state and the
							daughter of Levi Buchannon. Mr. Lawler has the distinction of having lived on the same
							farm all his life with the exception of four years, two of which were passed in
							another portion of the same township.</p>

						<p>On December 28, 1876, James M. Lawler was united in marriage with Mary E. Wilson,
							daughter of Jones and Telitha (Lumpkins) Wilson, of Boone county. The Lumpkin family
							originally came from Putnam county, this state, and after taking up their residence in
							Boone county became acquainted with the family of Wilson, Jones Wilson having passed
							the greater portion of his life in that county. To Mr. and Mrs. Lawler have been born
							three children, the eldest of the family being Charles O., whose wife was Ethel
							McDaniel, daughter of Jonathan and Mary (Gossett) McDaniel, citizens of Brown
							township, Hendricks county. Charles O. Lawler resides in Indianapolis and is the
							father of two children, Esther and Mildred. Stella M., Mr. Lawler's oldest daughter,
							became the wife of Homer Smith, of Boone county, son of Anderson and Mary (Layton)
							Smith. Their home is in Brown township, just west of that of the subject, and they
							also have two children, Irene and Hazel Ruth. The third child of the subject is Dora
							A., who remains at home with her parents.</p>

						<p>Mr. Lawler has devoted the energies of his life to the conduct of his business as an
							agriculturist and to the keeping and protecting of his home, being a man of decided
							domestic traits. His farm is generally conceded to be <pb id="VAC1000-602" n="558"/>
							one of the very best farms in the township and to this praise he is certainly
							entitled, being one of the most energetic men of his community. Quiet and unassuming
							in his relations with his fellow men, he nevertheless, by reason of his sterling worth
							and excellent qualities of head and heart, has won an enviable place in the respect of
							his fellow citizens and is, therefore, eminently entitled to representation in a work
							of the scope intended in the present one.</p>

						<p>Among the men of Hendricks county who have served their county with distinction as
							private citizens and public officials is John Q. A. Mattern, a prominent farmer and
							stock raiser of Guilford township. There are certain characteristics which are found
							in men who are destined to act as leaders in their communities, and among these are
							perseverance, honesty and sincerity of purpose. These characteristics are strikingly
							exemplified in the man whose history is herein delineated and consequently he is
							justly regarded as one of the representative citizens of his county.</p>

						<p>John A. Mattern, the son of John W. and Anna (Woodrow) Mattern, was born in Marion
							county, Indiana, on February 11, 1846. His parents were natives of Pennsylvania and
							reared a family of four children.</p>

						<p>John Q. A. Mattern received a common school education and at an early age began to
							work on his father's farm. When a young man he began farming for himself as soon as
							married and by good management and close application to his agricultural interests he
							has acquired a farm which is one of the best in his township, it comprising three
							hundred and sixty acres in one body. He has always been very actively engaged in the
							stock-raising department of farm work and for fourteen years was a stock commissioner
							at the stock yards in Indianapolis. However, he has not allowed his material welfare
							to blind him to those civic duties which every citizen should perform. He has served
							as treasurer and county commissioner of Hendricks county, and in both capacities
							rendered faithful and efficient service to the citizenship of the county.</p>

						<p>Mr. Mattern was married on October 6, 1869, to Dana Mills, the daughter of Jehu
							Mills, of this county. His wife was one of five children, two of whom died in infancy.
							Mr. and Mrs. Mattern are the parents of four children: Edwin, born February 9, 1871;
							William, born January 3, 1880, who married Jessie Smith and has two children, and is
							now in the stock <pb id="VAC1000-603" n="559"/> commission business at Indianapolis;
							Laura A., born September 16, 1886, married Earl Hoffman, a farmer in Marion county,
							Indiana; Leota, born July 28, 1888.</p>

						<p>On February 20, 1864, Mr. Mattern enlisted in Company D, One Hundred and
							Twenty-fourth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and served under General Sherman in
							the famous Atlanta campaign, his military record being characterized by courage of a
							high order.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Mattern has been a life-long Republican; fraternally, he belongs to
							the Free and Accepted Masons, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Grand Army
							of the Republic, while his religious membership is with the Friends society.</p>

						<p>In examining the life records of self-made men, it will invariably be found that
							indefatigable industry has constituted the basis of their success. True, there are
							other elements which enter in and conserve the advancement of personal
							interests-perseverance, discrimination and mastering of expedients-but the foundation
							of all achievement is earnest, persistent labor. At the outset of his career Mr. Clark
							recognized this, and he did not seek any royal road to the goal of prosperity and
							independence, but began to work earnestly and diligently in order to advance himself,
							and the result is that he is now numbered among the progressive, successful and
							influential business men of Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>William P. Clark, the son of Alfred and Sarah (Aker) Clark, was born January 28,
							1851, in Butler county, Ohio. Alfred Clark was born in Butler county, Ohio, in 1820,
							his wife being born near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in July, 1834. She came to Butler
							county, Ohio, when she was seven years of age with her parents, and is still living in
							Irving, Indiana.</p>

						<p>William P. Clark came with his parents from Butler county, Ohio, to Marion county,
							Indiana, when he was two years old and lived there until 1875, when he moved to the
							farm where he is now living. He was married April 14, 1880, to Elma Anderson, daughter
							of Edward and Amanda (Willits) Anderson. Mrs. Clark was born near Knightstown,
							Indiana, February 22, 1862. Her mother died when she was only nine months old and she
							was taken to her grandmother's at Noblesville, Indiana, where she lived until she was
							nine years old. She then went to the home of Isaac Harden, in <pb id="VAC1000-604"
								n="560"/> Washington township, Hendricks county, where she remained until her
							marriage to Mr. Clark.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Clark have four children: Leola May, who was born March 17, 1881, and
							died after reaching womanhood, having married Harry Gray; Walter Raymond, who was born
							November 19, 1883, and died March 20, 1887; Sarah Louisa, born May 2, 1886, died March
							9, 1887; and Alford A., the only child living, was born November 14, 1888. He married
							Merley Sarkey, daughter of Charles and Viola Sarkey, of Clermont, Indiana, and is
							living with her father on the old home farm.</p>

						<p>The subject carries on a general farming business, also raising Poland-China hogs and
							Shorthorn cattle, and has one hundred and sixty acres on the home place, besides forty
							acres in Wayne township, Marion county, Indiana. He votes the Democratic ticket. Mrs.
							Clark is a member of Shiloh Methodist Episcopal church. Mr. Clark built his fine home
							in 1908 and put up every building on the farm. He made all of the improvements just as
							they stand, for when he got the farm it was badly run down. He has laid over two
							thousand rods of drain tile.</p>

						<p>Theodore T. Martin, the superintendent of Hendricks county schools, was born on a
							farm in Orange county, Indiana, August 25, 1882. His parents were Charles and Mary Ann
							(Ferguson) Martin, his father being a native of Germany and his mother of Indiana, her
							people coming from England to North Carolina and then to Indiana. Charles Martin was a
							machinist and later a farmer.</p>

						<p>Superintendent Martin graduated from the public schools of his home county and later
							entered Central Normal College, at Danville, in 1901, where he pursued high school
							work. He taught three years in the district schools of Orange county, one year in the
							city schools of Summitville, Madison county, and four years in Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>Mr. Martin graduated from the teachers' course (Central Normal College) in 1905; from
							the scientific course at the same institution in 1906 and from the Indiana State
							Normal School, at Terre Haute, Indiana, in 1909; he has since been a student in
							Indiana University.</p>

						<p>In 1907 Mr. Martin was chosen principal of the Avon high school, Hendricks county,

							Hendricks county, and remained there for the succeeding two years. In June of 1911 he
							was elected county superintendent of Hendricks county public schools by the county
							board of education, and was the first Democrat to hold the office in this county.</p>

						<p>Mr. Martin was married to Eva Marie Osborne, of Clinton county, in December of 1906.
							They became acquainted while attending Central Normal College.</p>

						<p>In January of 1912, in co-operation with the county board of education, Mr. Martin
							caused a large wall map of the county to be made and placed in every schoolroom of the
							county so that a study of local industries, location of town, township and county
							places could be determined, and a familiarity with home conditions be included in the
							public schools. In January of 1914 the same board, in co-operation with members of the
							farmers' organization, procured the services of a county agricultural agent for the
							leadership in developing scientific farming through the county and supervising the
							teaching of agriculture in the public schools.</p>

						<p>Mr. Martin is a member of the Methodist Episcopal church of Danville, and is a member
							of the Masonic lodge of North Salem. While performing his duties as county
							superintendent he has followed the worthy example of his predecessors and has
							conducted the educational affairs free from political influence and has tried to place
							merit as his guide.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">HON. JAMES MILTON BARLOW.</hi></head>

						<p>It is a pleasure to investigate the career of a successful, self-made man. Great
							honor attaches to that individual who, beginning the great struggle of life alone and
							unaided, gradually overcomes environment, removing one by one the obstacles from the
							pathway of success, and by the master strokes of his own force and vitality succeeds
							in forging his way to the front and winning for himself a position of esteem and
							influence among his fellow men. Such is the record, briefly stated, of James M.
							Barlow, for several decades recognized as one of the most substantial and
							representative citizens of Hendricks county, to a brief synopsis of whose life and
							character the reader's attention is herewith directed. His protracted residence in
							this county has made his name widely and familiarly known. His life and the history
								<pb id="VAC1000-607" n="562"/> of this locality for a period of nearly a half
							century has been pretty nearly one and the same thing, and he has lived to see and
							take a prominent part in the later growth of the community. He is a progressive man in
							the broadest sense of the term. Realizing the wants of the people, he has tried to
							supply the demands of his constituents generously and unsparingly. His has been a life
							of honor and trust, and no higher eulogy can be passed upon him than to state the
							simple truth that his name has never been coupled with anything disreputable, nor has
							there been the shadow of a stain upon his reputation for integrity and unwavering
							honesty. He has been a consistent man in all that he has undertaken, and his career in
							the various relations of life has been utterly without pretense. Because of his
							earnest life, high attainments, well rounded character and large influence, he is
							largely entitled to representation in a work of this character.</p>

						<p>James Milton Barlow was born on September 13, 1845, in Washington township, Hendricks
							county, Indiana, and is the son of Harvey R. and Sarah E. (Smith) Barlow, the former
							born April 1, 1818, in Scott county, Kentucky, and the latter born in Henry county,
							Kentucky, December 8, 1822. To these parents were born eight children, four sons and
							four daughters, of whom four still survive, namely: The first born died in infancy;
							Hannah Jane C. died in early youth; James M., the subject of this sketch, was next in
							order of birth; Ruth Ann lives in Marion county; a daughter, who died in infancy; Mrs.
							Myra Alice Medsker died at the age of forty years, leaving a husband and eight
							children; Harrison S., of Brownsburg, Indiana; Harvey Morton, of Brownsburg. The
							subject's paternal grandfather, Enoch Barlow, was the son of a Revolutonary soldier
							and he himself was one of the early settlers in Scott county, Kentucky, his birth
							having occurred in Virginia. Eventually he moved to Indiana and in September, 1828,
							settled near Brownsburg, where he spent the remainder of his days, his death occurring
							in November, 1837. He was survived a number of years by his widow, who died on June
							16, 1856. They were the parents of eleven children, seven sons and four daughters.
							Harvey R. Barlow was a man of considerable prominence in his community and was captain
							of a company of state volunteers. Harvey R. Barlow came to Indiana at the age of ten
							years at the time of his father's death and took upon himself the management of the
							home farm. He was of necessity deprived of educational advantages, two months
							comprising the entire period of his attendance at school. However, he was of a
							studious disposition and by the most persistent efforts acquired a splendid education,
							so that for many years he was enabled to teach school to the entire satisfaction of
							parents and pupils. His death occurred on August 5, 1872. His <pb id="VAC1000-608"
								n="563"/> wife, whose maiden name was Sarah J. Smith, and who was a native of
							Kentucky, died at the age of seventy-three years. She came to this state in 1837, and
							was a woman of splendid qualities of character, an ardent Presbyterian and rearing her
							children in that faith. In the early life of Hendricks county, Harvey Barlow was
							prominent and progressive in his methods, having built the first saw and grist-mill in
							the county. He was a man of strong character and forceful personality, and in the
							community where he lived he was held in high esteem.</p>

						<p>James M. Barlow received his elementary education in the public schools and then
							became a student in Wabash College. On April 30, 1864, when but eighteen years of age,
							he enlisted in Company H, One Hundred and Thirty-second Regiment Indiana Volunteer
							Infantry, with which he rendered valiant service until receiving an honorable
							discharge in September, 1864. He took part in a number of hotly contested engagements
							and arduous campaigns, and received a certificate of thanks from President Lincoln and
							Secretary of War Edwin H. Stanton, for valuable services rendered by him during the
							Atlanta campaign. Mr. Barlow has been a very active man and at the close of the war he
							went on the road as a traveling salesman for Powers &amp; Weeks, lithographers of
							Cincinnati, Ohio, with whom he remained for two years. He then engaged in teaching
							school and was thus employed in twenty-two different schools, gaining an enviable
							reputation as a professional teacher and good administrative officer. For awhile he
							also gave some attention to auctioneering, in which he was successful, and also owned
							and operated a butcher shop in Brownsburg, and also a drug store. Then he was employed
							as bookkeeper for a firm in Pittsboro, in which position he gained a good, practical
							experience. In young manhood, by rigid economy and wise management, he succeeded in
							acquiring a small farm, which he operated with such good success that he was enabled
							to add to it from time to time, until at length he became the owner of seven hundred
							acres of fine farming land, of which he has given four hundred acres to his children,
							owning now three hundred acres of land. Aside from his farming interests, Mr. Barlow
							is identified with the Van Camp Packing Company, of Indianapolis. Strong and forceful
							in his relations with his fellow men, he has gained the good will and commendation of
							all with whom he has been brought in contact, ever retaining his reputation among men
							for integrity and high character and never losing that dignity which is the birthright
							of a gentleman. The splendid success which came to Mr. Barlow has been directly
							traceable to the salient points in his character, for he started in life at the bottom
							of the ladder, which he mounted unaided. He is a splendid example of the virile, <pb
								id="VAC1000-609" n="564"/> progressive, self-made man, who believes in doing well
							whatever is worth doing at all.</p>

						<p>Politically a Republican, Mr. Barlow has for many years been active in public
							affairs, and has been an important and influential factor in many movements for the
							welfare of his state. In 1897 and 1899 he was representative from Hendricks county in
							the Legislature, and in 1901-2-3 was a member of the Senate, representing the district
							of Boone and Hendricks counties. In these bodies his ability was recognized and he was
							placed on several of the most important committees. He was chairman of the
							agricultural committee, chairman of the committee on reformatory institutions, and on
							a number of other important committees in both bodies. He served his community as
							justice of the peace for four years, and a noteworthy feature of his administration of
							the office was that he was influential in having many cases settled out of court, thus
							saving useless litigation and expense. His decisions as justice of the peace were
							marked by a high sense of fairness and justice, never having a decision reversed in
							the higher courts. Fraternally, Mr. Barlow has been a member of Lodge No. 188,
							Independent Order of Odd Fellows, for forty-eight years. He is also a member of the
							Improved Order of Red Men, Lodge No. 167, and at present a member of Post No. 186,
							Grand Army of the Republic. He was a charter member of John A. Hollett Post No. 242,
							Grand Army of the Republic. In the Knights of Pythias, Mr. Barlow has been quite
							prominent, having taken an active part in the organization of the Uniform Rank, being
							elected major of the First Battalion of the First Regiment, this being the first
							regiment ever organized in this body, and the first and oldest regiment in the world.
							Mr. Barlow served as chief of staff of Commander in Chief Thomas J. Stewart, of
							Pennsylvania, when the Grand Army of the Republic met at San Francisco, and has for
							many years been prominent in the various councils of this veteran organization. For
							twenty years Mr. Barlow served as president of the Old Settlers' Picnic, one of the
							popular and prominent organizations of Hendricks county, an annual feature of which
							was an address given by the governor of the state. Religiously, Mr. Barlow has for
							many years been a faithful and earnest member of the Presbyterian church, of which he
							is an elder, and in 1903 was one of the delegates from Indiana to the general assembly
							of the church which met at Philadelphia. Mr. Barlow is a public spirited man in all
							that the term implies and is actively interested in enterprises tending to promote the
							general welfare, withholding his support from no movement for the good of the locality
							honored by his residence. His personal relations with his fellow men have ever been
							mutually pleasant and agreeable, and he is highly regarded <pb id="VAC1000-610"
								n="565"/> by all, being easily approached, obliging and straightforward in all the
							relations of life.</p>

						<p>On May 17, 1871, Mr. Barlow was married to Sarah E. Hornaday, a daughter of Isaiah
							Hornaday, a farmer of Washington township, this county, and was one of eight children,
							five of whom are now living. To this union have been born eight children: William E.,
							of Minneapolis, a teacher in the public schools, having charge of the manual training
							department in the South high school. He is married and the father of four children;
							Henry Dickerson, a farmer on the old homestead in Washington township, has four
							children living; Walter Harvey, a farmer in Guilford township, has four children;
							Myrtle, of Plainfield, who married Fred Brudford, a merchant of that city; Virgil M.,
							who lives in Missouri, married Edith Anderson; Albert Paul, of Plainfield, a merchant,
							married Marie Hollingsworth; Harrison Porter, who died at the age of three years, and
							Mary S., the youngest in order of birth, who is attending college at Terre Haute,

						<p>Fortunate is he who has back of him an ancestry honorable and distinguished, and

							succeeded well at whatever he has attempted to do and, although he is a plain,
							conservative gentleman, no doubt if he had sought to be a leader of men and achieve
							public distinction, he would have found that nature had provided well for him in the
							way of the proper equipment and that he only needed to call into proper use the
							dormant faculties.</p>

						<p>Hugh J. Woody, the manager of the grain elevator at Pittsboro, was born February 21,
							1865, one mile south of Plainfield, in Guilford township, this county. His parents
							were Miller and Margaret (Lacey) Woody. Miller Woody was born in North Carolina on May
							15, 1836, and died in Nowata, Oklahoma, January 13, 1909, at the age of seventy-two.
							He moved to Hendricks county at the age of fifteen years with his parents and on
							September 8, 1858, was married to Margaret Lacey, of Plainfield. He lived in this
							county for a number of years near Pittsboro and then moved to Oklahoma, in what was
							then called the Cherokee strip, in 1884. Mr. and Mrs. Miller Woody were the parents of
							seven children: Mrs. A. M. Hawkins, of Indianapolis; <pb id="VAC1000-611" n="566"/> H.
							J., of Pittsboro; Mrs. J. D. Reynolds, of Coffeyville, Kansas; C. F.; Mrs. Frank
							McCartney; Mrs. A. H. Gillespey, and Walter, of Nowata, Oklahoma. Miller Woody died at
							the home of his son-in-law, A. H. Gillespey, who was an alderman in the city of
							Nowata, Oklahoma. Margaret Lacey, the wife of Miller Woody. was a native of this
							county and died in 1877.</p>

						<p>Hugh J. Woody spent his boyhood days in this county and early in his twenties became
							associated in the grain elevator business at Pittsboro and has been identified with
							that industry for the past twenty-seven years, fifteen years of which he has been the
							general manager of the company at Pittsboro.</p>

						<p>Mr. Woody was married December 4, 1890, to Cora E. Hedge, the daughter of Chester and
							Sarah (Gott) Hedge. Chester Hedge was born March 4. 1840, in Pulaski county, Virginia.
							After his death his widow married James Mallory Leak, whose history is given elsewhere
							in this volume. Mr. and Mrs. Hedge were the parents of five children: Cora E., the
							wife of Mr. Woody; Myrtle R.; Mary E., deceased; Ernest E. and Charles O. Mr. Hedge
							was a stanch Republican and a member of the Christian church, being a deacon in that
							denomination. He had an enviable war record, having enlisted in March, 1862, in
							Company F, Fortieth Regiment of Indiana Volunteer Infantry, took part in the campaigns
							in Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia, and among many other battles participated
							in the engagements of Resaca, Jonesboro, Mill Springs, New Hope Church, Peach Tree
							Creek, Dallas, Rocky Faced Ridge, Atlanta, Lost Mountain and Franklin. At the latter
							battle he was captured, but escaped by plunging into the river and diving, and,
							although he was shot at several times, he made his escape safely. He was mustered out
							in 1865 at Indianapolis and died January 8, 1912, at Riner, Virginia. He was a member
							of George A. Kendall Post No. 499, Grand Army of the Republic, at Lizton.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Woody have three children who are still at home, Merle, Clara and
							Miller. Mr. Woody is a member of the Knights of Pythias and the Improved Order of Red
							Men at Lizton and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows at Pittsboro. While he casts
							his vote for the Republican party, yet he has never been an active worker in the
							ranks, preferring to devote all of his attention to his business. Religiously, he is
							by birthright a member of the Friends church, while his wife holds her membership in
							the Christian church. He is a man of optimistic nature, kind, considerate and one who
							is devoted to his home circle. He is a man to admire and esteem, for his industry and
							exemplary character has made him one of the highest respected citizens of his

						<p>Among the thriving farmers and stock raisers of Eel River township is Cunning Herbert
							Steward, who, although a resident of this county only three years, has nevertheless
							demonstrated his ability as a farmer of the first rank. He has tried to measure up to
							the standard of correct citizenship and this township is proud to number him among its
							progressive and representative residents.</p>

						<p>Cunning Herbert Steward, the son of Maurice and Lou (Yeager) Steward, was born in
							1883 in Morgan county, Indiana. Maurice Steward was born at Brooklyn, Morgan county,
							and his wife was a native of the same county. Maurice Steward is the son of William
							and Serelda (Rinker) Steward, and his wife was the daughter of Whalen Yeager and wife.
							The wife of Maurice Steward died in 1893, leaving five living children, and one who
							died in infancy. Shortly after Mrs. Steward's death her husband and the children moved
							to Putnam county, this state, and settled on a farm near Maysville. Maurice Steward is
							now living on a farm near Delma, in Putnam county.</p>

						<p>Cunning H. Steward received a good common school education in the Putnam county
							schools and worked out by the month for twelve years, until his marriage. In 1910 he
							became interested in the buying and selling of horses, but after his marriage he
							turned his attention to farming and the feeding of cattle for the markets. In
							September, 1911, he bought forty acres where he now lives in the southeastern part of
							Eel River township and adjoining eighty acres which belongs to his wife. Their farm of
							one hundred and twenty acres is very fertile and under the present excellent system of
							tillage produces abundant crops of wheat, oats, corn, hay, vegetables, fruits, etc.
							Mr. Steward makes a specialty of no particular crop, but gives his attention to
							general farming in which his success has been more than ordinarily gratifying. For the
							past three years he has been interested quite extensively in the raising of cattle,
							which he finds more remunerative than agriculture alone, and by a judicious
							combination of the two he has achieved his greatest success.</p>

						<p>Mr. Steward was married May 7, 1911, to Murl Case, a native of this township and the
							daughter of Lewis and Josie (Call) Case. Lewis Case, the son of Rev. John and Julia
							Case, was born near Maysville, Kentucky. John Case was a Baptist minister who came
							from Kentucky to Putnam county early in the history of that part of the state and
							entered government land <pb id="VAC1000-613" n="568"/> near New Maysville. He and his
							good wife reared a family of thirteen children, all of whom grew to maturity. He
							became one of the most substantial farmers of the county and presented several of his
							children with a farm upon their marriage. All of his children are now deceased. Lewis
							Case was a lifelong farmer and stock dealer and owned two hundred and sixty acres of
							land in the southeastern part of Eel River township, where he lived until his death,
							in April, 1904. Josie Call, the wife of Lewis Case, was a native of Kentucky, the
							daughter of John and Julia Call, and came to this county with her parents when she was
							about three years of age and lived here until her death in 1906.</p>

						<p>Mr. Steward is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons, the Independent Order of Odd
							Fellows, the Daughters of Rebekah and Order of Eastern Star. His wife is also a devout
							member of the Christian church. Personally, Mr. Steward is a very popular man, and
							with a personality which endears him to his many friends. He is honest,
							straightforward and upright in all the relations of life and he and his wife are
							favorites with a wide circle of friends.</p>

						<p>Under a popular form of government, like ours, where the democratic idea of equality

						<p>Oscar Hadley, president of the Standard Live Stock Insurance Company, of

							<pb id="VAC1000-615" n="569"/> those talents and qualities which were cultivated from
							his youth, reached an honorable position in the public mind and earned the respect and
							high regard of his fellow citizens.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hadley was born on a farm in Guilford township, near Plainfield, Hendricks
							county, Indiana, May 3, 1858, and in order of nativity is the fifteenth of the sixteen
							children born to Elias and Lucinda (Carter) Hadley, the former of whom was born in the
							state of North Carolina and the latter in Butler county, Ohio. Elias Hadley was a boy
							when his father, Jeremiah Hadley, removed with his family from North Carolina to
							Butler county, Ohio, where he was reared to maturity and received the limited
							educational advantages offered by the primitive schools of the pioneer days. Prior to
							the attaining of his legal majority, Elias Hadley came to Indiana and selected a
							favorable location in Hendricks county, after which he returned to Ohio and there
							married Lucinda Carter, who was then in her seventeenth year. Immediately after their
							marriage the young couple came to Hendricks county, Indiana, and established their
							little home in a pioneer log house erected on the land in Guilford township which he
							had secured from the government, and which represented at that time a veritable forest
							wilderness. His father also removed to the locality at the same time and both secured
							tracts of government land, on a portion of which the town of Plainfield now stands.
							Here the young man and the old grappled vigorously with the giants of the forest and
							in due time reclaimed their farms to civilization. Jeremiah Hadley and his good wife
							passed the residue of their lives in Hendricks county, and on their old homestead
							Elias and Lucinda (Carter) Hadley continued to reside until they, too, were summoned
							to the life eternal, honored pioneers of the county in which they took up their abode
							about the year 1822. Elias Hadley was seventy-five years of age at the time of his
							demise, and his devoted wife passed away at the venerable age of eighty-four years, a
							true mother in Israel, whose children may well "rise up and call her blessed," and
							whose memory they hold in lasting reverence. Both she and her husband were zealous
							members of the Christian church, and in politics he was originally a Whig, and later a
							Republican, having united with the "grand old party" at the time of its organization.
							Of the sixteen children nine are now living. The Hadley family has been one of the
							best known and most highly honored in Hendricks county for many years, and its members
							have contributed in liberal measure to the civic and industrial development of that
							favored section of the state. Twelve of the sixteen children in the Hadley family
							lived to maturity and all were members of the same church.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-616" n="570"/>

						<p>Oscar Hadley was reared as a farmer boy on the old homestead farm which was the place
							of his nativity. His boyhood days gained to him through personal experience an
							appreciation of the dignity and value of honest toil. He early learned the lessons of
							industry, self-reliance and sturdy integrity that have proved so potent in the guiding
							and guarding, of his career as a man among men. After completing the prescribed course
							of the public schools, Mr. Hadley continued his studies for one year at Butler
							College, at Irvington, and much of his business career has been one of intimate and
							successful identification with general farming and stock growing, in which latter
							department of industry he has gained a specially wide reputation as a successful
							breeder of high-grade cattle. For many years he has been numbered among the
							representative farmers and stock raisers of Hendricks county, where he owns a fine
							landed estate of two hundred and fifty acres, equipped with the best of improvements
							in all lines. He holds prestige as one of the leading exponents of agriculture and
							stock enterprises in the entire state. For several years he has been a member of the
							Indiana state board of agriculture, of which he served as president in 1909, giving to
							the work of the organization the benefits of his wide and practical experience and
							fine administrative ability. In 1902 Mr. Hadley became one of the organizers and
							incorporators of the Polled Durham Breeders' Association of the United States, the
							largest and most substantial organization of its kind in the world, and of which he
							was elected president in 1908. He has made a specialty of the breeding of the Polled
							Durham cattle, and on his farm are to be found the finest of specimens of this breed.
							He is a member of both the state and National Shorthorn Breeders' Association.</p>

						<p>A man of fine intellectual attainments and forceful personality, Mr. Hadley has
							naturally taken a laudable interest in public affairs in Indiana and done all in his
							power to conserve its progress and prosperity. A stalwart in the camp of the
							Republican party from the time of attaining his legal majority, he has rendered most
							efficient service in the promotion of its cause and has been a prominent factor in
							connection with the party work in his native state. His eligibility for positions of
							public trust was early recognized in his home community, where, it may be said, he set
							at naught all incidental application of the scriptural adage that "a prophet is not
							without honor save in his own country." At the age of twenty-one he became a precinct
							committeeman of his party in his home precinct, and he was chairman of the precinct
							committee for his township for a continuous period of fifteen years. The first
							elective office to which he was called was that of trustee of his native township, of
							which position he continued incumbent for five and one-half <pb id="VAC1000-617"
								n="571"/> years, at the close of which, in 1900, he was nominated and elected
							treasurer of Hendricks county. Local political precedent prescribes that in this
							county the county treasurer shall not become a candidate for a second term, and thus
							Mr. Hadley served only the one term, within which he showed marked ability in handling
							the fiscal affairs of the county.</p>

						<p>In 1906 Mr. Hadley's name was placed before his party as a candidate for state
							treasurer, and after a spirited preliminary campaign he was duly nominated for this
							office in the Republican state convention of that year. In November of the same year
							he rolled up a gratifying majority at the polls, having led the ticket, and on the
							10th of February, 1907, he assumed the duties of the office. Within his term of two
							years he amply justified the wisdom of the people's choice, bringing to bear marked
							capacity for handling the details of the work and doing much to improve the system of
							handling the fiscal affairs of the state. Popular appreciation of his fidelity,
							ability and integrity of purpose was indicated both in his nomination as his own
							successor by his party in the state convention of 1908, and also by the unequivocal
							support accorded him in the ensuing election, through which he was returned to office
							for a second term of two years, which expired on the 10th of February, 1911. His
							record as state treasurer was signally clean, straight-forward and successful,
							redounding alike to his credit and to the conservation of the best interests of the
							commonwealth. His administration is generally conceded as one of the best the office
							ever had.</p>

						<p>Upon leaving official life Mr. Hadley became identified with the Standard Live Stock
							Insurance Company of Indianapolis, of which he was one of the organizers and
							incorporators, and he has served as president of this corporation continuously since
							its organization to the present time. The Standard Live Stock Insurance Company is the
							largest organization of its kind in the world, having a capitalization of two hundred
							and fifty thousand dollars, and having business in many states of the Union.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hadley is vice-president of the First National Bank of Plainfield, being also a
							director and one of the organizers of this well-known Hendricks county bank.</p>

						<p>Fraternally, Mr. Hadley is a member of the Masonic order, in which he has taken the
							capitular degrees, being affiliated with Plainfield Lodge No. 653, Free and Accepted
							Masons, in Plainfield, and with Danville Chapter No. 46, Royal Arch Masons, of
							Danville. He also holds membership in the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the
							Knights of Pythias.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hadley was married March 10, 1880, to Emma Talbott, daughter of Lorenzo Talbott,
							a well-known stock dealer and farmer. Three children <pb id="VAC1000-618" n="572"/>
							were born of this union: Chester, born February 26, 1882, is engaged in the nursery
							business at Danville, Indiana; Vivian, born December 18, 1885, is the wife of Dr. T.
							A. Bryan, of Mattoon, Illinois; Nancy, born October 20, 1889, lives in
							Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hadley are consistent members of the Christian church. The Hadley home

						<p>Descended from a family who were in Indiana when it was admitted to the Union in 1816
							is Daniel M. Jones, whose history is briefly reviewed in the following pages. He is
							distinguished as a citizen whose influence has extended far beyond the community
							honored by his residence and he has for years stood out as a conspicuous figure among
							the successful farmers of his township and county. All of his undertakings have been
							actuated by noble motives and high resolves and characterized by that breadth of
							wisdom which distinguishes strong men. His success and achievements along agricultural
							lines represent the result of fit utilization of innate talent, directed along those
							lines where mature judgment and rare discrimination lead the way.</p>

						<p>Daniel M. Jones, the son of Samuel and Nancy (Ramsey) Jones, was born August 12,
							1849, in Morgan county, Indiana. His father was born May 24, 1803, in Tennessee, and
							his mother on March 25, 1812. Samuel Jones came to Indiana with his parents in 1815
							and settled in that part of the state which was still under the control of the
							Indians. It was bought from the Indians by the United States government in the fall of
							1818 and from it the territory in which the Joneses located was organized into Morgan
							county. Samuel Jones died in 1875 and his wife in 1898. They were the parents of eight
							children, only two of whom are now living, Daniel M., and Mrs. Elizabeth A. Snipes, of
							Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>

						<p>Mr. Jones was educated in the common schools of Hendricks county and later at
							Lafayette Farmers Institute. Early in life he decided that he wished to follow the
							occupation of his father. In accordance with the customs of those days, he was married
							very young and when nineteen years of age led to the nuptial altar Nancy Blair, of
							Guilford township, of this county, their wedding day falling on September 30, 1868.
							Immediately after their marriage they went to housekeeping on the farm where they have
							lived their married life of the past forty-six years one mile east of Plainfield. Mr.
								<pb id="VAC1000-619" n="573"/> Jones has always been a successful farmer and, while
							he has been very careful, he has not let his conservatism hinder him in taking
							advantage of all the latest improvements in farming. He has wisely divided his
							attention between the raising of grain and stock, with the result that he has acquired
							in the course of the last half century a very comfortable competence. He now has a
							fine farm of three hundred and seventy acres, which he has brought to a high state of
							cultivation and productivity. He has taken a great deal of interest in farmers'
							institutes and stock farm courses as provided by our excellent state school.</p>

						<p>Mr. Jones has been a life-long Republican, but has never indulged in the fervor of
							political campaigns. Religiously, he is a member of the Friends church and has always
							been an active worker in this denomination. He has always had the best interests of
							this locality at heart and has sought to advance them in whatever way possible. His
							career has been characterized by untiring energy, uncompromising fidelity and an
							earnest desire to serve his fellow men. He has been very much interested in education
							and particularly in the career of Earlham College, Richmond, Indiana, to which he has
							subscribed liberally. He has been a member of the Free and Accepted Masons and
							Independent Order of Odd Fellows at Plainfield for the past twenty years, being active
							in lodge work. Such has been his life during his long career that he has at the same
							time won and retains the high esteem of all with whom he has come in contact by the
							honorable course which he has at all times pursued.</p>

						<p>Agriculture has been an honored vocation from the earliest ages and, as a usual
							thing, men of honorable and humane impulses, as well as those of energy and thrift,
							have been patrons of husbandry. The free out-door life of the farm has a decided
							tendency to foster and develop that independence of mind and self-reliance which
							characterizes true manhood and no truer blessing can befall a boy than to be reared in
							close touch with nature in the healthful, life-inspiring labor of the fields. It has
							always been the fruitful soil from which have sprung the moral bone and sinew of the
							country, and the majority of our nation's great warriors, renowned statesmen and
							distinguished men of letters were born on the farm and were indebted largely to its
							early influence for the distinction which they have attained.</p>

						<p>Nathaniel Clark Gossett, one of the many successful farmers of Brown <pb
								id="VAC1000-620" n="574"/> township, Hendricks county, Indiana, is a native of this
							county, born on a farm of which his present holdings constituted a part, on January
							28, 1856, being one of twelve children of Nathaniel Walton and Mary Greenfield (Fox)
							Gossett, the former of whom was a son of John and Dorcas (Clark) Gossett, John Gossett
							was a son of Thomas and Sarah (Walton)Gossett. Dorcas Clark, paternal grandmother of
							the immediate subject of this sketch, was a daughter of Samuel E. and Rachael
							(Bratton) Clark, the former of whom was a veteran of the War of the Revolution. Mary
							Greenfield Fox, mother of the subject of this sketch, was a daughter of John and
							Hannah (Barker) Fox, and both she and the father of the subject were natives of the
							state of North Carolina, being brought to Indiana by their parents while they were
							still children. Nathaniel W. Gossett was twelve years of age at that time, while Mary
							Greenfield Fox was but eight years old. Both families settled in Hendricks county,
							about two and one-half miles north of Plainfield. Here the young people in question
							grew to maturity and there their marriage was later solemnized.</p>

						<p>Nathaniel W. Gossett spent his boyhood days on the paternal farmstead, where he early
							learned the secrets of successful agriculture under the intelligent direction of his
							father. He devoted himself assiduously to the cultivation of the soil all his life and
							was eminently successful in his chosen vocation. At the age of nineteen he was married
							and at that time purchased a portion of his father's farm, remaining on that tract
							until in 1853. His original holdings were then disposed of to advantage and he
							purchased two hundred and ten acres of land in the northeast portion of Brown
							township, Hendricks county, where he passed the remainder of his life. His death
							occurred on October 28, 1903, and at that time he was living, together with his son,
							Nathaniel C., the immediate subject of this sketch, in a house he had built on his
							farm some distance from the old homestead, having disposed of all but eighty acres of
							his original farm. A short time before his death he sold that tract to the subject of
							this sketch, who has continued to reside there. There too, the mother of subject
							passed away on October 23, 1910. Mr Gossett has never married. He keeps his farm up to
							the highest type of modern agricultural methods and conducts his business in such a
							manner as to win for himself the reputation of being a thorough agriculturist. Mr.
							Gossett's oldest brother was one of the leading men of his community, serving as
							county superintendent of school for several years. He was also a veteran of the Civil
							War. Personally, Mr. Gossett is a man of strong personal qualities, easily makes
							friends and always retains them. United in his composition are so many elements of a
							provident, practical nature, which during a series <pb id="VAC1000-621" n="575"/> of
							years have brought him into prominence and earned for him a first place among the
							enterprising men of his county, that it is but just recognition of his worthiness that
							he receive specific mention in this work.</p>

						<p>Among the progressive farmers of Hendricks county Albert W. Beaman occupies a
							prominent place for the reason that he is a man of education and self confidence. Real
							self confidence is not a matter of many words, but it is the quiet chap with square
							jaw and the silent tongue who is the man to be afraid of. He is the man who wins. Out
							of self confidence grow enthusiasm and earnestness, and for the man who is in earnest
							nothing is impossible. Many of us make the mistake of not taking ourselves seriously.
							If we are inclined to look upon life as a joke it is pretty certain that the joke is
							on us. Mr. Beaman is a man who has believed in himself; he has selected a goal and
							marched straightforward toward it. Although he has found many difficulties in his way,
							he has believed that they were only there in order to prove his strength, to test his
							self confidence. One by one he has cleared the difficulties out of his way and today
							he stands a self-reliant, aggressive man who takes a prominent and influential part in
							the community where he lives.</p>

						<p>Albert Wesley Beaman, the son of Adam and Rebecca A. (McDaniels) Beaman, was born
							February 22, 1874, in Brown township, Hendricks county, Indiana. Adam Beaman was a
							native of Boone county, this state, who came to Hendricks county after he was married,
							settling in Brown township, on eighty acres of land. He died in March, 1909. Rebecca
							A. McDaniels, the mother of Mr. Beaman, was born in Hendricks county in April, 1844,
							her birth occurring about one mile west of Brownsburg, and she is still living at
							Pittsboro, Indiana. Mr. and Mrs. Adam Beaman were the parents of seven children,
							Charles S., Willard E., Otis B., deceased, Albert Wesley, William Edgar, Ada,
							deceased, George Byron, deceased.</p>

						<p>Albert WV. Beaman spent his earlier life on a farm in Brown township, where he was
							born in a log cabin. This log cabin, around which cluster so many memories of the
							Beaman family, was destroyed by fire in May, 1879, when Albert was five years of age.
							When he was born this farm was an unbroken forest and his boyhood days were alternated
							between his school books and the clearing. He was quick to learn and acquired
							knowledge readily and easily. Upon his finishing his common school course, he was <pb
								id="VAC1000-622" n="576"/> sufficiently advanced to receive a teacher's license, and
							for two years taught school in Brown township, in this county. However, he preferred
							the life of a farmer, and upon his marriage began to farm and has since continued to
							follow that vocation, but taught one term near home recently, in Middle township.</p>

						<p>In the fall of 1900 Mr. Beaman bought the farm where he has since resided, in the
							east edge of Middle township, near the Boone county line.</p>

						<p>Mr. Beaman was married October 20, 1895, to Ona Kennedy, and to this union have been
							born three children, Byron Page, Edith Evangeline and Ernest Clifford. Mr. Beaman is a
							member of the Improved Order of Red Men at Fayette, Indiana, and in politics has
							always adhered to the principles of the Democratic party. While he has been active in
							the councils of his party, yet he has never been an aspirant for any office, but
							willing to serve in the ranks as a private. Mr. Beaman is a keen, business farmer,
							frank and plain spoken and is able to converse intelligently upon any topic of current
							interest. He is one of the clean-cut type of modern farmers who are the backbone of
							our nation today and help to make us the greatest nation on the face of the earth.</p>

						<p>Practical industry, wisely and vigorously applied, never fails of success. It carries
							a man onward and upward, brings out his individual character and acts as a powerful
							stimulus to the efforts of others. The greatest results in life are often attained by
							simple means and the exercise of the ordinary qualities of common sense and
							perseverance. The every-day life, with its cares, necessities and duties, affords
							ample opportunities for acquiring experience of the best kind and its most beaten
							paths provide a true worker with abundant scope for effort and self-improvement. The
							life history of John L. Gunn exemplifies what may be accomplished by a man who sets a
							high ideal in life and then has the courage to follow it all through his career. His
							life has additional interest because of his gallant service in the Civil War, in which
							he fought three years.</p>

						<p>John L. Gunn, the president of the Citizens' State Bank of Plainfield, was born March
							16, 1837, on a farm in Rush county, Indiana. His parents were Dr. John L. and Lydia
							(Hornaday) Gunn, his father being a native of Virginia and his mother of North
							Carolina. Doctor Gunn came west when a young man and first settled in Kentucky. He
							then moved into Indiana, but <pb id="VAC1000-623" n="[]"/>
							<figure>
								<p rend="center i">John L. Gunn</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-624" n="577"/> died shortly after coming into this state, in fact,
							dying a few months before John L., the subject of this sketch, was born. Doctor and
							Mrs. Gunn had one other child, Mrs. John Weir, who died in 1911. The widow of Doctor
							Gunn later married John V. Hadley and moved to Hendricks county when John L. was two
							years of age.</p>

						<p>John L. Gunn was reared as a farmer's lad, attended the rude district schools of the
							ante-bellum days and then entered Northwestern Christian University, now Butler
							College, where he completed his education. While in the University he was a classmate
							of Judge John V. Hadley, of Danville, and the late Col. Eli Ritter, of Indianapolis.
							Shortly after leaving college the Civil War opened and when the President's call was
							issued he enlisted in Company I, Sixty-third Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry. He
							was in the service for nearly three years and was mustered out as a duty sergeant. He
							participated in all of the battles of the Atlanta campaign, being in the battles of
							Buzzard Roost, Resaca, Peach Tree Creek, Marietta, Ringgold and many others. In the
							engagement at Hickory, Georgia, he was injured by the bursting of a shell near
							him.</p>

						<p>Mr. Gunn was first married in 1858 to Caroline Cox, of Hendricks county, and to this
							marriage were born two daughters, Mrs. Lillie D. Belle, of Indianapolis, and Mrs.
							Laura L. Pike, of Plainfield. Some years after the death of his first wife Mr. Gunn
							married Mrs. Mityline Tomlinson Bryant, of Hendricks county. There have been no
							children by the second marriage.</p>

						<p>Until twenty years ago Mr. Gunn was actively engaged in agricultural pursuits and his
							success was entirely commensurate with his efforts. He was recognized as one of the
							best farmers of Guilford township and when he retired from the active management of
							his place he had one of the most up-to-date farms in the township. He still retains
							his farming interests and also has valuable property adjoining the town of Plainfield.
							After moving to Plainfield he became one of its most progressive citizens and has been
							an enthusiastic advocate of local improvements, and during his service of six years on
							the town board of Plainfield he started the agitation for sidewalks and electric
							lights. For the past six years he has been president of the Citizens' State Bank of
							Plainfield and in that capacity has proved to be an able administrator of the various
							financial problems which come before the bank.</p>

						<p>Mr. Gunn has always been a Republican until the organization of the Progressive
							party, but has never held any office except that of town councilman of Plainfield. He
							is a man who has always kept his mind open to new ideas and keeps abreast of the best
							thought. In the course of his long life in the county he has won a wide circle of
							friends and acquaintances.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">WILLIAM DAVIS LEWIS.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the sturdy pioneers of Hendricks county, those who have made it their abiding
							place since its early days; who have seen it grow and develop from a sparsely settled
							country district to its present condition of prosperity, none is better known than the
							subject of our present sketch. A resident of the county for home than seventy years,
							he has proven himself loyal to the place of his birth, giving largely of his time, his
							thought and his influence to promote the growth and development of the
							commonwealth.</p>

						<p>William Davis Lewis, the son of Stephen Taylor and Nancy (Hornaday) Lewis, was born
							October 10, 1843, in Union township, this county, north of the town of Lizton. Here he
							spent his boyhood, learning the rudiments of his life's vocation, that of husbandry;
							laying the foundation of the sagacity and strength of physique which make for success
							in that calling. Here, also, in the township schools he received his schooling,
							attending the common schools, when he could, until the war broke out, and after the
							war, with characteristic ambition, going to Danville for a further term of study in
							the Danville Academy.</p>

						<p>On October 7, 1861, in response to his country's call for volunteers to come to her
							defense, he left the peaceful, protected life of the farm and enlisted in the Army of
							the Cumberland, becoming a member of Company C, Fifty-first Indiana Volunteer
							Infantry. For three years he remained with his regiment, engaging with great bravery
							in all its battles, enduring all the hardships and deprivations of the campaigns,
							having several very narrow escapes, and when his term of service expired he
							re-enlisted for another term of three years, and served until the close of the war. He
							was mustered out of service on the 13th day of December, 1865, but after peace was
							declared, he was sent to San Antonio, Texas, returning to Indianapolis on January 13,
							1866. He was taken prisoner with his regiment near Rome, Georgia, and narrowly escaped
							the horrors of Libby prison, finally, however, receiving his parole. At the close of
							the service he was mustered out as a lieutenant. After leaving the service he came
							back to Hendricks county, followed farming and attended Danville Academy.</p>

						<p>On February 3, 1870, he was married to Mary Evaline Parker, the daughter of William
							G. and Martha (Wells) Parker. Like their forefathers, the young people clung to the
							peaceful life of the farm, building for themselves a homestead on a twenty-eight-acre
							tract of land, most of which is now within the limits of Pittsboro, where they still
							reside, enjoying the fruits <pb id="VAC1000-626" n="579"/> of their industry and
							thrift. During their long-continued residence in the county, William Davis Lewis and
							his wife have stood for all that is best and noblest in the life of the community.
							Devoted members of the Christian church, that body has shown its appreciation of his
							sterling qualities and deep spirituality by electing him a deacon of the church for
							twenty-five consecutive years, and also making him one of the trustees of the church
							property. One daughter has blessed their union, now Mrs. Ella G. Todd. She is the
							mother of two sons, William Lewis and Clifford Parker, and resides in Worcester,
							Massachusetts.</p>

						<p>The ancestors of Mr. Lewis, for generations, have engaged in the pursuit of
							agriculture. His paternal grandfather, Stephen Lewis, was a native of Rush county,
							spending his days until death called him on the homestead farm, north of Rushville.
							Here his son, Stephen Taylor Lewis, the father of the subject of this article, was
							born and reared. In 1837 Stephen left the home to his father and came to Hendricks
							county. Here he entered from the government forty acres of land north of Lizton, in
							Union township. This he later sold and purchased eighty acres east of Lizton, which
							became his permanent home until his death, December 13, 1855. He was the father of
							five children, Stephen, Hannah Jane, John H.. William Davis and Thomas D., of whom the
							subject is the only survivor. While yet a resident of Rush county, Stephen Taylor
							Lewis was married to Nancy Hornaday, and throughout his life she remained his faithful
							companion, rearing their family and remaining on the homestead farm until her death,
							six years after the demise of her husband. Death came to her on April 3, 1859.</p>

						<p>The wife of William Davis Lewis was also the daughter of a farmer, William G. Parker,
							a native of Kentucky. He, however, spent much of his time trading in live stock, and
							for a number of years was a merchant. He was the father of nine children, as follows:
							Mary Evaline (now Mrs. Lewis), Oliver Wilson, Sarah Jane (deceased), Robert Ellsworth,
							William M., Ruth A. (deceased), and two little ones who died in infancy. Mr. Parker
							passed away in the year 1877. His wife was a native of North Carolina, and still
							survives, an honored member of the household of her daughter, Mrs. Lewis.</p>

						<p>In manner, Mr. Lewis is quiet, unassuming and sincere, having a personality which
							invites the confidence of all with whom he comes in contact. He served as commander of
							Thomas Ashby Post, Grand Army of the Republic, two or three terms. For forty-three

						<p>A farmer of Hendricks county, Indiana, who has a true love for his occupation is
							William E. Beaman, who has not been content to farm exactly in the same manner as his
							ancestors, but has moved from the beaten path and tried to keep pace with all the
							modern scientific methods of agriculture. For this reason he has been more than
							ordinarily successful and can attribute his measure of success to the fact that he has
							combined brains with brawn, a combination which is sure to yield a gratifying result
							when properly pursued.</p>

						<p>William Edgar Beaman, the son of Adam and Rebecca A. (McDaniel) Beaman, was born
							February 14, 1876, in Brown township, Hendricks county, Indiana. His father was native
							of Boone county, this state, and came to Hendricks county after his marriage, settling
							in Brown township on an eighty-acre farm and here he lived the life of a farmer, dying
							on March 15, 1909. He was a man who loved a simple, plain and unostentatious life and
							was capable of an enormous amount of hard work. When he was a young man he had a great
							reputation as an athlete. In the days when wrestling was in vogue, there was not a
							young man in the neighborhood who could lay him flat on his back. His wife was a
							native of this county, and was born near Brownsburg, in April, 1844, and she is still
							living at Pittsboro, this county. To Mr. and Mrs. Adam Beaman were born seven
							children: Charles S., Willard E., Otis (deceased), Albert Wesley (whose history is
							given elsewhere in this volume), William Edgar, Ada V. (who died in infancy), and
							George B. (deceased).</p>

						<p>William Edgar Beaman received a good, practical education in his township school and
							almost completed high school. He remained at home until his marriage, assisting his
							father on the home farm, taking part in clearing land and learning by experience. He
							then began farming north of Pittsboro, where he remained nine years. In 1907 he bought
							his present farm of eighty acres, on which he conducts a general system of
							farming.</p>

						<p>Mr. Beaman was married October 9, 1898, to Julia Hufford, the daughter <pb
								id="VAC1000-628" n="581"/> of Gideon Franklin and Mary Jane (Stout) Hufford. Gideon
							Hufford was a native of Hendricks county, his birth having occurred in Washington
							township, and he spent his life in the pursuit of agriculture, and died in 1903 at
							Tilden, Indiana. Mrs. Hufford was a native of Marion county, this state, and is still
							living in this county, near Tilden, on the old homestead farm. Mr. and Mrs. Hufford
							were the parents of nine children: George F., deceased; Delilah, who died when young;
							Mrs. Carrie Garner; Theodore Newton, deceased; Joel V.; Mrs. Ella Garner; Julia, the
							wife of Mr. Beaman; Edgar and John T. Mr. and Mrs. Beaman have four children, Doris
							M., Wilford Lawrence, Frances Isabel and Edgar.</p>

						<p>Fraternally, Mr. Beaman is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows at
							Pittsboro, and, politically, holds his affiliation with the Democratic party. He is a
							liberal and broad-minded farmer, who makes a deep study of farming as a practical
							profession, is of a decided mechanical turn of mind, and believes in the strict
							honesty of all men and is quick to resent any unfairness to himself or to any of his
							fellow citizens. He is strictly honest himself and believes in the Golden Rule in
							every-day life.</p>

						<p>Hendricks county is fortunate in that she numbers among her prominent families many
							who are not only natives of the place themselves, but whose ancestors as well found
							here an abiding place of peculiar attraction. Many of our early settlers came to this
							locality from other states, some even from abroad; but, after long and ofttimes
							perilous journeys, they appear to have found here what they sought, comfortable homes
							and the means of maintaining the same. Here their children and grandchildren were born
							and bred, some of them going out into various professions, and some loyally following
							in the footsteps of their fathers, tilling the soil, cultivating and improving not
							only their farms, but building roads and draining swamp lands, paving the way for the
							greater affluence of the present generation.</p>

						<p>Among these early settlers, the father of the subject of this article should be
							mentioned. James Sandusky was born in the year 1821 in Bourbon county, Kentucky, but
							came to Brown township, Hendricks county, in the year 1864. At that time this locality
							was uncultivated and swampy, a veritable wilderness of undergrowth. But Mr. Sandusky
							was alive to the possibilities of the place and did not hesitate at the hard work
							involved in clearing <pb id="VAC1000-629" n="582"/> and draining a tract of land in
							order that it might become a suitable location for human habitation; and the
							development of the place has proved the soundness of his judgment.</p>

						<p>On the 5th day of November, 1846, Mr. Sandusky was married to Agnes Sandusky, of
							Vermillion county, Illinois; but five years later they were separated by the death of
							his wife, she passing away September 5, 1851. He was later married to Elizabeth Susan
							Morgan, also of Vermillion county, Illinois, who became the mother of two of his
							children, Thomas Jacob (the subject of this sketch) and Mary Agnes (Gibbs). She was
							born May 29, 1826, and was called to her final home May 11, 1862. For the third time
							he sought and found a companion in Josephine Knaus, of Marion county, Indiana, she
							being a native of Sigmaringen, Germany. To this union were born four children,
							Elizabeth (Strawmyer), Antoinette (Beard), Josephine (Arbuckle), and Hannah (Coffman),
							deceased.</p>

						<p>Mr. Sandusky followed the pursuit of agriculture throughout his life, and when death
							called him, in 1893, he went from his own homestead to his final resting place. He was
							a member of the Masonic order and affiliated with the Democratic party.</p>

						<p>Thomas J. Sandusky, the immediate subject of this article, was born May 14, 1856, in
							Decatur county, Indiana, coming to Hendricks county with his father in 1864. On the 3d
							day of August, 1882, he was married to Susan E. Gibbs, a native of Marion county, this
							state. Her parents, William and Elizabeth (Burden) Gibbs, were both born natives of
							England, but emigrated to this country not long after their marriage. He found his
							highest efficiency in the wholesome, natural life of the farm, and here he brought his
							wife. Eleven children were born to them, as follows: Thomas, born in England; Mary;
							Anna, deceased;. William; Daniel; Homer, deceased; Theodore, deceased; Susan, now Mrs.
							Sandusky; Merritt; John and Everitt. Death claimed the wife and mother in 1903, and
							six years later the father was called. To Mr. and Mrs. Sandusky were born two
							children, Ida M. (now Mrs. Everett) and Grover T.</p>

						<p>After his marriage, Thomas Sandusky continued the work taught him by his father,
							clinging to the life of the farmer, and very successfully he has proven. His farm
							shows the results of the labor and care expended upon it, being in a high state of
							cultivation, well kept and showing the careful management which has characterized his
							labors. He is particularly interested in his live stock, taking great pride in his
							sheep, of which he raises a goodly number.</p>

						<p>In manner, Mr. Sandusky is quiet and unassuming, but sociable withal; a <pb
								id="VAC1000-630" n="583"/> progressive man and an excellent neighbor. He is a firm
							believer in Democratic principles as promulgated by Jefferson; is affiliated with the
							order of Knights of Pythias at Brownsburg, and both he and Mrs. Sandusky are well
							known members of the Methodist Protestant church, he being a trustee of this
							organization and she a charter member. He is also a trustee of the parsonage at
							Lebanon, Indiana. That he is well and favorably known throughout the surrounding
							country is evidenced by the fact that he has served as justice of the peace of Brown
							township for ten years, from 1878 to 1888; and later was elected township trustee,
							serving in that capacity from 1895 to 1900. In both offices he was known as a
							conscientious, honorable officer, exercising his powers with discretion and sound
							judgment. Altogether his life has been a thoroughly successful one, a splendid example
							to the community at large, and by the coming generation his name will be remembered
							with high regard.</p>

						<p>To attain a worthy citizenship by a life that is always honored and respected even
							from childhood deserves more than mere mention. One may take his place in public life
							through some vigorous stroke of public policy, and even remain in the hearts of
							friends and neighbors, but to take the same position by dint of the practice of an
							upright life, and without a craving for exaltation and popularity, is worthy of the
							highest praise and commendation. The late Joel Jessup, one of the successful farmers
							and public-spirited citizens of Hendricks county, who was well known throughout this
							community, was a man respected and honored, not because of the vigorous training of
							his special talents, but because of his daily life, each day having been one that was
							above criticism and passed upon in the light of real, true manhood. Strong and
							forceful in his relations with his fellow men, he not only made his presence felt, but
							also gained the good will and commendation of both his associates and the general
							public, ever retaining his reputation among men for integrity and character, no matter
							how trying the circumstances, and never losing that dignity which is the birthright of
							a gentleman. Consequently his influence for good in the general life of his community

							<pb id="VAC1000-634" n="585"/> potent, and he will long be sadly missed from the
							various circles in which he moved and over which his influence was like sunshine on a
							field of ripened wheat.</p>

						<p>The late Joel Jessup was born in Guilford township, this county, April 6, 1832, and
							died on the old homestead farm, October 4, 1908. He was one of five children born to
							Joseph and Rachel (Jackson) Jessup, the other four children being Mary, Jackson L.,
							Lethy and Mahalia Jane. Joseph Jessup and his wife were both natives of North
							Carolina, coming to this county shortly after their marriage in 1820 and entered one
							hundred and sixty acres of land. The deed for this land, signed by President John
							Quincy Adams, is still in the family and is a treasured relic, which is very much
							cherished. Joseph Jessup died at the age of seventy and his wife at the age of
							seventy-eight, both having been born in the latter part of the eighteenth century.</p>

						<p>Joel Jessup was given a very meager education, since the schools of his day were open
							but two or three months in the winter time and then offered very limited advantages.
							While Mr. Jessup was in the school room but a very short time, yet he laid the
							foundation for a desire for knowledge and, being a great reader all his life, he was,
							for a man of his age, well informed on most all subjects of the day. During all his
							life he lived on the farm and as a farmer was sufficiently progressive in keeping
							abreast of the times. As a boy he had to labor without any of the modern inventions,
							and as the modern agricultural implements came into use he added them one by one to
							his equipment until at the end of his life he was as well equipped for agriculture as
							any farmer in the county. He is remembered not so much for his success on the farm, as
							for his work in the community at large, work which was directed along moral and civic
							lines.</p>

						<p>Mr. Jessup was married August 12, 1852, to Louisa Moon, and to this marriage were
							born four children: Harrison, born August 20, 1853, who was a farmer all his life and
							died December 30, 1905, leaving a widow and two sons, Walter and Carlos; Theodore W.,
							born January 19, 1855, and died November 26, 1878, leaving a widow and two children,
							Nellie and Wallace T., the latter living on a part of the old homestead place; Jessie,
							born September 10, 1856, who married Jesse Allen, of West Newton, Marion county.
							Indiana, and they have four children. The Allen family are now residents of Pasadena,
							California; William S., born April 11, 1858, who married Emma Card, and they have four
							children, Louisa, Halstead, Donald and Mary Eleanor; William is now living on a part
							of the old home farm.</p>

						<p>The first wife of Mr. Jessup died August 20, 1885, and two years later, on June 22,
							1887, he was married to Dr. Maria Allen, the daughter of <pb id="VAC1000-635" n="586"
							/> Preston and Susannah (Jessup) Allen. Her father came from Ohio and she was one of
							four children. She was educated in the local schools and at Spiceland Academy in Henry
							county, this state. She taught school for twenty years and it was not until she was
							thirty-eight years of age that she entered the Woman's Medical College of Chicago,
							Illinois (now a part of Northwestern University), from which she graduated three years
							later. She was married to Mr. Jessup two months after she graduated and has practiced
							for the past twenty-seven years in Hendricks county, Indiana. She ranks as one of the
							most prominent women practitioners in the state. She is a woman of great strength of
							character and with a tender and sympathetic feeling which should be the necessary
							concomitant of the technical experience needed for the successful physician.</p>

						<p>Mr. Jessup had a birthright in the Friends church and throughout his whole life was a
							firm believer in the doctrines as set forth by that church. Being naturally of a quiet
							and reserved disposition, one had to know him intimately to appreciate his real depth
							of Christian spirit. He was of a deeply religious nature and a careful student of the
							Bible, and his great faith in Christ was built on its teachings. As might be inferred,
							his politics were in keeping with his faith and he was a Prohibitionist of the most
							radical kind all his life. Such men as Joel Jessup are a blessing to any community,
							because of their advocacy of wholesome living, pure politics and honesty in every-day
							life. Such men raise the standard of civic morality in every community, and their
							example is such as to help those who are starting in life.</p>

							who, while laboring for his individual advancement, has never forgotten his
							obligations to the public and his support of such measures and movements as have been
							for the general good could always be depended upon. Although his life has been a busy
							one, his private affairs making heavy demands upon his time, he has never allowed it
							to interfere with his obligations as a citizen and neighbor. Through the long <pb
								id="VAC1000-636" n="587"/> years of his residence in this community he has ever been
							true to the trusts reposed in him, whether of a public or private nature and his
							reputation in a business way has been unassailable. Possessing in a marked degree
							those sterling traits which have commanded uniform confidence and regard, he is today
							honored by all who know him and is numbered among the representative men of Hendricks
							county. He is one of the few remaining veterans of that great struggle which
							threatened to sever the Union in the sixties and special honor is due him for the four
							long and bloody years which he spent on the battle fields of the South.</p>

						<p>Amos C. Weaver, now living a retired life in Indianapolis, was born in Middle
							township, Hendricks county, Indiana, August 15, 1841. His parents were Thomas
							Jefferson and Anna (Hollis) Weaver, both natives of Kentucky, he being born in 1805
							and she in 1807. After their marriage in Kentucky, they came to Indiana in 1836 and
							settled on a farm in Middle township, this county, where they lived the remainder of
							their lives. He died April 3, 1873, and his widow passed away November 10, 1886. They
							were the parents of eight children, the subject of this sketch being the only one
							living. The children, in the order of their birth, are as follows: William died at the
							age of seventeen; John B. died at the age of seventeen; Amanda Jane, who married
							Paxton Alexander, and died in 1854, at the age of twenty-two; Mary Matilda, who
							married Carlo Gadson, and died in May, 1864, at the age of twenty-two; James Lewis,
							who died in infancy; Amos C., the only one living; Ellis, who died in 1910, was a
							member of Company B, Seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, for two years and
							was then attached to Battery B of the Fifth Regiment. Ellis was a recorder of
							Hendricks county at one time and one of the prominent citizens of the county; the
							eighth and youngest child was Taylor, who died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Amos C. Weaver was reared on the farm and went through all the experiences common to
							boys on the farm. He attended school in the old log school houses of Middle township a
							few months each winter, and proved to be a very apt pupil. As soon as he had secured
							all the education he could get in the country schools he started to take the course in
							Northwestern University at Indianapolis. In order to get money to continue his
							education he taught school at Pittsboro, in his home county. The year 1861 found him
							twenty years of age and a teacher in Pittsboro, but when President Lincoln issued his
							call for troops, in the spring of 1861, young Weaver forsook his books and answered
							the call. He was mustered into the service on October 8, 1861, in Company A,
							Fifty-first Regiment of Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and was mustered out March 22,
							1865. His company was attached to the <pb id="VAC1000-637" n="588"/> Army of the West,
							and he saw service in scores of the fiercest battles which were fought in the West.
							Among these were Shiloh, Perryville, Corinth, Stone's River, Lookout Mountain, and
							many other skirmishes and forays of lesser importance. He was wounded at Dalton,
							Georgia, on August 15, 1864, by a minie ball, which shattered his foot. The army
							surgeons wanted to amputate his foot, but he objected so strenuously that they dressed
							it the best they could and let him go. He was in a very precarious condition for some
							time, but finally fully recovered, due to his wonderful physical constitution. A few
							weeks before he was shot he had been elected captain, but his commission did not
							arrive until after he was laid up in the hospital. He was sent home in November of
							1864 and mustered out on March 22, 1865.</p>

						<p>In the spring of 1865 Mr. Weaver was elected trustee of Middle township, and his
							administration of the duties of the office were so satisfactory that he was re-elected
							in the spring of 1867. While he was trustee he started in the mercantile business at
							Pittsboro, and continued in the business after his term as trustee had expired. For
							thirty-two years he operated a general store at Pittsboro and by his strict integrity
							and upright business dealings he accumulated a goodly share of this world's goods. In
							addition to his mercantile establishment he was interested in farming and stock
							raising during most of his life in Hendricks county, and now owns three hundred and
							seventy-three acres of fine land near Pittsboro. Fortune has seemed to smile on all of
							his undertakings and he has usually realized a substantial profit on all his
							investments. In 1903 he retired from the active charge of business cares and is now
							getting a well-earned rest after years of hard labor.</p>

						<p>Mr. Weaver was married September 3, 1865, to Miriam Wells, the daughter of George
							Washington and Fanny Wells, of Middle township, this county. They are the parents of
							five children, all of whom have grown to maturity: Hollis H., a merchant of Greentown,
							Indiana; Chester A., a farmer living near Pittsboro; Urban R., who is a traveling
							salesman for a bankers' supply company of St. Louis; Grace D., who is the wife of John
							F. Wood; and Francis Pearl, who is the wife of B. O. Kile and lives near Galveston,
							Texas.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Weaver have been extensive travelers and have been across the continent
							to California, south to Florida, Georgia and every state on the gulf of Mexico. They
							have also traveled in Mexico and Canada and throughout the eastern part of the United
							States. They are both members of the Christian church, and Mr. Weaver is a member of
							the Free and Accepted Masons and the Grand Army of the Republic. At one time he was
							commander of Thomas Ashby Post No. 451, at Pittsboro. He has been a life-long <pb
								id="VAC1000-638" n="589"/> Republican and has never seen any reason why he should
							change his allegiance to any other party. He has never held any office except that of
							trustee, which was immediately after he came home from the war.</p>

						<p>Mr. Weaver has been a man of exceptional business ability, sound discretion and
							absolute integrity, factors which contributed to his success in a large degree. During
							all the years of his active career his life has been characterized by duty well
							performed, by faithfulness to every trust reposed in him, by industry, thrift and
							wisely directed effort, which has resulted in the acquisition of a liberal share of
							this world's goods, besides earning a reputation which has never been tarnished by the
							commission of a single unworthy act. During his long life in Hendricks county he made
							friends everywhere, and when he left the county, in 1903, he was one of the widest
							known men in the county. His career is certainly to be admired and is a worthy example
							to put before the people of the coming generation.</p>

						<p>One of the most difficult literary tasks is to write an unexceptionable review of a
							living man. If the life is worthy of -record there is always danger of offending that
							delicacy which is inseparable from merit; for even moderate praise, when it meets the
							eyes of the subject, is apt to seem fulsome, while a nice sense of propriety would not
							be the less wounded by a dry abstract containing nothing but names and dates. To sum
							up a career which is not yet ended would appear like recording events which have not
							yet transpired, since justly to estimate the scope and meaning of a history it is
							important that we have the closing chapter. In writing biographical notice, therefore,
							the chronicler from the moment he takes up his pen should consider the subject as no
							longer among his contemporaries, for thus he will avoid the fear of offending by
							bestowing praise where it is merited and escape the risk of giving but a fragmentary
							view of that which must eventually be taken as a unit. At some risk, therefore, the
							writer assumes the task of placing on record the life and character of a man who, by
							the force of strong individuality, has achieved eminent success in the vocations to
							which he has addressed himself and has won for himself an enviable place among the
							leading men of the city and county honored by his citizenship.</p>

						<p>W. A. Rushton, one of the leading citizens of Plainfield, Indiana, was born in
							Liberty township, Hendricks county, Indiana, April 4, 1874. His <pb id="VAC1000-639"
								n="590"/> parents were Ira and Talitha (Bray) Rushton, both of whom were natives of
							this county. His father was a leader in church work and helped to establish the Salem
							Methodist Episcopal church. Ira Rushton was born August 13, 1830, and died November
							22, 1912, spending his entire life in Hendricks county. His widow is still living on
							the old home farm in Liberty township. Mr. and Mrs. Ira Rushton were the parents of
							twelve children, nine of whom are still living: Mrs. Evaline Cravens, of Hinsdale,
							Kansas; Mrs. Laura E. Morrison, of Liberty township; James WV., of Indianapolis;
							Carrie, of Amarillo. Texas; Guy, of Liberty township; Mrs. Ola M. McCracken, of
							Monrovia, Indiana, and two sons who are still at home, Howard and Raymond.</p>

						<p>W. A. Rushton was reared on his father's farm and spent the life of the ordinary
							farmer's boy until he was twenty-one years of age, receiving his education in the
							district schools of his nieghborhood and later took a high school course at
							Belleville. With the intention of taking up teaching as a profession, he enrolled in
							the Tri-State College at Angola, Indiana, where he took the teachers' course. He began
							teaching in 1897 and only taught a part of one year. In 1898 he took up his present
							life work of an undertaker, and has continued in that business until the present time.
							He started in with the late William H. Hiss, a furniture dealer and undertaker of
							Plainfield, and remained with him for three years. He then went to Indianapolis and
							was manager of the Flanner &amp; Buchanan undertaking establishment for four years. In
							January, 1905, he bought out William Hiss, of Plainfield, and has since conducted the
							business under his own name. He understands every phase of his business, being an
							especially competent embalmer, and because of his painstaking attention to the
							important duties incumbent upon him in his profession, and his innate courtesy in all
							his associations with his patrons, he has earned a warm place in the esteem of those
							who know him.</p>

						<p>While working in Indianapolis, Mr. Rushton was married, on October 28, 1903, to
							Cophine Mills, daughter of William H. and Anna Mills, of Hendricks county, and to this
							union there have been born two daughters, Lois Mona and Marcia Dena.</p>

						<p>Mr. Rushton has been affiliated with the Democratic party since reaching his
							majority, but owing to the nature of his business he has never been active in

						<p>James C. Stafford, one of the large number of physicians in the same family, was born
							September 14, 1881, near Newcastle, Henry county, Indiana. His parents, John E. and
							Alpharetta (Nicholson) Stafford, were both natives of the same county and were born on
							adjoining farms. His father is a prosperous farmer in Henry county, Indiana, today,
							both parents being still living. Doctor Stafford is the only child in the family.</p>

						<p>Dr. Daniel Hastings Stafford, the subject's grandfather, graduated from the
							Physio-Medical Institute of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1866, and practiced mostly in Henry
							county, Indiana, where his death occurred in 1900. He had three sons who were doctors,
							James A., of Newcastle, Indiana; Lindley, deceased, and William H., deceased, who
							practiced at Blountsville, Indiana. Daniel H. Stafford had also four grandsons who
							were doctors, W. H., of Newcastle; C. A. and Lindley H., at Indianapolis, and James
							C., of Plainfield.</p>

						<p>Doctor Stafford received his common school education in district schools of his home
							neighborhood and then graduated from the Rich Square high school in Henry county in
							1898. Since this was only a three years' course, he graduated from the Newcastle high
							school in 1901 and then spent one year in the State University at Bloomington,
							Indiana. However, the call of the physician was not to be denied, and as a result he
							decided to enter the Indiana Physio-Medical College at Indianapolis, where he took the
							full four years' course, entering the fall of 1904, and graduating with the class of
							1908. He came to Plainfield in November, 1908, and here he opened up an office for the
							general practice of medicine, and has never regretted his choice of <pb
								id="VAC1000-641" n="592"/> locations. His practice has gradually improved and he now
							has his share of the patronage of the community.</p>

						<p>Doctor Stafford was married August 13, 1905, to Lura White, the daughter of Joseph
							and Sarah White, of Linden, Montgomery county, Indiana, and to them have been born
							three children, James Linden, born March 31, 1907; Lura Catherine, born August 13,
							1909, and William Clayton, born June 10, 1913. Doctor Stafford is a member of the
							Hendricks county and Indiana State medical societies, and is a wide reader of all
							kinds of medical literature. He keeps well informed on all the progressive methods of
							treating disease and his office is well equipped with all the up-to-date appliances
							which are found in the modern office of the best physicians.</p>

						<p>Doctor Stafford is a member of the Knights of Pythias, holding the office of past
							chancellor of the Plainfield lodge of that order. Although he was reared a Republican,
							he is not a partisan by any means, but in all local elections he votes for the man
							rather than for any particular party. However, he is well read on the political issues
							of the day and can discuss them intelligently. It is an interesting fact that there
							have been eight physicians in the Stafford family, the original Doctor Stafford having
							been born at Greensboro, Indiana, his parents coming to this state from North Carolina
							in an early day. Doctor Stafford gives all his time and attention to his practice and
							is rapidly being regarded as one of the most successful physicians of this section of
							the state. As a successful physician he has made friends throughout the county and
							retains the respect and esteem of all classes of people.</p>

							an enterprising, progressive man of affairs which the public has not been slow to
							recognize and appreciate.</p>

						<p>Joshua S. Tharp, one of the representative citizens of Brownsburg and for some time
							president of the Brownsburg Bank, was born on November 8, 1838, in Hendricks county,
							Indiana, and is the son of James and Mary (Yount) Tharp, the former of whom was a
							native of Shelby county, Kentucky, and a son of John and Rebecca (Lee) Tharp, both
							natives of that county, who came to Indiana at a later date, settling in Hendricks
							county about five miles north of Danville. James Tharp remained under the parental
							roof in the Kentucky home until he was eighteen years of age, when he married, and
							together he and his young wife came to Hendricks county, Indiana, on horseback,
							leading a pack horse with a few of their cherished possessions. This was in 1828 and
							they took up their abode west of Danville, on Mill creek, being among the very first
							settlers in that locality. He was among the very few who did not enter government
							land, and he passed the remainder of his life on the home place he secured when first
							coming to Indiana. He was the father of ten children, among whom was Joshua S., the
							immediate subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>Joshua S. Tharp remained with his father until he was twenty-one years of age, when
							he was united in marriage with Mary J. Fausset, when they took up their residence on
							his grandfather's farm, where they remained for fifteen years, making their home with
							his uncle, William Tharp, until the time of his death. They then took up their
							residence on their own farm, about a half-mile north of his uncle's homestead, and
							there they resided for twenty-five years. They later removed to Pittsboro, where they
							remained for less than a year, and from there came to Brownsburg, which they have
							since made their home. Mr. Tharp disposed of his farm north of Danville in 1906, when
							he purchased one hundred and sixty acres in Brown township, Hendricks county, and also
							purchased town property in Brownsburg, two of the pieces being business blocks.</p>

						<p>Mr. Tharp has been twice married. His first wife, Mary J. Fausset, who died in 1883,
							was a daughter of Robert Fausset and wife. To Mr. Tharp, by his first wife, were born
							ten children, namely: Willard, who died young; Isaac Wesley, who married Julia Noland
							and has four children, one of which died in infancy and the others being married;
							Edith, the eldest, is the wife of Raymond Smith and lives north of Danville; Clarence,
							who <pb id="VAC1000-644" n="594"/> married Lessie Day, lives on the same farm north of
							Danville; the other child is Hollis, who remains at home. Another son of Joshua S.
							Tharp, James, died while young. Arie O. became the wife of William S. Elmore, residing
							a mile and a half south of Pittsboro, and have a family of eight children. William R.
							resides in Indianapolis. His wife was an Indianapolis girl and they have a family of
							three children. Cora E. married Dan Hendricks and is living about five miles north of
							Danville. Geneva married Willard O. Johnson. They reside northeast of Pittsboro and
							have a family of four children. Florence, who resides in Lizton, is the wife of Edgar
							Biggs and has one child. H. Edgar Tharp married Minnie Graham and lives four miles
							north of Brownsburg. He is an auctioneer and is very well known all over the county.
							Mary J., the youngest child, died while young. In 1885 Mr. Tharp united in marriage
							with Rachael R. (Hendricks) Harrison. She is the daughter of Peter and Mary Ann
							(Woodworth) Hendricks and was born in Putnam county, Indiana, near Maysville, in 1845.
							Her parents were natives of the state of Kentucky, coming to Putnam county soon after
							their marriage. They raised a family of nine children. In 1860 she was united in
							marriage with Benjamin Harrison, whose death occurred in 1882. To their union were
							born eight children, four of whom are still living. Ora, one of her daughters, is the
							wife of Eddie Jack and the mother of four children. They live in Indianapolis. William
							H., a son, married Carrie Pelcher and they reside with their four children in
							Centralia, Washington. Francis M. took as his wife Hattie Thomas and they also have a
							family of four children and make their home north of Danville. Edgar, who has two
							children, married Marie Craven and makes his home in Tipton.</p>

						<p>Politically a Democrat, Mr. Tharp has been for many years actively interested in the
							welfare of his community. He served on the county board of review in 1913 and also in
							1914, and is one of the best posted men in the county as to land valuations of the
							county. He has ever done all within his power to advance the moral and material
							interests of his locality. That Mr. Tharp is enterprising in his operations is
							evidenced by the fact that his business interests are varied. He was president of the
							Brownsburg Bank, both as a private bank and since it was made a state bank; buys and
							sells wool, sells insurance and has many other duties devolving upon him in connection
							with the property he owns both in town and country. For twenty-seven years he was a
							director of the Hendricks County Mutual Fire Insurance Company. Fraternally, he is a
							member of the Free and Accepted Masons and both Mr. and Mrs. Tharp are members of the
							Order of the Eastern Star. Religiously, <pb id="VAC1000-645" n="595"/> they are
							members of the Baptist church and are sincerely interested in the workings of
							same.</p>

						<p>Mr. Tharp is a man who has ever made his influence felt for good in his community,
							being a man of sterling worth, whose life has been closely interwoven with the history
							of the community in which he resided. The well regulated life he has led, thereby
							gaining the respect and admiration of all his fellow citizens, entitles him to

						<head><hi rend="center">RICHARD D. PLUMMER.</hi></head>

						<p>The Plummer family has been identified with the history of Hendricks county, Indiana,
							since 1825, and during this period of nearly ninety years they have taken their part
							in the civic, moral, educational and religious life of their respective communities in
							such a way as to stamp them as a family of excellent characteristics. Richard D.
							Plummer has spent his whole career of more than three score years in this county, and
							no more public-spirited citizen has ever lived within the limits of the county. The
							interests of his county has been one of the mainsprings of his actions and he has done
							many disinterested deeds which stand to his credit. Starting life under pioneer
							conditions, he has risen to a position of prominence and during his long career in the
							county has aided in every way the growth of its material interests and the progress of
							its prominent industries.</p>

						<p>Richard D. Plummer, the proprietor of three farms in this county, aggregating three
							hundred and eighty-nine acres, was born on June 24, 1848, in Eel River township, this
							county. He is a son of Joseph and Ann (Day) Plummer, his father being a native of
							Greene county, Ohio, born on October 17, 1813, the son of Levi and Mary Plummer. Levi
							Plummer was born in Maryland and his wife in this state, and in 1815 they came to
							Fayette county, Indiana, where they lived for five years. They then moved to Morgan
							county, this state, and, after a residence of five years in that county, came to
							Hendricks county and spent the remainder of their days in this county.</p>

						<p>Joseph Plummer, the father of Richard D., was reared to manhood amid the scenes of
							pioneer life in this county and received only a meager common school education. He was
							married August 2, 1832, to Ann Day, in Morgan <pb id="VAC1000-646" n="596"/> county,
							this state, and to this union were born nine children, Mary, Martha, Thomas, Levi,
							Hannah, Fannie, John, Ann and Richard D. The mother of these children died January 18,
							1870, and on May 14, 1872, Joseph Plummer married Lydia Burgen, the daughter of Isaac
							and Sarah Burgen, who were among the early settlers of Hendricks county. In the spring
							of 1835 Mr. Plummer settled in the eastern portion of Eel River township, where he
							lived the life of a prosperous farmer until his death, in November, 1896. He had
							started in life with nothing, but by careful business methods and strict attention to
							his business he became the owner of five hundred and sixty-five acres of excellent
							farming land in this county.</p>

						<p>Richard D. Plummer has lived his whole life in Eel River and Center townships. He
							attended the rude log school houses of his home neighborhood during his boyhood days
							and assisted his father on the farm during his summer vacations. The schools of that
							day were only three months in length and the instruction was confined principally to
							reading, writing and arithmetic. Mr. Plummer has devoted his whole life to
							agricultural pursuits and has met with a measure of success which has been
							commensurate with his efforts. He married in 1872, and in 1876 bought his first farm
							of eighty acres, and to this he has added from time to time until he is now the owner
							of three hundred and ninety acres of land in the county. He is a man of powerful
							physique and has done a great deal of hard manual labor in his time. In the days when
							wheat was cut with the cradle, he could cut as much wheat as any man in the
							neighborhood and keep it up day after day.</p>

						<p>Mr. Plummer was married August 20, 1872, to Mary E. Margason, the daughter of John
							and Elizabeth (Griggs) Margason, early settlers of Center township, this county. The
							Margasons came from Kentucky to Jefferson county, Indiana, and later settled in this
							county, where they purchased land in Center township. Mr. and Mrs. Plummer are the
							parents of five children: Horace, a manufacturing jeweler and engraver in
							Indianapolis, with offices in the State Life building in that city; Marsalice, who is
							now in the West; Lydia is the wife of Richard Harrison, of Danville, and the mother of
							two children, Roy and Evangeline; Lula, who is still living with her parents; Oliver
							Earl, who is the chemist for a gypsum factory in Ohio, was recently married to Dora
							Padget.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Plummer is a supporter of the Republican party. The high standing
							which he occupies among the agriculturists of Hendricks county is attributable largely
							to his indefatigable perseverance and untiring energy. While his private affairs
							naturally receive the major portion of his time and <pb id="VAC1000-647" n="597"/>
							attention, yet he is interested in matters of public interest and is prominent in the
							local affairs of his community. In business circles he is respected by all with whom
							he comes in contact and occupies a foremost position among the representative citizens
							of his county.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOSEPH C. MORGAN.</hi></head>

						<p>The following is a brief sketch of one who, by close attention to business, has
							achieved marked success in the world's affairs and risen to an honorable place among
							the enterprising men of the county with which his interests are identified. It is a
							plain record, rendered remarkable by no strange or mysterious adventure, no wonderful
							and lucky accident and. no tragic situation. Mr. Morgan is one of those estimable
							citizens whose integrity and strong personality must force them into an admirable
							notoriety, which their modesty never seeks, who command the respect of their
							contemporaries and their posterity and leaves the impress of their individuality upon
							the age in which they live.</p>

						<p>Joseph C. Morgan, a plasterer and public-spirited citizen of Plainfield, was born
							April 3, 1859, at Monrovia, Morgan county, Indiana. His parents were William H. and
							Maria (Marvin) Morgan, his father being a native of Kentucky and his mother of Ohio.
							His father was born in 1824 and learned the trade of a plasterer in Kentucky before
							coming to Morgan county, in 1855. In 1863 William Morgan moved to Plainfield, Indiana,
							where he followed his trade until his death, in 1894, at the age of seventy. He was a
							prominent Mason and was always very much interested in the affairs of the lodge. Mr.
							and Mrs. William Morgan were the parents of seven children, all of whom are living:
							Joseph C., the immediate subject of this sketch; O. P., of Plainfield; Mrs. Rolena
							Hagee, of Plainfield; Mary, who has been a teacher in the Plainfield schools for the
							past twenty years; Nannie, of Monrovia, Indiana; and Mrs. Minnie Bridges, the wife of
							Doctor Bridges, of Plainfield.</p>

						<p>Joseph C. Morgan was given a good practical education in the public schools of
							Plainfield, and when a small lad began to help his father. He was thus early initiated
							into all of the details of the plasterer's trade and there is no trick in the trade
							with which he is not familiar. It is safe to say that there is no more efficient and
							artistic workman in this section of the state than Mr. Morgan, and as a result he has
							always had all the work he could handle, and yet his customers have been perfectly
							satisfied with his work in every particular.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-648" n="598"/>

						<p>Joseph C. Morgan has never married, but for many years has lived with his aunt in
							Plainfield. He owns a fine home, which is equipped with all the modern conveniences.
							In his fraternal relations he is affiliated with the Free and Accepted Masons and the
							Independent Order of Odd Fellows for the past twenty-five years. He has always voted
							the Republican ticket, and while he keeps well informed on all the current questions
							of the day, he has never been a seeker after political preferment.</p>

						<p>The family history of Mr. Morgan is of more than ordinary interest, and he is
							justified in being proud of his progenitors on both sides of the family. His mother's
							father, Clare Marvin, was a pioneer of Morgan county, Indiana, having settled near
							Monrovia about 1840. Clare Marvin was born in New York city, and was in the War of
							1812, taking part in the siege of Baltimore. The Marvin family is of English descent,
							the first representative of the family coming to America in 1793. Nancy Marvin,
							another one of the early members of the family to come to America, was born in London
							in 1788, and died in Morgan county, Indiana, in 1892, at the advanced age of one
							hundred and four years. She retained her faculties to the last and it was from her
							that most of the family history has been obtained.</p>

						<p>Joseph C. Morgan has lived a life of usefulness and has always taken an active part
							in the civic life of the community where he has resided for so many years. Personally,
							he is genial and companionable, enjoys a wide acquaintance throughout this section of
							the state, and is a popular member of the circle in which he moves.</p>

							January 6, 1894, while his mother was born May 14, 1821, and died January 6, 1870.
							John H. Brill was a stage driver for many years and covered the route from Winchester,
							Virginia, to Knoxville, Tennessee. When Jonah S. was about one year old, his father
							came with his family to Indiana, settling in Liberty township, Hendricks county, where
							they lived until 1867, when they moved to Sheridan county, Missouri. John H. Brill and
							his wife both died in that state. They reared a large family of thirteen children,

							Charles W., of Lampher, Colorado, and Mrs. Harriett E. Elliott, of Forest Green,
							Missouri.</p>

						<p>Jonah S. Brill came to Hendricks county from Virginia with his parents when he was a
							mere babe in arms and has lived here all his life except five years, when he lived in
							Sheridan county, Missouri. His education was received in this state and he finished
							his educational training in Missouri, where he lived from 1867 to 1872. At the age of
							twenty he began to learn the trade of a carriage trimmer in Indianapolis, and
							continued to work at this occupation for six years. He then took up farming in Liberty
							township, this county, and continued to follow the vocation of a farmer until 1897,
							when he removed to Plainfield and left the active operation of the farm to younger
							hands. A few years ago, in 1907, he sold his farm and is now living a retired life in
							Plainfield.</p>

						<p>Mr. Brill was married October 27, 1880, to Nannie Williams, the daughter of Nathan C.
							and Katherine (McPherson) Williams. The one child born to this union died in infancy.
							Mr. and Mrs. Brill are both devoted and consistent members of the Methodist Episcopal

							Masons, but has never taken an active part in politics, although he has always voted
								<pb id="VAC1000-650" n="600"/> with the Democratic party. Mr. Brill has the

						<p>Among the thriving farmers and stock raisers of Hendricks county the gentleman whose
							name introduces this article is especially conspicuous. Starting out with practically
							no capital or assistance, he has gradually forged to the front and has long since
							become one of the substantial citizens of his community, which he has seen develop to
							a foremost position in agricultural importance, and it is useless to add that he has
							played an important role in this work, having always had the affairs of his locality
							at heart and ready at all times to further any laudable undertaking having as its
							object the general good.</p>

						<p>Martin Luther Johnson, one of the prosperous farmers of Middle township, was born in
							1853 in Boone county, Indiana. His parents were Patrick and Clemens (Hanna) Johnson.
							Patrick Johnson was a native of Kentucky and came in 1829 to Boone county with his
							parents when he was eleven years of age. His father entered eighty acres near
							Brunswick, upon first settling in Boone county, but in 1865 moved into Hendricks
							county and bought one hundred and sixty acres of land in Brown township. He received
							his deed on the same day that Lincoln was shot, April 14, 1865. Patrick Johnson, in
							addition to his farming, bought and sold a large amount of stock, driving his stock to
							Indianapolis to market. He continued to farm his one hundred and sixty acres until
							about two years before his death, which occurred November 22, 1906. The wife of

							<pb id="VAC1000-652" n="601"/> Kentucky, who came to Boone county with her parents
							when a small girl. She died in 1905. Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Johnson were the parents of
							a large family of thirteen children: George H., Mrs. Mary Johnson (deceased), James
							F., John C., Albert N., Martin Luther, Mrs. Nancy E. Burks, Mrs. Martha Caroline
							Cassaday, William P., Wilson T., Willard P., Mrs. Hanna Florence Davis and Herbert
							M.</p>

						<p>Martin Luther Johnson spent the first twelve years of his life in Boone county and
							there received part of his education. After moving to this county he attended school
							for several years, receiving most of his schooling in Hendricks county. When he was
							married he only had twenty acres, but by honest endeavor and hard toil he has added to
							his land holdings from time to time, until now he owns a farm of one hundred and forty
							acres. He raises the crops of this locality and adds to his annual income by handling
							a considerable amount of live stock every year. In 1899 he built a large barn and has
							his whole farm improved in every way, in order to produce the best results with the
							minimum amount of effort. For fifteen years he operated a threshing machine outfit in
							connection with his farming, deriving no small income from this line of business.</p>

						<p>Mr. Johnson was married in 1876 to Leonora Schenck, the daughter of Isaac Harvey and
							Nancy J. (Harris) Schenck. Isaac Schenck was born in Butler county, Ohio, and his wife
							in Pulaski county, Kentucky. After marriage Mr. and Mrs. Schenck settled in Brown
							township, where he died in 1895 and she in 1912. Mr. and Mrs. Schenck were the parents

							Tilghman Howard, deceased; Mrs. Caroline Pitzer, deceased; Mary Ellen, deceased; Levi
							H.; Samuel Riley; James B.; Leonora, the wife of Mr. Johnson; Thomas Jefferson and

							living and five are married. Emma is deceased. The daughters living are: Mrs. Della
							Garner, Mrs. Ota Weaver, Mrs. Luella Stonebreaker, Mrs. Pearl Coleman, Miss Mary Etta
							Johnson and Mrs. Fern Hubble.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Johnson has always advocated the principles of the Republican party
							and has never seen any reason why he should change his adherence to that of any other
							party. He and his wife are members of the Regular Baptist church and he is a deacon
							and trustee in the church. Mr. Johnson has made a success of his life work, because he
							has been a hard worker and honest in his dealings with his fellow men. He is known

						<head><hi rend="center">REV. JOSEPH N. GREENE.</hi></head>

						<p>The life of the scholarly or professional man seldom exhibits any of those striking
							incidents that seize upon public feeling and attract attention to himself. His
							character is generally made up of the aggregate qualities and qualifications he may
							possess as these may be elicited by the exercise of the duties of his vocation or the
							particular profession to which he belongs. The highly honored and esteemed subject of
							this sketch is a man of well rounded character, sincere, devoted and loyal, so that
							there are many salient points which render consonant a tribute to him in this
							compilation. He has not been content to hide his talents amid life's sequestered ways,
							but has by force of will and a laudable ambition to succeed, forged to the front into
							a position which stamps him as a man of extraordinary ability. His life has been one
							of hard study and he stands today a man well equipped to perform his work in life.
							There is no higher calling than that of a minister of the Gospel and the good that he
							does never receives its full reward in this world. Rev. Joseph N. Greene has not only
							made a notable success as a minister, but has also earned a wide reputation as a
							lecturer on Shakesperian subjects. In addition he has entered the literary field and
							produced three books which have added not a little to his prestige.</p>

						<p>Rev. Joseph N. Greene, now pastor of the Broadway Methodist Episcopal church of
							Indianapolis, and a former resident of Danville, Indiana, was born in Valparaiso,
							Indiana, June 25, 1868. His parents were Nelson and Mary Jane (Funk) Greene, his
							father also being a minister in the Methodist church. Nelson Greene was a native of
							Ohio and came to this state as a young man, married at Warsaw and was a pastor in the
							Methodist churches of Indiana for more than half a century. Among the places where he
							held charges were Warsaw, Valparaiso, Brazil, Greencastle, Marion and Danville. He
							first came to Danville about 1869 and upon his retirement from the ministry he bought
							a home in that town and continued to reside there until his death, September 29, 1910.
							Mr. and Mrs. Nelson Greene were the parents of eight children, six of whom are living:
							Mrs. M. A. Keeney, of Danville; Edward J., of Danville; Charles, of West Lafayette;
							Mrs. John F. Way, of Mitchell, <pb id="VAC1000-654" n="603"/> South Dakota; Anan C.,
							of South Bend, Indiana. His widow, the mother of Rev. Greene, is still living at
							Danville at the advanced age of eighty-six.</p>

						<p>Rev. Joseph N. Greene received his elementary and high school education in the public
							schools of Danville and his theological training in the Boston School of Theology,
							graduating from the latter institution in 1897. Immediately after graduating from the
							high school he went into business in Danville, but within a short time he began to
							make preparations to enter the ministry. By the time he was twenty-six years of age he
							had passed all of the examinations and was admitted to the Northwest Indiana
							conference. Then in order to prepare himself for more efficient work he entered the
							Boston School of Theology and after completing the course in that school he received a
							call to the Grace Methodist Episcopal church at Terre Haute (1897-1899). The
							appointments which he has held since that time are as follows: Williamsport, Indiana
							(1899-1901); Maple Avenue church, Terre Haute (1901-1905); Brazil, Indiana
							(1905-1910); Watertown, South Dakota (1910-1912); Broadway church, Indianapolis (1910
							to the present time). All of these appointments have been under the Northwest Indiana
							conference except the Watertown charge, which was under the jurisdiction of the Dakota
							conference, and the Broadway, Indianapolis, charge, which is in the Indiana
							conference.</p>

						<p>Rev. Greene was married to Adah L. Titus, of Williamsport, the daughter of Mr. and
							Mrs. Jesse W. Titus, on October 18, 1900. They have one son, Warren Nelson, born
							October 18, 1912.</p>

						<p>The minister who can reach the public through the printed page is an exception and if
							he can do so his field of usefulness is vastly increased. Rev. Greene is one of the
							very few ministers who can write as well as preach, and two of his books have had many
							favorable notices. His first volume was entitled "The Gospel in Literature" and is a
							book of genuine merit. In it he displays a wide range of scholarship and erudition
							which gives to the book a solidity often lacking in volumes of a similar nature. His
							second publication, "The Funeral," is for the use of ministers and the hearty
							reception which it has received indicates that it is of real worth. A third book,
							under the title "The Exalted Fisherman," has just been issued by the Methodist Book
							Concern of Cincinnati and New York.</p>

						<p>Rev. Greene has always been a student of literature and has made a special study of
							Shakespeare. He frequently gives lectures on Shakesperian subjects before literary
							clubs, on such topics as "The Women of Shakespeare," "The Supernatural in
							Shakespeare," "Hamlet," and "Retributive Justice in Shakespeare." In these lectures he
							displays a deep insight in the literature of <pb id="VAC1000-655" n="604"/> the
							Elizabethan period and analyzes the mysteries of the Bard of Avon in a manner which
							bespeaks the profound student.</p>

						<p>It is interesting to note that while Rev. Greene was the pastor of the Brazil church,
							he was the moving figure in the movement to increase the attendance of the Sunday
							school. The result has been that the Sunday school in that town now is the largest in
							the world.</p>

						<p>Rev. Greene is quite actively interested in public affairs, taking the part of a good
							citizen in public measures and reforms; strong and alert, energetic and persistent, he
							has had marked influence for good in his community. In his politics he is independent,
							always voting for the best men regardless of their political affiliations. In all the
							pastorates he has held he has been popular and has built up the congregation,
							strengthened the work in all its departments and quickly won his way into the
							affections of his parishioners. He is profoundly versed in theology, a scholarly,
							high-minded, whole-souled gentleman, fearless in his denunciation of sin wherever
							found and, above all, a man who has the courage of his convictions. As a pulpit orator
							he is surpassed by few, always logical, forceful, earnest and often truly eloquent.
							Truly, he is a born leader of men, and as Shakespeare has said, "His life was gentle
							and the elements so mixed in him that the whole world might stand up and say, This was
							a man."</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">FRANK JOHNSON.</hi></head>

						<p>Agriculture has been an honored vocation from the earliest ages and as a usual thing
							men of honorable and humane impulses, as well as those of energy and thrift, have been
							patrons of husbandry. The free, out-of-door life of the farm has a decided tendency to
							foster and develop that independence of mind and self-reliance which characterizes
							true manhood and no truer blessing can befall a boy than to be reared in close touch
							with nature in the healthful, life-inspiring labor of the fields. It has always been
							the fruitful soil from which have sprung the moral bone and sinew of the country, and
							the majority of our nation's great warriors, renowned statesmen and distinguished men
							of letters were born on the farm and were indebted largely to its early influence for
							the distinction which they have attained.</p>

						<p>Frank Johnson, the proprietor of three hundred and twenty acres of fine farming land
							in Franklin township, Hendricks county, Indiana, was born in Morgan county, this
							state, April 20, 1858. His parents were Wesley and <pb id="VAC1000-656" n="605"/> Mary
							(Garrison) Johnson, his father being a native of North Carolina and his mother of
							Indiana. When Wesley Johnson was about seven years of age he came to this county from
							North Carolina with his father, who entered government land in Morgan county. Wesley
							Johnson received the very meager education which was afforded by the subscription
							schools of his day and when a mere lad started to work on his father's farm, where he
							learned as a lad all those lessons which must be a part of every successful farmer's
							equipment, and his success in after life may be in a large part attributed to the
							excellent teaching received at the hands of his father along agricultural lines. He
							continued on the farm with his father until his marriage, and, in fact, lived all of
							his life on the farm, except one year which he spent in Danville. Mr. and Mrs. Wesley
							Johnson were the parents of two children, Frank, the immediate subject of this sketch,
							and Elizabeth, who married Oscar Weasner, and they have four children, Lee, Mary, Ina
							and Willis.</p>

						<p>Frank Johnson was educated in the common schools of Hendricks county and during his
							school days he worked on his father's farm during the summer, so that by the time he
							was twenty-one years of age he had received from his father a practical course in
							agriculture. When he reached his majority he married, rented a farm and started in to
							make his fortune with his good wife How well they have succeeded may be seen by the
							most casual observer who passes by his spacious residence and notes the broad fields
							which are his today. As a farmer and stock raiser he is the equal of any in this
							county of excellent farmers and his success is due to his persistent and persevering
							energy and good judgment in all things which pertain to the agricultural life.</p>

						<p>Mr. Johnson was married January 20, 1879, to Mary Newman, the daughter of Lacy and
							Maria (Phillips) Newman, and to them have been born two children, Luna, who died May
							3, 1899, and Clarence, who married Mabel Gambold, and they have three children, Allen,
							Edwin and Helen. Mr. Johnson's wife's parents were both natives of North Carolina, her
							father having come from that state to Indiana when he was eighteen years of age and
							settled with his father upon one hundred and sixty acres of land which he entered from
							the government. Mr. Newman died in 1892, his wife having passed away six years
							previous. Mr. and Mrs. Newman were the parents of six children: Laura, who died at the
							age of five years; Jane, who married Galen Robinson; Mary, the wife of Mr. Johnson;
							Martha, who married Frank Masten; George died at the age of seventeen years; Julia
							married Harrison Shields.</p>

						<p>Mr and Mrs. Johnson are both consistent and loyal members of the <pb id="VAC1000-657"
								n="606"/> Methodist Episcopal church at Stilesville, in the affairs of which they
							are much interested, Mr. Johnson being a trustee of the church. Mr. Johnson has been a
							stanch Republican for many years and although he takes a deep interest in the current
							questions of the day and political issues of the hour, he has never been a seeker for
							any public office. His extensive farming interests have demanded his time and
							attention so that he has not felt inclined to bother himself with the question of
							holding office. Mr. Johnson has a fine residence and keeps his farm in a highly
							cultivated state of improvement at all times. He has a reputation for honesty and
							integrity which has been the direct result of his square dealings throughout his long
							years of residence in this county. He is a man who has won the esteem of his fellow
							men by the daily touch of his life.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">CHARLES W. NEAL.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the well known farmers of a past generation who have been instrumental in
							placing Hendricks county in the front ranks of the agricultural counties of Indiana,
							was Charles W. Neal, who was born in Bourbon county, Kentucky, March 29, 1834, and
							died March 18, 1905, on his farm in Lincoln township, this county. His parents were
							Nathaniel and Sallie (Sandusky) Neal, his mother dying at his birth. She was the
							daughter of Jacob Sandusky, of Bourbon county, Kentucky. In the early history of the
							state Jacob Sandusky came to Indiana with twenty thousand dollars in his belt and
							walked around over the central part of the state barefooted and looking like a tramp
							in order to quietly pick out the best lands. He bought eleven hundred acres where
							Irvington now stands and four hundred and eighty acres two and one-half miles south of
							Brownsburg, six hundred and forty acres in Decatur county, this state, north of
							Greensburg, eight hundred acres in the south edge of Boone county and other lands in
							the central part of the state. However, he did not live on any of these tracts, but
							continued to reside in Kentucky, coming back to Indiana each year to look after his
							property and pay his taxes.</p>

						<p>Charles W. Neal never knew what it was to have a mother's protecting care and when he
							was four years of age he was taken away by relatives on horseback to Illinois, where
							he was kept for six years. He was then taken back to Kentucky, but remained there only
							a short time before he took a yearling colt, with a sheepskin for a saddle and a rope
							bridle, and, fording the Ohio river, he returned to his relatives in Illinois. The
							first pair of shoes the lad <pb id="VAC1000-658" n="607"/> had he earned by driving
							oxen at ten cents a day. He again returned to Kentucky and spent the remainder of his
							boyhood days, and in that state he was married, July 4, 1861, to Emma S. Bradley, the
							second of seven children born to Shelton and Mildred (Simpson) Bradley. His wife was
							born in Bourbon county, Kentucky, near Paris. It is interesting to note that both
							Charles Neal and his wife had been reared on farms where slaves did most of the work,
							and that neither of them had learned much of the hard realities of life when they were
							married. From his grandfather, Jacob Sandusky, he inherited four hundred acres of land
							two miles south of Brownsburg in Hendricks county, and in 1864 he and his wife came to
							this county to live. The only road to his farm was a blazed trail through the forests,
							swamps and underbrush, and the farm certainly could not have looked very inviting to
							him on the day on which he first saw it, as the land was low, wet, covered with a
							thick mat of underbrush. This was probably one reason why it had not been settled
							sooner. The Civil War had swept away what his family and relatives owned in Kentucky
							and that was one reason why he and his young wife decided to come to Indiana. They
							probably had little notion of the four hundred acres which was waiting for them in
							this county. Neighbors in Kentucky prophesied disaster for them in the new country,
							but Charles and his wife were not to be dismayed and with their little children they
							started in with brave hearts to make a living on their farm. For the first five years
							he did little farming, spending most of his time hunting. However, dire necessity made
							him forsake his gun for the hoe and axe, and he gradually began clearing his land and
							dealing in live stock, buying and selling throughout the county. He cleared his land,
							rolled his logs, burned brush just as though he had always been used to it, drained
							his land, improved and fenced it, erected buildings and built a house which was one of
							the best in the county at that time. It must be remembered that he had lived in a
							state where white men did little work and where the slaves did all of it, and for this
							reason it took some time for him to understand that in Indiana white men did all of
							the work.</p>

						<p>Charles W. Neal was a frank, plain-spoken man, even blunt of speech, but he had a
							host of friends who admired him for his sincerity. He was a man all the way through
							and was respected for his rugged honesty. He died in 1905, and his wife on September
							27, 1908. Four children were born to them: Tavner, whose history is given elsewhere in
							this volume; Claudia, the wife of Alonzo Turpin; Forest, who is living; Lorenzo,
							deceased. The children all live in the southern part of Lincoln township, or near the
							old home farm.</p>

						<p>The history of a county or state, as well as that of a nation, is chiefly a chronicle
							of the lives and deeds of those who have conferred honor and dignity upon society. The
							world judges the character of a community by those of its representative citizens and
							yields its tribute of admiration and respect to those whose works and actions
							constitute the record of a community's prosperity and pride. Among the prominent
							citizens of Hendricks county who are well known because of their success in business
							affairs and the part they have taken in the civic affairs of the locality is he whose
							name appears at the head of this article and who is now the efficient and popular
							president of the Pittsboro Bank.</p>

						<p>E. W. Sawyer, a business man of thirty years' experience in Pittsboro, Hendricks
							county, Indiana, was born in Sterling, Massachusetts, in 1854. He was given an
							excellent education and completed his schooling by graduating from the Lancaster
							Academy. He spent his boyhood and early manhood in the state of Massachusetts, where
							he operated a news-stand at Leominster for several years. In 1881 he came to Indiana
							and settled in Pittsboro, this county, where he worked for Oliver W. Hill in his
							general store. He showed a marked aptitude for business and in 1888 he was able to
							engage in business for himself. His worth as a citizen and the popularity in which he
							was held in his own town is shown by the fact that he was appointed postmaster of
							Pittsboro by President Benjamin Harrison in 1888. In 1895 he built the Sawyer block in
							his home town and continued in business for the next ten years in this building. In
							1909 he was elected president of the Pittsboro Bank and has continued to hold this
							important office since that time. In addition to his mercantile and banking interests
							he has also been interested in agriculture, having bought in 1898 the Samuel Hill farm
							of one hundred and forty acres, which he still owns and manages. He has proven as
							successful in the management of his farm as he did in his mercantile business. He is
							now living retired in Pittsboro, having given up the active management of his store
							and farm.</p>

						<p>Mr. Sawyer was married to Forest Dean Hill in 1884, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
							Oliver Hill. He and his wife are members of the Christian church in Pittsboro and take
							a very active interest in the various organizations of the church. Mr. Sawyer was
							elected a deacon and trustee of the church in 1905. He has made his way in the

						<p>The science of agriculture-- for it is a science as well as an art-- finds an able
							demonstrator as well as successful practitioner in the person of J. Wesley Ayers, who
							is widely known in Hendricks county, Indiana, maintaining a very productive and
							desirable farm in Franklin township. He comes of a very highly honored pioneer family,
							members, of which have played well their parts in the general development of this
							favored section of the great Indiana commonwealth.</p>

						<p>J. Wesley Ayers, the son of William P. and Mary E. (Bell) Ayers, was born in
							Danville, Indiana, April 4, 1865. His father was a native of Maryland, while his
							mother was born in this county. William P. Ayers came to Indiana from Maryland with
							his parents when he was about four years of age. He received his education in this
							county, and after leaving school he worked on his father's farm until his marriage, at
							the age of twenty. To Mr. and Mrs. William P. Ayers were born ten children: Laura, the
							wife of Aaron Aldredge; Leander; Alice, who married Bradley Tout and, after his death,
							Henry Roland; Miranda, the wife of Frank Ryland; Dora, who married James West; Clara,
							the wife of Charles Garrison and, after his death, Frank Whitlock; Charles, who
							married Delia Denny; Otis, deceased; Albert, and J. Wesley, the immediate subject of
							this review.</p>

						<p>J. Wesley Ayers secured his education by attending the common and high schools of
							Danville and attended the Central Normal College of Danville, and upon the completion
							of his education he came to Indianapolis, where he was in the employ of the Sherman,
							Occidental and Stubbins hotels as clerk for about four years. Upon the death of his
							father at Danville, he removed to the latter place and took up his father's occupation
							as brick maker and contractor, and for the succeeding eight years he followed this
							line of business, erecting, among other buildings, the First National Bank building,
							of Danville. He then purchased a farm and began operations as an agriculturist, <pb
								id="VAC1000-662" n="610"/> securing his first farm of sixty-two acres north of
							Danville, and he managed this place for the next ten years, after which time he sold
							this tract and bought sixty acres two and one-half miles east of Danville. Two years
							later he sold this land and purchased his present farm of sixty acres in Franklin
							township, known as the William Tincher farm, a farm which he has brought to a high
							state of cultivation and made attractive with a good home, outbuildings and other
							extensive improvements.</p>

						<p>Mr. Ayers was married April 2, 1908, to Ambrosia Hurst, the daughter of Charles R.
							and Mary E. (Bence) Hurst, and to this union there has been born one child, Mary
							Elizabeth. Mrs. Ayers' parents were both natives of Harrison county, Indiana, and Mrs.
							Ayers was born in that county. She has one brother, John, who married Frankie E.
							Thomas, and they live near Corydon, Indiana.</p>

						<p>Mr. Ayers has identified himself since his majority with the Republican party, but
							has never been an active participant in the campaigns of his party. He is a member of
							the Knights of Pythias and also of the Sons of Veterans. He and his wife are loyal and
							consistent members of the Methodist Episcopal church of Danville, and are liberal
							contributors to the support of this denomination. Owing to his genuine worth as a man
							and his genial disposition, he easily wins friends and has always retained them. He
							enjoys a marked degree of popularity in the locality where so many of his active years
							have been spent.</p>

						<p>The student interested in Hendricks county, Indiana, does not have to carry his
							investigation far into its annals before learning that Jesse Masten has long been one
							of the leading and active representatives of its agricultural interests and that his
							labors have proven a potent force in making this a rich farming region. Through
							several decades he has carried on farming, gradually improving his valuable place, and
							while he has prospered in this he has also found ample opportunity to assist in the
							material development of the county, and his co-operation has been of value for the
							general good.</p>

						<p>Jesse Masten, the proprietor of five hundred and fifty-five acres of fine farming
							land in Franklin township, Hendricks county, Indiana, was born in this township,
							February 26, 1847, the son of Reuben and Margaret (Garrison) Masten, both of whom were
							natives of North Carolina. Reuben Masten received his education in that state and
							after leaving school he worked on his <pb id="VAC1000-663" n="611"/> father's farm for
							a few years. After his marriage in North Carolina, he, together with his father, moved
							to Daviess county, Indiana, but remained there only a short time. He then came to
							Hendricks county and entered one hundred and sixty acres of land from the government
							in Franklin township, and there he lived the simple, unostentatious life of a farmer
							and was very successful in all his undertakings, having four hundred and seventy acres
							of land at the time of his death, October 10, 1892. Mr. and Mrs. Reuben Masten were
							the parents of eleven children: Hezekiah, who married Ann Jackson; John, deceased;
							Derias, who married Margaret DeMott; Mahala, the wife of David Pike, both deceased;
							Mary, who married Marshall Roberts, deceased; Matthias, who married Nancy Elmore;
							Harry, deceased; Sarah, deceased; Ann, deceased, who married L. Buis; Emmazetti, the
							wife of John Hodson, of Coatesville, Indiana, and Jesse, the immediate subject of this
							review.</p>

						<p>Jesse Masten received the best education which the country schools of Franklin
							township afforded in the stirring days preceding the Civil War. His education was
							naturally limited because there were no schools which really merited the name. After
							completing his meager educational training, he started to work with his father on the
							home farm. The land which his father had entered was a virgin forest, and the sound of
							the axe and the crackle of the burning brush was the finest kind of music to the ears
							of the pioneers of that day. While still a young man he was married to Mary Ellen
							Baird, the daughter of Boles and Emmeline (Coons) Baird, and to this union there were
							born six children: Irene, who married Albert Smith, and is the mother of three
							children, Nina, Carl and Jesse; Ira, who married Ida Bowen, and they are the parents
							of three children, Mabel, Vivian and Mary; Maude, who married Frank Powers, and is the
							mother of two children, Lucile and Ralph; Arthur married Elizabeth Powers, and Clyde
							and Willis, who are unmarried and at home.</p>

						<p>Mrs. Masten's parents were both natives of Kentucky and reared a family of eight
							children: William, who married Katie Starkey; Lucinda, the wife of Wesley Richardson;
							Eliza became the wife of Martin Mason; Bence, married Allie Bandy; Mary, wife of Mr.
							Masten; Frankie married Jacob Shoptaugh; Clay married Eva Marshall; Charles,
							deceased.</p>

						<p>Mr. Masten was reared to the life of a farmer and has never seen any good reason to
							forsake that time-honored calling, in which he has met with such distinctive success.
							On his splendid farm of five hundred and fifty-five acres in Franklin township he
							carried on general farming and also gives considerable attention to the breeding and
							raising of high grade live stock, having found this to be a very valuable and
							profitable auxiliary to his agricultural <pb id="VAC1000-664" n="612"/> interests. His
							farm is well improved in every respect and is a pleasing sight to the passerby.</p>

						<p>In politics Mr. Masten is a Progressive, having allied himself with that party upon
							its organization in the fall of 1912. He and his wife are interested in all movements
							looking toward the welfare of the community in which they live, Mrs. Masten being a
							member of the Missionary Baptist church at Coatesville. Mr. Masten is financially
							interested in the First National Bank at Coatesville and is now vice-president of that
							institution.</p>

						<p>Among the strong and influential citizens of Hendricks county the record of whose

							whose name appears above occupies a prominent place and for years he has exerted a
							beneficial influence in the locality where he resides. His chief characteristics are
							keenness of perception, a tireless energy, honesty of purpose and motive, and
							every-day common sense, which have enabled him not only to advance his own interests,
							but also largely contribute to the moral and material advancement of the
							community.</p>

						<p>John A. West, the proprietor of one hundred six and a half acres of land in Clay
							township, Hendricks county, was born March 8, 1867, in the county where he has spent
							his entire life. His father was also a native of this county, his birth having
							occurred near Pecksburg, in 1833, and died in Clay township, March 5, 1908. Columbus
							West, father of the subject, received a limited common school education in the schools
							of his day, and worked on his father's farm and in the grist mill and, after his
							marriage, began farming on a forty-acre tract which was given him by his father. He
							proved to be a remarkably successful farmer, and at one time had eight hundred and
							sixty acres of fine land in the county. He married Tabitha Staley, and to this union
							eight children were born: Ellen, deceased; Lucy, the wife of George Harvey; Jane, who
							married John Baron; Morton married Effie Walls; George married Alva Walls; Henry, who
							first married Albia Harlan and, after her death, Mary Bartholomew; Milo, who married
							Naomi Barow, and John A., the immediate subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>The West family trace their ancestry back to North Carolina, Abraham West,
							grandfather of John A., being a native of North Carolina, who <pb id="VAC1000-665"
								n="613"/> came to Hendricks county with his parents when he was a small boy. Upon
							reaching manhood he married Sinia Hadley, and to this union nine children were born:
							William; Washington, who married Lucinda Staley; Columbus, the father of John A.;
							Diego, who first married Endemile Asher, and, after her death, Elizabeth Whicker;
							Sipio, who married Della Parker; Ellen, deceased; Narcissus, who married Alpeus
							Harlan; Amanda, the wife of Allen Whicker; Malissa, the wife of Milton Asher, and who
							married Manly Justice after the death of her first husband.</p>

						<p>John A. West attended the district schools of Clay township, and was early initiated
							into all the mysteries of agriculture by his practical father. Upon becoming of age
							his father gave him a farm and he immediately decided to provide a helpmate for
							himself. Accordingly he was married to Ada B. Harrison, the daughter of William and
							Eliza (Bartholomew) Harrison, and through the many years during which they have walked
							together theirs has been truly a happy marriage. His wife's father was a native of
							Hendricks county, and followed the occupation of a farmer all his life. His wife,
							Eliza Bartholomew, was the daughter of Benjamin and Sabina, (Johnson) Bartholomew, and
							to them were born five children, Iva, Oscar, Ada (the wife of Mr. West), Benjamin and
							Wilma. Iva married Luther Trester; Oscar married Nettie Rushton; Benjamin died when
							small and Wilma is still unmarried. William Harrison was born in 1834 and died in
							1873. His wife was born in 1837, and her death occurred September 23, 1913. Thomas
							Harrison, the father of William Harrison, was a native of Kentucky, and later moved to
							Tennessee, from which state he moved to Hendricks county, Indiana, early after his
							marriage. He was married to Nancy Bryan, and to this union six children were born:
							John, who married Margaret Clark; Martha. the wife of Reuben P. Wall; William, who
							married Eliza Bartholomew; James and Nathan died when young; Thomas died in 1853; the
							grandmother surviving nearly a half century afterwards, passing away in 1899.</p>

						<p>Mr. West has always cast his ballot for the Republican party, because he felt that in
							this party were the leaders who were well qualified to direct the destinies of the
							nation. In his fraternal relations he is identified with the Independent Order of Odd
							Fellows, while, religiously, he is a loyal and consistent member of the Baptist church
							at Amo. He has always taken a keen interest in the various movements of his locality
							which were organized for the purpose of civic or intellectual betterment, and has
							always been a sympathetic helper in all such movements. His clean life and integrity
							of <pb id="VAC1000-666" n="614"/> high rank have won for him the approbation of a

						<head><hi rend="center">JAMES MONTGOMERY.</hi></head>

						<p>One of the sturdy pioneers of Hendricks county who has lived within its borders for
							more than three score and ten years is James Montgomery. His family were among the
							very first people in the county and during the whole history of the county the
							Montgomerys have been important factors in the material advancement of the county.
							They have seen the wilderness and swamps give way to broad, cultivated fields and
							flourishing towns and villages, and in all this change they have borne an honorable
							part.</p>

						<p>James Montgomery, the son of George and Nancy (Sturman) Montgomery, was born near
							Plainfield, Hendricks county, in 1841 and has spent his whole life in this county.
							When he was two years of age his father moved from Plainfield to Marion township and
							in this township James Montgomery has lived since that time. He was given the best
							education afforded by the subscription schools of his time and at an early age began
							to assist his father upon the farm. He remained at home until his marriage, at the age
							of twenty-one, when he started out for himself on a farm adjoining his father's, and
							remained on the same farm until he retired from active life.</p>

						<p>Mr. Montgomery was married in 1862 to Margaret Tharp, the daughter of James and Mary
							Tharp. A history of the Tharp family is given in the life of Joshua Tharp which is
							delineated elsewhere in this volume. To this first marriage there were born three
							children: George B. McClellan, who married Catherine Riggles, and has six children,
							Gertrude, Homer, Era, Harley, Lantus and Mary. George is now farming one mile west of
							New Winchester, but was formerly a merchant at Hadley and New Winchester. Louise
							Catherine, the second child of Mr. Montgomery, was the wife of John Neville, and died
							in November, 1900, leaving one daughter, Nellie. Nellie is the wife of Urban Olsen, of
							Pittsboro, and has one daughter, Louetta. The youngest child of Mr. Montgomery by his
							first marriage is Erasmus, who married Addie Patterson and has four children,
							Herschel, Lawrence, Clarence and Mabel. Erasmus is a farmer and lives in Union
							township near Montclair.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-667" n="615"/>

						<p>The first wife of Mr. Montgomery and the mother of the three children above mentioned
							died in 1869, and on November 17, 1870, Mr. Montgomery married Sarah Baker, the
							daughter of Jesse and Margaret (Clark) Baker. She was born in Putnam county in 1853.
							Her father was born near Lexington, Kentucky, the son of Andrew and Martha (Griggs)
							Baker, was reared in his native state, married Margaret Clark, of the same state, in
							1852, and immediately brought his young bride to Hendricks county. In the following
							year they moved to Putnam, but in a short time came back to Hendricks county. For
							fourteen years he was assessor in this county and then, after moving back to Putnam
							county, he was an assessor in that county for five years. He was also deputy assessor
							for a number of years under others who did not understand the work. He was regarded as
							the most expert man in this line of business that either county ever had. He was a
							Democrat and, with his wife, an attendant of the Regular Baptist church. He died
							February 22, 1909.</p>

						<p>By the second marriage there were four children, Nancy Jane, Oscar, Florence May and
							Charles Harlan. Nancy Jane was born June 17, 1872, and died June 18, 1890. Oscar was
							born April 14, 1878, and was married April 20, 1898, to Sallie Lane, the daughter of
							Thompson and Josephine (Creech) Lane. She was born in Tennessee and came to Hendricks
							county with her parents when she was five years old. They lived at North Salem until
							1910 when they moved to a farm near Danville, where they now reside. Oscar and his
							wife have three children, Mabel, Gladys, Mary Blanche and Walter Raymond. Florence May
							has been married twice, her first husband being Otha Sheets, and to this union there
							was born one daughter, Anna Mae; the second marriage of Florence May was to Thomas Cox
							and to this union there have been born two sons, Roy Harlan and James DeWayne. Mr. and
							Mrs. Cox live in Indianapolis at the present time. Charles Harlan, born September 25,
							1885, the youngest child of Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery, lives at New Castle where he
							manages a sales stable. He married Hallie Peyton and has one son, Donald Edwin.</p>

						<p>James Montgomery began manufacturing tile about 1884 near his home and continued in
							that business along with his farming for eight years. Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery are both
							members of the Regular Baptist church and are interested in all the activities of
							their denomination. Mr. Montgomery is a genial and unassuming man whose friends are
							numbered by his acquaintances.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">COL. GEORGE C. HARVEY.</hi></head>

						<p>George C. Harvey, a prominent lawyer of Danville, was born on August 9, 1860, on a
							farm near Rockville, Parke county, Indiana, the son of George C. and Martha Ann
							(Thompson) Harvey, his father also being a native of Parke county, and his mother of
							Kentucky. His mother was the daughter of James L. Thompson, a very prominent Methodist
							minister and author of a volume of sermons. His father was a young farmer at the
							opening of the Civil War and enlisted for service on September 15, 1861, in Company I,
							Thirty-first Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry. He was mustered in as captain and
							participated in the battles of Fort Henry and Donelson in the spring of 1862 and was
							killed on the first day of the battle of Shiloh, April 6, 1862. His mother was left
							with three small children and reared them to lives of usefulness and honor. She never
							remarried and is still living in Danville at the age of seventy-six. These children
							were James H., of Yazoo City, Mississippi; Mrs. Mary T. Hadley, the widow of Otis C.
							Hadley, who is now a teacher of art in the public schools of Lebanon, Indiana. For a
							number of years she was at the head of the art department in the Danville schools, and
							also the Central Normal College. She teaches for the love of art and cares nothing for
							the financial side of the profession. The third child is George C. Harvey, the
							immediate subject of this sketch, who was only about one year old when his father was
							killed in battle.</p>

						<p>Col. George C. Harvey was born in a log house which is still standing in Parke county
							about half way between Rockville and Bloomingdale. After his father's death in the
							Civil War, his mother, with her three children, moved to Attica, where they lived for
							a few years. Later they moved to Rockville, where they lived until 1875, when they
							came to Hendricks county. George C. Harvey then went on the farm of his guardian and
							remained there until the fall of 1879, when he entered Wabash College and completed
							the four-years course. He worked his way through college by putting in crops in the
							summer time and doing railroad contract work and, in fact, anything he could find to
							do. He at times worked in the auditor's office at Danville in order to make a little
							money to continue his course in college. While his vacation periods were as busy as
							they could possibly have been, he was not less employed while in school. In addition
							to carrying full college work and doing chores on the side, he read a great deal of
							law in the offices at Crawfordsville. In the summer of 1883, upon his graduation, he
							went into the office of Thaddeus S. Adams, of Danville, and continued with him until

							<figure>
								<p rend="center i">Geo. C. Harvey</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-670" n="617"/> the spring of 1887, but not as a partner. He was
							admitted to the bar in 1884, but had been deputy prosecuting attorney before that time
							in the justice of peace court, and might have been admitted to the bar before 1884,
							but he did not care for his admission until he had had a case in the circuit court. In
							July, 1887, he formed a partnership with George W. Brill, the present judge of
							Hendricks county, and this partnership continued until Judge Brill was elected in
							1912. Colonel Harvey has won an enviable name for himself in court and is known
							throughout the central part of Indiana as one of the best jury lawyers. He has had
							more than thirty murder cases in court, and has had a very large share of success in
							the general practice of Hendricks county. Recognizing his keen ability as a lawyer and
							as an analytical student of the law, corporations have frequently engaged him as
							counsel, and he has always been able to give good service to his clients.</p>

						<p>Colonel Harvey was married November 8, 1887, in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, to Lillian D.
							Drenan, the daughter of James P. and Mahala Drenan, of that city. To this union there
							have been born four children, Drenan R., born April 6, 1889, who is now practicing law
							with his father; George R., born August 17, 1890, who is also associated with his
							father in the practice of law; Martha A., born April 22, 1895, and John Parke, born
							June 10, 1902. Mr. and Mrs. Harvey are justly proud of their four children, and they
							have given them every educational advantage possible in order that they might be the
							best equipped for their future careers. It is a satisfaction to the parents to know
							that their children have fulfilled their expectations in every way and are in a fair
							way to make themselves recognized factors in the community in the future.</p>

						<p>Colonel Harvey was elected clerk of the city of Danville on four different occasions,
							a fact which attests his popularity in his home town. He was a member of the military
							staff of Governor Chase, and also of Governor Matthews with the rank of colonel. He
							has also been chief inspector of the infantry of the state. In 1890 he was elected
							colonel of the Sons of Veterans of the state of Indiana, and since that time has held
							the office of judge advocate general of the Sons of Veterans of the United States. He
							is a member of the Loyal Legion, the Free and Accepted Masons, both of the chapter and
							council, and while in college was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi Greek-letter
							fraternity. In his political relations he is a member of the Republican party and saw
							no reason in the fall of 1912 why he should sever his connection with that old and
							established party. Colonel Harvey is vice-president of -the Klondike Milling Company,
							of Danville, and is financially interested in that company. He is one of the directors
							of the Columbia Club of <pb id="VAC1000-671" n="618"/> Indianapolis and a stockholder
							in the same. Colonel Harvey has been a prominent figure in Hendricks county for many
							years and is still regarded as one of the best men of the Hendricks county bar. As he
							approaches the fall of life he will have the satisfaction of letting his mantle rest
							upon the shoulders of his two worthy sons, who are fast qualifying themselves to take
							up the work which their father has so well done in the past.</p>

						<p>Hendricks county, Indiana, enjoys a high reputation because of the high order of her
							citizenship, and none of her citizens occupies a more enviable position in the esteem
							of his fellows than the gentleman whose name appears at the head of this sketch. A
							residence here of nearly seventy years has given his fellows a full opportunity to
							observe him in the various lines of activity in which he has engaged and his present
							high standing is due solely to the honorable and upright course he has pursued. As a
							leading citizen of his community he is eminently entitled to representation in a work
							of this character.</p>

						<p>William Hunt, a gallant veteran of the Civil War and a prosperous farmer of this
							county, was born in Clay township, July 31, 1845, and has spent his three score and
							ten years in the county of his nativity. His parents were Albert and Lucinda
							(Hayworth) Hunt, his father being a native of North Carolina and his mother of
							Virginia. Albert Hunt came to this state when a small boy with his parents and located
							in Clay township, this county, where his father became one of the heaviest land owners
							of the county, having six hundred and forty acres of land at the time of his death,
							July 24, 1856. Albert Hunt was born August 10, 1818, and his wife, Lucinda Hayworth,
							was born February 18, 1821. They were married August Io, 1841, and to this union five
							children were born: Ira, who was killed in the battle of Gettysburg on July 3, 1863,
							was a member of Company I, Twenty-seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry; Rachel
							died in childhood; David married Melissa Hunt and has five children, Frank, Ira, Ida,
							Steven and Harry; David died September 3, 1900; Beulah died when young; William, the
							immediate subject of this sketch, was the third in order of birth of the five children
							born to his parents.</p>

						<p>William Hunt was educated in the district schools of his home township, and since he
							was only sixteen years old when the Civil War broke out, <pb id="VAC1000-672" n="619"
							/> he was not old enough for service. However, as soon as he reached the age of
							eighteen he enlisted in Company B, One Hundred Seventeenth Regiment Indiana Volunteer
							Infantry, and served for about eight months. At the close of his service he returned
							to his home county and worked at farm labor in his home township for about two years.
							He then married and went on to a farm of fifty-two acres, which he had inherited, and
							here he continued to reside for the next twenty years. He then moved to Amo in his
							home township, where he lived for the next fourteen years, at the expiration of which
							time he bought the farm of ninety-five acres on which he is living at the present
							time.</p>

						<p>William Hunt was married September 7, 1869, to Sarah E. Benbow, the daughter of Elam
							and Anna (Harley) Benbow, and to this union there has been born one child, Ettie, who
							married William E. Christie, and is the mother of four children, Iso, Blanche, Hubert
							and Christine. Iso married Stanley Hadley and has one child, J. Edward. Mrs. Hunt's
							father was a native of North Carolina, and her mother of Virginia. Elam Benbow came to
							Hendricks county about 1826 with his parents, who settled west of Amo, and he remained
							on the same farm until his death in 1892. His wife died in 1852, leaving a family of
							five children: Harvey, who married Louisa Atkins; Thirza, the wife of Woolson Bryant;
							Nancy J., the wife of Eli Duffey; Sarah E., wife of Mr. Hunt; Rhoda, the wife of
							George W. Tincher. The maternal grandparents of Mr. Hunt were Asher and Rachel
							(Johnson) Hunt. They reared a family of seven children: Elizabeth, wife of Ira Carter;
							Caleb, who married Mary Dickson; Eletha, the wife of Aaron Benbow; Albert, father of
							the immediate subject of this sketch; Margaret. wife of Mordecai Carter; Cynthia, wife
							of Newby Hodson; Beulah, who married Newton Carter, and Elmina, the wife of Jay
							Kersey.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hunt's wife died March 14, 1907, since which time he has been making his home
							with his children. He has been a life-long Republican, and his party recognized his
							sterling worth by electing him as township trustee for a term of six years.
							Religiously, he is affiliated with the Friends church, and has been an overseer in
							this denomination for the past twenty years. He is a member of the Grand Army of the
							Republic, and is one of the most active members of the post at Amo. William Hunt has
							spent a busy and useful life and now, in the declining years of his career, he can
							look back over a life which has been one of usefulness to his fellowmen, and his
							career during the long years of his residence in this locality has won for him a host

						<head><hi rend="center">GUY HARLAN.</hi></head>

						<p>One of the best known and enterprising of the younger agriculturists of Hendricks
							county is Guy Harlan, now in the very prime of life and usefulness, and his influence
							as an honorable, upright citizen is productive of much good upon all with whom he
							comes in contact. His past success gives assurance of something yet to come, and he is
							evidently destined to continue a potent factor for substantial good for many years to
							come. He lives on a fine farm in Franklin township, this county, which he conducts in
							a manner that stamps him as fully abreast of the times.</p>

						<p>Guy Harlan, the son of Smith and Barbara (Masten) Harlan, was born in Franklin
							township, Hendricks county, Indiana, June 24, 1885. Both of his parents were also
							natives of Hendricks county, his father having followed the occupation of a farmer all
							of his life until his retirement in 1913, when he moved to Indianapolis. To Mr. and
							Mrs. Smith Harlan were born four children: Harry, who married Daisy Quirk; Londa
							married Sylvia Hurst; Carey, unmarried, and Guy, the immediate subject of this review.
							The paternal grandparents of Guy Harlan were Jesse and Elizabeth (Boarders) Harlan,
							and to them was born one son, Smith, the father of the subject.</p>

						<p>Guy Harlan spent his boyhood in the manner of lads who are reared on the farm,
							attending the district schools of his neighborhood in the winter months and working on
							his father's farm during the summer. After finishing the course in the schools of Amo,
							Indiana, he worked as a lineman for the Big Four and the Terre Haute &amp; Eastern
							Railway Company for three years He then began farming as a hired hand and worked for
							various farmers in his home locality until March, 1913, when he moved on to his
							father's farm. He is now improving this farm and bringing it to a good state of
							cultivation. He has started a system of crop rotation which will increase the
							productivity of the soil, and in the short time in which he has had the management of
							the farm he has shown that he will be a successful farmer in the future.</p>

						<p>Mr. Harlan was married October 3, 1908, to Ella Underwood, the daughter of George and
							Nancy (Scott) Underwood. His wife's parents were natives of Kentucky and were married
							in that state, living there until 1902, when they located south of Clayton, Indiana.
							Mr. and Mrs. Underwood were the parents of nine children: Rosa, the wife of George
							Bennett; Mary, deceased; James, deceased; Georgia, the wife of David Dispain; Maria,
							the <pb id="VAC1000-674" n="621"/> wife of Joseph Ratliff; Mattie, who married John
							Van Cleave; William, who married Emma Scraggs; Ella, wife of Mr. Harlan; Emma, wife of
							Isaac Hendren. Mrs. Harlan's grandparents were Isaac and Maria (Druin) Underwood, and
							to them were born the following children: Nancy, Hiram, Thomas, Sallie, Ulysses,
							William, Martha and George.</p>

						<p>Mr. Harlan is a Socialist in politics, because he believes that the unrest and
							distress in this country is due to the unjust advantage which is taken of the laboring
							class by the capitalists of the country. He feels that in the tenets of the Socialist
							party there are the principles which, if judiciously applied, will alleviate much of
							the suffering in this country. Owing to the fact that his party is in a minority in
							his home county, he has never had any opportunity to hold public office, and, in fact,
							never expects to. He is a member of the Improved Order of Red Men and the Knights of
							Pythias, and takes an active interest in the workings of these fraternal
							organizations. Mr. Harlan is a man who has worked for what he has and knows how to
							sympathize with the laboring man. He is a man of such genial disposition that his
							friends are as numerous as his acquaintances. By his upright manner of living he has
							justly won the esteem of all of those with whom he is associated.</p>

							temple ever erected and dedicated to human freedom. The world looked on and called

							were natives of North Carolina, his father being born in that state on February 22,
							1801. James Kersey was educated and married in North Carolina, coming to Indiana about
							1830. He and his wife first located in Wayne county, this state, and in 1832 James
							came to Hendricks county and located in Clay township, where he entered three hundred
							and twenty acres of land from the government. Shortly after coming to this county he
							took up the study of medicine and studied under Doctor Parker, of Winchester, Indiana.
							After completing his course he practiced his profession in this county until his

							War, and Amos, the immediate subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>Amos Kersey was educated in the common schools of his home township and worked on his
							father's farm until the opening of the Civil War. He then enlisted in Company I,
							Twenty-seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and served a little more than
							three years. His regiment was transferred to the Army of the Potomac and participated
							in the first and second battles of Bull Run, Winchester, Antietam and in the three-day
							struggle at Gettysburg in July, 1863. His regiment was then transferred to Sherman's
							army and he made the famous march to the sea through the state of Georgia and
							participated in all the battles of the famous Atlanta campaign. Upon returning from
							the war he engaged in farming with his father and continued in partnership with him
							until the latter's death, in 1883. He then bought two hundred and ten acres of his
							father's farm and began to build up a landed estate of his own. He has added to his
							possessions from time to time until he now has three hundred and forty acres of land
							in this township.</p>

						<p>Mr. Kersey was married on September 24, 1867, to Mary Catherine Cassity, the daughter
							of Lewis Clements and Ann Jane (Knetzer) Cassity, and to this marriage there have been
							born eight children: Ann Jane, the wife of William Powers, of Plainfield, who has four
							children, Ernest Gladys, <pb id="VAC1000-676" n="623"/> Horace, and one who died in

							Lucile; Eva married Claude Henderson and has four children, Hazel, Cecil, Clyde and
							Carroll; Charles married Menti Seckman, and they have two children, Naomi and Edna;
							Carrie married Arthur Brooks; Mary is unmarried and still at home. The Cassity family
							is of Irish descent. Lewis Clements Cassity was born near Owensville, Montgomery
							county, Kentucky, on October 31, 1822, and died at North Salem, Indiana, in April,
							1905. He was the son of David Cassity, whose father emigrated with Daniel Boone from
							Virginia to Kentucky, where he reared his family. He married Polly Clements and their
							seven children were Lewis C., Levi, Elizabeth, Emma, Mary and two who died in infancy.
							Polly Clements Cassity was the daughter of Roger and Hannah Clements, of Bourbon
							county, Kentucky. Roger Clements was a large slave-holder, and at his death all but
							four of the slaves were dispersed with, the widow bringing two of them to Indiana. She
							settled in Boone county, near her two sons, Phillip and John, where she died.
							Grandmother Cassity also brought two of the slaves to Indiana. Lewis C. Cassity's
							maternal grandmother was a Hathaway. In 1834 David Cassity came to Indiana, locating
							in Putnam county, three miles southeast of Bainbridge. Lewis C. Cassity was brought to
							Putnam county, Indiana, in childhood, and was there reared and married. His wife, Ann
							Jane Knetzer, was born in Mason county, Kentucky, in 1827. Her paternal
							great-grandparents were natives of Germany, who, upon their emigration to America,
							first settled in Virginia for a short time, and there was born Charles Knetzer, Mrs.
							Kersey's grandfather. Later the family moved to Kentucky, where the parents died on
							the same day from cholera. Charles Knetzer, who was born on August 18, 1793, married,
							in Kentucky on September 23, 1819, Catherine Gill, of German descent, who was born
							June 23, 1804, and died January 9, 1879. The latter's mother, who was of Welsh stock,
							bore the family name of Moss, her grandparents having settled on what was known as the
							Lockridge farm near Greencastle, Indiana. Their daughter, Lydia Ann Moss Bradley, died
							at Peoria, Illinois, about ten years ago, at the age of ninety-four years, leaving an
							estate valued at four million dollars, which she willed to the city. Catherine Gill's
							parents remained in Kentucky, where they owned slaves, and upon their deaths, their
							children all came to Indiana excepting a son and a daughter who remained at the old
							homestead, retaining their slaves until emancipation.</p>

						<p>To Lewis C. and Ann Jane Cassity were born five children: Mary <pb id="VAC1000-677"
								n="624"/> Catherine, the wife of Amos Kersey; David, deceased; Andrew, who married
							Margaret Snyder; one who died in infancy and Levi, of Montana. The mother of these
							children died in April, 1858, and Mr. Cassity afterwards married Pauline M. McCoy, the
							daughter of George and Julia (Raglan) McCoy, who were natives of Kentucky, but married
							in Indiana. To this second marriage thirteen children were born: Armilda, the wife of

						<p>Though he whose name stands at the head of this review has passed from the life

							the entire locality in which he lived so long and which he labored so earnestly to
							upbuild in any way within his power, it is particularly fitting that specific mention
							should be made of him in a work containing mention of the representative citizens of
							the community in which he lived and labored so long. A man of high moral character,

							<pb id="VAC1000-679" n="625"/> he stood "four score to every wind that blew" and
							throughout his wide circle of friends and acquaintances he was universally admired and
							esteemed.</p>

						<p>John Columbus Walker was a native of this county, having been born near Belleville on
							February 22, 1847, and he departed this life at his home in Clayton on October 29,
							1913, aged sixty-six years and eight months. He was left an orphan in early childhood
							and was reared by an uncle who lived in Liberty township, this county. Robert Walker,
							the uncle, saw that he received a good education, and in early youth he attended the
							Belleville schools, later finishing at what was known as the Belleville Academy. When
							only a little over fourteen years of age, with his boyish soul on fire for humanity
							and love of country, he heard the call to arms and on April 24, 1861, he was entered
							in the nation's ranks as a private in Company A, Seventh Indiana Volunteer Infantry.
							On August 2, 1861, his term having expired, he was mustered out of service, but he
							could not be content to remain at home with the wrong still unrighted, so he again
							enlisted on June 18, 1862, this time as a member of Company H, Fifty-fourth Regiment
							Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and remained at the front until the expiration of his term
							of enlistment, which was the following September. He again returned home, but again
							becoming dissatisfied with his idleness, once more joined the forces of the nation's
							patriotic sons, this time as a member of Company A, One Hundred and Seventeenth
							Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry. This was on July 22, 1863, and he remained in
							service until February 24, 1864, when he was mustered out. This time he remained at
							home something over a year, but, the nation still being engaged in conflict, he felt
							his duty strong once more and again donned the blue and was enrolled as a private in
							Company K, One Hundred and Forty-eighth Regiment, on March 15, 1865, remaining in
							service until he received his honorable discharge on September 5, 1865, the great war
							having ended in the meantime. All this he went through before he reached his majority
							and upon .his return home he proceeded to lay the foundation which later proved his
							right to be considered one of the very foremost agriculturists of the county. He began
							in an humble way as a farm laborer, then became a renter and in due time made his
							first modest purchase of land, which served as the nucleus of his excellent farm of
							six hundred acres, all in exceptionally good state of cultivation and, in addition to
							his own holdings, he was caring for one hundred and sixty acres of the Miles estate at
							the time of his death. He owed his success in life solely to his own efforts,
							possessing indomitable will and energy, unlimited perseverance and a high degree of
							business ability, which, combined with correct principles of <pb id="VAC1000-680"
								n="626"/> life, wrought most excellent results. His home was located about two miles
							south of Clayton on the national road and was a commodious ten-room brick house, most
							beautifully located. He took up his residence there in 1870 and remained there until
							the fall of 1908, when he purchased a large and modern home in Clayton, where he
							passed the remainder of his life.</p>

						<p>Mr. Walker was twice married, his first wife being Martha Ann Miles, with whom he was
							united in marriage on October 20, 1870. This union was without issue, and in 1874 Mr.
							and Mrs. Walker adopted a little daughter, who is now Mrs. Florence Bray, of
							Indianapolis, and with her three sons cherishes most happy memories of a kind father.
							Mrs. Walker departed this life on December 22, 1891, and on March 5, 1896, Mr. Walker
							was again married, his bride being Jeanetta S. Mays, who was born in Center Valley,
							four or five miles south of Clayton, being a daughter of Stephen R. and Mary Frances
							(Tate) Mays. Both Mr. and Mrs. Mays were born and raised in Orange county, North
							Carolina, near Hillsboro, where his birth occurred in 1834 and hers in 1838. They were
							married in their childhood home on December 30, 1852, and in 1859 they came to the
							Hoosier state, locating near Center Valley. Mr. Mays was a blacksmith, which trade he
							followed, and in addition to this was a considerable dealer in horses and other live
							stock. Both he and his wife were devout members of the Methodist Episcopal church and
							his fraternal affiliation was with the Free and Accepted Masons, of which order he
							became a member in 1863. Mr. Mays departed this life on December 10, 1906, and he met
							death with the high courage of a true Christian. Mrs. Mays' death occurred on July 24,
							1913, at the advanced age of seventy-five years. Her life was guided by her faith and
							under all circumstances, whether pleasant or otherwise, her countenance ever exhibited
							her sweet spirit of hopefulness and resignation and her peace with God and the world.
							Mrs. Walker was but six years old when her parents brought her to Belleville and she
							attended the schools of the village during her girlhood, later finishing at the
							academy. To Mr, and Mrs. Walker were born two children. The eldest was a little
							daughter, Helen M., who passed away when a babe of but six months. She was born on
							July 14, 1897. Edward Raymond, the son, was born December 19, 1903, and is a bright
							and promising boy.</p>

						<p>Mr. Walker's political sympathies were with the Republican party and he was ever
							active in local politics. During the fall of 1867, while a religious revival was in
							progress at the Baptist church of Belleville, he was brought under personal conviction
							and made his peace with God, but for many years <pb id="VAC1000-681" n="627"/> failed
							to unite with any church society, while living the life of a consistent Christian and
							assisting in the material support of different church societies. However, in June,
							1913, he united with the Clayton Presbyterian church, of which his wife and son are
							also members. Mr. Walker's fraternal affiliation was with the ancient order of
							Freemasonry, being a member of Lodge No. 463 at Clayton. He received the
							thirty-second, or Scottish Rite, degree at Indianapolis in 1911 and also at that time
							became a Noble of the Mystic Shrine.</p>

						<p>Mr. Walker was a man among men, ever ready to assist all who were doing all in their
							power to assist themselves. He was averse to doing kind deeds that the public might
							know of, and doubtless many are the benevolent acts placed to his credit of which the
							world knew nothing. Tie was a man of good business judgment and executive ability, and
							spurned taking advantage of his fellow men in any way, believing always that a square
							deal was the only course. In all the elements of manhood and good citizenship, Mr.
							Walker was all that a man should be and the enviable place which he held in the hearts
							of a wide circle of friends and acquaintances was but a fitting tribute to one
							eminently deserving.</p>

						<p>It is a well authenticated fact that success comes as the result of legitimate and
							well applied energy, unflagging determination and perseverance in a course of action
							when once decided upon. She is never known to smile upon the idler or dreamer and she
							never courts the loafer, only the men who have diligently sought her favor being
							crowned with her blessings. In tracing the history of the influential farmer and
							representative citizen of Clay township, Hendricks county, Indiana, whose name forms
							the caption of this review, it is plainly seen that the prosperity which he enjoys has
							been won by commendable qualities and it is also his personal worth that has gained
							for him the high esteem of those who know him.</p>

						<p>Fred G. Shirley, the proprietor of one hundred and twenty acres of fine land in Clay
							township, this county, was born on the farm where he is now living February 2, 1873.
							His parents were William R. and Sallie M. (Phillips) Shirley, his father being a
							native of this county, born in 1845, and his mother also a native of Hendricks county,
							her birth having occurred in about 1855. William R. Shirley received a good common
							school education <pb id="VAC1000-682" n="628"/> and when a young man engaged in the
							general merchandising business at Pecksburg, Clay township, in connection with his
							father. He continued with his father in the store until his marriage, and shortly
							afterwards he bought forty acres, part of this land being included in the farm of Fred
							G. Shirley. He continued to reside on this farm until about 1900, when he retired from
							active farm life and moved to Danville, where he remained until his death, August 4,
							1902, his wife having preceded him in death some years previous in 1898. Sallie M.
							Phillips, wife of William R. Shirley, was the daughter of Samuel and Rachel (Newman)
							Phillips. Mr. and Mrs. William R. Shirley were the parents of four children: Etta L.,
							who married Wilson J. Shaw, of Danville, and they are the parents of five children,
							Erver, Ina, Merrill, Ralph and Phillip; Fred G., the immediate subject of this sketch;
							Alva R., who married Elizabeth Hadley and has one child, Mildred, and one who died in
							infancy.</p>

						<p>Mr. Shirley attended school for two years in the village of Pecksburg and completed
							his common school education in the Dover school house in Liberty township. After
							finishing the common school course he entered the Central Normal College at Danville,
							where he made a very satisfactory record as a student. Upon the completion of his
							educational training he returned to his home and worked with his father until his
							marriage, which occurred on March 16, 1898, to Elnora Hadley, the daughter of Mathias
							and Matilda (Bringle) Hadley, and to this union there have been born three children,
							Wendell, Lois and Geneva. Mathias Hadley was a native of Hendricks county, Indiana,
							and to him and his wife, who was the daughter of Solomon and Cynthia (Suits) Bringle,
							there were born eleven children, two of whom died in infancy. The other nine lived to
							maturity and all of them married: Leora, married James Harvey; Alzora became the wife
							of Dr. William Marshburn; Loretta married Perry Hunt; Orlando married Eva Dickerson;
							Ozella married Miles Furnas; Orien married Mary Stanley; Ozro married Rossilee
							Garrison; Orvis married Catharine Cosner; Elnora married Fred G. Shirley. Mrs. Hadley
							died in 1894, and her husband the year following. John Hadley, Mrs. Shirley's paternal
							grandfather, was a native of North Carolina, and married Elizabeth Johnson, who also
							was born in that state. They reared a very large family of children.</p>

						<p>Mr. Shirley allied himself with the new Progressive party in the fall of 1912,
							because he felt that this new party had a platform which, if properly carried out,
							would redown to the welfare of the country at large. In his religious affiliations he
							has been a member of the Friends church since 1912, <pb id="VAC1000-683" n="629"/> and
							has always taken a very active part in the affairs of this denomination, being a
							trustee in the church at the present time. The life which Mr. Shirley has led stamps
							him as a man who has the interest of his community at heart, and one who is not only
							concerned with his individual advancement, but takes a keen interest in the welfare of
							his friends and neighbors. Such men are a help to the community in which they live,
							and because Mr. Shirley is such a man he has won the esteem of a large circle of
							friends and acquaintances.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">WILLIAM WALLACE LEACH.</hi></head>

						<p>There are very few farmers in Hendricks county whose memory goes back to the time
							when there were but two roads in the county, the National road and the old State road.
							In those days, back in the thirties, it was possible to go out and shoot deer any
							place in Hendricks county, and wild turkeys, squirrels and small game of all sorts
							were as abundant as English sparrows are today. William Wallace Leach, who has lived
							in this county nearly eighty years, has seen as many as ten deer in a herd in his
							boyhood days in this county, and flocks of wild turkeys numbering hundreds. As he
							travels around over the highly improved roads of his county now in his automobile his
							mind goes back to the time when in order to get to his home he had to follow a bridle
							path. The complete history of such a man as William Wallace Leach would be a history
							of Indiana for eighty years, civic, educational and moral.</p>

						<p>William Wallace Leach, retired farmer of North Salem, was born in Bath county,
							Kentucky, October 15, 1835, the son of Meredith and Eliza (Allison) Leach, both of
							whom were natives of Kentucky, where they were reared and married. In 1836, when
							William Wallace was only one year old, his parents moved to this county and settled
							south of Lizton, in Union township, where his father entered government land. The axe
							of man had never touched a tree on this farm and here in this primitive wilderness
							Meredith Leach and his young wife began housekeeping and here they remained the rest
							of their lives, his death occurring in 1859, while his wife survived him a few years.
							Mr. and Mrs. Meredith Leach were the parents of seven children, of whom William
							Wallace, whose history is portrayed here, is the oldest, the other in the order of
							their birth being as follows: James Valentine, deceased; Mary L., deceased wife of
							Amos Rook; Martha Jane, the deceased wife of Moses Rawlings; Sarah Ann, the widow of
							Jeptha West; <pb id="VAC1000-684" n="630"/> Amanda Louisa, the widow of William
							Harrison, and Francis Edna, who died in childhood.</p>

						<p>William Wallace Leach was reared amid these primitive conditions, hearing the music
							of the axe in the daytime, and yet he probably spent ,is happy a boyhood as any of the
							boys of today. A very meager education was his, because the schools in his day were
							confined to three "R's" and very little of that. In February, 1862, he was married to
							Margaret F. Clark, who was born November 29, 1841, in Union township, this county. Her
							parents were Silas Garrett and Mary Ann (Mount) Clark. Silas Clark was born in
							Kentucky, near Lexington, the son of William and Francis (Blades) Clark, and came to
							this county early in its history and here married Mary Ann Mount, the daughter of
							Alfred and Margaret Mount, the same family which gave a governor to the state of
							Indiana. Mr. and Mrs. Clark reared a large family of eleven children, only four of
							whom are now living. The sons are: William, of Missouri; James Thomas, of Bloomington,
							Indiana, and Henry Washington, of Iowa. Two other brothers, George and John, died in
							the West. Of the five daughters, Sarah Elizabeth married Thomas Stewart; Jane became
							the wife of John Russell; Rhoda Ann, the wife of Linden Wade, and Ella died when a
							young woman.</p>

						<p>When Mr. Leach was married he already owned forty acres of land in Union township,
							and here the young couple started in life. He rented land in addition to his own for
							farming, and by thrift and ecomony was enabled to save some money, and in a few years
							bought another eighty acres near his first farm. In 1844 he traded for a farm of
							sixty-five acres near North Salem and moved into North Salem, where he engaged in the
							grocery business for six years. He was also in the dry goods business for a part of
							the time when he lived in North Salem. He then traded his grocery for a farm two and
							one-half miles northwest of Salem, at the same time selling his sixty-five-acre farm
							and buying one hundred acres adjoining the farm for which he traded, making him a
							total of one hundred and eighty acres of land, which he still owns. He lived on this
							farm for about five years and then bought property in North Salem, where he has lived
							for the past twelve years.</p>

						<p>Mr. Leach is usually a Democrat in politics, although he does not hesitate to vote
							for the best men in local elections irrespective of politics. Mr. and Mrs. Leach have
							now been married for more than fifty-one years and are both enjoying good health at
							the present time. They are both able to read without glasses, have good hearing and
							are cheerful and genial at all <pb id="VAC1000-685" n="631"/> times. In recent years
							they have made several trips to Hot Springs, Arkansas, and to Florida, and are
							frequently seen in good weather in their automobile driving around the roads of
							Hendricks county, enjoying themselves as if they were fifty years younger.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">AUBREY C. PEBWORTH, M. D.</hi></head>

						<p>The man who devotes his talents and energies to the noble work of ministering to the
							ills and alleviating the sufferings of humanity is pursuing a calling which in
							dignity, importance and beneficial results is second to none other. If true to his
							profession and earnest in his efforts to enlarge his sphere of usefulness, he is
							indeed a benefactor of his kind, for to him more than any other man are intrusted the
							safety, the comfort, and, in many cases, the lives of those who place themselves under
							his care and profit by services. It is gratifying to note in the series of personal
							sketches appearing in this work that there remain many native sons who are maintaining
							the prestige of their county in other fields. Many have gone to other parts of the
							state and yet they look back to Hendricks county as their real home. Among the many
							citizens who were born in this county and then left for wider fields is Aubrey C.
							Pebworth, a successful physician of West Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>Aubrey C. Pebworth, the son of James H. and Marcia (Carrington) Pebworth, was born
							near Danville, Indiana, December 28, 1877. His father was a native of Shelby county,
							Kentucky, and his mother spent all of her life in Hendricks county. James Pebworth
							came to this county with his parents when he was a small boy and followed the life of
							a farmer until his death, September 13, 1910. He served in the Civil War and a wound
							in the head which he received at the battle of Lookout Mountain was finally the cause
							of his death. Mr. and Mrs. James Pebworth were the parents of six children: Mrs.
							Morton Ellis, of Pittsboro; Mrs. Frank A. Haynes, of Pittsboro; Eva, one of the best
							known teachers of Hendricks county; Dr. Aubrey C., the youngest of the family, and two
							others who are deceased.</p>

						<p>Doctor Pebworth received his common and high school education in the schools at
							Pittsboro, in his native county, and immediately after his graduation entered the
							Central College of Physicians and Surgeons at Indianapolis. Upon finishing his medical
							course in 1905 he at once began the practice of medicine in West Indianapolis, where
							he has been very successful. During the period of his professional practice in that
							community, Doctor <pb id="VAC1000-686" n="632"/> Pebworth has not only gained the
							respect of his confreres in his chosen field, but has also sustained a sound
							reputation for uprightness and nobility of character in all the relations of life. He
							has realized that to those who attain determinate success in the medical profession
							there must not only be technical ability, but also a broad human sympathy which must
							pass from mere sentiment to an actuating motive for helpfulness.</p>

						<p>Doctor Pebworth was married on August 9, 1905, to Mary Thomas, the daughter of Rev.
							and Mrs. E. D. Thomas, and to this happy union there have been born two children,
							James T. and Robert C. The Doctor is a member of the Marion county and Indiana state
							medical societies and is interested in all the meetings of these organizations. He is
							a member of the Free and Accepted Masons and also belongs to the Indianapolis Chapter
							of Royal Arch Masons. Politically, he is allied with the Progressive party. In his
							church relations he is a member of the Christian church, while his wife retains her
							connection with the Baptist denomination. Mrs. Pebworth is secretary of the Hendricks
							County Society for Indianapolis. She is a graduate of the teachers' course at the
							Central Normal College of Danville and was a teacher in the public schools before her
							marriage. Mr. and Mrs. Pebworth are genial and hospitable people who have gained a
							wide circle of friends in the community where they live.</p>

							<pb id="VAC1000-688" n="633"/> county, Indiana, June 21, 1848. His parents were
							Jonathan D. and Eliza J. (Wilson) McClelland, his father being a native of Union
							county, Indiana, and his mother of Kentucky. Jonathan McClelland was born in 1816, the
							year Indiana was admitted to the Union, and came to Marion county, this state, with
							his father, Francis McClelland, when he was a small boy of six years. Francis
							McClelland settled on a farm in Marion county, near the Hendricks county line, on land
							which he entered from the government. He lived on this farm until his death. Mr. and
							Mrs. Jonathan McClelland were the parents of seven children, only three of whom are
							living, Charles, of Danville, Indiana; James, of Ponca, Oklahoma, and William R.</p>

						<p>William R. McClelland was born on his father's farm in Marion county and educated in
							the district schools of his home neighborhood. He continued to work on his father's
							farm until he was twenty-four years of age, when he went to Danville and entered the
							employ of a dry goods firm as a clerk. A few years later he started out in business
							for himself, engaging in the furniture and undertaking business in Danville, in which
							business he continued for about twenty-five years. He left the furniture and
							undertaking business to become identified with the State Life Insurance Company as
							general agent, and in 1905 removed to Indianapolis, where he has since continued to
							reside. Mr. McClelland has always taken a prominent part in Republican politics in his
							county and has been signally honored by his party on several different occasions. He
							served as county clerk of Hendricks county from 1884 to 1888, was a member for four
							years of the board of control of the Indiana Boys School at Plainfield, and was a
							member of the school board at Danville for ten years. In all of these positions he
							showed himself thoroughly familiar with the duties of his office and proved himself to
							be not only an able and efficient official, but one who won the confidence of the
							citizens of the county.</p>

						<p>Mr. McClelland was married to Sarah E. Nichols in 1872, a daughter of James and
							Rachel Nichols, who were both members of pioneer families of Hendricks county. Mrs.
							William McClelland died on March 16, 1912, leaving one son, Harry Nichols, who is
							married and has one son, William Pearce, aged two years. Harry Nichols is in the
							auditing department of the State Life Insurance Company, and resides in
							Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>Mr. McClelland has been a life-long member of the Methodist Episcopal church, and has
							been a member of the official board of the Methodist Episcopal church for more than
							forty years. Fraternally, he is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, with
							which order he has been identified for more than forty-two years, and has held every
							office in Silcox Lodge No. <pb id="VAC1000-689" n="634"/> 123, at Danville. On
							different occasions he has represented his local lodge in grand lodge.</p>

						<p>Thus far Mr. McClelland's life has been one of strenuous activity and by reason of
							the success with which it has been attended, his friends are justified in predicting
							for him a still greater sphere of usefulness and efficiency. As a citizen of Hendricks
							county for many years he stood high in the esteem of his fellow men. Whether as a
							merchant or as a public official, his influence was always public-spirited and
							progressive, and. at all times he was found willing to lend his aid and influence in
							behalf of enterprises for the material benefit and advancement of his city and county,
							and for the intellectual, social and moral good of the people. He is a man of social
							tendencies, kind, obliging, unassuming and straightforward and honorable in all the
							relations of life, and is universally respected and popular among his large circle of
							friends and acquaintances.</p>

						<p>There are few natives of far-away Sweden in Indiana and still fewer in Hendricks
							county, but the few who have come to our state have been among our best citizens. No
							country of the old world has sent to us better and more substantial people than Sweden
							and fortunate, indeed, is the community that can boast of Swedish descendants. They
							are always loyal to their adopted country and are a valuable asset to the locality in
							which they settle.</p>

						<p>Charles Relander, the son of Nels and Lottie (Ericson) Relander, was born in Grenna,
							Sweden, in 1843, and lived there till eighteen years of age, then went to Stockholm,
							the capital of the country. He received a good practical education in the public
							schools of Grenna and early in life started to learn the bricklayer's trade. At the
							age of twenty-four he came to America to seek his fortune and made his first stop at
							Chicago. In 1869 he came to Danville, Hendricks county, Indiana, landing in the town
							for the first time on June 17th. He at once began work on the Big Four railroad, which
							was then being built through the county, and for the next twenty-eight years continued
							in the employ of this company. For twenty-one years of this time he was section boss
							and during that time saved his money so that he was enabled to buy an eighty-acre farm
							in Center township, this county. In 1897 he retired from the service of the Big Four
							and went onto his farm <pb id="VAC1000-690" n="635"/> where he has since remained.
							Since taking up farming he has added another eighty acres to his farm and now owns one
							hundred and sixty acres in Center township. He has been a success as a farmer and
							stock raiser, despite his long years at another occupation. He has shown his ability
							by adapting himself to a new occupation without having had any previous experience in
							it, and in the course of a few years being recognized as one of the leading farmers of
							his township.</p>

						<p>Mr. Relander was married in 1870 to Mary Elizabeth Curtis, the daughter of Peter and
							Sarah (Kirkendall) Curtis. The grandfather of Mrs. Relander was Peter Curtis, who was
							born in 1763 in Virginia and served for five years in the Revolutionary War. He was at
							the battle at Guilford Court House in North Carolina in 1781, and was later married at
							that place. He and his young bride then settled in Kentucky and there, in Garrard
							county, Peter, Jr., the father of Mrs. Relander, was born on February 14, 1808. Peter,
							Jr., grew up in Kentucky and on Christmas Day, 1827, was married to Sarah Kirkendall,
							the daughter of Richard and Betsy (Reed) Kirkendall, She was born in Garrard county,
							Kentucky, September 18, 1811. Her father was of Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry and her
							mother of Irish parentage. In 1829 Peter Curtis and wife came to Indiana and settled
							near Crawfordsville, shortly after moving into the town, where Mr. Curtis followed the
							trade of a blacksmith for several years. About the year 1840 he moved to Hendricks
							county and bought the Scearce farm, half a mile west of Danville. The family lived

							spent the remainder of their days, he passing away in 1890 and his wife in 1892.
							During the Civil War they had charge of the Hendricks county poor farm, which at that

						<head><hi rend="center">WILLIAM T. HIGGINS.</hi></head>

						<p>One of the oldest and best known families in Hendricks county is the Higgins family,
							six generations of whom have lived in this county. David Higgins, the first of the
							family to come to Indiana, was born in Mercer county, Kentucky, in 1795. His wife,
							Helen Mudd, was a native of Maryland, whose parents had moved to Kentucky from their
							native state. Soon after their marriage, David Higgins and his young wife set out for
							Indiana, and in the spring of 1821 they stopped for a short time in Lawrence county.
							Later they moved on north and located about four miles south of Greencastle. In 1831
							they came to Hendricks county and settled the southeast quarter section 33, in Marion
							township, this land having been entered in 1828 by Thomas, the brother of David. On
							this farm David Higgins spent the rest of his life, dying in 1851, his wife surviving
							him several years. He proved to be a successful farmer and at the time of his death
							owned fifteen hundred acres of land in the county.</p>

						<p>Michael Higgins, the father of William T., was born in Putnam county, August 5, 1823,
							and spent his boyhood days on his father David's farm. He was married on October 7,
							1847, to Elizabeth Plaster, the daughter of William Plaster, an early settler of
							Middle township, this county. Mrs. Michael Higgins was born September 30, 1822. To Mr.
							and Mrs. Michael Higgins were born six children, William T., David A., Mrs. Mary Jane
							Wilson, Mrs. Cassandra Hunt, Charles E. and May. Mrs. Michael Higgins died August 15,
							1883. He was the largest land owner in Marion township at one time, having eight
							hundred and eighty acres of valuable land in this <pb id="VAC1000-692" n="637"/>
							township. Michael Higgins was a truly remarkable man and his ability was recognized by
							every one. He served his township as trustee and his county as treasurer, filling both
							offices to the entire satisfaction of his fellow citizens. He was a hard worker, a
							good manager, diligent, thrifty and persistent in carrying out his plans. He was of
							unusually upright character, strictly moral and took an active stand for righteousness
							and the betterment of humanity. He and his wife were members of the Christian church
							and lived up to the teachings of the church as near as they possibly could. He died in
							April, 1903, a man who was loved by everyone, with whom he came in contact.</p>

						<p>William T. Higgins, the son of Michael Higgins and wife, was born October 2, 1848, in
							the township where he has spent his whole life. He lived at home until his marriage to
							Mary Underwood on January 23, 1877. She is a sister of Obed Underwood, a sketch of
							whom, elsewhere in this volume, gives the family history of the Underwood family.
							William began farming for himself about two miles northeast of New Winchester on a
							farm of his own. About two years after his marriage he moved to his present farm in
							the northwest part of Marion township. He has been very successful, as is shown by his
							present farm of five hundred and sixty acres, of which four hundred acres are
							cultivable. He was formerly a heavy dealer in live stock, but has confined his
							energies to the raising of grain in the last few years. He has made many improvements
							on his place and has a very comfortable and attractive home.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Higgins have three children: Oscar, born in 1878, who graduated in the
							New Winchester high school, and later married Olive Oakley, the daughter of James and
							Ellen (Ader) Oakley. James Oakley, born and reared in Putnam county, was the son of
							Lafayette and Mildred (Harris) Oakley. Mildred Harris was born in Kentucky and came to
							Putnam county in early childhood with her parents. Her mother's maiden name was
							Neeves. Lafayette Oakley also came from Kentucky in childhood and settled with his
							parents in Putnam county. Ellen Ader was born and reared in Putnam county and was the
							daughter of Adam and Margaret (Chatham) Ader. After Oscar Higgins, the eldest son of
							William T., was married he farmed in Putnam county for one year and then moved to his
							present home on his father's farm. Oscar and wife have two children, Edna Merle, and
							Virgil Wayne, who died recently. Clay, the second child of William T. and wife, died
							at the age of thirteen and the youngest son, Earl Glendon, is still at home. The wife
							and <pb id="VAC1000-693" n="638"/> mother died in April. 1893. Politically, Mr.
							Higgins is a Democrat, though he has never aspired to public office. Religiously, the
							members of his family affiliate with the Christian church.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN R. GARNER.</hi></head>

						<p>All callings, whether humble or exalted, may be productive of some measure of
							success, if enterprise and industry, coupled with a well-directed purpose, form the
							motive force of the person directing the same, and in no case is this fact more
							apparent than in agricultural pursuits. It is a well authenticated fact that success
							comes as the result of legitimate and well applied energy, unflagging determination
							and perseverance as well as the above enumerated qualities. When a course of action is
							once decided upon, these attributes are essential. Success is never known to smile
							upon the idler or dreamer and she never courts the loafer, only those who have
							diligently sought her favor being crowned with her blessings.</p>

						<p>John R. Garner was born in Brown township, Hendricks county, Indiana, on December 14,
							1861, about one and one-half miles northwest of his present home, being a son of
							Solomon B. and Deborah (Lyons) Garner, both natives of Bath county, Kentucky. They had
							been married several years before they brought their family to the Hoosier state.
							After coming here they settled on the farm where the immediate subject of this sketch
							was born. This farm comprised some two hundred acres, being land which Solomon Garner
							had entered from the government and on which he passed the remainder of his life, his
							death occurring in 1861. His wife died on the same place in 1880. There were nine
							children in their family, but one other besides the subject living today.</p>

						<p>John R. Garner passed his youth and early manhood under the care of the parental
							roof, remaining there until first married, on December 17, 1871, to Sarah A. Jones,
							daughter of Benjamin and Nancy (Dodson) Jones, both of whom were from the state of
							Kentucky, and who took up their abode in Brown township, Hendricks county, upon coming
							to Indiana. Sarah A. Jones, first wife of the subject, died on November 17, 1888,
							leaving two children, the eldest being Viola, who is the wife of Robert Davis, of
							Rossville, Illinois, where they live at the present time. They are the parents of a
							family of nine children, namely: Ruth, Lucretia, Mary, Esther, <pb id="VAC1000-694"
								n="639"/> Ralph, Agnes, Edith, Randle and Arthur. The second child of Mr. Garner by
							his first wife is a son, Arthur, who chose as his wife Della Johnson, daughter of
							Martin and Norah Johnson, of Hendricks county.. They make their home in Middle
							township, Hendricks county, and the parents of three children, Russell, Crystal and
							Catherine.</p>

						<p>After his first marriage, John R. Garner took up his residence on a tract of forty
							acres, being part of the land originally entered from the government by his father,
							and there they lived for eighteen years. In 1890 he took as his second wife Sarah A.
							Jones, daughter of Uriah and Frances (Kenneday) Jones. Uriah Jones was the son of
							Benjamin and Nancy (Moore) Jones, who were of Kentucky nativity. The parents of
							Frances (Kenneday) Jones were also from that state. Mr. Garner's wives were of the
							same name, the first wife being a half aunt of the present Mrs. Garner. After his
							second marriage, Mr. Garner built his present home, where they have since resided.
							There is one child, Ethel, by the second marriage, who remains at home.</p>

						<p>Mr. Garner recalls with interest the methods of farming which were in vogue in his
							younger days, when he plowed with a yoke of oxen. He also has used the reap hook for
							harvesting grain, before the days of reapers or any of the farm machinery now thought
							necessary by the smallest and poorest of agriculturists. He also recalls with pleasure
							the days of sugar-water gathering time and the work of the sugar camp, which became
							quite a social affair for the neighborhood and was eagerly looked forward to from year
							to year. Then, too, the sugar so made was the entire supply of the pioneer families
							for the ensuing year. Mr. Garner has always confined his efforts to the vocation of
							farming and has seen this labor grow from one of the most arduous of occupations, with
							its attendant comparatively small remuneration, to an up-to-date business, wherein
							machinery of all kinds is employed as well as modern and scientific methods and the
							farmer has become the most independent man in any line of business.</p>

						<p>Mr. Garner's religious affiliation is with the Baptist church, of which his wife and
							daughter are also members, and the entire family contribute of time and means to
							furthering the cause of that church society. By a straightforward and commendable
							course, Mr. Garner has made his way to a respected position among his associates,
							winning the hearty admiration of the people of his neighborhood as a broad-minded and
							upright citizen whose line of conduct has ever been above reproach.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">WILLIAM M. ROSE.</hi></head>

						<p>To a great extent the prosperity of the agricultural sections of our country is due
							to the honest industry, the sturdy persistence, the unswerving perseverance and the
							wise economy which so prominently characterize the farming element of the Hoosier
							state. Among this class may be mentioned William M. Rose, who, by reason of years of
							indefatigable labor and honest effort, has not only acquired a well merited material
							prosperity, but has also richly earned the highest esteem of all with whom he is
							associated, as is shown by the fact that he has been entrusted with important official
							positions, the duties of which he has most faithfully and ably discharged, thus
							eminently meriting the high esteem in which he is universally held.</p>

						<p>William M. Rose, a prosperous farmer of Eel River township, was born November 23,
							1859, in Putnam county, near the Hendricks county line. His parents were Lewis M. and
							Margaret (Kelley) Rose. Lewis M. Rose was the son of Lewis A. Rose and wife, who were
							natives of Kentucky and lived in the vicinity of Bowling Green. Lewis M. Rose married
							Margaret Kelley, the daughter of William and Malinda (West) Kelley. William Kelley was
							born in Nashville, Tennessee, and came here as a young man, entering one hundred and
							sixty acres of government land near New Winchester. However, he did not farm, but
							became the pioneer merchant of New Winchester, where he died early in life. Melinda
							West, the wife of Mr. Kelley, was born in Kentucky and came here with her parents and
							located near New Winchester, where she grew to womanhood and on February 22, 1855,
							married Lewis M. Rose. After his marriage Lewis M. Rose moved to near New Maysville,
							where he lived until the breaking out of the Civil War. In August, 1862, he enlisted
							in Company B, Ninety-ninth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and died while in the
							service in the following January. For several years after his death, his widow
							remained on the farm near New Maysville, and later married James Hayes, and moved to
							his farm in the northwestern part of Marion township, in this county, where she still
							resides. Lewis M. Rose and wife were the parents of three children, one of whom died
							in infancy, the other two being William M., and Mrs. Alice Dooley, of Danville.</p>

						<p>William M. Rose grew up on his stepfather's farm and after completing the course in
							the common schools in his neighborhood, he then attended the normal school at Ladoga
							for two terms. After his marriage, he began farming in Marion township near his mother
							and there remained until 1905. He <pb id="VAC1000-696" n="[]"/>

							sold this and bought one hundred and ninety-three and a half acres about a mile
							northeast of North Salem, where he still lives. On his new farm he has built a fine
							residence, good barns and improved the place in every way. As a farmer he ranks among
							the first in the township and divides his attention between the raising of grain and
							the production of live stock.</p>

						<p>Mr. Rose was married on August 21, 1884, to Amanda Bowen, who was born in Putnam
							county, Indiana, December 9, 1860, the daughter of James and Nancy (Higgins) Bowen.
							Nancy Higgins was born in this township, her parents corning to this county from
							Mercer county, Kentucky, in 1821. James Bowen was reared in Putnam county, Indiana.
							Mr. and Mrs. Rose are the parents of three children, all of whom are at home, Ethel
							C., Edith Lottie and Edward Maurice.</p>

						<p>Mr. Rose and his family are all members of the Christian church and to this
							denomination render faithful and zealous support. Mr. Rose has been an honorable,
							upright, industrious and temperate man all of his life, and has performed well his
							part in the body politic. No one questions his standing as one of those citizens who
							always stand for the best welfare of the commonwealth.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">MURAT W. HOPKINS.</hi></head>

						<p>This biographical sketch has to do with Murat W. Hopkins, who has for a number of
							years been recognized as one of the successful lawyers of Indianapolis. As a citizen
							he is public spirited and enterprising; as a friend and neighbor, he combines the
							qualities of head and heart that have won confidence and respect; as an attorney, he
							is easily the equal of his professional brethren at the Marion county bar.</p>

						<p>Murat W. Hopkins, now one of the leading attorneys of Indianapolis, and formerly a
							resident of Hendricks county, Indiana, was born in Brown township, this county, on
							October 20, 1857, the son of William and Ruah (Harding) Hopkins, his father being a
							native of Maryland and his mother of Kentucky. William Hopkins was a farmer all of his
							life, coming to Hendricks county, Indiana, about 1840, and locating in Brown township,
							where he followed the occupation of a farmer until his death, which occurred in 1891.
							William Hopkins was one of the prominent citizens of the county in that early day, and
							for many years served as trustee of his township. He <pb id="VAC1000-698" n="642"/>
							also held many other appointments of trust and frequently served as administrator or
							guardian. Mrs. William Hopkins died in 1907. They were the parents of six children.
							Mrs. Sarah Lawhead, of Newburgh, New York; Erastus, of Marienthal, Kansas; Wyatt,
							deceased; Liston, of Salem, Oregon; Everett, who lives on the old home place two and
							one-half miles north of Brownsburg, and Murat W., the immediate subject of this
							review.</p>

						<p>Murat W. Hopkins was born and reared on his father's farm, receiving his elementary
							education in the district schools of his home township. He taught in the public
							schools of this county and then attended the State Normal School at Terre Haute, after
							which he entered the State University of Iowa City, where he received his degree of
							Bachelor of Law in 1881. The following year he began the practice of law at Danville,
							and continued there until 1891 when he went to Indianapolis, at which city he has
							built up a successful practice in general work and specializing in legal work relating
							to corporations. He has been a constant student of the law and during his practice of
							nearly twenty-five years in the Capitol City he has enjoyed a successful practice and
							now occupies an influential position among the lawyers of that city. He is a member of
							the Indianapolis Bar Association, the Indiana Bar Association and the American Bar
							Association.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hopkins was married on April 20, 1882, to Allie L. Montgomery, of Mattoon,
							Illinois, who was formerly a resident of Brownsburg, Hendricks county, and was a
							daughter of Tyra and Caroline (Lockhart) Montgomery. Her grandfather was Thomas
							Lockhart, a pioneer Christian preacher of Indiana. Mr. and Mrs. Hopkins have two
							daughters, Kate Elliott, the wife of Wendall Coval, of Indianapolis, and Caroline
							Ruah. the wife of Donald Gordon, of Metamora, Indiana.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hopkins has been affiliated with the Democratic party since he reached voting age
							and has always taken an active interest in the affairs of his party. However, he has
							not felt inclined to enter into the struggle for any official position, being content
							to devote his time and energy to his interesting and successful legal practice. He is
							a member of the Indiana Democratic Club at Indianapolis, and he is also a member of
							the Art Association of that city. Fraternally, he belongs to the Free and Accepted
							Masons, is a Scottish-Rite Mason, and belongs to the Ancient Arabic Order of Nobles of
							the Mystic Shrine and the Knights of Pythias.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hopkins, in his public and private life, is regarded as a man of high integrity,
							with kindly impulses for his fellow citizens and always ready to help those who are
							deserving of assistance. His love of good books has caused him to accumulate a goodly
							sized private library, in which can be <pb id="VAC1000-699" n="643"/> found many old,
							rare, interesting and valuable volumes. In his law library is to be found one of the
							very few complete sets now in existence of the session laws of Indiana enacted by the
							General Assembly since the formation of the state. There will also be found in his law
							library original volumes of the Indiana territorial laws, enacted before the state was

						<head><hi rend="center">CALVIN T. HAULK.</hi></head>

						<p>In the agricultural circles of Hendricks county, Indiana, a county noted for the
							degree of success attained and the high standing of its citizens following that
							vocation, there is no one more deserving of favorable comment than he whose name is
							found at the head of this paragraph. He is descended from some of the earlier families
							of the county, men and women who endured all the privations and sufferings of the
							early pioneers. The attributes of their stalwart characters still find expression in
							their sons and daughters of today and the energy, perseverance and enterprise which
							Calvin T. Haulk has exhibited in carrying his plans to successful execution mark him
							worthy of the ancestors who did so much to impress upon this locality in its early
							days the principles of correct living and advanced ideas.</p>

						<p>Calvin T. Haulk was born on December 28, 1870, in eastern Tennessee, the son of
							Andrew and Seda Emeline (Ottinger) Haulk, both of whom were natives of the same state,
							the former having been born in Greene county and the latter in Cook county, the
							daughter of Thomas and Lavina (Ottinger) Ottinger. Thomas was born in Virginia and
							Lavina in Pennsylvania and, despite the similarity of name, there was no relationship
							existing between the two families. Andrew Haulk, father of the immediate subject, was
							born on January 1, 1847, and was the son of William Haulk, also a native of Greene
							county, Tennessee. All his life Andrew was engaged in farming in his native county and
							died there on August 3, 1872, leaving his widow and three small children, namely:
							Calvin (the subject), Wade and Malvina. Early in her widowhood, Mrs. Andrew Haulk
							brought her three children to the home of her brother, Wylie Ottinger, who lived near
							Whitestown, Boone county, this state, and in February, 1883, she again united in
							marriage, this time becoming the wife of Jacob Neese, also a native of Cooke county,
							Tennessee, and a son of Abraham and Mollie (Blazer) Neese. When Jacob Neese was twelve
							years old, his parents left their native state and came to Boone county, where they
							passed the remainder of their lives. They left Tennessee <pb id="VAC1000-700" n="644"
							/> during the Civil War, making the journey all the distance in a wagon, bringing with
							them only a few of the most precious of the family effects. Jacob Neese grew to
							manhood on the home farm in Boone county and about the year of 1900 he and his wife
							came into Hendricks county and now reside in the southeastern part of Lincoln
							township. To their union have been born five children, Wesley, Delia, Charles, Grace
							and Earl. Mr. Neese is identified with the Methodist Episcopal church and his wife is
							a member of the Lutheran society.</p>

						<p>Calvin T. Haulk remained with his mother until the time of his marriage. In his
							boyhood days he attended the district schools of their locality, where he secured the
							rudiments of a good education, and after leaving school he engaged in farm work,
							working out among the neighbors. On December 16, 1893, he was united in marriage with
							Addie B. Isenhouer, who was born July 9, 1872, in Boone county, near Whitestown, and
							is the daughter of William W. and Mary (Claman) Isenhouer. William W. Isenhouer was
							born in Boone county in 1850, being a son of Jonathan and Margaret (Whisnand)
							Isenhouer. His parents were also natives of Tennessee and early in their married life
							made the journey through the wilderness from Monroe county to Boone county, this
							state, about 1848. They came on horseback, carrying their oldest son, following the
							faint trails through the forests, fording streams, and in due time reaching the new
							country. They did not stay long in Monroe county, coming almost directly to Boone,
							where there were few traces of civilization at that early date. They entered a tract
							of government land which was heavily timbered, and this they removed first of all so
							as to erect a cabin home. Gradually they reclaimed the soil from the grasp of the
							wilderness, gradually acquired greater comforts in the home, and on this homestead
							near Whitestown they lived to a good old age. They celebrate their golden wedding
							anniversary November 9, 1887. His death occurred in August, 1894, and she survived
							until December 24, 1911, age ninety-two years, eleven months and three days. Isaac and
							Rebecca Whisnand, parents of Margaret and Rebecca Whisnand, come from eastern
							Tennessee in 1830, and settled near Bloomington, Monroe county, which at that time
							comprised but a few cabins and was called Hendersonburg. There they settled on a farm,
							where they spent the remainder of their days and died. Isaac Whisnand was opposed to
							matters religious and did not train his children in any faith. Margaret obtained
							possession of a Testament by stealth and kept it hid from her father under a sugar
							trough, where she went to read it and pray. Its beautiful truths <pb id="VAC1000-701"
								n="645"/> appealed to her girlish heart and she joined the Methodist church at
							Whitestown. At that time the society had no church building, but a short time after an
							edifice was erected in which the society worshipped for a number of years. Within the
							last few years it was torn down, and she alone was living of its members at the time
							of its erection. Her husband also became a member at the time of its erection. Her
							husband also became a member of that church through her ministrations. William W.
							Isenhouer was united in marriage with Mary Angeline Claman in 1870. She was born in
							Monroe county, this state, being the daughter of William and Rebecca (Whisnand)
							Claman. William Claman was the son of John Claman, a native of West Virginia, who,
							with his wife, come to Indiana about 1835. In 1836 William Claman married Rebecca
							Whisnand, who was a twin sister of William W. Isenhouer's mother. After marriage,
							William W. Isenhouer settled down to farming and stock raising near Whitestown where
							he remained until 1883, when he removed to Missouri where the family stayed a year and
							then returned to the old home near Whitestown. In 1886 they again left the farm, this
							time taking up their residence in Lebanon, Boone county, and in 1906 left the Hoosier
							state, going to Arkansas, where his death occurred in 1909. His widow still resides in
							that state. William W. Isenhouer was a most affectionate husband and father, a man of
							marked domestic traits who was never happier than when doing something for those he
							loved. He was a faithful friend and neighbor, always obliging and self-sacrificing and
							ever anxious, to extend a helping hand to those in need, even at the cost of self
							denial. For many years he was in poor health, but was of such a sincere and cheery
							disposition that he habitually looked on the bright side of life and bore his
							affliction in a spirit of meekness. For many years he and his wife had been faithful
							members of the Methodist Episcopal church and through its teachings he found the
							beautiful way of life that even suffering could not darken for him.</p>

						<p>After marriage, the subject and wife lived in Boone county on a rented farm and in
							March, 1904, purchased the farm where they now reside in the southeastern part of
							Lincoln township, this county. The farm comprises sixty-three acres and is in an
							excellent state of cultivation. To Mr. and Mrs. Haulk have been born five children,
							namely: William Russell, born March 25, 1895; Ernest Isaac, born September 27, 1897;
							Ray Andrew, born December 19, 1899; Ruth Annabel, born January 2, 1905, and Margaret
							Evangeline, born February 26, 1911. Both Mr. and Mrs. Haulk are devout members of the
							Methodist Episcopal church, she having united with that society at the early age of
							thirteen.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-702" n="646"/>

						<p>In politics Mr. Haulk is a Republican, though taking no active interest in politics,
							and his fraternal affiliations are with the Modern Woodmen of America. He is a
							self-made man, who has worked hard to get ahead in financial matters and has displayed
							the, marked economy which is a distinct trait of the enterprising American farmer. He
							went into debt in the purchasing of his farm and then his efforts were bent to
							discharging that obligation and acquiring all modern comforts to make more pleasant
							the daily life. No longer is the vocation of farming looked upon as one of hardship
							and privation, for more and more the American public is coming to realize that the man
							who is most independent, who has the opportunity to most fully live and enjoy life, is
							the farmer. All the conveniences of the modern home of the city are within his reach
							and in addition he enjoys the freedom and independence known in no other vocation.
							Mrs. Haulk's family were among the first in this section of the country and have many
							interesting experiences to tell. There were no matches and fire was kept constantly
							burning. If by any chance this should become extinguished, it was a laborious task to
							carry fire from the nearest neighbor, possibly some distance away. Tallow candles and
							"dips" furnished the illumination and the big fireplace was where the meals were
							prepared. How changed are all these conditions, brought about by men of foresight,
							energy and thrift, and in this class of worthy citizens the subject of this sketch
							well belongs.</p>

							claim and it is safe to say that he is just as proud of his home county.</p>

						<p>Amos D. McCormick, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Aquilla S. McCormick, was born February
							24, 1870, northeast of Cartersburg, Hendricks county, Indiana. He remained at home
							until eighteen years of age and then started to clerk in the store of Pruitt Brothers
							at Cartersburg, where he remained for three or four years. He then went to work in the
							store of W. T. Jordan at Pittsboro where he remained until he was twenty-six years of
							age. He then went into the poultry business at Cartersburg and followed this for the
							next two years, when he went to farming on the farm where he was born. He was
							ambitious, however, to get into the business world and when the opportunity presented
							itself he left the farm and took a position with a lumber company. On March 1, 1901,
							he went to Linton and took a position with the Greer-Wilkinson Lumber Company, the
							largest lumber company in Indiana, having at that time forty yards throughout the
							state. He remained with this company a little more than two years and then went into
							the employ of the New Union Lumber Company at the same place as manager of their
							yards. From there he went to Indianapolis in the winter of 1906 and became estimator
							for the Burnett-Lewis Lumber Yards Company. Two years later he resigned his position
							and then spent a year at Los Angeles, California, with the Wells Fargo Express
							Company, but his love for the lumber business drew him back into that again and in
							1908 he returned to Indiana and became manager of the New Union Lumber Company at
							Jasonville. He continued there until August 20, 1911, when he took his present
							position as manager of the Capitol Lumber Company, yard Number Two at Forty-eighth
							street and Monon railroad in Indianapolis. He has a thorough knowledge of the lumber
							business in all its details and is rapidly pushing to the front as a capable man in
							that line of business.</p>

						<p>Mr. McCormick was married in 1895 to Kate Brent, the daughter of George and Marion
							(McVay) Brent. His wife was born on the old Brent homestead, one and one-half miles
							southwest of Pittsboro. Her father was born on a farm near Campbellsburg, Kentucky,
							about 1844 the son of Sanford Brent and wife. He came to Hendricks county while a
							young man and was married to Marion McVay, the daughter of Molar and Mary (Bradshaw)
							McVay. The Bradshaws were early pioneers of this county. George Brent was a farmer all
							of his life, and died March 16, 1879, at the early age of thirty-five. After his death
							his widow married Dr. J. S. French, of Crawfordsville, and has lived in Pittsboro ever
							since. Mr. and Mrs. McCormick <pb id="VAC1000-704" n="648"/> have one son, Edwin, born
							February 2, 1901. They still own the farm which was entered by Mr. McCormick's
							grandfather.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. McCormick are members of the Third Christian church of Indianapolis and
							liberal supporters of that denomination. Mr. McCormick is a man of excellent parts and
							by his strong and vigorous personality has won success in his chosen field. He
							thoroughly understands every phase of the lumber business and because of this fact he
							is a very valuable man to the company which employs him. He is a wide reader and a
							close observer of men, and enjoys a large acquaintance among the business men of
							Indianapolis. He is a man of integrity and honor and lends his support to all measures
							which make for the welfare of his community, and for this reason is deservedly held in
							high regard by all who know him.</p>

						<p>In placing Obed Underwood in the front rank of the farmers of Hendricks county,
							simple justice is done to a biographical fact universally recognized by all who are
							familiar with his history. A man of sound judgment, wise discretion, thorough
							agricultural knowledge and business ability of a high order, he has managed his
							affairs with splendid success and has so impressed his individuality upon the
							community as to gain recognition among the leading citizens and public-spirited men of
							affairs.</p>

						<p>Obed Underwood, the son of William and Harriett (West) Underwood was born at
							Winchester, this county, on September 21, 1854. William Underwood was born in Shelby
							county, Kentucky, in 1824, the son of John and Rebecca (Radford) Underwood. When
							William was still a small lad his parents came to Hendricks county, Indiana, where
							they entered a large amount of government land in Marion township, and here they spent
							the remainder of their lives, rearing a family of seven children, William, the father
							of Obed, being the eldest child; Franklin, Charlotte, Elizabeth, Catherine, Sarah and
							Ellen. William Underwood was reared in this township and married Harriett West, who
							was a native of Kentucky, the daughter of Isaac and Polly Ann West. She came to this
							county when a child with her parents. Her father, Isaac West, now deceased, was one of
							the early pioneers of Hendricks county. He was born in Wayne county, Kentucky, and was
							a son of Alexander and Sarah West. He had no educational advantages in his youth and
							was early compelled to earn his own living. He married in Kentucky <pb

							<pb id="VAC1000-706" n="649"/> and his wife, Polly, the daughter of George Turner,
							came to Indiana in 1827 with her parents and settled in the woods one mile south of
							New Winchester, where they entered one hundred and sixty acres of land from the
							government. Here they lived until the death of Mr. Turner, who lived to the advanced
							age of ninety-four years, and died on August 29, 1898, having lived in this county
							seventy years. He began life with nothing whatever, and by hard work, honesty and
							indomitable courage, succeeded in clearing up a farm of two hundred and sixty-five
							acres. He was a member of the Missionary Baptist church, a man noted for his honesty
							and integrity and was held in the highest esteem by every one. His wife died December
							15, 1887.</p>

						<p>After his marriage William Underwood, the father of Obed, began life on his own
							account as a farmer and so successful was he that at the time of his death he had six
							hundred acres of land in the county. He died September 1, 1875, at the age of
							fifty-one. He was a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. His wife died
							April 7, 1912, on her eighty-fourth birthday. To Mr. and Mrs. William Underwood were
							born six children: John F., who lives in Danville; William I. and Robert L., of New
							Winchester; Mary Ellen and Angeline, deceased, and Obed, of whom this narrative
							speaks.</p>

						<p>Obed Underwood was reared in this county, spent his early days in the school room,
							and upon reaching manhood was married to Louie Bousman, the daughter of John and Mary
							(Haynes) Bousman, of Marion township. Her parents came from Clinton county, Ohio,
							about 1854 and located in Marion township, this county. Mr. Bousman was a carpenter by
							trade, although after he came to this township he bought a farm and continued farming
							and carpentering. In 1879 the Bousman family bought property in Danville, where they
							lived the remainder of Mr. Bousman's life, his death occurring February 5, 1904. He
							was a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, while he and his wife belonged
							to the Christian church. Mrs. Bousman is now living with Mr. and Mrs. Underwood at New
							Winchester. After his marriage, Mr. Underwood started farming for himself and became
							the owner of various farms in Marion township. In September, 1912, he retired from the
							active management of his farm and moved to New Winchester, where he is living a life
							of ease and comfort. In politics he is a Democrat and as a representative of his party
							has served as township trustee on two different occasions, being elected the first
							time in 1900 and again in 1904. He was an able and efficient official and served his
							party and the citizens of his county, irrespective of their political faith, equally
							well.</p>

						<p>Mr. Underwood has two daughters, Maude and Jessie. Maude is the wife of Arthur Carter
							and lives in Clay township; Jessie is the wife of Olson <pb id="VAC1000-707" n="650"
							/>\ Hunt and lives in the eastern part of Marion township, and has one daughter,
							Marvel. Mr. and Mrs. Underwood are faithful and consistent members of the Missionary
							Baptist church and are interested in the various activities of that denomination. Mr.
							Underwood is a man who is well known throughout the community and is highly esteemed
							by all who know him, since he has for many years been a potent factor in the civic
							life of the community.</p>

						<p>Hendricks county is indebted, perhaps, to the Tucker family as much as to any other
							for its wondrous transformation to one of the choicest sections of the Hoosier state,
							for members of this family have been leaders in agricultural, industrial and civic
							affairs since the early days. Each, with a fidelity to duty and a persistency of
							purpose peculiar to that class of men who takes the lead in large affairs, has
							performed well his duty in all the relations of life, and while advancing their own
							interests they have not been unmindful of the general welfare of their fellow
							citizens. Thus they rightfully deserve an honored place in the history of this
							locality.</p>

						<p>Nathan A. Tucker, the son of Dandridge and Catherine (Davis) Tucker, was born four
							miles northeast of North Salem, November 27, 1853. The reader is referred to the
							history of Dandridge Tucker, elsewhere in this volume, for a complete family genealogy
							of the Tucker family.</p>

						<p>Nathan A. Tucker was reared on his father's farm and after taking the course in the
							local schools he attended Valparaiso University and Wabash College. Upon his return
							from college he worked with his father on the farm until his marriage.</p>

						<p>Mr. Tucker was married September 15, 1880, to Mary E. Carriger, of Boone county,
							Indiana, the daughter of George and Sarah (George) Carriger, who came from Tennessee
							to Indiana in 1840 and located in Boone county. Upon his marriage, in 1880, Mr. Tucker
							started farming on eighty acres which was given him by his father, and he has proved
							to be a very successful farmer, since he has by his own energy and persistence added
							to his farm from time to time until he now has two hundred and eighty acres of
							excellent farming land in the county. He has his farm highly improved in every way and
							it presents a striking appearance to the passerby. His home is placed back from the
							road and is approached by a gravel roadway, lined on both sides with beautiful shade
							trees at regular intervals. The house is <pb id="VAC1000-708" n="651"/> placed upon an
							eminence, which renders it conspicuous in all directions and from which an excellent
							view may be had all over his farm. He has good barns, outbuildings and all the
							equipment which characterizes the successful farmer of today. He raises all the crops
							of this latitude and makes it a point to feed most of his grain to his own stock, his
							annual sale of hogs, cattle and sheep adding not a little to his yearly income.</p>

						<p>The first wife of Mr. Tucker died in November, 1892, and in October, 1894, he was
							married to Anna M. Spears, who died two years later and Mr. Tucker now lives on the
							old home farm with his children. There is no more interesting family of children in
							Hendricks county than Mr. Tucker's and no children in the county who have been given
							better educational advantages. He has three sons and three daughters and all of them
							have graduated from the North Salem high school, while the three sons are all DePauw
							University men. The sons are Lee, Carl A., and George D., while the daughters are
							Sarah Catherine, Etta Agnes, and Louisa J., the last named being the only one of the
							six children married. She is the wife of Logan R. Owen and lives one and one-half
							miles north of North Salem. Agnes and Lee are both teaching at North Salem, and all of
							the children, except the married daughter, are living with their father.</p>

						<p>Mr. Tucker is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons, and he and his children are
							members of the Methodist Episcopal church. His home is one where genuine hospitality
							always manifests itself, and he is justly proud of his fine children, who have all
							prepared themselves for useful members of society.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">PETER GREELY.</hi></head>

						<p>The life history of Peter Greely, one of the well known and highly esteemed citizens
							of Hendricks county, Indiana, shows what industry, good habits and stanch citizenship
							will accomplish in the battle for success in life. His record shows duties well and
							conscientiously performed in all the relations of life. Born on a foreign soil and
							coming to this county many years ago, he has grown into the life of his adopted
							country and has played his part in the drama of civilization. He has ever been an
							advocate of wholesome living and has always stood for the highest and best interests
							of the community in which he has so long resided and which has been honored by his
							citizenship.</p>

						<p>Peter Greely w as born in 1840 in county Galway, Ireland, the son of <pb
								id="VAC1000-709" n="652"/> John and Bridget (Eagan) Greely, the mother dying when
							Peter was a child of three years. The subject grew up in Ireland, remaining on his
							native soil until twenty-four years of age, when, in 1864, in company with thirteen
							other young men and girls, he set out to try his fortune in the new world. They had a
							delightful voyage and landed in New York, where all found friends. Peter had a sister
							in this county, Mrs. Margaret Corliss, who had come to America in 1860, locating near
							Brownsburg and had married a year later. Mr. Greely had owned a farm in Ireland and
							was well versed in the secrets of husbandry and upon reaching his sister's home he
							found that her husband owned a farm of forty acres in Brown township, later moving to
							Lincoln township, where he had one hundred acres. Thus it was but natural that Mr.
							Greely should turn to the work with which he was familiar, and he worked among the
							farmers until in 1869, when he purchased sixty-eight acres one mile northeast of
							Brownsburg. At the time he bought this land it was covered with dense thickets and
							timber and was very swampy, the thickets so dense in some places one could scarcely
							see ten feet ahead. There were but ten acres cleared and the only building was an old
							log house. He proceeded to clear this land, drain and tile it and has today some of
							the finest land in the county, land for which he has refused two hundred dollars per
							acre. He now has one hundred and forty acres in all. In 1908 his home burned, and he
							then erected the handsome and commodious dwelling in which the family now resides.</p>

						<p>In 1870 Mr. Greely was united in marriage with Margaret Dugan, who was born in county
							Galway, Ireland, the daughter of Patrick and Nora (Dugan) Dugan. She and Mr. Greely
							were acquainted in Ireland and she came to America soon after Mr. Greely did, finding
							friends in Indianapolis and in her earlier days here worked in farm homes near the
							city. To their union were born ten children and throughout the years Mrs. Greely
							proved herself to be a most devoted wife and mother and a woman highly respected by
							friends and neighbors. Her death occurred at midnight on March 1, 1910. John, the
							eldest son, married Mrs. Isa (Ulry) Maloney, a widow, and they live two miles
							northeast of the subject. Nora is the wife of Thomas O'Connell and resides in
							Indianapolis. Her husband is foreman for the Grocers' Baking Company. They have two
							children, Leo and Catherine. Bridget Delia is unmarried and makes her home in
							Indianapolis. Michael is teaching school at Paoli, this state. Margaret is a
							stenographer in Indianapolis. Patrick is on the farm with his father, and Kate also
							remains at home. Nellie is an instructor in the high school at Sunman, Indiana, having
							attended both <pb id="VAC1000-710" n="653"/> Butler College, Indianapolis, and the
							State University at Bloomington. Mary lived to the age of twenty-two years and Kate
							died when three years old.</p>

						<p>The entire family are devout members of the Roman Catholic church. When a youth in
							Ireland, Mr. Greely received an excellent education, being versed in Latin, German and
							the Gaelic tongues, as well as many other subjects. He is an unusually well read man
							and exceedingly well versed in the Bible and history pertaining to it. He is a man of
							high ideals and strong convictions and throughout his life has lived according to his
							ideas of the essential qualifications of perfect manhood. He is a man of influence
							among hi, neighbors and highly respected by all.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JAMES B. DOOLEY.</hi></head>

						<p>The gentleman whose biographical record is here given was for a long lapse of years
							one of the substantial farmers and honored citizens of Hendricks county. His
							well-directed efforts in the practical affairs of life, his capable management of his
							business interests and his sound judgment have brought him a fair measure of
							prosperity, and his life demonstrates what may be accomplished by the man of energy
							and ambition who is not afraid to work and has the perseverance to continue his labors
							in the face of seemingly discouraging circumstances. As a native son of Hendricks
							county he patriotically served his country during our great Civil War, and in all the
							relations of life he has commanded the respect and confidence of those with whom he
							has been brought in contact.</p>

						<p>James B. Dooley was born in 1837, about one mile west of Danville, Hendricks county,
							Indiana. He is a son of Moses and Elizabeth (Bohannan) Dooley. Moses Dooley was born
							in Virginia in 1799, and at the age of thirteen years came to the state of Kentucky
							with his mother, his father having died in Virginia. The mother and son lived in
							Shelby county, Kentucky, and there Moses grew to manhood and married Elizabeth
							Bohannan, a native of that state. In pioneer days Moses Dooley and his wife came to
							Danville, Hendricks county, Indiana. That was a primitive day, and he assisted in the
							clearing of timber from the court house yard in Danville. Their eldest child, Martha
							J., was born in Kentucky, and their other children were born in Hendricks county.
							Moses Dooley's first farm was one mile west of Danville, but later he moved to a farm
							of one hundred and sixty acres situated between Belleville and Clayton. He met with
							pecuniary misfortune by <pb id="VAC1000-711" n="654"/> going security for a friend and
							crediting others, which caused him to lose his farm. He had only three hundred and
							fifty dollars left, but later succeeded in buying another farm six miles northwest of
							Danville, in Marion township, where his son, James B., the immediate subject of this
							sketch, grew to manhood.</p>

						<p>James B. Dooley was married in 1860 to Mary Buntin, daughter of Harvey Buntin and a
							sister of John H. Buntin, of North Salem, Hendricks county. In August, 1862, he
							enlisted in Company H of the Ninety-ninth Indiana Volunteer Infantry, which was
							assigned to the Army of the Tennessee under General Logan and General Sherman. Major
							J. B. Homan, of Danville, was captain of this company and Rev. D. R. Lucas was
							chaplain. Mr. Dooley participated in some of the important battles of the war, among
							them being the battles of Dalton, Resaca, Atlanta, and many other engagements
							incidental to the march to Atlanta. With his company he accompanied Sherman to the
							sea, and was near Raleigh, North Carolina, when Johnson surrendered to General
							Sherman. The Ninety-ninth Regiment did as much marching as any in the service. Before
							going on the Atlanta campaign it saw much hard service at Haines Bluff during the
							siege of Vicksburg. They also participated in the battle of Mission Ridge and many
							other noted engagements. From Raleigh the horses and mules and artillery were loaded
							on cars and shipped to Washington, and the infantry was obliged to walk. They marched
							through Petersburg, Richmond and on to Washington, where they participated in the
							Grand Review, Mr. Dooley receiving an honorable discharge at the close of the war.</p>

						<p>After the war Mr. Dooley returned to Hendricks county, reaching home on June 15th, a
							late time of the season for a farmer to start work. His good wife had saved five
							hundred dollars from money he had sent her from the front, and she, like many other
							patriotic women of that day, had, by dint of hard work in the harvest fields and by
							other heavy labor, managed well. He was thus enabled to buy a small farm, chiefly on
							credit, which he was able to dispose of the following spring at a profit. He then
							purchased twenty acres, paying cash, and this gave him a substantial start. He
							subsequently traded this and secured more land in Marion township, and in time became
							the owner of a good sized farm, a part of which, however, was inherited by his wife.
							He and his wife had eighty acres in one tract and he had fifty-two acres in another
							part of the township, where the family home was established. He farmed there until he
							was unable longer to bear the burden of active work.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-712" n="655"/>

						<p>To James B. and Mary (Buntin) Dooley were born four children: Hattie, the first born,
							is the wife of William Bowman, and they live at Maplewood, Indiana, and have two
							children, Ernest and Homer. Minnie is the wife of Edward Dow and they live on East
							Twelfth street, Indianapolis, and have six children, Mary, Lora, Ruby, Vivian, Phyllis
							and Byron. Lizzie is the wife of John Crosby, a successful farmer, and they live two
							miles north and three-quarters of a mile east of New Winchester, Indiana, and they
							have two children, Ray and Carlos, both now students at Purdue University, Lafayette,
							Indiana. Lester, the youngest by Mr. Dooley's first marriage, died at the age of
							eighteen months. The first Mrs. Dooley died in 1903. She was a faithful member of the
							Christian church at New Winchester, and a woman of many lovable traits of character.
							On November 17, 1908, Mr. Dooley was married to Mrs. Leanah (Buntin) (Walton) Wright,
							a sister of his first wife. She was born about two miles west of New Winchester and
							grew to womanhood in Marion township. In January, 1861, she married William Walton.
							One son, Amos McClellan Walton, born of this union, died at the age of two years, of
							diphtheria. Mr. Walton and Mr. Dooley enlisted for service in the Civil War at the
							same time and in the same company, and were together until Mr. Walton's death by
							typhoid fever, near Lagrange, Tennessee, in the winter of 1862-3. Mrs. Walton later
							married John Wright, a native of Marion township, a son of William Wright and wife,
							who were pioneer settlers in Marion township. William Wright was in ,Missouri at the
							time the Civil War began and came home and enlisted in the state militia which was
							called into service at the time of Morgan's raid. Mr. Wright was a farmer and did a
							great deal of teaming and hauling timber. After their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Wright
							lived for seven years in the state of Illinois, when Mr. Wright's health failed and
							they then returned to Hendricks county, where he died. Mrs. Wright remained a widow
							twenty-four years, during which time she lived on a farm in Marion township. There
							were seven children born of her marriage to William Wright. Lena is the wife of Otis
							Hedge and they live near Valley Mills, and they had two children, only one living,
							Edna, who is the wife of Chester Jay. Retta, the second child, died at the age of
							twenty-one. Oscar Wright is a grocer and horseman at Franklin, Indiana. Maude is the
							wife of Fred Sears and they live in the eastern part of Marion township, Hendricks
							county, and have one daughter, Maxine. Donna was the wife of Charles Graham and both
							are deceased, leaving two children, Vesta and Bernice. Alice is the wife of Raymond
							Rudd and they live at Franklin, Indiana, <pb id="VAC1000-713" n="656"/> where Mr. Rudd
							is a partner with Oscar Wright in the grocery business; they have two daughters,
							Farrell and Leanah. Homer Wright has been a government employe in the Indianapolis
							postoffice for past eight years and makes his home with his mother and Mr. Dooley.</p>

						<p>James B. Dooley is retired from active life, and on September 15, 1909, removed to
							his present home at No. 1902 Commerce avenue, Indianapolis, which they had bought a
							year before. He and his wife are members of the Christian church and he belongs to the
							Grand Army of the Republic. Politically, he was formerly a Republican, but is now
							allied with the Progressive party.</p>

						<p>Mr. Dooley has always been a loyal and patriotic man, loyal to the laws of his
							country in times of peace and patriotic in defense of the flag in times of peril. He
							was one of six sons, of whom five were soldiers in the Civil War, and none of them
							were in the same regiment. Henry was wounded and Arthur was captured and confined in a
							Confederate prison, but all came home alive.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">DANDRIDGE TUCKER.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the families of Hendricks county who have descended from Revolutionary stock is
							the Tucker family, whose history is not only of general interest, but of especial
							interest to the many descendants of that illustrious family.</p>

						<p>Dandridge Tucker, one of the most highly respected and best beloved men of Hendricks
							county of a past generation, was born in Casey county, Kentucky, March 3, 1827, and
							died in Danville, in this county, on June 18, 1892. He was the only son of Lee and
							Miranda (Durham) Tucker. Lee Tucker was one of the first pioneers in Hendricks county,
							and was born in Bedford county, Virginia, May 4, 1803. Lee Tucker was the eldest son
							and third child of a family of ten children, born to Dandridge and Nancy (Settles)
							Tucker, who were also natives of Virginia. The father of Dandridge Tucker was William,
							a soldier of the Revolutionary War for seven years.</p>

						<p>William Tucker, who grew up in Virginia, married Nancy Settles, and their son, Lee,
							became the father in turn of Dandridge, whose history is herein presented.</p>

						<p>Lee Tucker, the father of Dandridge, was eight years of age when his parents moved
							from Virginia to Casey county, Kentucky. He was reared to manhood on his father's farm
							in Kentucky and married, on March 7, 1826, <pb id="VAC1000-714" n="[]"/>
							<figure>
								<p rend="center">DANDRIDGE TUCKER</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-715" n="657"/> Miranda Durham, the daughter of Thomas and Frances
							(Moss) Durham, natives respectively of Virginia and Maryland. Miranda (Durham) Tucker
							was born December 16, 1805, in Mercer county, Kentucky, and after his marriage he and
							his wife continued to live on the old homestead farm until the fall of 1834, when, on
							account of his opposition to slavery, he came to Indiana, arriving in Eel River
							township, Hendricks county, on September 12, 1834. He immediately entered one hundred
							and sixty acres of unimproved land in this township, and afterwards entered one
							hundred and twenty acres more. When Lee Tucker and his family came here in 1834,
							practically the only cleared land in the township was that of Isaac Trotter, all the
							rest of the township being a dense wilderness. In 1826 Mr. Tucker and his wife joined
							the Methodist Episcopal church in Kentucky and soon afterwards he was appointed class
							leader. Upon coming to Indiana he organized a church society of six members and his
							own house served as the place of worship for some time. Later he organized the first
							Sabbath school in Eel River township, which was also held in his own home. He served
							as class leader, steward and trustee in the church until his death. His house was
							always the rendezvous of the ministers, and no man in the county ever took a more
							hearty interest in this work than did Lee Tucker. He was an earnest advocate of
							temperance and was the first man in his township to refuse to furnish intoxicants at
							his log rollings or in the harvest field. Politically, he was an old-line Whig, but
							upon the organization of the Republican party he became affiliated with that political
							institution. He was always among the foremost to aid in every good cause. His death
							occurred June 23, 1884, his wife having passed away July 24, 1872. Three children were
							born to Lee Tucker and his wife: Lee Ann, the wife of John Durham; Dandridge, and
							Francis, who died when seven years old. In addition to rearing these children of their
							own, Mr. and Mrs. Lee Tucker reared eight orphan children, all of whom grew to be
							useful members of society.</p>

						<p>Dandridge Tucker, reared by such parents, could not help but be a man who would be an
							ornament to any community. Coming to this county when he was seven years of age with
							his parents, he spent the rest of his life here. He assisted his father to clear and
							improve the home farm and was given the meager education which was afforded by the
							subscription schools of that period. He was married on May 5, 1850, to Catherine
							Davis, who was born March 11, 1830, in Montgomery county, Kentucky, the daughter of
							Nathan and Nancy (Kidd) Davis, her parents coming to this county in 1835. To Dandridge
							Tucker and wife were born four children, David Lee and Nathan <pb id="VAC1000-716"
								n="658"/> A., whose histories are presented elsewhere in this volume; Miranda F. and
							Robert E.</p>

						<p>After his marriage in 1850 Dandridge Tucker settled on the farm where his sons,
							Nathan and David, now reside, and gradually improved the farm until it was as

						<p>Religiously, Mr. Tucker was a loyal and earnest member of the Methodist Episcopal
							church and his wife of the Christian church. His wife died February 15, 1883, and some

						<p>Mr. Tucker was always an active worker in the Republican party, and in 1847 he was
							appointed township trustee. He was elected treasurer of the board and served in that
							capacity until the new Constitution was adopted in 1852. He was a great student of
							Masonry and was one of the oldest representatives of the grand lodge of Indiana. He
							had taken all of the degrees and was one of the first thirty-second-degree Masons in
							the state. He was a man of broad, generous character, a good citizen in every sense of
							the word and a man who was indeed and in truth "four square to every wind that
							blew."</p>

						<p>The Tucker family have played an important part in the history of Hendricks county.
							The history of this family, which has been traced back through the Revolutionary War,
							discloses the fact that its members have always played an honorable and prominent part
							in the affairs of the various communities in which they have resided.</p>

						<p>David Lee Tucker, who has lived more than three score years in this county, is a man
							who stands high in the estimation of his neighbors and friends, whose interests he has
							always sought to promote while endeavoring to advance his own. He is a man of courage,
							self-reliance and of the utmost integrity of purpose, with the result that he has
							earned a full share of this world's goods and at the same time has taken a part in the
							civic life of the community in which he lives. He is a son of Dandridge Tucker and his
							birth occurred February 13, 1852, on the farm where he now lives min Eel River
							township, this county. Since the Tucker family history is given in the sketch of
							Dandridge Tucker, the reader is referred to that biography for the ancestry of David
							Lee Tucker.</p>

						<p>David L. Tucker grew up on the farm where he is now living and after <pb
								id="VAC1000-717" n="659"/> completing his common and high school education in the
							North Salem schools he attended Wabash College. He was married December 31, 1903, to
							Lillian G. Overstreet, the daughter of Aaron and Catherine (Elder) Overstreet. Aaron
							Overstreet, the son of James and Susan Overstreet, was born in Casey county, Kentucky,
							January 19, 1826. He was reared in Kentucky, and on December 24, 1850, married
							Catherine Ann Elder, and two years later came to Hendricks county, Indiana, and after
							living in several different parts of the county he settled in Union township. In
							August, 1862, he enlisted for service in the Union army in Company G, Ninety-ninth
							Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and served during the remainder of the war. He
							was in the battles of Jacksonville, Chattanooga, Vicksburg, all of the battles of the
							Atlanta campaign, and was with Sherman on his march northward from Savannah to the
							final surrender at Guilford court house in the spring of 1865, and in August of that
							year he was mustered out of the service, when he immediately returned to this county,
							where he lived as a farmer until his death, which occurred June 22, 1910. To Mr. and
							Mrs. Overstreet were born twelve children. Both Mr. and Mrs. Overstreet were active
							members of the Christian church, and, fraternally, Mr. Overstreet was a member of the
							Free and Accepted Masons and also of the Grand Army of the Republic. He was an honest,
							industrious man who had great faith in the better side of human life. He was truthful
							and optimistic to a marked degree and not only mild when life looked dark and gloomy,
							but believed that the man who is worth while he is the one who will smile when
							everything goes against him.</p>

						<p>Mr. Tucker has one hundred and sixty acres of well improved land in Eel River
							township, where he grows all the grains, vegetables and fruits common to this section
							of the state. He devotes a great deal of time and attention to live stock and has
							earned a reputation more than local as a cattle raiser. He is a man of progressive
							ideas and tendencies, and by adopting modern methods of farming and keeping in touch
							with the more advanced thought on the matter of agriculture and stock raising, has
							achieved definite success. He is a member of the Knights of Pythias at Jamestown,
							while, religiously, he and his wife are both members of the Christian church at North
							Salem. He is a man of keen business discernment, is able to foresee with remarkable
							accuracy the probable outcome of a transaction, and is by nature a man always on the
							alert, progressive, yet scrupulously honest, straightforward and unassuming, obliging
							and courteous, kindly and hospitable and he numbers his friends only by the limit of
							his acquaintances, and has won the good will and confidence of all with whom he has
							come in contact.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">CHARLES E. KURTZ.</hi></head>

						<p>In the history of Hendricks county, as applying to the agricultural interest, the
							name of Charles E. Kurtz occupies a conspicuous place, for through a number of years
							he has been one of the representative farmers of Marion township, progressive,
							enterprising and persevering. Such qualities always win success, sooner or later, and
							to Mr. Kurtz they have brought a satisfactory reward for his well-directed efforts,
							and while he has benefited himself and community in a material way, he has also been
							an influential factor in the educational, political and moral uplift of the community
							favored by his residence.</p>

						<p>Charles E. Kurtz, the son of Henry and Margaret (Logan) (Vannice) Kurtz, was born in
							Marion township, this county, September 10, 1867. His father was born in Nelson
							county, Kentucky, February 10, 1823, and was brought to this state by his parents when
							six months old. They settled in Putnam county on a farm, where he was reared and, with
							the exception of the three years he spent in the army during the Civil war, he always
							resided on the farm. He was married October 9, 1851, to Margaret Logan Vannice, the
							daughter of Lawrence and Caroline Vannice, after which they settled on a farm, where
							they continued to live the remainder of their lives, the farm at the time they took it
							being an unbroken wilderness. At the opening of the Civil War there were four little
							children in the family and when the husband and father enlisted, on August 13, 1862,
							to battle for the Union, he left his family not knowing whether he would ever see them
							again. He enlisted in Company G, Ninety-ninth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and
							was assigned to the Army of the Tennessee, and, with his regiment, participated in all
							the campaigns and battles of that command until July 22, 1864, when in the great
							two-days battle at Atlanta, he was taken prisoner and confined to the stockade at
							Andersonville. He was in this historic prison from August 1, 1864, until October 24th
							of the same year, and during this time he experienced all the horrors and privations
							of that terrible prison pen. From Andersonville he was taken to the stockade prison at
							Florence, South Carolina, and confined here for three months. On February 28, 1865, he
							was exchanged and sent north, being almost dead from the hardships he had endured. He
							arrived home March 22, 1865, and, since the war was nearly at an end, he did not
							re-enlist. While in the army he wrote home as frequently as the mails would permit and
							his letters give thrilling glimpses of the battles, marches <pb id="VAC1000-719"
								n="661"/> and incidents through which he was passing. Many a day his loving wife
							took the little flock to the forest to gather such wood as she could find for fuel.
							Many a night she put the children to bed, extinguished the light and sat with her face
							pressed against the window, where she saw men pass along the road to meet and plot
							against the government for which her husband was risking his life, but he returned and
							their happy life was resumed and they lived for fifty years after this terrible
							struggle was over. In 1901 they celebrated their golden wedding anniversary and in
							1911 their sixtieth anniversary, and on these occasions abundant testimony was given
							of the high regard with which this venerable couple was held. To them were born eight
							children: Mrs. Caroline F. Underwood; Jacob L.; Mrs. Eliza Hadley; William. H.,
							deceased; Mrs. Jennie Hadley; Charles E., Oscar and Wilbur, deceased. Living together
							for more than sixty years, they were separated in death only a few days, Mrs. Kurtz
							dying on May 28, 1913, and he dying a few days later, on June 8, 1913.</p>

						<p>Charles E. Kurtz received his education in the district schools of his township and
							grew to manhood on the home farm, part of which is now owned by him. He has operated
							his present farm since his boyhood days and has improved it in every way. The farm is
							well drained, well fenced, and he has a fine home, excellent barns and other
							outbuildings, the place being a model of neatness and convenience. While he raises all
							of the crops peculiar to this latitude, he makes a specialty of stock raising and
							breeding. He breeds Hereford cattle and ships them to all points in the United States.
							He has taken part in many fairs and expositions and has won many prizes away from his
							home county and in different states. He has displayed his cattle at the International
							Stock Show at Chicago and has carried off prizes, winning over cattle from all over
							the United States. He also is a breeder and raiser of Spotted Poland China hogs and
							finds a ready sale for his surplus stock.</p>

						<p>Mr. Kurtz was married in 1892 to Alice Henry, daughter of Thompson and Esteline
							(Jesse) Henry. Thompson Henry is a native of this county and grew to manhood on the
							old Nathan Tucker farm in Eel River township. He and his wife, who also was a native
							of this county, are now living retired at Jamestown. They reared a family of eight
							children, Jesse, George H., Oliver, Alice, Effie, Mattie, Reddie G., deceased, and one
							who died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Kurtz have four children, all of whom are at home, Ralph, Verla P.,
							Henry H. and Charles E. Mr. Kurtz is a member of the <pb id="VAC1000-720" n="662"/>
							Free and Accepted Masons and the Knights of Pythias at North Salem, and also is a
							member of the Royal Arch Masons at Danville. He is a Republican in politics and has
							always taken a more or less active part in local political affairs. He has been a
							member of the Hendricks county council and in that capacity has stood for all measures
							which promise to better the condition of the county. He and the members of his family
							are adherents of the Presbyterian church at New Winchester and are generous
							contributors to its maintenance. Mr. Kurtz has been a hard worker all of his life and
							is richly deserving of the success which has come to him. On his fine farm of two
							hundred and eighty acres he has the opportunity to show what a progressive farmer can
							accomplish and it needs but a glance over his well-tilled fields to show that he has
							taken advantage of the opportunity. Such men are welcomed in every community, and the
							greater the number of this class the better it is for the community, for it is people
							who live in any locality which really make it what it is. Therefore, Mr. Kurtz can be
							justly regarded as one of the best representative men of Hendricks county today.</p>

						<p>The history of the Hoosier state is not an ancient one. It is the record of the
							steady growth of a community planted in the wilderness in the last century and
							reaching its magnitude of today without other aids than those of continued industry.
							Each county has its share in the story, and every county can lay claim to some
							incident or transaction which goes to make up the history of the commonwealth. After
							all, the history of a state is but a record of the doings of its people, among whom
							the pioneers and the sturdy descendants occupy places of no secondary importance. The
							story of the plain common people who constitute the moral bone and sinew of the state
							should ever attract the attention and prove of interest to all true lovers of their
							kind. In the life story of the subject of this sketch there are no striking chapters
							or startling incidents, but it is merely the record of a life true to its highest
							ideals and fraught with much that should stimulate the youth just starting in the
							world as an independent factor.</p>

						<p>Martin Hession, the subject of this review, was a native of Ireland, born in county
							Galway, and about the year 1834, when fourteen or fifteen years of age, he came
							unaccompanied to America. His mother had died previous to his coming, and some time
							after he had established himself in <pb id="VAC1000-721" n="663"/> the new land his
							father joined him. He was the son of Daniel and Sarah Hession and was one of a family
							of four children, the others being Charles, Michael and Ellen. Mr. Hession first set
							foot in the new world at New Orleans, after a long and tedious journey in the sail
							boats of that day, and remained there for about two months before coming to Indiana.
							After arriving in Indiana, he found friends in both Marion and Hendricks counties and
							worked out among them on their farms at day labor. In this manner he employed himself
							for eight or nine years, when he felt able to invest in a farm for himself and
							purchased a forty-acre tract in the eastern portion of Brown township, this county. He
							lived there for three or four years, when he sold it and bought a forty-acre farm in
							Boone county. There he resided for two years, when he traded that farm to a brother
							for forty acres in Brown township, when he again became a citizen of Hendricks county,
							and has since remained here. Mr. Hession has carried on general farming and kindred
							interests and, by reason of his unfailing energy and tireless efforts, he has
							prospered. The forty acres secured from his brother has formed the nucleus for his
							present holdings, comprising three hundred and fifteen acres of as fine land as the
							county can boast, and the reputation of Hendricks county for excellent soil is well
							known.</p>

						<p>On January 4, 1860, Mr. Hession was united in marriage with Mary Hagon, who was born
							in September, 1840, in county Galway, Ireland. Her parents died in the old country
							when she was young and when but fourteen years of age she journeyed to the United
							States alone, landing at New Orleans and coming directly to Marion county, this state,
							where three of her brothers and one sister were already settled. These were John,
							Michael, Martin and Kate. After arriving at the home of her brothers she went out as a
							domestic to service on various farms in Marion county and in this way made her own way
							until the time of her marriage. Her parents were James and Bridget Reddington. To the
							union of Martin and Mary (Hagon) Hession have been born nine children, two of which
							have passed away. The others are: James, who married Belle Sharkey and resides on a
							farm about one mile north of the subject; Sarah is the wife of Martin Hession and
							lives on a farm in Middle township, this county; Delia married Darby Mulrine and lives
							in Indianapolis. Her husband is employed by Kingan &amp; Company, Limited. They have
							two children, Nora and Martin. Martin F. married Nellie King, of Indianapolis, and
							they reside just east of the subject's home; Daniel, John and Mary remain at home;
							they are the parents of three children, namely: Elizabeth, Mary and Martha. Charles
							died <pb id="VAC1000-722" n="664"/> when thirty-three years and six months of age and
							a little daughter, Julia, died in infancy. The family is considered one of the very
							best in the community and has a host of friends. The atmosphere of the home is
							thoroughly hospitable and both friends and strangers find appropriate welcome there.
							Mr. Hession, after a strenuous career, has practically retired from active duties and
							is enjoying the fruits of many years of unceasing labor. There is much that is
							commendable in his life's record, much that might well be an inspiration to young men
							with life before them and without influential friends to come to their aid. By his own
							effort and right principles of living he has not only won for himself an enviable
							competency for his declining years, but has so conducted his affairs with his fellow
							men as to win for himself the reputation of one absolutely trustworthy and honorable
							in his business dealings, and worthy in every respect of the warmest personal
							friendship. The entire family are communicants of the Roman Catholic church and give
							liberally of their substance to its support.</p>

							which he resides and a man of decided views and laudable ambitions, his influence has
							ever been exerted for the advancement of his kind, and in the vocation to which his
							energies are devoted he ranks among the representative men of the country.</p>

						<p>William S. Dickerson, the son of Ennis and Anna (Ross) Dickerson, was born February
							24, 1865, in Marion township, Hendricks county, Indiana. His father was a native of
							Virginia, and came to this state with his parents, Andrew R. and Mahila (Dodd)
							Dickerson, when but a small boy. They settled in Marion township about three and
							one-half miles north of New Winchester. Here Andrew R. Dickerson bought a forty-acre
							farm which had been entered by Paul Faught, and is known as the old Dickerson
							homestead. Ennis Dickerson was a member of the Friends church and a farmer in this
							county until his death, in 1899. He was an invalid most of his life, but in spite of
							this affliction he was a hard worker and successful in life. His wife, Anna Ross, was
							a native of Kentucky and came to this county with her parents when she was a small
							child. She <pb id="VAC1000-723" n="665"/> is now seventy-four years of age and is
							living in Indianapolis. Mr. and Mrs. Ennis Dickerson were the parents of six children:
							John Calvin, deceased; William S., whose history is herein set forth; Mrs. Eva E.
							Hadley; James Ora; Frank O. and Ella, who died at the age of eight.</p>

						<p>William S. Dickerson spent his boyhood days on the farm, and lived with his parents
							until he was twelve years of age in Marion township. They then removed to Center
							township, near Mill Creek, where he remained until he was nineteen years of age,
							returning to care for his grandmother, with whom he lived until his marriage. He moved
							on his present farm of fifty-three acres in 1905, and has improved his farm until it
							presents a very attractive appearance in every way, built fences, put up buildings and
							a neat country home.</p>

						<p>Mr. Dickerson was married January 30, 1887, to Lizzie Faught, the (laughter of Henry
							H. and Martha J. (Armstrong) Faught. Henry H. Faught was born August 23, 1841, in this
							county, the son of George Washington and Annie Jane (Hayes) Faught. George Faught was
							reared in this township, being born in 1818, the son of Paul and Elizabeth (Liszt)
							Faught. Paul Faught was one of the first settlers to enter land in this county. His
							wife, Elizabeth. died April 26, 1860, and he died one month later, May 26, 1860. Their
							son, George W., lived and died in the same locality and was a farmer all of his life,
							dying June 26, 1880. His wife, Annie Jane, died September 4, 1874. Henry H., the son
							of Mrs. Faught, was married August 27, 1863. to Martha J. Armstrong, the daughter of
							William and Mary Ann (Ross) Armstrong. William Armstrong was born in 1818 in Shelby
							county, Kentucky, the son of Levi and Susan (Johnson) Armstrong. Levi was born
							February 27, 1791, and his wife in 1793. Levi was a son of George, born in 1763, and
							Sarah Armstrong, born in 1766. The Armstrong family has traced their ancestry back to
							a much earlier date in the state of New York. They came to Kentucky in wagons and have
							lived in that state for several generations. William Armstrong grew up in Kentucky and
							in 1837 married Mary Ann Ross, a native of Kentucky. Soon after marriage they came to
							Indiana and settled near New Winchester, where they lived and died. His first wife,
							the mother of Mrs. Faught, died in 1875. In 1876 he married Amanda Harris, and died
							July 15, 1899, at the age of eighty-one, having spent a very busy and useful life.
							After Henry H. Faught was married he moved to Edgar county, Illinois, where he
							remained for five years. He then came back to Marion township, Hendricks county, and
							located two miles north of New Winchester <pb id="VAC1000-724" n="666"/> on a farm,
							which belonged to his father. After his father's death, Mr. Faught bought his
							brother's interest in the farm, thus becoming the owner of one hundred and twenty
							acres. He lived here the rest of his life, farming and trading in live stock. He was a
							Mason and both he and his wife were members of the Christian church, although at the
							time of their marriage she was a member of the Baptist church. He died March 30, 1911,
							after nearly half a century of married life. He was an earnest believer in the faith
							of the Gospel and his life was one devoted to making friends and keeping them. Three
							children were born to Mr. and Mrs. H. H.. Faught: George W., a clothing merchant of
							Indianapolis, who married Mrs. Catherine (Morris) Adams; they have one child, Cecil.
							Dora May, the deceased wife of John C. Himes of Ladoga. She left one son, Fred C., who
							was only nine months old at the time of his mother's death. He was reared by Mr. and

						<head><hi rend="center">FRED ALBERT HAYS.</hi></head>

						<p>The subject of this review as one of the most enterprising of our younger generation
							of farmers in Hendricks county, who has believed from the outset of his career that
							the "wisdom of yesterday is the folly of today," and that while the methods of our
							grandfathers in tilling the soil were all right in their day, yet in the twentieth
							century we are compelled to adopt new methods and farm along different lines, in view
							of the fact that conditions of climate, soil; grains, etc., have changed since the
							days of the pioneers. He has been a close observer of modern methods and is a student
							at all times of whatever pertains to his chosen life work, and he has therefore met
							with encouraging success all along the line, and, judging from <pb id="VAC1000-725"
								n="667"/> his past record, he will undoubtedly achieve much in the future years and
							take his place among the leading agriculturists of a community noted for its fine
							farms and adroit husbandmen.</p>

						<p>Fred Albert Hays, the son of James and Mary (Kelley) Hays, was born in Marion
							township, Hendricks county, Indiana, June 3, 1876. His father was born in this
							township March 10, 1836, the son of John and Catherine (Munday) Hays. John Hays was a
							native of Virginia and was a son of William and Mary Hays. When John was about eight
							years of age his parents moved to Mercer county, Kentucky, and there he grew up and
							married Catherine Munday, who was a native of Mercer county, the daughter of Woodson
							and Nancy Munday. In 1829 John Hays and his wife came to Hendricks county, Indiana,
							and entered land not far from New Winchester, where they lived, reared their family
							and there they both died. John Hays was a life-long farmer and owned between three and
							four hundred acres of land at the time of his death. James Hays, the father of Fred
							Albert, is one of nine children, only two others being alive at the present time,
							Harvey Hays, of New Winchester, and John Thomas Hays, who lives two miles southwest of
							Danville, in Center township.</p>

						<p>James Hays was married twice, his first wife being Mary Kelley, a native of this
							county and the sister of his second wife. After his marriage on March 24, 1857, he
							began farming on the place where he is still living. At that time the land was heavily
							timbered and he had to clear off a plot of ground large enough to build his cabin, a
							task of no small magnitude in those days. On this farm he has built three houses, his
							first two having been destroyed by fire. To his first marriage there were born four
							children: Annie Belle, the wife of James Clark, of Danville, died in 1898, leaving
							three children, Mabel, Rennice and Carlos; Hattie lives south of New Winchester, where
							she owns a farm; Frank, who married Ida Myrtle Sears, the daughter of Jeptha and Emily
							(Hamrick) Sears, lives on a farm adjoining his father's place on the east. He has a
							farm of one hundred and twenty-seven acres; the youngest child of this first marriage
							is Fred Albert, whose history is herewith outlined. After the death of his first wife,
							in 1882, James Hays married Mrs. Margaret (Kelley) Rose in 1889, who was a sister of
							the first Mrs. James Hays. She is the mother of William M. Rose, of Eel River
							township, this county, whose history will be found elsewhere in this volume.</p>

						<p>Fred Albert Hays spent his early days on his father's farm, and has been a tiller of
							the soil all his life. He moved to his present farm in March, <pb id="VAC1000-726"
								n="668"/> 1902, and now has one hundred and twenty acres of land which he operates
							in an up-to-date manner. In addition to his general farming he makes a specialty of
							buying, feeding and selling cattle.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hays was married June 2, 1901, to Emma L. Hardwick, the daughter of Warren and
							Nancy (Graham) Hardwick. Warren Hardwick was born September 25, 1839, in Marion
							township, this county. He was the son of Silas and Rhoda (Cook) Hardwick. Silas
							Hardwick was born about 1809, in Montgomery county, Kentucky, and moved to Shelby
							county, in the same state, when a child, where he remained until 1830. In 1832 he came
							to Hendricks county, Indiana, with his parents, Charles and Elizabeth Hardwick.
							Charles Hardwick entered one hundred and sixty acres of government land in Center
							township, Hendricks county, and one hundred and sixty acres in Marion township. Both
							Charles and his son, Silas, were blacksmiths and started the first shop in Danville.
							Silas Hardwick was an all-around mechanic, a good carpenter and an excellent
							cabinet-maker and in addition was a farmer of more than ordinary ability. Warren
							Hardwick grew up on the home farm and received his education in the old academy at
							Danville. He taught school for several terms in Indiana, Illinois and Iowa, and was
							married March 16, 1871, to Nancy G. Graham, the daughter of Young W. and Emily
							(Harris) Graham. Mr. Graham came from Mercer county, Kentucky, in November, 1840, and
							bought two hundred acres of school land in section 16, of Marion township, this
							county, and here his death occurred on April 22, 1846, at the age of thirty-five
							years, his wife surviving him for forty years, her death occurring on April 14, 1886.
							Warren Hardwick spent the rest of his life in Marion township, where he followed the
							occupation of a farmer and stock raiser. He became the owner of several fine farms and
							owned nine hundred acres in Marion township. Mr. and Mrs. Hardwick reared a large
							family of eight children, one of whom died in infancy; the other seven are still
							living and are as follows: Glenn; Silas; Emily L., the wife of Mr. Hays; Everett W.;
							Harry J.; Florence R., the wife of Fred Creech, and Bessie E. In the fall of 1907 Mr.
							Hardwick bought a fine residence on the Danville and North Salem road, where he lived
							until his death, which occurred May 6, 1909. Mrs. Hardwick and all her children except
							the two married daughters still reside at this home. Mr. and Mrs. Fred Hays have a
							daughter, Irene, born May 8, 1902.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hays is a Democrat in politics, but has never been active in the affairs of his
							party. He is interested in all public enterprises and takes a <pb id="VAC1000-727"
								n="669"/> kindly interest in the welfare of his fellow citizens. His wife is a
							member of the Missionary Baptist church at New Winchester and is a woman of refinement
							and culture who adds grace and charm to the home. Mr. Hays is a congenial man and one
							who is well liked by every one. He and his wife are prominent in the best social
							circles of their community and still have many years of usefulness before them.</p>

							which affected the weal of their community.</p>

						<p>The Hardwicks trace their ancestry back to the latter part of the eighteenth century,
							the first of the family to come into this county being Charles Hardwick, who was born
							during the Revolutionary War. Silas, the son of Charles and Elizabeth (Crook) Harwick,
							was born in 1809 in Montgomery county, Kentucky, and came with his parents to this
							county in 1832. Charles entered one hundred and sixty acres in Center township and he
							and his son Silas at once opened the first blacksmith shop in the little village of
							Danville, Silas being an excellent mechanic, carpenter and cabinet-maker.</p>

						<p>Silas Hardwick married Rhoda Cook and they were the parents of Warren, whose
							interesting career is briefly set forth here. Warren Hardwick was born September 25,
							1839, on the New Maysville road in the northeastern part of Marion township. He grew
							to manhood on the home farm and after completing the course in the common schools of
							the neighborhood, he attended the old Methodist Academy in Danville. He then taught
							school for several years in Indiana, Illinois and Iowa, and made an enviable record as
							a teacher.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hardwick was married March 16, 1871, to Nancy E. Graham, the daughter of Young W.
							and Emily (Harris) Graham. His wife was born in Marion township, her parents having
							come from Kentucky in the fall of 1840. Mr. Graham entered two hundred acres of school
							land in <pb id="VAC1000-728" n="670"/> section 16 in Marion township and died on this
							farm on April 22, 1846, his wife surviving him until April 14, 1886. Mr. and Mrs.
							Hardwick have reared a family of eight children, seven of whom are still living:
							Glenn; Emily L., wife of Fred A. Hays, whose history is given elsewhere in this
							volume; Everett W.; Harry J.; Florence] R., the wife of Fred Creech, whose career is
							presented in another part of this volume, and Betsie.</p>

						<p>After his marriage, Mr. Hardwick retired from teaching and devoted the remainder of
							his life to farming and stock raising. He was very successful and at the time of his
							death owned several fine farms, aggregating more than nine hundred acres. In the fall
							of 1907 he purchased a fine residence on the Danville and North Salem pike and there
							his widow and all the children except the two married daughters are now living. Mr.
							Hardwick enjoyed his new home only two years, passing away on May 6, 1909.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hardwick was a man of unusual power and concentration and achieved success
							because he was a skillful manager and a keen observer of men and conditions. His
							career was such that his honesty and integrity were never questioned and the result
							was that he was highly esteemed by a large circle of friends and acquaintances in the
							county.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">GEORGE MONTGOMERY.</hi></head>

						<p>In the year that the United States opened up its second war for independence there
							was born in the state of North Carolina a lad whom destiny was to make one of the
							pioneers of Hendricks county as well as one of its wealthiest men. North Carolina has
							sent its thousands into Indiana, but no one of its early emigrants made a more
							pronounced success in the Hoosier state than did the youngest, who uttered his first
							cry on July 22, 1812. On this date there was born in the old state of North Carolina
							George Montgomery. His father was Samuel Montgomery and he came from sturdy old
							colonial stock, that could handle the musket and hoe with equal facility.</p>

						<p>The first pictures of young George were filled with the terrible struggle which was
							then being waged between the United States and England, and those were stirring events
							which were happening just one hundred years ago. The girl whom he was to marry was
							born in the same year that General Jackson won his famous victory at New Orleans, and
							when Nancy Sturman, who was his future wife, was born, on February 27, 1815, the <pb
								id="VAC1000-729" n="671"/> territory of Indiana was just getting ready to apply to
							Congress for statehood.</p>

						<p>When George Montgomery and Nancy Montgomery were married they at once, if not before,
							began to plan to go West. It must have taken brave hearts to face a trip in those days
							to the plains of the Mississippi, but our grandfathers and grandmothers were never
							daunted by any fears. So George and Nancy talked it over with his people and her
							father and mother with the result that in the spring they decided to cast their
							fortunes in the rising state of Indiana. They induced the Sturmans to accompany them
							and the little party made their overland journey in the spring of 1837, arriving in
							Hendricks county, Indiana, when nature was at her loveliest. George and his young
							bride settled at Plainfield and the Sturmans located in Marion township. For seven
							years George worked as a farm hand for Jonathan Hadley, at the end of which time he
							felt able to purchase a forty-acre farm in Marion township. When they first located at
							Plainfield they occupied a rude log cabin with a dirt floor and a bed which was built
							into the wall. In this cabin their first three children were born and here was where
							they planned how they could buy the little farm. When they moved to the farm they put
							all of their possessions on a small sled and to the casual onlooker it would hardly
							have seemed possible that in a few years this little family would be one of the
							wealthiest in the whole county. But George Montgomery was a man who knew how to work
							and, what is more important, how to save his money. The result was that in the course
							of a few years he owned seven hundred and forty-five acres of land and was considered
							one of the wealthiest and best known men in the county. It is not every man who can
							start out in life with a wife, thirty-seven cents in cash and a roan horse, as did Mr.
							Montgomery, and accumulate over seven hundred acres of land, but that it has been and
							can be done is strikingly shown in his case. He and his good wife also reared a family
							of eight children: Julia, who died September 16, 1907, at the age of seventy-two;
							Jonathan, who was born October 11, 1836, and died June 6, 1851; Hannah, who was born
							December 31, 1839, and married Taylor Mills; James, who was born December 14, 1841,
							and whose life history is set forth in this volume; Harlan, who was born July 6, 1843,
							and is now living at Bedford, Iowa; Samuel Thomas, who was born February 12, 1846, and
							died June 28, 1869; Mary Jane, who was born September 17, 1848, and died August 3,
							1851; and Tyra, who was born December 9, 1852, and whose history is presented
							elsewhere in this volume.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-730" n="672"/>

						<p>The mother of these children died April 8, 1881, at the age of sixty-six, and the
							father lived to the ripe old age of ninety-one, not passing away until October 26,
							1903. They were truly good people and were a blessing to the community in which they
							lived so many years. The day of the log cabin is gone, the dirt floor is passed away
							forever, but the memory of such people as these will never die. They fought the good
							fight and the victory is theirs and their children and grandchildren shall always have
							cause to cherish their memory with filial reverence.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">TYRA MONTGOMERY.</hi></head>

						<p>Descended from an illustrious family, one of the earliest pioneers of Hendricks
							county, Tyra Montgomery is an excellent type of the sturdy sons who have placed this
							county in the foremost ranks among the agricultural counties of the state. He has been
							one of the factors in the material development of his particular locality and has
							always been foremost in lending his encouragement, to worthy causes of every kind.</p>

						<p>Tyra Montgomery, the son of George and Nancy (Sturman) Montgomery, was born in Marion
							township, Hendricks county, in 1852. Inasmuch as a history of George Montgomery is
							presented elsewhere in this volume, it is not necessary to go into detail concerning
							his interesting career at this place. Suffice it to say that he was one of the best
							known of the early pioneers of the county and a man who left a deep impress upon the
							county.</p>

						<p>Tyra Montgomery received an excellent common school education and continued to reside
							under the parental roof until after his marriage. As a boy he was ambitious and worked
							his own way through the graded schools at Amo by working out and fattening hogs of his
							own, thus early showing a dependence upon his own efforts. At the age of twenty-three
							he was married to Amanda Wilson, the daughter of Peter and Delilah Wilson, and to this
							union there were born two children, Alice and Grace Ann.</p>

						<p>Mr. Montgomery continued to farm until 1891, when he decided to quit farming and go
							on the road for the Huber Threshing Machine Company. He was in the employ of this
							company for the next seven years, part of the time being on the road and part of the
							time in their offices doing clerical work of various kinds. He is an expert penman and
							accountant and made a valuable man in the office for that reason. In 1898 he returned
								<pb id="VAC1000-731" n="673"/> to Marion township and married Mrs. Mary Riley, the
							widow of William Riley, she being a native of Orange county, Indiana. She is the
							daughter of Mahlon and Charity (Morris) Leonard, and has one daughter by her first
							marriage, Nora, who has been adopted by her stepfather.</p>

						<p>Mr. Montgomery is a stanch Democrat, but does not take an active part in the
							political game, preferring to devote his time and energies to his agricultural
							interests. He has two highly productive farms. One consists of eighty acres near the
							northwest part of Danville, where he has just built a modern home in a beautiful
							location commanding a very broad view of the country. His other farm is one of eighty
							acres in the northeast part of Marion township. The family are very fond of music and
							have several musical instruments in the house, the daughter being an accomplished
							musician. Mr. Montgomery is a very genial man who easily makes the stranger feel at
							home and is known throughout the neighborhood as a man who is charitable to the faults
							of others and who tries to help all those who are in distress in any way. He has a
							big, whole-souled heart, which makes him friends everywhere he goes.</p>

						<p>The one of whom this narrative speaks is one of those strong, self-reliant and
							determined characters who are occasionally met with and who are of such a distinct
							type as to seem born leaders of their fellow men. Not that Mr. Gowin courts that
							distinction, for he is entirely unassuming, but his great force of character and his
							zeal and energy in whatever he undertakes naturally places him at the head of the
							crowd, and he has been a potent factor in the development of Hendricks county, where
							he has long maintained his home and where he is well known to all classes for his
							honorable and industrious life, both in private and public.</p>

						<p>Oliver Sayer Gowin, the son of Steven and Eliza (Debery) (Walton) Gowin, was born in
							Marion township, Hendricks county, Indiana, two miles from his present farm, on
							October 16, 1854. His father was left an orphan at a tender age, his parents, James
							and Mary Gowin, both dying shortly after his birth in Virginia. He was sent to
							Frankfort county, Kentucky, where he was reared to manhood by his uncle. Steven Gowin
							was twice married, his first wife being a native of Kentucky, and to this first <pb
								id="VAC1000-732" n="674"/> marriage were born twelve children, only one of whom,
							Jane, is living at the present time, the other eleven being as follows: Etna, James,
							William, Allen, Sarah, Mary, Steven Merritt, Elizabeth, Robert, John and two unnamed,
							who died in infancy. After his first marriage, in Kentucky, Steven Gowin moved to
							Ripley county, Indiana, where his first wife died, and some time after this he was
							married to Mrs. Eliza (Debery) Walton, and to the second marriage six children were
							born: Love, deceased; Emily Adeline; Oliver Sayer, whose biography is set forth in
							this review; Alexander Campbell Buchanan; Cynthiana Ellen and Ann Eliza. While living
							in Ripley county, this state, Steven Gowin purchased a farm, but in 1852 he sold this
							place and moved to Hendricks county, where he settled in Marion township, about seven
							miles northwest of Danville. Here he purchased eighty acres and later added thirty
							acres more, and on this farm of one hundred and ten acres he lived the remainder of
							his life. He was a Whig in politics in the early days, and upon the dissolution of
							that old party, in 1852, he became a Democrat. He was a member of the Christian church
							at New Winchester and a man who was well known and highly respected in the community
							where he lived.</p>

						<p>Oliver Sayer Gowin, the third child of his father's second marriage, was given his
							elementary education in the district schools of Marion township and spent his boyhood
							and early manhood days on his father's farm. Upon reaching his majority, in 1875, he
							was married to Mary E. Blanton, the daughter of John and Delilah (Ragland) Blanton.
							John Blanton was born in Kentucky in 1811 and came to Hendricks county with his
							parents when a young man. He was a farmer all his life and died in 1873. His wife was
							also a native of Kentucky, her birth having occurred there in 1825, and her death
							occurred in this county in 1907, at the advanced age of eighty-two.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Gowin have seven children: Esther Ann, the wife of Daniel Dodds,
							a farmer of Eel River township, in this county; Alva Porter, who married Mamie Rooker,
							and who lives on a farm in Marion township, this county; he has four children living
							and one who died in infancy, Cecil, Ollie, Jennie and Raymond; Charles, who died at
							the age of thirteen; Edgar M. married Emma Eggers, and is a farmer in Marion township,
							has one daughter, Dorothy, living, while three children died in infancy; Lilly Tessie,
							who became the wife of Maurice Sutherlin, who was formerly a teacher, but is now a
							farmer in Putnam county, this state, and they have one son, Howard; Mamie, the wife of
							Allen Eggers, a farmer <pb id="VAC1000-733" n="675"/> of Putnam county, Indiana, and
							Clarence B., the youngest in order of birth, who is still under the parental roof.</p>

						<p>Mr. Gowin has been a farmer since the age of ten, starting out at that early age by
							renting a small tract from his father and tending his crops with the enthusiasm which
							characterizes boys of that tender age. Upon his marriage, he rented a farm of eighty
							acres four miles northwest of New Winchester and remained on this farm for the first
							three years of his married life. He then moved to the eighty acres adjoining his
							present farm and lived here for twelve years, after which he moved to his former farm
							of eighty acres and spent the next three and one-half years there. He then returned to
							his other eighty acres and, after living there for about a year and a half, he moved
							to his present place in 1895, where he has since resided. By close attention to his
							business and by good management he has succeeded in accumulating a fine farm of two
							hundred and forty acres. He is what the world delights to honor, a self-made man, and
							is not at all ashamed of the fact that he started out in life with nothing.</p>

						<p>Mr. Gowan is a Progressive Republican and is well informed upon all the political
							questions of the day, being a wide reader of magazines and newspapers. He has never
							held any office except that of township supervisor. He and his wife are members of the
							Christian church at New Winchester, and he has been a trustee of the church for a
							number of years. Mr. Gowan has managed his affairs in such a way as to keep his
							reputation unblemished before the world, and in his whole life of three score years in
							this county no act of his has ever been the occasion for censure upon the part of his
							fellow citizens. He has lived the quiet, unostentatious life of the good American
							citizen and is an honor and credit to the community in which he lives.</p>

						<p>Hendricks county, Indiana, has reason to take pride in the personnel of her corps of
							medical men from the earliest days in her history to the present time, and on the roll
							of honored names that indicates the services of distinguished citizens in this field
							of endeavor there is reason in reverting with gratification to that of Dr. Bertrand M.
							O'Brien, of Danville, who has attained eminence in his chosen profession and for a
							number of years has stood among the scholarly and enterprising physicians in a
							community long distinguished for the high order of its medical talent. He realized
							early that there is a <pb id="VAC1000-734" n="676"/> purpose in life and that there is
							no honor not founded on worth and no respect not founded on accomplishment. His labors
							have been eminently worthy because they have contributed to a proper understanding of
							life and its problems.</p>

						<p>Bertrand M. O'Brien, the son of John O. and Rachel (Anderson) O'Brien, was born in
							Putnam county, Indiana, October 5, 1880. His father was born in county Tipperary,
							Ireland, in May, 1819, and was the son of James O'Brien. At the age of twenty-one John
							O'Brien came to America and for the first four or five years worked on the steamboats
							on the Mississippi river. He then came to Greencastle, where he worked for three years
							and then moved to Hamrick Station, bought land and followed the occupation of a farmer
							for the remainder of his life. His wife was a native of Putnam county, this state, and
							a woman of great strength of character. John O'Brien became a prominent citizen of
							Hamrick Station and vicinity and as an indication of the esteem in which he was held
							by his fellow citizens it may be noted that he was elected as township trustee on two
							different occasions, and served with fidelity and efficiency throughout his whole term
							of office. He was a member of the Catholic church, while his wife adhered to the
							Christian church. His death occurred February 6, 1905, and his widow is still living
							in New Winchester, this county.</p>

						<p>Dr. Bertrand M. O'Brien was reared on the home farm and while a youth farmed on the
							shares in the neighborhood in order to get money for his education. After graduating
							from the Manhattan high school in his county, he attended the Central Normal College
							at Danville. However, he was determined to obtain a medical education, and he entered,
							in the fall of 1899, the St. Louis College of Physicians and Surgeons, and worked his
							way through, graduating with honor in April, 1903. He at once began the practice of
							medicine at Hazelwood, in Putnam county, this state, but after a year he entered into
							a partnership with another physician at Filmore. This partnership continued for one
							year, after which he came to New Winchester on March I, 1905, where he has since
							continued to reside. Here he has built up a very large and lucrative practice and is
							justly regarded as one of the best physicians of this section of the state. In 1913,
							in order to keep fully abreast of the times, he took a post-graduate course at the
							State University of Illinois, at Chicago. He is a wide reader of all literature
							bearing upon his profession and takes a deep interest in all the associations which
							deal with his profession.</p>

						<p>Doctor O'Brien was married May 18, 1902, to Candace Bowman, the daughter of John M.
							and Sarah Bowman. Her father is a farmer in <pb id="VAC1000-735" n="677"/> Putnam
							county. Doctor O'Brien and wife are the parents of two children, Berenice and Waldo.
							Fraternally, he is a member of the Modern Woodmen of America and the Independent Order
							-of Odd Fellows, while he and his wife are both members of the Christian church of New
							Winchester. The Doctor is a very genial gentleman to meet and has an ever-increasing
							number of friends who take delight in his success. His career is a splendid example of
							what can be accomplished by a determined American youth when he makes up his mind to
							qualify himself for any particular profession and should be a source of inspiration to
							others who are forced to make their own way in the world. Doctor O'Brien is just
							entering into the period of his life where his usefulness is increasing and in the
							course of time he bids fair to become one of the most valuable members of the
							community in which he is living.</p>

						<p>Among the citizens of Hendricks county who have built up comfortable homes and
							surrounded themselves with many of the luxuries of life, no one has attained a higher
							degree of success than Henry C. Rodney. His story reads like a romance, for there
							appears to be much of accident and the whims of fortune in his life's career. His
							family history goes back to France on one side and England on the other, and if his
							father had not been a Confederate soldier he would not be represented in this volume
							.today. Michael Rodney, the father of Henry C. Rodney, was born in New Orleans,
							Louisiana, on July 4, 1845. His father was a native of England and his mother was a
							French woman. Michael's father was a merchant in New Orleans. and he had two brothers
							who were sailors, and one is still a pilot at the jetties at the mouth of the
							Mississippi River. Michael C. Rodney received part of his education in the common
							schools at New Orleans, then went to France for a year. On returning to New Orleans
							during the Civil War, he was immediately drafted into the Confederate army and sent to
							the front, and participated in the fighting around Vicksburg. Upon its surrender, he
							was captured and sent to Camp Morton, at Indianapolis, where he was released after
							eighteen months. After his release he was absolutely friendless, penniless and a mere
							lad less than twenty years of age. He started out to walk from Indianapolis and, going
							in a westerly direction, he came across J. M. Crawford, who lived southwest of Clayton
							on the National road. Mr. Crawford thought him a likely looking youth, took him in and
							gave him employment, <pb id="VAC1000-736" n="678"/> retaining him for two or three
							years. Later he worked for Milo Moon on the Sprague farm. He then married Caroline
							Hufford, the daughter of Henry and Hulda (Snodgrass) Hufford. and after his marriage
							he moved to eighty acres of land in Center township, this county. About thirty-two
							years after he had gone into the Civil War he returned to New Orleans, where he found
							his mother and brothers still living, his father having died in the meantime. Mrs.
							Michael Rodney died July 16, 1905.</p>

						<p>Henry C. Rodney, the eldest child of Michael C. and Caroline Rodney, was horn on
							January 10, 1870, about three miles southeast of Danville. He was reared on the home
							farm and attended the neighborhood schools of his township. At the age of twenty-two
							he was married to Effie M., the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Gibbs. Mr. Gibbs was
							born on February 12, 1845. in Washington township, this county, and died January 15,
							1905. He was the eldest son of George A. and Louisa (Hubbard) Gibbs. His father,
							George A. Gibbs, was born on August 2, 1822, in North Carolina, the son of Thomas and
							Tabitha Gibbs. In 1826 George A. Gibbs, with his parents, moved to Morgan county,
							Indiana, and in 1830 to Hendricks county, this state, where they settled in Washington
							township. George A. Gibbs was reared on this place and followed the vocation of a
							farmer all his life. He began life in limited circumstances, but became well to do,
							owning at the time of his death two hundred .and seventy acres of land. He married, in
							1842, Louisa Hubbard, who was born near Mobile, Alabama, in 1827, the daughter of
							Samuel Hubbard. She came to Washington township when she was a girl of about sixteen
							years of age. George Gibbs and wife were loyal and earnest members of the Methodist
							church and active and liberal in its support. He was interested in everything that
							pertained to the betterment of the community. He helped to organize the church at
							Bartley's Chapel, and was a leading member and superintendent of the Sunday school at
							that place His death occurred in the early eighties. His wife still survives him and
							is a sincere Christian also and is still living a quiet, unostentatious life. She is
							remarkably well preserved for a woman of her years, being now eighty-seven years of
							age, and, if occasion requires, she can do the family washing, hitch up the horses or
							even climb into the mow and throw down the hay for the horses. Henry Gibbs grew up on
							the farm of his father and in July, 1863, enlisted in Company A, One Hundred
							Seventeenth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry. He served for six months in Tennessee
							and Kentucky. In 1868 he married Elizabeth Van Treese, who died October 11, 1911.</p>

						<p>After his marriage, in 1892, Mr. Rodney began farming two miles southeast of
							Plainfield, and after remaining there for a year he moved to <pb id="VAC1000-737"
								n="679"/> what is known as the Jordan farm, in the southeastern part of Center
							township, where he remained for three years, at the expiration of which time he moved
							to a farm one mile west of Plainfield, where he lived until 1898, when he moved to his
							present farm of two hundred and ten acres. However, he did not purchase all of this
							farm in 1898, but has added to the ninety-six and one-half acres which he bought at
							that time until he is now the owner of that amount of acreage. He raises all the crops
							common to this section of the country and also devotes considerable amount of
							attention to live stock.</p>

						<p>Fraternally, Mr. Rodney is a member of the Knights of Pythias, and, with his wife,
							belongs to the Methodist Episcopal church, to which he is a liberal contributor. They
							are the parents of two children, Rollie and Clifford, who are being given the best
							advantages for an excellent education. Politically, Mr. Rodney is a Progressive.
							feeling that in the principles as laid down by that party the welfare of the country
							will be advanced. His career has been a busy one, and it has been no less useful than
							busy, since he has always been an advocate of every enterprise which has for its
							object the improvement of his community. Being a man of pleasing personality, he has
							won a large circle of friends, who esteem him for his genuine worth as a man.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">ROBERT WESTERFIELD.</hi></head>

						<p>One of the enterprising and successful farmers of Hendricks county, Indiana, who has
							succeeded in his chosen vocation solely through his own courage, persistency and good
							management, is Robert Westerfield, of Center township, a man who believes in lending
							what aid he can to his neighbors and the general public while advancing his individual
							interests, consequently he is regarded as one of our best citizens in every
							respect.</p>

						<p>Robert Westerfield, the son of Davis and Betsey (Carter) Westerfield, was born in
							1855, near Keokuk, Iowa. His parents were both natives of Kentucky, his father born in
							Mercer county and his mother in Washington county, that state. David Westerfield was a
							son of James Westerfield, who was a native of New Jersey, and came to Kentucky with
							his parents when he was six years of age. While James Westerfield was still a small
							boy the Indians came to their settlement and the settlers were compelled to flee to
							the fort in which Daniel Boone was also a refugee, and here they stayed for six
							months. James Westerfield grew up near Harrodsburg, the old fort <pb id="VAC1000-738"
								n="680"/> being within two hundred yards of the present court house there. It is
							interesting to note that the fort was built around a large spring, which is still
							flowing. James Westerfield became county surveyor of Mercer county, and died in that
							county in 1866, being one of the prominent citizens of the county. David Westerfield
							was reared in Kentucky and there married Betsey Carter, who was born in Washington
							county, near the Mercer county line. David and wife lived in Kentucky until after
							seven children were born, then moved to Iowa, where they settled on a farm near
							Keokuk, and where they remained for about two years. During their sojourn in Iowa,
							Robert was born. In 1855 the family returned to Kentucky, where another child was
							born, and where the mother died in the spring of 1857. Shortly afterwards David
							Westerfield married and to this second marriage two children were born, after which
							the second Mrs. Westerfield died and Mr. Westerfield again married and to the third
							marriage nine children were born.</p>

						<p>David Westerfield, although he was a citizen of Kentucky and his father an extensive
							slave owner, enlisted in the Nineteenth Regiment Kentucky Volunteers and fought for
							the Union nearly four years. He was in the siege and capture of Vicksburg, and he had
							a son who took part in the battle of Perryville, Kentucky, which was fought only four
							miles from his home. Robert Westerfield was then a boy of only eight years and could
							distinctively hear the cannon and musketry on that memorable 8th of October, 1862. He
							thought it was thunder in a clear sky until he saw both armies pass their home.</p>

						<p>When David Westerfield was married the second time in 1857, Robert, then a mere lad
							of fourteen, left home and went to Illinois, where he hired out to work by the month.
							In August, 1874, he came to Hendricks county, Indiana, and located in Liberty
							township, where he has lived since. He hired out as a farm hand and his entire life
							has been spent in agricultural pursuits. Having left his home at so early an age, he
							has known what it is to meet all kinds of hardships and discouragements. His father
							was financially broken up during the Civil War, and his grandfather, James
							Westerfield, who owned more than seventy slaves at the time they were freed, was also
							financially ruined. Robert Westerfield started life from a very small beginning,
							indeed, as he landed in Illinois at the age of fourteen years with only thirty cents
							in money, and when he came to Hendricks county in 1874 he had fifty dollars, a horse,
							saddle and bridle, but, being of a frugal, thrifty turn of mind, he saved his money so
							that he was able to get married and start to housekeeping. He bought a team and
							started in to farm <pb id="VAC1000-739" n="681"/> on his own account, settling on a
							tract in Liberty township, this county. At the end of three years he engaged in
							teaming and followed this occupation for the next three years. In 1885 he began
							farming operations in Center township, where he lived until 1896. The year previous to
							that he purchased eighty acres of land southeast of Danville and in the spring of 1896
							moved to this place, and in the fall of that same year his barn, crops, wagons and
							tools were all destroyed by fire, but, with indomitable courage and energy, he started
							in anew, rebuilding his barn, purchased new tools, machinery and wagons and was soon
							on his feet again. Within a few years he was able to purchase forty acres additional,
							and is now the owner of one hundred and twenty acres of fine farming land in Center
							township.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Westerfield is a Democrat and has always been actively interested in
							the deliberations of his party. During the past twenty-eight years he has been
							precinct committeeman every year but two, and served on election boards from the time
							the Australian ballot was introduced in 1883 down to the present time. He has also
							frequently been a delegate to the state conventions of his party. Fraternally, he is a
							member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, both subordinate and encampment.</p>

						<p>In 1876 Mr. Westerfield was married to Elizabeth Lookebill, the daughter of Peter O.
							and Nancy (Faircloth) Lookebill, both natives of North Carolina, who came to this
							county in 1853. Mrs. Westerfield was born in Liberty township, this county, and grew
							up near Clayton. Her mother died at the home of Mr. Westerfield on Thanksgiving day,
							1909. Mrs. Westerfield's father was a soldier in the Mexican War, and also served in
							the Civil War, being a member of the Seventieth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry.
							To Mr. and Mrs. Westerfield have been born fifteen children, ten of whom are living.
							Of the five who are deceased, four died in infancy and Lulu was killed in a railroad
							accident at the age of fifteen. The ten living children are Oliver, who married Lillie
							Petty, and lives on the home farm with his father; he has three children, Hubert,
							Florence and Beulah; James William married Mrs. Nora Cornet, and lives at Brownsburg,
							and has one daughter, Mary Elizabeth. William has been principal of the schools at
							Brownsburg, and now holds the same position at Pittsboro; Amos lives at Newton,
							Kansas, and married Birdie Johnson. and has four children, Leo, Harold, Oral and Mary
							Elizabeth; Rose became the wife of Alfred Williams and lives at Racine, Wisconsin, and
							his three children, Leona,Alfred and Robert; Harlis married Elsie Miklesby, and also
							lives at Racine, Wisconsin, and has one son, Harlan; Emma married Wiley Stone and

							other children, <pb id="VAC1000-740" n="682"/> Calla, Lilly, Robert, Melvin and Martha
							Ellen, are still under the parental roof.</p>

						<p>Mr. Westerfield has ever enjoyed the respect and esteem of those who know him for his
							friendly manner, business ability, his interest in public affairs and upright living,
							and he is regarded by all as one of the substantial and public-spirited citizens of

						<p>Carey M. Hamrick, the son of William F. and Dicey (Blackburn) Hamrick, was born in
							Marion township, Hendricks county, Indiana, July 10, 1855. A complete history of his
							father, William F., is given in the history of Mrs. J. A. Tinder, which may be found
							elsewhere in this volume. Carey M. Hamrick was reared on the home farm and was given
							such education as was afforded by the subscription schools of his period. Upon

						<p>The biographies of successful men are instructive as guides and incentives to those
							whose career are yet to be acheived. The examples they furnish of patient purpose and
							consecutive endeavor strongly illustrate what is in the power of each to accomplish.
							The gentleman whose life history herewith is briefly set forth is a conspicuous
							example of one who has lived to good purpose and achieved a definite degree of success
							in the special sphere to which his talents have been devoted.</p>

						<p>David A. Clements, the son of John N. and Mary V. (Hendron) Clements, was born in
							North Salem, Hendricks county, Indiana, on January 22, 1858. John N. Clements was born
							in Clements Valley, Kentucky, and grew up and married in that state. Mary V. Hendron
							was a native of Virginia. Immediately after their marriage the young bridal couple
							took their honeymoon trip to Putnam county, Indiana. They came through on horseback,
							following blazed trails. forded rivers and threaded their way through the wilderness.
							They located first in Putnam county, afterwards going to Boone county, this state, but
							after a short stay in that county, settled in Eel River township, Hendricks county,
							about one and one-half miles south of North <pb id="VAC1000-742" n="684"/> Salem, in
							what was then known as the Round Town neighborhood. There they started pioneer life
							with their rude log cabin and all that went with it. They lived here until David A.
							was sixteen years of age, when they moved into North Salem and spent the remainder of
							their lives. The panic of 1873 brought disaster to the family and the farm had to be
							sold. John N. Clements and two sons, John E. and George H., were in the Civil War and
							served throughout that fierce struggle. John N. Clements enlisted three times and was
							wounded twice and permanently disabled. After the panic of 1873 he recovered his
							finances and died in comfortable circumstances. He was a stanch Republican all his
							life and active in the party organization. Religiously, he was a member of the Regular
							Baptist church from boyhood, his father being a Baptist minister. He lived to be
							ninety-one years of age, his wife dying at the age of sixty-five.</p>

						<p>David A. Clements received his education in the district schools of his township, and
							when he was sixteen years of age he moved with his parents to North Salem, where he
							completed his educational training, after which he started to learn the trade of a
							machinist and for fourteen years was an engineer at North Salem in a flouring mill. He
							was then left without a position upon the burning of the mill. He came to
							Indianapolis, where he worked for about sixteen months in Wasson's department store,
							following which he was appointed superintendent of the Hendricks county poor farm and
							held that position for six and one-half years, his term ending March 1, 1914. After
							leaving the county farm he purchased a farm near Brownsburg, where he now resides.</p>

						<p>Mr. Clements was married September 14, 1880, to Lettie M. Waters, the daughter of
							Harney Waters, and to them has been born one daughter, Anna Maude, wife of U. W.
							Parsons, a lumber dealer of Brownsburg, and they have two children, David Vanuel and
							Beatrice Pauline. They also had a daughter, Maurine. who died on Christmas day, 1913,
							at the age of two years and seven months. Mr. and Mrs. Clements were the parents of
							three other daughters: Della G., who died at the age of two years; Nellie C., who died
							at the age of four, and Della C., who died at the age of two years.</p>

						<p>The father of Mrs. Clements was born in Kentucky December 7, 1842, and was the son of
							William and Julia Ann (Waters) Waters. When he was a babe in arms his parents moved to
							North Salem, where his father followed farming all his life. In the fall of 1862
							Nathan Harney Waters married Rosena Zimmerman, the daughter of John and Nancy (Myers)
							Zimmerman. He was born near North Salem, his parents coming here from <pb
								id="VAC1000-743" n="685"/> Kentucky. The Zimmermans were a well-known pioneer family
							and reared a family of fifteen children. For the past ten years Mr. Waters has been
							sexton of the Fairview cemetery at North Salem. He and his wife are members of the
							Christian church and have been married for more than a half century.</p>

						<p>Fraternally, Mr. Clements is a member of the time-honored order of Free and Accepted
							Masons, and he and his wife both belong to the Order of the Eastern Star. Religiously,
							Mr. Clements and his family are loyal and consistent members of the Christian church
							at North Salem and are interested in all of the work of that church. They have a
							hospitable home and have a large number of friends and acquaintances who esteem them
							for their many good qualities.</p>

						<p>Many states in the Union have contributed to the present population of Hendricks
							county, Indiana, but it is probable North Carolina furnished as many of the early
							pioneers of this county as any other state in the Union. Most of the people who came
							from North Carolina to Indiana in the early history of the state were members of the
							Friends church, who left the state of their nativity because of their opposition to
							slavery. When North Carolina changed her constitution in the early part of the
							nineteenth century, she permitted slaves to be held in that state, and as soon as the
							Friends found that slavery was to be tolerated they made preparations to leave the
							state. Wayne county, Indiana, was practically settled by North Carolina Friends, and
							other counties in the state received large delegations of native citizens of North
							Carolina. Wherever these native sons of North Carolina settled, they became prosperous
							and influential citizens.</p>

						<p>Among the Friends of North Carolina who settled in Hendricks county, there is no one
							who has led a more highly respected and honorable career in this county than William
							Romulus Bowman, who was born March 22, 1850, in Guilford county, North Carolina. His
							parents were Richard and Polly Ann (Little) Bowman, natives of Guilford county, that
							state. Richard Bowman was a farmer in his native state and spent all of his days
							there. His wife was born in 1823, and died in October, 1910, in her native state. Mr.
							and Mrs. Richard Bowman were the parents of ten children: Leroy W.; Lysandry A.,
							deceased; Mary, deceased in infancy; William Romulus, whose history is here presented;
							Cornelia, deceased; Edmond, a resident of North <pb id="VAC1000-744" n="686"/>
							Carolina: Martha, deceased; Rufus, of North Carolina; Victor, deceased, and Mrs. Nanna
							Emma Hoggins, who lives in North Carolina. Richard was a great worker in the church,
							as was his wife.</p>

						<p>William R. Bowman spent his boyhood days on his father's farm in North Carolina, but
							upon reaching his majority he came to Henry county, Indiana, and shortly afterwards
							went to Rush county, this state, where he remained a year. He then removed to Hamilton
							county, Indiana, and three years later came to Hendricks county, where he remained for
							the next three years, later going to Morgan county, Indiana, where he married, after
							which he returned to Hendricks county in 1881 and settled on his present farm.</p>

						<p>William R. Bowman was married on December 12, 1878, to Jane Rachel McCollum, the
							daughter of Joseph and Matilda (Weesner) McCollum. Joseph Milton McCollum was born
							April 24, 1828, in Randolph county, North Carolina, and, when a young man, came to
							Guilford township, Hendricks county, Indiana, where he worked for Mr. Blair and
							others. When he came to the county he had sixty-five cents and two suits of jeans and
							spent thirty cents of his capital for a Bible. He worked for a short time in this
							county, then went to Morgan county, where he worked two years for Mr. Weesner, and
							while working there he became acquainted with Mr. Weesner's daughter, and subsequently
							married his employer's daughter in Morgan county, and began farming for himself in
							that county. He bought eighty acres of land in Monroe township, that county, and by
							diligent effort and thrift he and his wife accumulated nearly three hundred acres
							before his death, which occurred on July 15, 1908, at the advanced age of eighty.
							Joseph Milton McCollum was a great Bible student all his life and was a prominent
							worker in the Friends church at West Union, Morgan county. Throughout his life in that
							county he was an active worker in the church and attributes his success to the fact
							that he was one of the tithers of his denomination. Mr. McCollum was a prosperous
							farmer and specialized in the raising of Poland China hogs. Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Milton
							McCollum were the parents of nine children: Mrs. Delphiana Lawrence, who is living in
							Kansas: Mrs. Elmina Johnson, of Liscomb, Iowa; Mrs. Mary Page, who resides on the old
							home place in Morgan county, Indiana; Jane, the wife of Mr. Bowman; Louisa, deceased;
							John L., who lives in Michigan, and twins who died in infancy. Mrs. McCollum, now
							eighty-nine years of age, is living with Mr. and Mrs. Bowman. She came from her home
							in North Carolina to Henry county, Indiana, when a small child with her parents and
							soon afterwards the family came to Morgan county, Indiana, where they <pb
								id="VAC1000-745" n="687"/> both died. The father lived to the advanced age of
							ninety, and her mother passed away at the age of sixty-six. Mrs. McCollum is now an
							invalid, and has been for eight years, but is kindly cared for by Mr. and Mrs.
							Bowman.</p>

						<p>William R. Bowman and wife are the parents of five children: John Alfred, who died at
							the age of fourteen months; Urban, who married Elsie Thompson and has three children,
							William Harold, Blanche Maria and Richard Merlin; Urban is a farmer living in Marion
							county, near Bridgeport; Milton Richard, the third child of Mr. and Mrs. Bowman,
							married lone Dillon; he is a skilled machinist at Bridgeport, Indiana; William Gurney
							died at the age of twenty years, and Jennie died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Mr. Bowman and his wife are both faithful and loyal members of the Friends church and
							give to it their earnest and zealous support. Politically, Mr. Bowman is a
							Prohibitionist, feeling that the principles as advocated by that party, if put into
							effect, would insure the more rapid advancement of civilization in this country. Mr.
							Bowman has been a resident of this county for about forty years, and in that time has
							impressed his individuality upon his community. He is a man of generous impluses and a
							firm believer in those principles of honesty and integrity which he has always
							employed in his business. He is a man essentially of domestic taste and is devoted to
							his family and to his church, and because of the clean and wholesome life which he has
							lived in this county he has won the esteem of his friends and neighbors.</p>

							whose life of more than three score and ten years has been spent wholly within this
							state, and he has been a witness of the remarkable growth which has taken place during
							that long period. He has always led a quiet life and during his long career he has
							never forsaken the soil and the independent existence which characterizes the
							successful farmer.</p>

						<p>James E. Daugherty, the son of James and Mary Ann (Mills) Daugherty, was born in
							Montgomery county, Indiana, February 8, 1841. His parents were natives of Kentucky,
							and came to this state and settled in Montgomery county in 1830. His mother died on
							July 31, 1872, at the age of sixty-six years, and his father died at Ladoga, Indiana,
							on January 9, 1891. Mr. and Mrs. Daugherty, Sr., reared a family of five children:

							Stover, who died March 12, 1908; Mrs. Catherine Bird, who died in August, 1881, and
							Mrs. Minerva Harshberger, who died March 12, 1906; James E., whose history is here
							presented.</p>

						<p>James E. Daugherty was reared on his father's farm in Montgomery county, Indiana, and
							received his education in the schools of his home neighborhood. He was married May 27,
							1869, to Eliza Jane McCoun, who was the daughter of John W. and Melvina (Talbott)
							McCoun, and born in Jackson township, Hendricks county, on August 31, 1849. To this
							union were born the following children: Henrietta, who married Homer Paterson and died
							on August 21, 1890; Edgar, a farmer in Center township; Charles, Mary and Grace, who
							are at home.</p>

						<p>In the fall of the same year he was married, Mr. Daugherty bought a farm in section
							31, Center township, Hendricks county, Indiana, and he proved to be a very successful
							farmer from the start of his agricultural career. As a result of his thrift and
							economy he was able to add to his possessions from time to time until he is now the
							owner of five hundred and fifty-six acres of well improved land in the county. In
							addition to his heavy farming interests, he has engaged in the buying and selling of
							all kinds of live stock. He raises considerable live stock himself, making a
							speciality of pedigreed Shorthorn cattle and Poland China hogs.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Daugherty is a Democrat, while in religion the family are identified

							forcibly illustrates what energy, integrity and a fixed purpose can accomplish when
							animated by noble aims and correct ideals. He has ever held the unequivocal confidence
							and esteem of the people among whom he has labored, and his career can be very
							profitably studied by the ambitious youth standing at the parting of the ways.</p>

						<p>A man who has played a large part in the work of the Friends church and its allied
							organizations is Peter W. Raidabaugh, of Plainfield. A man of broad scholarship, fine
							business ability and lofty ideals, he has long occupied a conspicuous place as a
							churchman and as a citizen of the community where he has resided. He was born in
							Lewisburg, Union county, Pennsylvania, March 9, 1849, the son of Adam and Eve
							(Winegarden) Raidabaugh. Both of his parents were natives of Pennsylvania, his father
							being a plasterer and a man of more than ordinary ability. He was a prominent Mason
							and Odd Fellow and was an officer in the grand lodges of both orders. He had the
							reputation of being one of the best informed men on Masonry in the whole state. He
							died in the state of his nativity in 1892 and his widow survived him just ten years.
							Mr. and Mrs. Adam Raidabaugh were the parents of six children, all of whom are living:
							George P., of Baltimore, Maryland; Daniel, of Lewisburg, Pennsylvania; Charles A., of
							Atchison, Kansas; Minerva, of Lewisburg, Pennsylvania; Henry W., of Baltimore,
							Maryland; and Peter W., the immediate subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>Peter W. Raidabaugh was educated in the public schools of Lewisburg, Pennsylvania,
							and very early in life decided that he would make the ministry his life work. When he
							was only twenty years of age he began to fill the pulpit in the Evangelical
							Association church and at the age of thirty-two he was the presiding elder of the
							Lewisburg district of the Central Pennsylvania conference, of that church. He
							continued in the ministry until 1883, when he was elected editor of(the Sunday school
							publications of that church. He then moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where he lived for the
							next ten years. In 1889, on account of a division in the Evangelical Association,
							resulting in two denominations, the subject did not feel clear to go with either
							faction and he united with the Friends church and was immediately installed as pastor
							of the society at Cleveland, retaining this charge for two years. The Publishing
							Association of Friends then put him in charge of the Sunday school and other
							publishing interests of the Friends church throughout the United States and Canada,
							and he located at Chicago. In addition, he was editor of the <hi rend="i">Christian
								Worker</hi> until 1894, when the paper was consolidated <pb id="VAC1000-749" n="690"
							/> with the <hi rend="i">Friends Review</hi> of Philadelphia, and the two papers
							merged into the <hi rend="i">American Friend</hi>, the present church organ; and since
							that time Rev. P. W. Raidabaugh has given all of his time to the editing and
							publishing of the Sunday school literature of the Friends church, with his
							headquarters at Chicago. The business was removed to Plainfield in 1901 and remained
							there until 1913, when it was transferred to the Friends Bible School Board at
							Fairmount, Indiana. In 1904 he bought the <hi rend="i">Plainfield Progress</hi> and
							changed the name of the paper to the <hi rend="i">Friday Caller</hi>, and, with his
							son Walter as editor, the paper was a decided success. He sold the paper in 1910 to C.
							C. Cumberworth, but two years later he took it back again, and finally disposed of it
							in 1913 to Fred E. Warner, the present editor and owner.</p>

						<p>Reverting to an earlier period in Rev. Raidabaugh's career, during the year 1885,
							while he was serving as Sunday school editor in the Evangelical publishing house at
							Cleveland, Ohio, a city election occurred, the question of closing the saloons on
							Sunday becoming the leading issue in connection with the election of councilmen. Rev.
							Raidabaugh being a resident of the twenty-third ward, the largest resident ward of the
							city, he was requested by a large number of citizens to stand for election to council
							on the Republican ticket. At the primary he was nominated over two other candidates
							and was subsequently elected. For two years he was active in the affairs of the city,
							being chairman of the committee on printing and a member of the committees on fire and
							water and on ordinances. His voice and vote were constantly used in favor of a higher
							moral tone for the city.</p>

						<p>After the incorporation of the town of Plainfield, Rev. Raidabaugh became the first
							treasurer of the town, and was re-elected, serving for six years, with eminent
							satisfaction to his fellow citizens.</p>

						<p>In 1889 Rev. Raidabaugh was sent as a delegate from the state of Ohio to the first
							world's Sunday school convention, held in the city of London, England.</p>

						<p>Rev. P. W. Raidabaugh now finds himself out of active business for the first time
							since early manhood, although he is still the pastor of the Friends church at
							Bridgeport, Indiana, and has been in charge of that church for the past ten years.</p>

						<p>Rev. P. W. Raidabaugh was married October 15, 1872, to Sarah W. Walter, of Union
							county, Pennsylvania, and to this union there have been born three children: Walter,
							who was a very promising young man and associated with his father in the newspaper at
							Plainfield, and died in 1910; Mrs. Elizabeth Newsom, of New York city, and Helen,
							deceased.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-750" n="691"/>

						<p>Rev. P. W. Raidabaugh has lived an eminently useful life. He has always been calm and
							dignified, never demonstrative, yet his life has been a persistent plea, both by
							precept and example, as well as by written and spoken word, for the purity and
							grandeur of right principles and the beauty and elevation of wholesome character. He
							has always had the greatest sympathy for his fellow men and has ever been willing to
							aid and encourage those who were struggling to aid themselves against adverse fate,
							yet in this, as in everything else, he was entirely unostentatious. To him home life
							has been a sacred trust and the church a sanctuary of faith, and nothing has ever been
							able to swerve him from the path of rectitude and honor.</p>

						<p>William Henry Arnold was born on September 15, 1852, in Putnam <pb id="VAC1000-751"
								n="692"/> county, this state, the son of Richard and Levina (Potts) Arnold, the
							former of whom was a native of Kentucky and came to Harrison county, this state, with
							his parents, Richard, Sr., and Rebecca Arnold, being but five years of age at that
							time. Richard, Sr., was born in Kentucky on March 15, 1765, and Rebecca was born in
							the same state in July, 1773. Their marriage took place in 1790 and Richard, Jr., was
							born August 1, 1805. He grew to manhood in Harrison county, this state, and was there
							married on November 10, 1825, to Levina Potts. His life-long vocation was that of
							farming and at an early date in the history of this section he came to this county,
							settling on what is now known as the old Bowen farm. Here he probably entered about a
							quarter section of government land. He was a hard working man and cleared up his land,
							nicely fencing it and preparing it for cultivation. He remained on this farm for
							several years and then sold out and moved to Arkansas. He made the trip overland in a
							covered wagon, but so disappointed was he with the prospects upon arriving there that
							he did not even unload his wagon, but after a short rest started back to the good old
							Hoosier state. He went to Putnam county, where he obtained a farm and where he
							remained for several years and reared his family. He later disposed of this property
							and returned to this county, taking up his residence in Franklin township. Near the
							close of his life he retired from active farm work and went to Stilesville to live,
							his death occurring there. Levina Potts, his wife, who was a Kentuckian by birth, also
							died at their home in Stilesville. They were the parents of fifteen children, Jacob,
							Beckie, Margaret, Nancy, Maria, Rebecca, Richard, Malinda, John, Vina Ann, Columbus,
							and an infant, all deceased. These living, besides the subject, are George and
							Alonzo.</p>

						<p>William Henry Arnold spent his boyhood days in this county, coming with his parents
							from Putnam county when fourteen years of age. When a youth he attended the early
							schools of the township, acquiring the best education the opportunities of that day
							afforded in this community. On September 22, 1876, he was united in marriage with
							Sarah Cosner, daughter of John and Louisa (Rolla) Cosner. She is a native of this
							county, having been born at Stilesville. John Cosner was a native of North Carolina,
							born there on May 9, 1822, and died at Stilesville on January 31, 1893. He was a
							farmer all his life, a man of excellent character and ability. He was twice married,
							his first wife being Eliza Wicker, to whom he was united in marriage in 1846. Her
							death occurred on November 1, 1848, and she left one child, a son, Alfred. In 1851
							John Cosner was again married, <pb id="VAC1000-752" n="693"/> this time to Louisa
							Rolla, and by this marriage became the father of six children. Besides Sarah, wife of
							the subject of this sketch, there are Miranda, Elizabeth, Leander, Lafayette and
							Margaret. Louisa (Rolla) Cosner was a native of Ohio, born February 16, 1834, and died
							at Stilesville, this state, on October 24, 1883. To the subject and his wife have been
							born three children, Glenn, Earle and Irvin. All his life Mr. Arnold has been engaged
							in farming and kindred pursuits. Shortly after his marriage he came to reside on his
							present farm. containing one hundred and sixty acres. He is one of the best farmers of
							the county, progressive in all his methods. He is thorough and systematic in his work,
							makes a careful study of his soil and determines by scientific methods what it is best
							adapted for and then proceeds to carry out his theories with energy and ability. The
							soil with which he has to deal is exceptionally fine and for the last five years he
							has put a great deal of thought and labor on the nursery business, devoting particular
							attention to fruit trees, etc. He is the originator of an excellent pear known as the
							"Arnold" pear, which has acquired a wide reputation and is highly advertised by
							nurserymen. Mr. Arnold has been highly complimented on his success in this line of
							endeavor by men who have devoted a life of study and experiment to the same line. In
							addition to this line of work, he has considerable reputation as a raiser and breeder
							of cattle and at all times feeds considerable stock. He is an eminently successful man
							and has won his enviable position through tireless endeavor and well directed energy.
							He is a great reader, a deep thinker, a thoroughly sound and sane man and. as may be
							expected, is a delightful companion.</p>

						<p>Mr. Arnold's political affiliation is with the Democratic party in the affairs of
							which he takes a quiet, though keen, interest. He is too busy with his own affairs to
							desire public office of any sort, but at one time was induced to serve as township
							supervisor, which place he held for four years. Mrs. Arnold is a member of the
							Missionary Baptist church at Stilesville, and while Mr. Arnold is not connected with
							any church society, he is interested in the progress of all. The family is one of the
							best known and most highly respected in the county, with a strong influence for right
							in all phases of life. Mr. Arnold can honestly claim all the honor accorded him for
							what he has accomplished, for he started in life with practically nothing, but is now
							one of the substantial men of his community as a result of his close application to
							business and his persistency. He has a host of friends, for his life has been
							honorable in every respect.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">GEORGE W. WISE.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the honorable and influential citizens of Hendricks county, Indiana, is the
							subject of this brief review, who has here maintained his home for many years, winning
							a definite success by means of the agricultural industry, to which he has devoted his
							attention during the years of an active business life. His career has been without a
							shadow of wrong or suspicion of evil, and thus he has ever commanded the confidence
							and esteem of his fellow men.</p>

						<p>George Washington Wise, the proprietor of a one-hundred-and-fifty-acre farm in Marion
							township, this county, was born in Granger county, Tennessee, in 1845. His parents
							were William and Patience (Sherrod) Wise, both of whom were natives of Wayne county,
							North Carolina, where they were reared, married, and spent their earlier married life,
							later moving to Tennessee, where they remained until their death, which occurred in
							1875. George W. Wise lived in Wayne county, North Carolina, until sixteen years of
							age, and then went to Garrett county, Kentucky, where he had relatives, with whom he
							lived until he grew to manhood and married.</p>

						<p>Mr. Wise was married in 1866 to Nancy Jane Mallicoat, the daughter of Joel and Martha
							(Allen) Mallicoat. George Wise and his wife were playmates when they were children in
							Tennessee, and the friendship which was established in those early days was broken
							when he moved to Kentucky, but after Nancy Mallicoat grew to young womanhood she
							happened to go on a visit with her brothers to Kentucky, and visited in the same
							neighborhood where George was working, and they again met, and the friendship which
							was the joy of their childhood days ripened into a deeper affection with the result
							that they were united in marriage before her return to her native state. Her father
							was a prosperous farmer in Tennessee and a man of fine character in every way. He
							lived to an advanced age, his death occurring in his ninety-third year on October 20,
							1910, and when he passed away it was said that he did not have an enemy in the world.
							His wife, the mother of Nancy, died when she was only four years of age.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Wise remained in Kentucky but five years after their marriage, and then
							came to Hendricks county, where they located in the eastern part of Marion township in
							July, 1873. In this township they have lived for the past forty years. At first they
							were not able to purchase a farm, having come here with practically nothing, and as a
							result they had to rent land, but they were industrious and frugal and managed so that
							they might <pb id="VAC1000-754" n="695"/> save and have a home of their own. They
							first bought sixty acres of land just west of New Winchester, and from time to time
							added acre by acre to this until they now have one hundred and fifty acres of fine
							farming land, all of which is clear of encumbrances of any kind. They have done this
							and yet have played an important part in the material, social and moral welfare of
							their community. They have one son, William Henry, who was born in 1867. He married
							Ida Lasley, the daughter of Gabriel and Nancy Lasley, and is now living at Gonvick,
							Minnesota, where he is following the occupation of a farmer. He and his wife have nine
							children living, Clyde, Minnie, Fred, Martha, Willam, Fanny, Gertrude, Kitty V. and
							Ida May. Paul died when he was three and one-half years old.</p>

						<p>Mr. Wise has lived a clean, upright and straightforward life and there is not a man
							who has ever had cause to question his integrity. His and his wife are loyal members
							of the Baptist church at Danville and are firm believers in the efficacy of church
							work. They have always stood for the best ideals and have always endeavored to
							cultivate that sweetness which is the saving grace of civilization and the benediction
							of mankind in general.</p>

						<p>The subject of this sketch is one of those strong, self-reliant and determined
							characters who are occasionally met with and who are of such a distinct type as to
							seem to be born leaders of their fellow men. Not that Mr. McCoun courts that
							distinction, for he is entirely unassuming, but his great force of character and his
							zeal and energy in whatever he undertakes naturally place him at the head of the
							crowd, and he has been a potent factor in later years in the development of his
							community. While still a young man, Mr. McCoun has attained a degree of success which
							might well be the pride of one of a far greater number of years, and which promises
							great things for a wider field of influence as the years go on. He is well known to
							all classes for his honest and industrious life, both in private and public.</p>

						<p>Samuel C. McCoun was born on March 25, 1884, on the old homestead farm, northwest of
							Danville, Hendricks county, Indiana, and he is the son of John W. and Elizabeth
							(Carrington) McCoun. John W. McCoun was a native of the state of Kentucky, born in
							1821 at Winchester, that state. When but five years of age he was brought to Indiana
							by his <pb id="VAC1000-755" n="696"/> parents, James and Eliza McCoun. They first
							settled in Marion township, this county, where they farmed for about fifteen years.
							They were among the large land owners of the county and it is believed that they had
							entered from the government the land which they possessed. They went to Putnam county,
							this state, accompanied by their son, John W., and about the year 1856 moved to
							Missouri. There John W. remained for about a year, when he returned to Center
							township, this county, and farmed here until his death, in 1900, on the homestead
							farm. John W. McCoun was considered one of the successful farmers of his community,
							being very methodical and thorough in his work. Beside the attention he gave to
							general farming, he took great interest in his herd of Shorthorn cattle, which was
							truly a pride. He raised considerable stock at all times. John W. McCoun had no
							fraternal affiliations whatever, and in his early life had been aligned with the Whig
							party, later endorsing the platform of the Democratic party. He always took a keen
							interest in politics, but never aspired to office of any sort. For many years he was a
							faithful member of the Christian church and ordered his life according to the tenets
							of that faith. He was twice married, his first wife being Melvina Talbott, of Putnam
							county, by whom he had a family of seven children, namely: John T., deceased; James
							L., deceased; Eliza, Mrs. Daugherty; Amelia, Mrs. Williams; Robert; Anne, Mrs.
							Johnson; and Boone. The first Mrs. McCoun died in 1880 and his second wife was
							Elizabeth Carrington, by whom he had one child, the subject of this sketch. She is a
							native of Hendricks county, born in 1839, and makes her home on the old homestead with
							her son, the subject.</p>

						<p>Samuel C. McCoun spent his boyhood days on the home farm in Center township, this
							county, attending the township schools, and later took a two-year agricultural course
							at Purdue University, at Lafayette, this state. In addition to general farming, he
							makes a specialty of raising and breeding Berkshire hogs, and has raised and sold many
							animals of value. His farm is known as the Locust Grove farm and consists of two
							hundred and eighty-eight acres of excellent land, having the advantage of being
							located close to the city of Danville. Every bit of this land is under careful
							cultivation and observation and in addition there are many large and substantial
							buildings, one large building being devoted exclusively to the raising of hogs. The
							farm residence is a handsome brick structure of modern design, considered one of the
							finest homes in the county. Mr. McCoun is a most progressive farmer and an
							indefatigable worker. He is considerable of a student along the line of his vocation
							and uses his technical knowledge to the best possible <pb id="VAC1000-756" n="697"/>
							advantage. He is generous in this respect, not retaining the results of his studies
							for his own use alone, but being glad to be of assistance to others, and in that way
							he is making for himself an enviable name throughout the county.</p>

						<p>On November 15, 1905, Mr. McCoun was united in marriage with Mabel McCoun, a native
							of Hendricks county, and a daughter of Edward and Alice (Steward) McCoun. To their
							union has been born one child, Alice.</p>

						<p>Mr. McCoun's fraternal affiliation is with the ancient order of Freemasonry, being
							identified with Lodge No. 26 at Danville, and he is also a chapter member of the Order
							of the Eastern Star. Since attaining his majority, Mr. McCoun has been identified with
							the Democratic party and of later years takes the more progressive view of the leaders
							of that party. While not a member of any church, Mr. McCoun's religious sympathies are
							with the Christian church, of which his wife is a member and to whose support he
							contributes of his means. Mr. McCoun is a man of sterling character, quiet and
							unassuming in his manner, with a kindly word for his neighbors, of excellent personal
							habits and undoubted veracity. Needless to say, such a broad-minded and helpful man
							stands high in public estimation and has won to himself many who hold him in high
							regard.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">MELVILLE C. ENSMINGER.</hi></head>

						<p>A community is judged largely by the lives of comparatively few of its members. Few
							residents of Hendricks county were as widely and favorably known as the late Melville
							C. Ensminger, whose life's record was finished November 11, 1901. No man stood higher
							in the esteem and confidence of the community in which he resided than he. and his
							whole life was of such a nature as to justify the statements that he was man "whom to
							know was to love."</p>

						<p>Melville C. Ensminger, son of Samuel J. and Mary (McGee) Ensminger, was born November
							19, 1842, on what is known as the old Ensminger homestead, northeast of Danville,
							Hendricks county, Indiana, and died November 11, 1901, the result of injuries received
							in a railroad accident, which occurred between Danville and his home. He was descended
							from one of the pioneer families of the county, a history of which is given in the
							sketch <pb id="VAC1000-757" n="698"/> of his brother, Samuel B. Ensminger, elsewhere
							in this volume. He grew to manhood on the farm where he was born and reared, receiving
							his education in the old Danville Academy. After leaving school he taught for twelve
							years, and in the meantime read law for three years with Col. Christian Nave, of
							Danville, and was admitted to the bar, but never engaged in the active practice of the
							profession, spending his entire life upon the farm.</p>

						<p>Mr. Ensminger was married December 31, 1874, to Samantha A. Lineinger, the daughter
							of Aaron and Margaret (Duzan) Lineinger. A sketch of the Lineinger family is given in
							the biographical mention of Alfred S. Lineinger, elsewhere in this work. Mrs.
							Ensminger was born and reared a short distance east of Danville and has lived in that
							neighborhood all her life. To this marriage have been born four children, three sons
							and one daughter, Mary, who died at the age of three months. The three sons are
							Julian, Aaron M. and Chesley Bailey. Julian married Esta May Smith, the daughter of
							William and Viola Smith, and they live four miles northeast of Danville on one of the
							farms which was owned by his father. The other two sons and Mrs. Ensminger live on the
							old home farm east of Danville. For two years after his marriage Mr. Ensminger
							continued to reside on the farm where he was born, at which time he moved to a farm
							which he inherited from his mother. From time to time he purchased more land and at
							the time of his death he was owner of two hundred and eighty-five acres of fine
							farming land. He built a fine, attractive home and had good barns and other
							outbuildings and all his farms were in first class shape in every particular. He
							carried on extensive farming and stock raising and was considered one of the most
							substantial farmers of the county, having farmed for many years about four hundred
							acres.</p>

						<p>Mr. Ensminger was a Republican in politics all his life and actively interested in
							the welfare of his party. He was a member of the Methodist Episcopal church, his
							father having been a Methodist minister, and he was reared in the faith of that
							denomination and was a liberal contributor to its support. He was a man of strong
							convictions, earnest, fearless and frank in his denunciation of what he considered was
							wrong. He was a man of strong domestic tastes, loving his family and home, and took
							great enjoyment in providing for his family. He was a close student and great reader,
							and a man whom it was a pleasure to meet. His life was well spent and affords a good
							example for the coming generation of the county. Aaron M. Ensminger, the son who
							remains on the home farm, is actively engaged in the buying and raising of shorthorn
							cattle and graded stock.</p>

						<p>Among the younger farmers of Hendricks county, Indiana, who have built up a
							comfortable home by their own efforts is Charles P. Duncan, of Liberty township, who
							was born June 12, 1880, on the farm where he is now living. His parents were William
							G. and Matilda (Barnes). Duncan. William Duncan was a native of this county, his birth
							having occurred on June 21, 1843, and his death occurred June 17, 1911. William Duncan
							was the son of Charles and Delilah (Blunk) Duncan, and he spent his entire life in
							this county, with the exception of four years, when he was in the Civil War. He
							enlisted in 1861 in Company A, Thirty-third Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, for
							the three-year service. His regiment was assigned to the Army of the Potomac, and
							after serving two and one-half years he re-enlisted and served until the end of the
							war, being mustered out in July, 1865, at Indianapolis. He was with Sherman on his
							famous march to the sea and took part in all those hard-fought battles and skirmishes
							which characterized that campaign. He was disabled and sent to the hospital on account
							of injuries, but recovered sufficiently to rejoin his regiment and be with them when
							they were mustered out. Immediately upon the close of the war William Duncan returned
							to this county and resumed farming. He was a prominent citizen of his township and
							served on the advisory board for some years. He was a member of the Christian church
							and a deacon in that denomination on all occasions. He was a strong believer in
							righteous living and upright conduct in all business affairs.</p>

						<p>The wife of William Duncan, Matilda Barnes, was a member of one of the pioneer

							Hazelwood, this county.</p>

						<p>Charles P. Duncan spent his boyhood days on the home farm southwest of Hazelwood and
							received his education in the district schools of his township. He has spent his whole
							life on the farm where he is now living with the exception of ten years he spent on a
							rented farm of one hundred and eight acres in Franklin township, this county. He now
							owns eighty acres, which includes the old farm, and is bringing the farm to a high
							state of cultivation by his skillful system of crop rotation. After leaving Franklin
							township, this county, he bought sixteen acres north of his present farm, but sold
							this in the fall of 1913 before moving to where he now resides.</p>

						<p>Mr. Duncan was married March 31, 1902, to Nida Skaggs, a daughter <pb
								id="VAC1000-759" n="700"/> of Lee and Anna (Kavanus) Skaggs. Lee Skaggs was born in
							Tennessee, and his wife was a native of Liberty township, this county. Mr. and Mrs.
							Skaggs are now living at Indianapolis. Mr. and Mrs. Duncan are the parents of five
							children, Ollan, who died at the age of five years, Lloyd, Chrystine. Pauline and
							Kathryn Dee.</p>

						<p>Mr. Duncan is an active Republican, but has never been identified as an aspirant for
							any public office. He and his wife are members of the Church of Christ at Hazelwood,
							and both take an active part in the affairs of their church. Mr. Duncan is a quiet,
							unassuming man, with a friendly disposition. Because of his high character he is

						<p>Hendricks county is widely known for its beautiful homes, rich, fertile farms, the
							high state of cultivation to which its land has been brought, and, above all, for the
							very active, progressive farmers who reside within her borders. These are business men
							in the best sense of the word-men who work with their hands to produce sustenance for
							their fellow men, as well as their own immediate families, yet guided by an active
							intelligence which lifts their toil above drudgery and places them in the front rank
							of our independent, prominent citizens. In this admirable class of clean-cut,
							broad-minded men, few are better known throughout the county than the subject of our
							present sketch. Born in Franklin township, he has been ready to grasp the
							opportunities which lay nearest him, and by his unremitting energy has given to the
							world a large family of useful citizens and amassed for himself a competence.</p>

						<p>William S. Elmore, son of John and Mary (Wood) Elmore, was born October 23, 1864, and
							received his education in the schools of Franklin township. Here his youth was spent,
							living near to nature and learning from his father many of the principles of the
							science of agriculture; and that he has continued to study and put into practice these
							principles and theories is evidenced by his success as a farmer.</p>

						<p>On the 20th day of March, 1887, he was married to Ollie Tharp, a native of Center
							township, this county, a daughter of Joshua Tharp and wife; and after seven years of
							residence in the environment of his youth, <pb id="VAC1000-760" n="701"/> he brought

							productive, well-kept farm of eighty acres. Nine children have been born to them, as
							follows: Mabel (Mrs. Sparks), Cecil (who died in infancy), Roy, Gladys, Ova, Jesse,
							Byron, Charles and Robert.</p>

						<p>The father of the subject, John Elmore, is also one of the well known citizens of the
							county. One of the early pioneers, he has watched with pleasure the changes and
							improvements which have come to the surrounding country, and now, in his declining
							years, after a long and fruitful life, he is spending his days "beneath his own vine
							and fig tree," the homestead where his family has been reared. Finding his greatest
							happiness in the independent life of the farm, he has spent his days tilling the soil,
							living near to the heart of Mother Nature and rearing a large family to perpetuate his
							name and principles, and revere his memory in the future.</p>

						<p>John Elmore was born March 11, 1832, in Monroe county, coming to Hendricks county
							with his parents. Samuel and Elizabeth Elmore, in 1834, while he was yet a child. They
							made their permanent home in Franklin township, where they entered land from the
							government. There John Elmore grew up amid pioneer surroundings, later, however,
							purchasing a tract of land in Union township, where he has since remained. In the year
							1853 he was married to Mary Wood, who was also a native of this state. Six children
							were born to them, Jerry, Moses, William S., Martha (Warren), Minnie (Montgomery) and
							Emaline (Foxworthy). In the year 1877 the faithful wife and mother passed away. About
							two years later he was married to Fanny Elmore, of Kentucky, and to them one child was
							born, a daughter, Elizabeth, now Mrs. Woodward. Mrs. Elmore died in July, 1912. Mr.
							Elmore has been a home-loving man, devoting his time to the family, which has carried
							his influence abroad; but he has also been interested in the various movements for the
							good of the community which have taken place during his long residence. A stanch
							Democrat, he has adhered strictly to the principles of his party, active in
							promulgating the principles of true Democracy at all times, and now happy in its
							supremacy. His son William, like his father, is a firm believer in the teachings of
							Jefferson, and has consistently voted the Democratic ticket. Fraternally, William is a
							member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows at Pittsboro, and, with his wife and
							four of his children, is a member of the Christian church of that place.</p>

						<p>Personally, the subject of this sketch is genial, broad minded and well informed, a
							man who holds the confidence of the community at large. Mrs. Elmore, who has been his
							best friend and most helpful ally in all his <pb id="VAC1000-761" n="702"/>
							undertakings, has a charming personality and is widely known and greatly admired among
							the young people of the community, many of whom have enjoyed her hospitality. Taking a

						<p>Middle township, Hendricks county, has been especially honored in the character and

							and defeated many another, has forged his way to the front by a strong inherent force
							and well directed intelligence and judgment and who for many years has ranked among
							the substantial and prominent men of this locality, few having occupied a more honored
							place in the estimation of his fellow citizens than he. He is a man of public spirit,
							who, while laboring for his individual advancement, has never neglected his broader
							duties to the public in general, and his character has been exemplary in all the
							relations of life.</p>

						<p>Robert E. Parker, the son of William G. and Martha (Wells) Parker, was born in
							Pittsboro, Indiana, in 1863. William Parker was a native of Kentucky and when a small
							boy came to this county with his parents. Upon reaching manhood he remained on the
							farm for a time and later engaged in the mercantile business in Pittsboro for a number
							of years. During the war he bought and shipped mules for the government and throughout
							his whole life he was interested in the buying and selling of stock. In 1872 William
							Parker moved to Indianapolis, but four years later moved back to Pittsboro, where he
							remained until his death, January 8, 1877. While he was primarily interested in
							business ventures of one kind and another, he was, nevertheless, greatly interested in
							politics and always took a prominent part in the affairs of his community. He was
							trustee of his township for eight years and was always active in Republican politics.
							Mrs. William Parker was born in North Carolina and came in a wagon to this county with
							her parents when she was a small girl. She is still living in Pittsboro. Mr. and Mrs.
							William Parker reared a family of nine children: Mrs. Mary E. Lewis; Loyd; Wilson;
							Jennie, deceased; Robert E., whose history is herein presented; William; Ruth,
							deceased, and two who died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Robert E. Parker received his education in the school of Pittsboro and <pb
								id="VAC1000-762" n="703"/> Indianapolis, a part of the time in Indianapolis, while
							his parents were living there from 1872 to 1876, and later in Pittsboro. Upon the
							death of his father in 1877, he went on to the home farm, where he has resided since.
							In addition to his general farming, he also raises hogs and good road horses, which he
							finds a very successful and lucrative part of his farming.</p>

						<p>The prosperity of a town depends in large measure upon the activity and
							aggressiveness of its business men, and Pittsboro, in this respect, is to be
							congratulated upon the progressive, energetic spirit shown by her merchants. Among
							these few, if any, are more widely known throughout the district nor more highly
							respected than the man who supplies the hardware, tools and farming implements of
							various kinds used in the surrounding country.</p>

						<p>Charles Everett Kesler, the leading hardware dealer of this place, was born April 7,
							1881, on a farm near Danville, Hendricks county. He is truly a son of the county, both
							parents, John C. and Sarah (Pierson) <pb id="VAC1000-763" n="704"/> Kesler, being also
							native to the place. Here they both spent their childhood and youth, receiving their
							schooling in the township schools; both trained to the free, natural life of the farm,
							finding not only their work but their pleasure also in compelling the good earth to
							yield her abundance for the sustenance of themselves and their family. Congenial in
							their tastes, both were content to remain in the home of their childhood and youth
							until, in 1908, they were separated by the death of the faithful wife. Five children
							were born to them, as follows: Nettie (Dinsmore), deceased; Myrtle (Woods); Novella;
							Ernest, deceased also; and Charles Everett, the subject of this article.</p>

						<p>Charles Everett Kesler was married October 11, 1900, to Lucena Dinsmore, daughter of
							William Frank and Rachel (Holmes) Dinsmore. Two sons have come to them to brighten
							their home, Floyd Eugene and Harrold Glenn. Mrs. Kesler was born and reared in Boone
							county, as were also both her parents, who are still residing in that place, being
							well known and generally respected. Mr. Dinsmore is the holder of eighty acres of well
							cultivated, productive land, and by his industry, thrift and intelligent management of
							this farm, together with the never failing assistance of his faithful helpmate, he
							reared a large family and laid up for his declining years a competence. Fourteen
							children have been born to them: Jacob, Eliza (Ragsdale), John, Charity (Bailiff),
							Mary (Linton), Dora (Griggs), Marion, Della (Wiley), Lucena (Kesler), Artie, and four
							others whom death has claimed, two of them in infancy.</p>

						<p>Mr. Kesler spent his boyhood days upon the farm with his father, receiving his
							elementary education in the township school and later attending the high school of
							Pittsboro. Here he remained until his marriage, when he left the farm and entered the
							grocery business at New Ross. After two years in this place, he sold the grocery and
							spent a year at Advance as proprietor of a livery barn. Disposing of this, he returned
							to Pittsboro, continuing in the livery business, however, for two years more.
							Following this, he was owner of a restaurant for a year, after which he acquired his
							present thriving establishment. His varied experiences in the business world and his
							wide acquaintance throughout the county have proven valuable assets in this field, and
							his genial manner and shrewd business acumen have been large factors in its
							upbuilding. Hence, after five years as an active, energetic dealer in hardware and
							implements, we find him crowned with success in business, the possessor of hosts of
							friends and enjoying to the fullest the confidence and respect of his fellow men.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-764" n="705"/>

						<p>However, his activities have not been confined solely to the upbuilding of his
							financial success, for he is interested in several fraternal orders, being a member of
							the Knights of Pythias at Brownsburg; the Red Men at Advance, and the Haymakers. He is
							affiliated with the Republican party and is a strong advocate of its doctrines, and,
							while not a member of any church, is in sympathy with the Baptist church of Pittsboro,
							where his wife is a member.</p>

						<p>That life is the most commendable that results in the greatest good to the greatest
							number, and of the thousands of occupations which are open to the citizens of the
							United States today, there is no one in which there is a better chance to help mankind
							than in the profession of teaching. It is not necessary that one have a college
							education, a fine brick building and a well stocked library in order to make a
							successful teacher. What is essential is that natural sympathy and tact which always
							characterizes the most successful teachers. In the record of George D. Junken, of
							Hendricks county, we have the life history of a man who has spent thirty-five years of
							the best part of his life instructing the youths of his county, and during all of
							those years he has tried to instill the right principles, aim and ideals into his
							pupils. His actions have always been the result of careful, conscientious thought,
							and, once convinced that he is right, no suggestion of policy or personal profit could
							swerve him from the course on which he had decided.</p>

						<p>George D. Junken, who is now living retired at Pittsboro, this county, was born in
							Middle township November 8, 1850. His parents were David A. and Margaret (Danner)
							Junken. David A. Junken was born December 24, 1825, in Wayne county, Indiana, and
							lived there until his marriage. He and the girl whom he had selected for his wife
							added to the gaiety of the country in 1847 by being married on July 4th of that year,
							and immediately after the ceremony mounted their horses and took their honeymoon trip
							through the dense forests and along the blazed trails to this state, and after a short
							time in Rush county, they settled in Middle township, this county. David's father had
							been here before this time and had entered about twelve hundred acres for his children
							near Pittsboro. so that the <pb id="VAC1000-765" n="706"/> young bridal couple already
							had a farm to settle upon when they reached their destination. David was a blacksmith
							and a mechanic of more than ordinary ability and followed this trade in Pittsboro for
							the first fifteen years after coming to this county. He then went onto the farm and
							continued to farm until 1883, when he went into the hardware and grocery business at
							Pittsboro. Eight years later he sold out a successful business and retired from active
							life. He built the fine brick business block where his store was established. He had
							commenced in a rented brick building, which burned down two years after he went in
							business, and then he built the brick building which is still standing in Pittsboro.
							About two years after he sold out the store he went blind, but suffered his terrible
							affliction patiently until the end. He died March 18, 1907, and his wife two years
							later. Both of them were consistent and devoted members of the Christian church and he
							was a member of the Masonic order. Mr. and Mrs. David Junken reared a family of seven
							children : James, who died in infancy, George D., Joseph M., William N., Oliver P.,
							Alonzo Frank, and one who died in infancy.</p>

						<p>George D. Junken spent his boyhood days in Middle township and received his education
							in the township and high school at Brownsburg. Later he began teaching in 1870 and for
							the next thirty-three years taught in Middle and Brown townships, teaching his last
							year in 1905. During this long service in the school room, he taught the children of
							some of the children who had gone to him in his earlier years of teaching.</p>

						<p>For the past eight years he has done the assessing and gathering of statistics of his
							township, and knows his township most thoroughly. Probably he could describe every
							piece of land from memory, and tell the owners thereof. His work was said by the
							county board to be the most accurate, and his records kept the best, of any assessment
							records in the county.</p>

						<p>Mr. Junken is a member of Pittsboro Lodge No. 620, Free and Accepted Masons, and of
							Danville Chapter No. 46, Royal Arch Masons, and has been a life-long Republican,
							although, due to the nature of his profession, he has never taken an active interest
							in politics. He and his wife are both members of the Christian church at Pittsboro and
							he has been an elder in the church for the past twenty years. He has often been called
							on to conduct the services at funerals, knows the people thoroughly, and for years
							past has written the obituaries of most of those who have died in his community.</p>

						<p>Mr. Junken was married October 24, 1875, to Sallie J. Waters, and to this union have
							been born two children, Mrs. Gertrude Goebel and Mrs. <pb id="VAC1000-766" n="707"/>
							Lutie J. Worrell. Mr. Junken is a quiet, unassuming man and no one in the township has
							a higher standing in every way than he. His influence has always been cast in favor of
							all worthy enterprises and measures, and everything which he has done has been
							directed toward the betterment of his community.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JAMES MALREY LEAK.</hi></head>

						<p>A half century ago, more than two hundred thousand of Indiana's young men, strong and
							active in body, exulting in their young manhood, offered themselves for their
							country's service, and of these many thousands who went from Indiana there are today
							but few left and these few are old men who have long ago passed their meridian and are
							now looking eagerly forward to the time when they will answer the last roll call. The
							soldiers who fought so bravely in the Civil War soon will all have passed to another
							world, but so long as this nation shall endure, their memory will be revered high
							above other men. Hendricks county sent many brave young men to the front, but no man
							fought more valiantly than James M. Leak, who, through four long years of hard
							service, participated in some of the bloodiest battles of the war. Although he was
							twice wounded before his four years' enlistment was up, yet such was his courage and
							patriotism that he re-enlisted in February, 1865, as a substitute and served until his
							final discharge at Louisville, Kentucky, in 1865.</p>

						<p>James Malrey Leak, a distinguished veteran of the Civil War and one of Hendricks
							county's best loved citizens, was born October 20, 1841, in Bracken county, Kentucky.
							His parents were Louis and Elizabeth Leak, who were both natives of Kentucky. Louis
							Leak was born in Kentucky in 1808, grew to manhood and was married there before coming
							to this county. Early in the history of this county he and his family entered eighty
							acres in Union township, north of Lizton, where he farmed until his death. He was a
							public-spirited citizen and was township trustee for several terms. He and his wife
							were both members of the Christian church. Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Leak were the parents of
							nine children: Mrs. Susan Jane Runnels, who died in 1859; David V., who married Julia
							Ann Waters and died September 4, 1912; Belle, deceased, the wife of Allen Hayden; John
							Robert, deceased; James Malrey, whose career is herein set forth; Francis Marion, born
							January 15, 1843, and died in April, 1903; William M., of <pb id="VAC1000-767" n="708"
							/> Missouri, died in 1911; Nancy Ann, of Danville, the wife of Allen Bell, and
							Minerva, who was the wife of Woodson Bell, died in 1867.</p>

						<p>James Malrey Leak grew to manhood on the old home farm and when twenty years of age
							enlisted for service under his country's flag. He was mustered into Company H, Seventh
							Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, for three years, in August, 1861, and was first
							assigned to the Army of the West, but later transferred to the East and his regiment
							was made a part of the Army of the Potomac. While serving in Virginia he was twice
							wounded in battle, first at Fairfax Gap and later at Spotsylvania Court House. At
							Louisville, Kentucky, at the end of his three years' enlistment, he re-enlisted in
							February, 1865, as a substitute for a man who was drafted in this county. While acting
							as a substitute, he received five hundred dollars in money and a deed for forty acres
							of land in Union township. He was finally mustered out August 27, 1865, at Louisville.
							Kentucky, after having seen four years of service in the midst of the bloodiest civil
							war which has ever happened in the history of the world.</p>

						<p>Immediately after his discharge. Mr. Leak returned to this county and commenced
							farming in Union township. He was married August 6, 1865, to Mary Dickey, who died
							November 9, 1872, leaving one daughter, Vada. Vada married John A. Leak, whose history
							is delineated elsewhere in this volume. James M. Leak was married a second time to
							Margaret (Davidson) Winters, who died February 15, 1899. There were two children born
							to this second marriage, Eva, who died December 24, 1887, and Omer, a farmer of this
							township, who married Bessie Walter, having one daughter, Lurene. After the death of
							his second wife, Mr. Leak was married to Mrs. Frances (Gott) Hedge.</p>

						<p>Mr. Leak continued in active service on the farm until December, 1905, when he
							retired from the farm and moved to Lizton. Politically, Mr. Leak is a Republican of
							the progressive type, and has been voting the Republican ticket ever since the days of
							Abraham Lincoln. While he has always taken an intelligent interest in politics, he has
							never been a seeker after political preferments. He is a member of the Grand Army of
							the Republic at Lizton. He and his wife are members of the Christian church and he is
							a deacon in that denomination. He is a man who is always willing to help those in
							distress and has lived a life of a quiet, unostentatious farmer ever since the day he
							returned from the battle field of the sixties. He is an ideal citizen in every respect
							and is highly honored and respected by every one in the community.</p>

						<p>Chester Alvin Weaver, former merchant of Pittsboro and now one of the leading farmers

							is now living retired in Indianapolis. He formerly operated a drug store at Pittsboro
							for five years, afterwards he built a store building and engaged in the dry-goods
							business in 1872, continuing this for the next thirty years. Mrs. Amos C. Weaver was
							also a native of this county and is still living. Mr. and Mrs. Amos Weaver are the
							parents of five children, Hollis, Chester Alvin, Mrs. Grace Wood, Urban and Mrs.

						<p>Chester Alvin Weaver received his early education in the Pittsboro schools. Upon
							reaching his maturity he went into his father's store. In 1887 his father sold out to
							his sons and they continued to operate the store for the next ten years. In 1897
							Chester Alvin bought out the interest of his brothers and managed the store himself
							until 1905, continued to live in Pittsboro three years after selling the store and
							then bought a farm of one hundred and sixty acres, one mile northeast of Pittsboro,
							where he is now residing. He handles a great deal of stock, buying and selling all the
							time. He also makes a specialty of raising chickens and turkeys, and has his farm
							improved in such a way as to net him the largest maximum income annually. While he was
							prosperous as a business man, he is no less successful in the agricultural field, and
							is rapidly forging to the front as one of the leading farmers of the township.</p>

						<p>Mr. Weaver was married September 16, 1897, to Nell Dillon, the <pb id="VAC1000-769"

							great deal in real estate. He returned to Hillsboro, Kentucky, about 1900, where he is
							still living. Mrs. Dillon was also a native of Kentucky, and died in 1897. Mr. and

						<p>Mr. Weaver is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons and the Knights of Pythias.
							Owing to the nature of his business he has never taken an active part in politics,

						<p>As a farmer, public official, soldier or private citizen, Calvin Warrick was always

						<pb id="VAC1000-770" n="711"/>

						<p>Calvin Warrick, a distinguished veteran of the Civil War and a prosperous farmer of
							Middle township, was born in Rush county, Indiana, October 19, 1840. His parents were
							Edward H. and Ruth (Whiteman) Warrick. Edward Warrick was a native of Delaware and a
							school teacher in his young days, and taught in Rush county before moving to Hendricks
							county. He came to this county when Calvin was about four years of age and bought
							eighty acres two miles north of Brownsburg, which he farmed until 1858. He then sold
							it and made a prospecting trip through the West, but decided that Indiana was good
							enough for him, and returned to Hendricks county where he bought two hundred acres in
							Middle township. He lived on this farm until his death, October 30, 1864. Mrs. Edward
							Warrick was a native of Virginia and died in Nebraska in December, 1910. Mr. and Mrs.
							Edward H. Warrick were the parents of eight children: Samuel, who died in 1912, Mrs.
							Ann Crawford, Calvin, Amos, Mrs. Esther E. Hale, Mrs. Mary Jane Job, Mrs. Harriet
							Talbott, and Mrs Madora Towell.</p>

						<p>Calvin Warrick was given a good education under the tutelage of his father and grew
							to manhood on the farm in this county, with the exception of a year or so spent in the
							West. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War he enlisted, on September 14, 1861, in
							Company B, Seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry. His regiment was attached to
							the Army of the Potomac and he participated in all of the engagements in which his
							regiment participated, and was mustered out December 20, 1864.</p>

						<p>On December 14th of the same year Mr. Warrick was married to Evaline Smith, the
							daughter of Joel and Susan Smith. Joel Smith was a native of Kentucky, as was his
							wife, and after their marriage they came to this county and entered two hundred acres
							near Brownsburg, where they lived until their deaths. He died in 1863 and she seven
							years later. Mr. and Mrs. Joel Smith were the parents of eleven children: William

							are living, Shiles M., William E., Oliver C., Edward H. and Mary May. Mary May married
							Fred Parker, who farmed a part of Mr. Warrick's farm.</p>

						<p>Mr. Warrick has farmed in this county since he was sixteen years of age, with the
							exception of the four years which he spent in the war. When a boy he had to walk two
							miles to school and incidentally had to perform all of those chores which the boys of

							general farming he has always handled a great deal of live stock, especially cattle.
							He always kept a high-class grade of shorthorn cattle.</p>

						<p>Mr. Warrick is a member of the Grand Army of the Republic and the Free and Accepted
							Masons at Pittsboro. He has been a life-long Republican, and was old enough to cast
							his first vote for the second election of Lincoln in 1864. At the close of the war he
							served two years as assessor of Middle township and at one time made a strong race for
							nomination for county auditor. As a rule, however, he has never taken an active
							interest in politics generally, preferring to devote his energies to his agricultural
							affairs. Mr. and Mrs. Warrick are both members of the Baptist church and contribute

							engaged in the mercantile business, and there he spent the remainder of his life,

						<p>Francis H. Hall received his education in three different states, Ohio, Iowa and
							Indiana, and, being a youth of observing mind, he acquired no inconsiderable education
							from the extensive journeys made by his parents back and forth across the Mississippi
							valley. At the opening of the Civil war in 1861 he enlisted in Company H,
							Forty-seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and served three years and nineteen
							days with the Union army. He was with General Grant at Fort Henry, Fort Donelson,
							Shiloh, luka and was in the terrific siege of Vicksburg in 1863. He was a participant
							in the battle of Champion's Hill. Mississippi, which history has recorded as the
							bloodiest battle of the whole struggle. He was with General Banks on his campaign in
							Arkansas and Oklahoma, being in the ordnance department at that time. He proved a
							valiant and courageous soldier and served faithfully in all the engagements in which
							his regiment was a participant. After the close of the war he returned to Putnam
							county. Indiana, where he engaged in agricultural pursuits, and began to make a
							specialty of fine cattle to feed for the markets. He claims to be the oldest cattle
							feeder in Hendricks county, having fed a bunch of cattle each year for the market for

							Joseph Fleece Clay, who was formerly a sheriff of Marion county, but now a resident of
							Putnam county, Indiana.</p>

						<p>Joseph F. Clay, the son of James Henry and Susan (Fleece) Clay, was born in Hendricks
							county September 1, 1865. His father was born in Bourbon county, Kentucky, January 20,
							1819, the son of Littleberry and Arabella (McCoun) Clay. James H. Clay and Susan
							Fleece were married July 29, 1841, their marriage taking place shortly after his
							parents arrived in this county. Littleberry Clay and his family came to this county in
							1840 and purchased a section of land in Eel River township. After living in this
							county a few years Littleberry Clay and part of his family went to Missouri, but James
							H. remained in this county the remainder of his days. Susan Fleece was born in Boyle
							county, Kentucky, near Danville, and came to Hamilton county with her parents, Charles
							Fleece and wife, in the early history of the county. Her parents entered land west of
							North Salem, near Eel river.</p>

						<p>James H. Clay followed the vocation of a farmer all his life. During the forty years
							of his residence in this county he was one of the prominent <pb id="VAC1000-774"
								n="715"/> and influential citizens. At one time he owned nearly a section of land,
							but before his death he divided it among his children, nine of whom grew to maturity:
							Mrs. Arabella Waters; Mrs. Mary Catherine Rose; Samuel C.; Mrs. Sallie Rogers, of Amo;
							James A., of Indianapolis; J. C., whose history is found elsewhere in this volume;
							Nicholas, deceased: Arthur E., of Indianapolis: Joseph F., whose history is here
							recorded, and one daughter, Lillie, who died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Joseph F. Clay was educated in the common schools of Eel River township and later
							attended the graded school at North Salem. Early in life he decided to follow the
							vocation which had brought such pronounced success to his father. After his marriage
							he began to farm and at the same time devote a great deal of attention to the raising
							of stock. In fact, he soon found that there was more money in the raising of stock
							than in the raising of grain, and within a few years left the farm and moved to
							Indianapolis, where he engaged in the live stock business in connection with Messrs.
							Stockton &amp; Gillespie, the firm being known as Stockton, Gillespie, Clay &amp;
							Company. He was connected with this company for the next thirteen years, and left it
							to take the office of sheriff of Marion county, to which he was elected in the fall of
							1906. He served one term and then returned to his farm in Jackson township. Putnam
							county, where he is the owner of four hundred and seventy acres of fine farming land.
							He is now engaged in farming and stock breeding, paying most of his attention to
							stock.</p>

						<p>Mr. Clay was married February 15, 1888, to Olive Thomas, daughter of John H. and Mary
							(Davidson) Thomas. John H. Thomas was a life-long farmer of Putnam county, this state,
							dying in that county at the age of seventy-three in 1903. To Mr. and Mrs. Clay has
							been born one daughter, Eula, the wife of Armin Krutzsh, who is now living on the farm
							of Mr. Clay. Mrs. Clay died March 11, 1911.</p>

						<p>Mr. Clay has been an active Republican in politics and has been influential in the
							councils of his party. His worth as a citizen and his ability as a man is shown by the
							fact that he was nominated by the Republicans of Marion county for the responsible
							position of county sheriff and subsequently elected to that important position. In the
							discharge of his duties he was fearless and honest and won the esteem of all with whom
							he was associated while in the management of his office. He is a member of the Third
							Christian church at Indianapolis. Fraternally, he is a member of the Free and Accepted
							Masons, belonging to Oriental Lodge at Indianapolis. He is also a member of Raper
							Commandery, Knights Templar, Keystone Chapter of Royal Arch Masons and the Mystic
							Shrine at Indianapolis. He also holds his membership <pb id="VAC1000-775" n="716"/> in
							the Columbia Club and Marion Club, two of the most influential clubs of the capital
							city. Mr. Clay has been remarkably successful in life, and in everything he has done
							he has commanded the respect and confidence of all those with whom he has been brought
							into contact. His life amply demonstrates what may be accomplished by a man of energy
							and ambition who is not afraid to work, his success being the result of his well
							directed efforts, his capable management of his business interests and his sound
							judgment.</p>

						<p>A business man of Hazelwood, Indiana, who has made a pronounced success in life is
							Ethor V. Million, who, by the exercise of keen business ability and honest dealings,
							has built up a trade in a small town which is little short of marvelous. There are
							some men who are naturally gifted with the business instinct and this fortunate
							characteristic is the secret of the success of Mr. Milhon. Starting with a very small
							store, he has gradually worked up to a position where he has a business which is out
							of all proportion to the size of the town where he is located. In addition to his
							business interests, he has not failed to take a prominent part in the body politic,
							and every worthy enterprise which is for the good of the public has found in him a
							sympathetic and ready helper. His life has squared with right ideals, and for this
							reason he is highly esteemed by a large circle of friends and acquaintances.</p>

						<p>The postmaster, merchant and banker of Hazelwood was born in Liberty township, near
							Hazelwood, Hendricks county, Indiana, on November 26, 1870, the son of George W. and
							Susan Catherine (Richardson) Milhon, who were among the most highly esteemed residents
							of this township. George W. Milhon was born January 3, 1843, in Belmont county, Ohio,
							the son of George and Mary Ann (Hatbringer) Milhon. George Milhon, Sr., was a native
							of Virginia, and was born near Winchester, in that state, October 16, 1812. His wife
							was born in the same state August 12, 1812, and after their marriage George Milhon and
							wife left Virginia and settled in Belmont county, Ohio, where they farmed for several
							years and then came to Indiana, settling in Nashville, Brown county. In 1860 they came
							to Hendricks county and settled in Liberty township. Here George Milhon, Sr., followed
							farming, but after two years returned to Nashville in Brown county, this state, where
							his death occurred December 30, 1879, while his wife died on the first day of the year
							1880. lie and his wife were loyal members of the Methodist Episcopal <pb
								id="VAC1000-776" n="717"/> church and they reared a family of eleven children: Sarah
							Elizabeth, deceased; Mrs. Rebecca Jane Doan; John Henry, deceased; Mrs. Rachel Anna
							Marshall; George WV., the father of the subject of this review; Martha Ann, deceased;
							Norris; Jane; James; Mrs. Mary Catherine Purcell and Mrs. Lucinda Davis. George WV.
							Milhon was married January 20, 1870, to Susan Catherine Richardson, daughter of
							William B. and Mary E. (Hurd) Richardson. William Richardson was a native of North
							Carolina and came to Hendricks county, Indiana, with his parents, Daniel and Dorcas
							Richardson, in the early history of the county. The Richardsons entered one hundred
							and sixty acres of government land in the county and on this farm William Richardson
							grew to manhood. He was born December 9, 1831, and died in November, 1881, in this
							county. His wife was born near Frankfort, Kentucky, October 30, 1831, and is still
							living. Mr. and Mrs. William B. Richardson were married November 24, 1850, and to
							their union were born seven children: Mrs. Milhon; Mrs. Martha Jane Oliphant; Mrs.
							Elizabeth D. Barnes; Joshua Newton: William Alfred, deceased; Mrs. Mary Elizabeth
							Hiatt, deceased, and Mrs. Emma Burzite. Mrs. Richardson has twenty-nine grandchildren
							and eight great-grandchildren. Mr. and Mrs. George William Milhon are the parents of
							seven children, five living and two deceased; Ethor Y., whose history is here
							presented; Mrs. Effie May Cooper, deceased; Everett Newton; Mrs. Mary E. Stout; Maude
							A., deceased; Mrs. Hattie B. Patterson and James W. Everett Newton Milhon married
							Hattie Wrightman and lives in Mooresville, Indiana, where he is chief engineer and
							superintendent of the telephone company of that place, and has two children, Irvin and
							Roy; Mary E. Milhon married Calvin Stout, of Hazelwood, a farmer and the president of
							the Hazelwood Bank, and has one child, Lenore; Hattie D. Milhon married Mark
							Patterson, a farmer living east of Hazelwood, and they have two sons, Ralph and
							Maurice; James W. Million married Maude Johnson and they live on a farm of this
							township, and have one child, Sylvan J.</p>

						<p>George William Milhon enlisted in June, 1862, in Company H, Fifty-fourth Regiment
							Indiana Volunteer Infantry, for the three-months service in the Union army in Kentucky
							and served four months before he was discharged. He then returned to Hendricks county
							and has lived the life of a farmer since. He is the owner of a fine farm of one
							hundred and seventy acres, most of which lies in Hendricks county. He and his wife are
							zealous members of the Regular Baptist church of Center Valley, and have rendered
							generous assistance to the church in every way. Mr. Milhon came to this county without
							a cent and has achieved success solely through his own <pb id="VAC1000-777" n="719"/>
							determination and square business dealings. He has bought and sold much stock and has
							shipped hundreds of car loads from this county. He is a man well liked by every one
							and is still in good health and enjoying life.</p>

						<p>Ethor V. Milhon spent his boyhood days on the home farm and received a practical
							education in the schools of Liberty township. After finishing the common school course
							he graduated from a business college at Indianapolis, and the business education which
							he there received has been of incalculable benefit to him in his later career. Early
							in his life he started in the grocery business at Hazelwood with a small stock of
							about three hundred dollars worth of goods and went into debt for this. His store was
							only a small box of a place, but by hard work and square dealings he has met with
							wonderful success. He gradually built up his store, increased his stock, secured
							better buildings and, later on, took in C. E. Shields as a partner. The firm of Milhon
							&amp; Shields continued for about four years and then Mr. Milhon bought out his
							partner's interest and continued to conduct the business alone. In 1898 Mr. Milhon
							erected a modern two-story brick building, one hundred by thirty feet in size, and
							moved his stock of goods into this. The second floor is used by the Improved Order of
							Red Men.</p>

						<p>In addition to his mercantile interests, Mr. Milhon is interested in the banking
							business in Hazelwood. He was elected cashier of the Hazelwood Bank in 1905, an
							institution which had been organized previous to that year under the name of the E.
							Milhon Bank. It had been organized in 1898 by Mr. Milhon and continued as a private
							bank until 1905, when it was reorganized as the Farmers Bank of Hazelwood. The new
							bank occupies part of the new building which was erected by Mr. Milhon and has
							commodious quarters where it transacts a rapidly-increasing business. In addition to
							his mercantile and financial interests, Mr. Milhon has also been the postmaster of
							Hazelwood for the past twenty years and still occupies that responsible position. Mr.
							Milhon enjoys an immense trade from Hazelwood and the surrounding community. The
							farmers from as far as ten miles come to Hazelwood to do their trading. He is a clever
							advertiser and appreciates the value of scientific advertising. In fact, such is the
							excellence of his work along this line that he has received numerous comments from dry
							goods magazines throughout the country on the excellence of his advertising.</p>

						<p>Mr. Milhon was married July 4, 1893, to Ida Hazlewood, daughter of Benjamin P. and
							Eunice A. (Thomas) Hazlewood, and to this marriage there have been born two children,
							Sylvan, who died in infancy, and Emery J. Fraternally, Mr. Milhon is a member of the
							Free and Accepted Masons at <pb id="VAC1000-778" n="719"/> Monrovia, Indiana, the
							Knights of Pythias at Mooresville, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows at Monrovia
							and the Improved Order of Red Men at Hazelwood. Mrs. Milhon is a loyal and faithful
							member of the Missionary Baptist church, and also belongs to Order of the Eastern Star
							and the Daughters of Pocahontas. Their son Emery is affiliated with the Red Men.
							Politically, Mr. Milhon has always espoused the cause of the Democratic party. but the
							business cares which have demanded all of his attention have prevented him from taking
							any active part in politics. Enough has been said of the life history of Mr. Milhon to
							show that he has been a man of keen business judgment, combined with that tact and
							personality which render him a successful man of the world. Nevertheless, in spite of
							the fact that he has been busy with his many interests, he has not neglected to take
							an active part in the life of the community about him, but has contributed his share
							to all worthy enterprises in his locality. He has been in the milling business for the
							past twenty years at Hazlewood, his trade extending twenty miles out.</p>

						<p>It is both pleasant and profitable to study the life record of such a worthy

							one who directs his efforts, as Mr. Stevenson has done, along proper paths with
							persistency and untiring zeal, toward worthy ends. Having had as his close companion
							through life, upright principles, these worthy traits of character have resulted, as
							we shall see, in blessing to himself, his family and those with whom he has come into
							contact.</p>

						<p>William H. Stevenson, the son of Morgan and Rhoda E. (West) Stevenson, was born
							February 2, 1862, in Marion township, about four miles west of Danville. Morgan
							Stevenson was a native of Kentucky and came with his parents, Payton and Sarah
							Stevenson, to this county when a small boy. He became a farmer and continued to follow
							that occupation until his death, February 14, 1888. His wife died October 24, 1896.
							Mr. and Mrs. Morgan Stevenson were the parents of ten children: Mrs. Sarah E.
							Thompson; Harriet, deceased; Mrs. Lottie Tinder; Evaline, deceased; William H., whose
							biography is herein delineated; Mary Etta, deceased; Flora (Mrs. Hiram Gooch) is
							deceased; Edgar, Isaac and Charles.</p>

						<p>After receiving a good common school education, William H. Stevenson <pb
								id="VAC1000-779" n="720"/> remained on the home farm until his marriage and for the
							first eight years after his marriage he lived on a rented farm. He was thrifty and,
							with the assistance of his wife, was able to lay aside some money each year. In 1895
							they purchased sixty-seven acres from the old Stevenson homestead, but four years
							later sold this and bought the one hundred and fifty-four acres in Union township,
							three miles south of Lizton, where they now live. While following general farming he
							has always raised some stock each year and from the sale of this he has added not a
							little to his annual income. He has improved his farm in many ways, until it now
							presents a very attractive appearance.</p>

						<p>Mr. Stevenson was married December 11, 1887, to Mary C. Flynn, the daughter of John
							D. and Virginia W. (Harris) Flynn. John D. Flynn was a native of this county, his
							father having come to this county from Kentucky. He died January 24, 1888. His wife
							also was a native of this state, and died April 12, 1899. Mr. and Mrs. Flynn were the
							parents of four children: James, deceased; Mary C., the wife of Mr. Stevenson;
							Nicodemus, deceased, and Mrs. Virginia Ann Christey. Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson have one
							son living, Ray. He married Beulah Harbison, and has one son, Loyd.</p>

						<p>Mr. Stevenson has been a life-long Democrat and, while he is interested in the local
							candidates of his party, he has never taken an active interest in the general
							campaigns of his party. He and the members of his family are adherents of the
							Missionary Baptist church and contribute generously of their means to its support. Mr.
							Stevenson is a very pleasant man to meet and he is in every sense of the word one of
							the sterling representatives of the twentieth-century man of affairs of Hendricks

						<p>Harry E. Sanders, the son of Henry and Julia A. (Gossett) Sanders, was born in
							Plainfield, Indiana, October 10, 1870. His father was a native of Fayette county,
							Ohio, his birth occurring there in July, 1826, while his mother was born in North

							William E., of Chicago, who is a real estate dealer, married Ida Coffee; Dr. Frank E.,
							who is a practicing physician of Culver, Indiana, is married and has one son. Henry
							Sanders died in 1896, and was survived by his widow several years, her death occurring

						<p>Harry E. Sanders, whose history is here briefly reviewed, was reared on the farm in
							Washington township, and attended the public school of his home neighborhood,
							receiving a good, practical education, and early in life decided that he wanted to
							follow the agricultural profession, and with this end in view applied himself to the
							acquisition of all the information which would assist him in making a success of this

						<p>Mr. Sanders was married October 17, 1905, to Emma L. Saunders, whose father was a
							merchant of Zanesville, Ohio. Mrs. Sanders is a woman of refinement and culture and
							adds grace and charm to their elegant home. Mr. Sanders has, in addition to his
							regular farming duties, taken an active interest in civic affairs and as a member of
							the county board of commissioners has been one of the prominent factors in the
							building of the new two-hundred-and-seventy-five-thousand-dollar court house at
							Danville. This building embodies all of the latest and most modern ideas in court
							house architecture, and when completed will be one of the finest of its kind in
							Indiana. He has also been on the advisory board of his township, and in both

						<p>Mr. Sanders is now in the prime of life and usefulness and has many years of active

						<p>It is with pleasure the biographer presents the following sketch, that of a plain
							honest man of affairs, who by correct methods and a strict regard for the interests of
							his patrons has made his influence felt in Hazelwood and won for himself distinctive
							prestige in the business circles of that community. Of sterling German ancestry, Mr.
							Barnes is a man whose integrity and strength of character commands the respect of his
							contemporaries and who leaves the impress of his individuality upon the community
							honored by his residence.</p>

						<p>Wilson D. Barnes was born in 1852 near Stilesville, Hendricks county, Indiana, the
							son of Stephen A. Barnes and Lydia Ann Long, his wife. Stephen A. was born in
							Pennsylvania in 1805, a son of William Barnes, who with his wife emigrated to America
							about the year 1800. He located in Pennsylvania and there passed the remainder of his
							life, his death occurring while his son Stephen A. was still a youth. Later on,
							Stephen A. Barnes and his mother came westward into Indiana and located in Miami
							county. They remained there a short time, when both came into Hendricks county, where
							he secured a tract of government land about one mile south of Stilesville and there he
							lived the balance of his life, farming the tract of land he had secured in a wild
							state, but which he had with much labor converted into a well-cultivated farm. In the
							early days he was a bricklayer and helped build the first brick flues which were
							erected in the then growing town of Indianapolis. The first chimneys had been simply
							primitive affairs of mud and sticks. Lydia Ann (Long) Barnes, mother of the immediate
							subject of this sketch, was born in Ohio probably about 1810 and came to Indiana with
							her parents while she was still a girl, the family locating near Stilesville. Her
							death occurred when the subject of this sketch was but seven years old, in August,
							1859. Stephen A., the subject's father, lived for many years there-after, his death
							occurring August 27, 1883. After the death of his first wife, <pb id="VAC1000-783"
								n="723"/> Stephen A. Barnes married the second time, his bride being Mary Ann Davis,
							whose death occurred several years after he passed away.</p>

						<p>Wilson D. Barnes grew up on the homestead near Stilesville. and remained with his
							lather until eighteen years old, when for a few years he worked out as a farm hand. On
							January 11, 1877, he was united in marriage with Elizabeth D. Richardson, who was born
							near Hazelwood, this county, a daughter of William B. and Mary (Hurd) Richardson, the
							former of whom was a native of North Carolina and a son of Daniel and Dorcas Hurd.
							When William B. was a young man, he came to Indiana with his parents. They made the
							long journey in a wagon. William B. walking about half the distance. They settled near
							Hazelwood at an early date. Mary Hurd, mother of Mrs. Barnes, was born in Kentucky, a
							daughter of Joshua Hurd, who came to Indiana, settling in Montgomery county, when she
							was but a small child. William B. Richardson and wife passed the remainder of their
							lives on the farm near Hazelwood, where he carried on general farming and in addition
							did considerable trading and selling of live stock. He was one of the influential men
							of the community and a good citizen in every respect, having served three years in the
							Union cause during the dark days of the sixties. He was a man highly esteemed and
							respected and because of the unbounded confidence which friends and neighbors reposed
							in him, he was often appointed guardian for minors and acted as administrator in
							settling up the business of many an estate.</p>

						<p>For two years after his marriage, subject carried on farming near Hazelwood, and
							then, in the spring of 1880. he engaged in the mercantile business at Hazelwood. In
							this business he continued for about ten years, when he disposed of his interest and
							purchased a farm south of Hazelwood. This farm contains seventy-five acres, which he
							still owns. After about nine years spent on the farm, he again engaged in business in
							Hazelwood and since that time. with the exception of two years, he has been so
							engaged.</p>

						<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Barnes have been born five children, two of whom have passed away.
							These are Arthur D., who died when about twenty months old, and Lillie D.. who lived
							to be eighteen years old, her death occurring in 1904. Those living are Minnie, who is
							the wife of R. D. Stone, the proprietor of the telephone system at Clayton. Myrtle E.
							remains at home and Conrad W., who was born in 1887, married Emma Turner, of
							Indianapolis, and is in partnership with his father in the store at Hazelwood. Both
							Mr. and Mrs. Barnes are members of the Missionary Baptist church, being devoted and
							consistent members of the same. For most of the last twenty years Mr. Barnes <pb
								id="VAC1000-784" n="724"/> has served the society as church treasurer. The success
							attained by Mr. Barnes in his business affairs has been greatly owing to his steady
							persistence, stern integrity and excellent judgment, qualities which have also won for
							him the confidence and esteem of the public to a marked degree. Personally, he is a

						<head><hi rend="center">CHARLES E. SHIELDS.</hi></head>

						<p>Hendricks county, Indiana, is known as one of the best counties of the state and, as
							the reputation of a locality is but a reflection of the quality of its citizenship, it
							goes without saying that this county numbers among its citizens many men who in one
							way or another have given of their time or ability to further such enterprises as make
							for the advancement of any community in its moral, educational or material life. Such
							a citizen is Charles E. Shields, who by reason of unusual ability and enterprise has
							taken his place among the foremost citizens of the county, and while primarily
							considering the interests of himself and those dearest to him, has at the same time
							accomplished much for the public good.</p>

						<p>Charles E. Shields, present trustee of Liberty township, Hendricks county, was born
							on July 28, 1872, near Lake Valley, Morgan county, this state, the son of David and
							Frances (Pruitt) Shields, both of whom also were born in the same county. David
							shields was a son of David Shields, Sr., who was born and raised in North Carolina,
							coming to this state some time after his marriage, bringing with them two or three
							children. They accomplished the journey from their native state in the early days,
							coming overland in a wagon, passing through the state of Kentucky. They located in
							Morgan county, where they passed the remainder of their lives on the farm which they
							had secured.</p>

						<p>David Shields, Jr., grew up in Morgan county, receiving what education the early
							schools of the day afforded and employing his time in agricultural labors. He was a
							veteran of the Civil War and died in 1881, when the subject of this sketch was but
							nine years old, his wife having died three years previous. After the death of his
							father, the subject was taken into the home of his uncle, Harrison Shields, near
							Eminence, Morgan county, and there remained until he was fifteen years of age. At that
							time he came <pb id="VAC1000-785" n="725"/> to friends in Liberty township, this
							county, and attended Central Normal College at Danville, while also engaged in farm
							work. However, this was not the chosen vocation of his life, and about 1898 he formed
							a partnership with E. V. Milhon and together they engaged in the mercantile business
							at Hazlewood, which partnership remained in force about three and one-half years.
							Prior to the dissolution of that partnership, these two gentlemen had organized and
							constructed what is known as the Hazelwood Telephone System, and in 1902 Mr. Shields
							disposed of his interest in the mercantile business to Mr. Milhon and purchased Mr.
							Milhon's interest in the telephone company. Also, in connection with their mercantile
							business, the two partners had operated a private bank, and at their dissolution Mr.
							Shields' interests in this went to Mr. Milhon, the subject desiring to devote his
							entire time to the operation of the telephone business. This business he retained
							until January I, 1912, by which time it had assumed considerable proportions and had
							proven of untold value to the community.</p>

						<p>Mr. Shields has always been a strong adherent of the Republican party and always took
							an active interest in local affairs pertaining to same. In 1908 he was elected
							township trustee and by reason of the legislative change made in the length of term of
							office of township trustees, he holds his seat until January 1, 1915. Mr. Shields'
							fraternal affiliations are with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Knights of
							Pythias and the Improved Order of Red Men, and in the workings of these orders he
							takes a commendable interest.</p>

						<p>On July 9, 1899, Mr. Shields was united in marriage with Sylvia Burch, who was born
							near Bloomington, Monroe county, this state, a daughter of William Hi. and Susie
							(Sparks) Burch, both of whom were born and reared in the same county and were
							throughout their lives very active in promoting the interests of the Baptist church.
							Mr. Burch's vocation was that of farming, as was also that of his father, Charles
							Burch, who with his wife, Jane, came from their native state of North Carolina and
							settled in Monroe county in the early thirties and there he passed the remainder of
							his life, his death occurring December 23, 1905. His widow still resides in
							Bloomington, at an advanced age. Susie Sparks Burch, mother of Mrs. Shields, was a
							daughter of William and Nancy Sparks, who also came from North Carolina, making the
							long journey overland in a wagon. They arrived in Monroe county about 1835, where they
							spent their remaining days. Mrs. Shields received her elementary education in the
							district schools of Monroe county, later attending high school in Bloomington and the
							Central <pb id="VAC1000-786" n="726"/> Normal College at Danville, from which latter
							institution she obtained her certificate qualifying her to teach school and for six
							years she followed this profession, teaching four years in Monroe county and two in
							Hendricks county. To Mr. and Mrs. Shields have been born three children, the eldest
							being Joy June, who was born in June, 1900, and died in December, 1906. The two
							remaining are Myrth and Jewel.</p>

						<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Shields are active members of the Church of Christ and have been
							largely instrumental in bringing about the excellent conditions existing in the local
							body at Hazelwood. Mr. Shields and two other members purchased and donated the site
							for the new church building, which was completed and dedicated to its high calling on
							October 30, 1910. The church society was organized in March, 1909, and since the time
							of its organization Mr. Shields has served as trustee and elder, being active in
							bringing about the speedy erection of the church edifice, which is a handsome
							structure, costing between nine and ten thousand dollars. Prior to the completion of
							this structure, the society held its meetings in Red Men's hall. Mrs. Shields is not
							behind her husband in good works, for since the organization of the Ladies' Aid
							Society, in connection with the church, she has been very active in the work falling
							within its scope, and was the first president of the local organization, which has the
							reputation of being one of the most proficient and finely organized societies in the
							state. She is deeply interested in the National Mother Congress. Mr. and Mrs. Shields
							are among the very best people of the community, both being full of interest in the
							lives of others and sincerely desirous of accomplishing all the good possible for
							their community. In view of Mr. Shields' public activities, it is especially fitting
							that a biographical sketch of his career be incorporated in a work of the scope
							intended in the present volume.</p>

						<p>It was once remarked by a celebrated moralist and biographer that "there has scarcely
							passed a life of which a judicious and faithful narrative would not have been useful."
							Believing in the truth of this opinion, expressed by one of the greatest and best of
							men, the writer of this review takes pleasure in presenting a few facts in the career
							of a gentleman who, by industry, perseverance, temperance and integrity, has worked
							himself from an humble station <pb id="VAC1000-787" n="727"/> to a successful place in
							life and won an honorable position among the well known and highly esteemed men of the
							locality in which he resides.</p>

						<p>Francis Marion Harrison, the son of Benjamin and Rachael (Hendricks) Harrison, was
							born in Eel River township, Hendricks county, March 11, 1873. Benjamin Harrison was a
							native of Boone county and reared to manhood and married in that county. His father
							was a cooper at Lafayette and followed that trade until his death. Benjamin Harrison
							came to Hendricks county about 1870 and operated a saw-mill northeast of North Salem
							for a number of years. He sold his mill and then ran one in Boone county for a number
							of years. He then returned to Hendricks county, Union township, and operated a
							saw-mill at Montclair until his death at that place in 1881. The wife of Benjamin
							Harrison was also a native of Boone county and is still living at Brownsburg. After
							the death of her husband in 1881, she married Joshua Tharp, a farmer and banker at
							Brownsburg. Benjamin Harrison and wife were the parents of eight children: George,
							deceased; Frank, deceased; John, deceased: Ora; William; Oliver, deceased; Francis
							Marion and Edgar.</p>

						<p>Francis M. Harrison was reared to manhood in Hendricks county and has lived north of
							Danville since he was fifteen years of age. He began operating his present farm in
							1910, having formerly operated a farm of eighty-three acres in Marion township for ten
							years. He sold his Marion township farm and bought his present farm of ninety acres in
							Center township. He carries on general farming and also raises considerable live stock
							for the market. He is a man with excellent ideas concerning agriculture and takes an
							interest in farming institutes and all other organizations that are of benefit to the
							farmer.</p>

						<p>Mr. Harrison was married in August, 1895, to Hattie May Thomas, the daughter of Lewis
							and Louisa (Talbott) Thomas. Lewis Thomas was a native of Fayette county, Indiana, and
							came with his parents to this county when he was ten years of age. His father, Erasmus
							Thomas, was born in Fayette county November 13, 1821, and moved to Hendricks county in
							1864. Erasmus Thomas was the first auditor of Tipton county, Indiana, and helped to
							lay out the present town of Tipton. He held the office of auditor for one year, then
							refused to hold it any longer because of the meager salary which was attached to the
							office. He never held any offices in Hendricks county, but farmed and served as a
							regular Baptist preacher for over forty years, preaching in the Danville church for a
							long time. He died in 1897 on the' homestead farm. His son, Lewis, the father of Mrs.
							Harrison, was reared to manhood in this county and qualified for the Regular Baptist
							ministry. He <pb id="VAC1000-788" n="718"/> is still active as a Baptist minister at
							Ashley, Ohio, where he has been for the past thirty years. Mrs. Lewis Thomas is a
							native of Center township, this county, and died February 7, 1877, on the old
							homestead farm, four and one-half miles north of Danville. Mr. and Mrs. Harrison are
							the parents of four children, all of whom are still under the parental roof, Benjamin,
							Mildred, Aria and Mary.</p>

						<p>Mr. Harrison is a member of the Republican party, but has never taken any further
							part in politics than to cast his vote for his candidate at the regular election.
							However, he takes a deep interest in the main questions of the day and keeps himself
							well informed as to the progress of events of the nation by reading the newspapers and
							magazines. He is a member of the Knights of Pythias at Danville. He and his wife are
							faithful members of the Regular Baptist church. Mr. Harrison is a man who has always
							been interested in the various public-spirited enterprises of his community and only
							lends his assistance to such as he deemed worthy. He is congenial by nature and has a
							personality which attracts friends, whom he easily retains because of his fine
							qualities of character.</p>

						<p>William W. Quinn, of Cartersburg, Hendricks county, now living in comfortable
							retirement after many years of unceasing activity in connection with agricultural
							pursuits, is one of the best known citizens of the county. His well directed efforts
							in the practical affairs of life, his capable management of his business interests and
							his sound judgment have brought to him prosperity and his life demonstrates what may
							be accomplished by any man of energy and ambition who is not afraid to work and has
							the perseverance to continue his labors in the face of any disaster or discouragement
							that may arise. In all the relations of life Mr. Quinn has commanded the confidence
							and respect of those with whom he has been brought into contact and a biographical
							history of this locality would not be complete without a record of his career.</p>

						<p>William W. Quinn was born on April 1, 1837, in Union county, Indiana, the son of John
							and Sarah (Bright) Quinn, both of whom were born and reared in Fleming county,
							Kentucky. They were married there prior to coming to this state about 1820. They
							located in Union county immediately upon coming to Indiana, and there passed the
							remainder of their lives. John Quinn was a life-long farmer and when he first took up
							his <pb id="VAC1000-789" n="729"/> residence in Union county it was then not much more
							than a wilderness. One man filled all the county offices. John Quinn's death occurred
							when the subject of this sketch was a lad of but fourteen years. He left a family of
							thirteen children, the youngest being the subject, who is now the only surviving
							member of the family.</p>

						<p>The subject passed his boyhood on the home farm in Union county, obtaining such
							education as the early subscription schools of the time afforded and receiving early
							instruction in the secrets of successful farming from his father, who was quite
							skilled in his chosen vocation. Mr. Quinn has been twice married. On March 8, 1877,
							Mr. Quinn for the second time stood before the alter of Hymen, his bride being Nancy
							L. Clevenger, of Wayne county, this state, a daughter of Samuel and Ruth (Sparh)
							Clevenger, the former a well-known farmer of Abbington township, Wayne county, where
							he resided for many years. Immediately after marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Quinn established
							their home in Jackson township, Decatur county, this state, where he engaged in
							farming for ten years. Then in 1887 they came to this county, arriving at Cartersburg
							on March 3d of that year. In this county Mr. Quinn purchased a fine farm of two
							hundred and sixteen acres a short distance northwest of Cartersburg and there he
							resided until March 12, 1902, when he moved into Cartersburg, and on December 2, 1902,
							he moved into his present home, which he had erected. Mr. Quinn also owns two hundred
							and ten acres of farm lands in Marion county, this state; in all, his holdings now
							amount to considerably over four hundred acres. In addition to general farming, Mr.
							Quinn pays particular attention to the raising and selling of live stock, and. in this
							branch of his business especially he has made an unqualified success. All this has
							been brought about through his untiring energy and ambition, coupled with unusual
							executive ability and the fact that he has ever sought to keep abreast of the times in
							his chosen work.</p>

						<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Quinn was born one son, Harlan Everett, who first saw the light of
							day on September 29, 1888. He married Maude Holderman and is the father of two sons,
							William Lee and James Harry. Everett now has charge of affairs on the farm which the
							subject left upon taking up his residence in Cartersburg.</p>

						<p>Mr. Quinn's fraternal affiliation is with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, being
							a member of the local lodge at Danville. Politically, he is independent. Mrs. Quinn is
							a member of the Methodist Episcopal church. Mr. Quinn is a man of positive
							temperament, strong in his convictions, and <pb id="VAC1000-790" n="730"/> when once
							having thought out a course of action, he is determined in its execution. With these
							stronger characteristics, he is genial and friendly and is highly esteemed by friends
							and neighbors who know him for his sterling worth and unvarying uprightness of
							character.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">ALBERT JOHNSON.</hi></head>

						<p>Hendricks county, Indiana, enjoys an enviable reputation because of the high order of
							her citizenship and none of her citizens occupy a more favorable position in the
							estimation of his fellows than the gentleman whose name appears at the head of this
							sketch. The son of an unusually strong and progressive man, to whom the early
							development of this county is highly indebted, Albert Johnson is himself numbered
							among .the leading citizens of his native county. His continued residence here has but
							strengthened his hold on the hearts of the people with whom he has been associated and
							no one today enjoys a larger circle of friends and acquaintances, who esteem him
							because of his sterling qualities of character and his business ability. He is,
							therefore, eminently entitled to representation in a work of this character.</p>

						<p>Albert Johnson was born on September 19, 1843, about one and one-half miles northwest
							of Bridgeport and near the eastern line of Hendricks county, being the son of Jeremiah
							and Susanna (Johnson) Johnson. Jeremiah Johnson was a son of Aholiab and Hannah
							Johnson, and was born at Killingly, Windham county, Connecticut, on August 23, 1792,
							and when three or four years old removed with his parents to Stafford, in Tolland
							county, Connecticut. With the exception of about three years passed at the home of his
							mother's father, Jeremiah Bacon, at Middletown, Connecticut, he continued to live with
							his father and work at farming and getting such education as the opportunities of that
							day afforded him. He taught several schools in the winter time before he was
							twenty-one years of age. In 1813, during the war with Great Britain, he served as a
							volunteer in the state militia of Connecticut for about seventy days, being placed on
							duty to guard the fort at New London and vicinity, for which service he, long
							afterwards, obtained a bounty of land from the government. After the close of his
							military service, he went as far south as Washington, D. C., seeking his fortune, and
							for a short time was employed in the reconstruction of the capitol building, it having
							been burned by the British. However, he soon <pb id="VAC1000-791" n="731"/> tired of
							this class of labor and, believing there was in store for him an easier way of gaining
							a livelihood, he journeyed to Baltimore, where he shipped on a private armed sloop
							bound for a cruise. He took an immediate dislike to that sort of life and was
							discharged at one of the West Indian islands called Virgin Gorda, from whence he
							returned to his father's home in Stafford. There for one term he taught the district
							school, numbering not less than one hundred pupils, and early in the spring of 1815 he
							started with a small trunk, containing a few articles of wearing apparel and about
							fifty dollars in money, leaving the balance of his savings placed on interest. He was
							bound for the great new West and travelled by stage to Philadelphia. There he placed
							his trunk on one of the large wagons constantly passing between Philadelphia and
							Pittsburgh and betook himself on foot to the latter place. There he fell in company
							with another Eastern man of like ambition as himself, and the two constructed a flat
							boat which they loaded with coal and floated down the Ohio river to Cincinnati, where
							boat and cargo were both sold for whatever they would bring. From Cincinnati he soon
							went to a German village about twenty miles northwest of that city and there he was
							soon engaged in teaching the Germans the English language and such other rudiments of
							education as circumstances permitted. There he continued until such time as the
							authorities of the new state of Indiana fixed the place for the site of the new state
							capitol, the present Indianapolis. He soon learned of the fact and, seeing for himself
							an opportunity in connection with that circumstance, he hired a couple of men, each
							having a four-horse team, and loaded them with provisions and such other articles as
							were necessary in a new settlement. Leaving his German friends, he started through the
							then unbroken forest for the future city, fording streams and cutting the way through
							the woods, guided only by a small compass. After much time and endeavor and enduring
							many hardships, he at length reached the place of his destination. Here he detained
							the two teamsters until they, together with such assistance as those already there
							could afford, had built for him a log cabin, being the third house in the new capitol
							of Indiana. His first dining table was the head of a flour barrel, his first plate a
							clean maple chip and his first bedstead was framed into the corner of his cabin. He at
							once opened up and began disposing of his stock of provisions, powder, lead, etc., and
							became one of the earliest promoters of the place. When the first brick court house
							was built (which was also used as a state house for several years) he took the
							contract for the brick work and, in company with John Johnson (one of whose daughters
							afterward became his wife), <pb id="VAC1000-792" n="732"/> made the brick and
							completed the contract to the satisfaction of the authorities. At that time money was
							a very scarce article and the state obligations with which he was paid for his work
							were heavily discounted and had it not been for the money which was due him in
							Cincinnati, which was collected by friends and sent him as fast as possible, he would
							probably have become bankrupt. However, he remained in the growing village of
							Indianapolis for a number of years, doing all within his power to foster its dignity
							and growth. He was generally reasonably successful in business, though sometimes he
							suffered heavy losses as once when bringing a boat load of salt up the Wabash river,
							the boat suddenly sank and boat, cargo and wearing apparel of himself and associates
							was lost. They were thankful to escape with their lives and had to beg and walk their
							way home, a distance of over one hundred miles. He invested his savings in land at
							government prices, which of course advanced in value as the county became settled.
							When the National road was built west from Indianapolis, he laid out the village of
							Bridgeport on land which he owned, and built a hotel, steam mill and a store. When the
							plank road was built he took an active interest in it and gave right of way through
							all his land. He later gave ground for a depot at Bridgeport and did much otherwise to
							encourage the building of the railroad. He was active and energetic in business and
							did much to promote the cause of education and scientific agriculture in the state. On
							his own farm he kept abreast of his times and did much to improve the breed of cattle
							throughout his community by importing improved breeds from other states.</p>

						<p>Jeremiah Johnson came from pure English ancestry and, according to family tradition,
							some of them left England and settled in Massachusetts on the restoration of Charles
							II, finding it expedient to do this on account of their participation in the Civil War
							as soldiers and partisans of Cromwell. Jeremiah Johnson reared a family of nine
							children, seven sons and two daughters. He survived his wife and both daughters
							several years and departed this life at Clayton, this county, on March 20, 1876,
							having passed a life of unusual activity and usefulness. His influence over the moral
							life alone of this section of the state can not be estimated and his generous
							contributions to the material advancement of the community certainly can be surpassed
							by none. Such men as he are the heart and bone and sinew of a new community.</p>

						<p>When Albert Johnson was a boy he lived on the home farm and at Bridgeport for a short
							time. About 1850 the family moved about three <pb id="VAC1000-793" n="733"/> miles
							east of Bridgeport, near where Ben Davis now is, and resided there until 1855 and then
							moved to Liberty township, this county, when the immediate subject of this sketch was
							about twelve years old. Here he grew to manhood on his father's farm, attending the
							early schools of the district and later attending the academy at Danville in the
							winter of 1859-1860. He returned home after one year spent in Danville, in a very poor
							state of health and for four years was almost an invalid. In 1876 he left the farm and
							removed to Clayton, but continued to operate the farm until in 1880, when he engaged
							in the mercantile business at Clayton in partnership with his brother and Edwin
							Johnson, L. D. Johnson also being a partner, under the firm name of Johnson Brothers
							&amp; Company. In connection with that business, he and his brother did a little
							private banking business. In 1886 the brother died, but the mercantile business was
							continued under the same name, the banking business, however, having the name changed
							from Johnson Brothers to Albert Johnson &amp; Company, the widow having retained her
							interest in the firm and the business being conducted along the lines of a private
							bank. In 1896 the mercantile business was disposed of and the banking business
							continued as before. In 1905 the banking business was reorganized under the private
							banking law, retaining the same firm name. On January 28, 1907, Lorenzo D. Johnson,
							former partner with Johnson Brothers in the mercantile business, became a member of
							the banking firm in company with the subject, his daughter and brother's widow, the
							bank at that time being capitalized at twenty thousand dollars. They continued under
							the old firm name until May 1, 1912, when they reorganized under the state banking law
							and converted the institution into a state bank with a capital stock of twenty-five
							thousand dollars, fully paid up, and with a surplus of twelve hundred and fifty
							dollars. They were officered as follows: Albert Johnson, president; J. C. Walker,
							vice-president, and L. D. Johnson, cashier, with those three also acting as directors.
							The present directors are Eugene Edmundson, Milton A. West, L. D. Johnson and Albert
							Johnson. Mr. Walker has recently died.</p>

						<p>On October 20, 1867, Mr. Johnson was united in marriage with Mary E. Snoddy, daughter
							of George W. and Nancy (Fitzgerald) Snoddy, of Morgan county, this state. Mr. Snoddy
							was a farmer and stock raiser and was also a minister ordained in the Christian
							church. To Mr. and Mrs. Johnson have been born four children. One daughter, Annie,
							died when ten years old. Their daughter Gertrude is the wife of O. W. Greene and lives
							in Kansas City, Missouri. She is the mother of two children, Marian <pb
								id="VAC1000-794" n="734"/> and Emily. Emma C. is the wife of B. M. Davis and resides
							at Oxford, Ohio, Mr. Davis being a professor in Miami University. Arthur A. is a civil
							engineer located in Indianapolis. His wife was May Brayton, daughter of Dr. A. WV.
							Brayton, of Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>In 1890 Mr. Johnson moved to Indianapolis, taking up his residence in Irvington, so
							as to be near Butler College, where he wished to educate his children. He, however,
							retains his interests in Clayton and considers this his permanent home. Mr. Johnson is
							a man of sound and practical intelligence, keenly alert to everything relating to his
							interests, and, in fact, with all that concerns the advancement and prosperity of his
							community. Because of his splendid personal characteristics and his genuine worth, he
							enjoys the confidence and esteem of all who know him and he has an unusually wide and
							varied acquaintance.</p>

						<p>In past ages the history of a country was comprised chiefly in the record of its wars
							and conquests. Today history is largely a record of commercial activity, and those who
							are foremost in the annals of the nation are those who have become leaders in business
							circles. The conquests now made are those of mind over matter, and the victor is he
							who can most successfully establish, control and operate business interests. Mr.
							Johnson is unquestionably one of the strongest and most influential of the men whose
							lives have been an essential part of the history of Hendricks county. Tireless energy,
							keen perception, honesty of purpose, genius for devising and executing the right thing
							in the right place and time are the chief characteristics of the man. These, combined
							with everyday common sense and guided by strong will power, are concomitants which
							will insure success in any undertaking.</p>

						<p>Lorenzo D. Johnson, cashier of the State Bank of Clayton, is a Hoosier by birth,
							having first seen the light of day in Morgan county on May 14, 1851, the son of
							Hezekiah K. and Eliza (Greene) Johnson. Hezekiah K. Johnson was born in North Carolina
							in 1809 and married Miss Greene there before he came to Indiana, where they located in
							Morgan county. In 1865 he removed to Clayton and at that time he gave up the vocation
							of farming, which he had followed all his life, and engaged in the general merchandise
							business. He opened up his business in 1868 on the spot where the <pb id="VAC1000-795"
								n="735"/> traction station now stands. He continued in this business until his
							death, in 1870. His widow followed him into the great beyond one year later. In
							addition to his business as an agriculturist and merchant, he was also a minister of
							the Gospel and an earnest and sincere man in all the relations of life.</p>

						<p>Lorenzo D. Johnson received a good schooling in his youth and after completing his
							studies he went into his father's store and at the time of his father's death took
							charge of it and operated it until 1873. At that time he disposed of it to Howland
							&amp; Spotts, of Danville, but continued with them until they sold it to Mr. Field, of
							the old publishing firm of Merrill, Field &amp; Company of Indianapolis. After Mr.
							Field purchased the store, Mr. Johnson continued in his employ with full charge of the
							store and did not see the new proprietor until six weeks after the purchase was made,
							the former owners having simply turned keys, books, etc., over to Mr. Johnson. After
							leaving Mr. Field, Mr. Johnson took a position with Clark &amp; Harris and was with
							them until 1880, when he became a partner with Albert and Edwin Johnson in their
							mercantile business, under the firm name of Johnson Brothers &amp; Company. He was
							with them until 1896, and was then employed in the private bank of Albert Johnson
							&amp; Company and in the year 1907 became a partner in that bank with the position of
							cashier. In this capacity he continued with the bank through its reorganization into
							the State Bank of Clayton in 1912 under the state banking laws. He was elected cashier
							of the new organization and continues in that capacity at the present time.</p>

						<p>On June 18, 1873, Mr. Johnson. was united in marriage with Frances V. Garrison,
							daughter of John and Sarah (Nichols) Garrison, the former being the son of Josiah
							Garrison, an early settler here who came from New Jersey. John Garrison was engaged in
							farming here throughout his life. To Mr. and Mrs. Johnson have been born two children,
							Mary and Dee. Mary is the wife of J. Mark Black, of Indianapolis. She is the mother of
							three children, Dorothy, Frances and Robert L. Their daughter Dee is the wife of Dr.
							B. R. Quinn, of Indianapolis. She is the mother of two children, Maxine and
							Russell.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Johnson are both members of the Methodist Episcopal church at Clayton
							and contribute liberally of time and means to further the cause of that society. They
							are considered among the very best people of the town and in their comfortable and
							commodious home there is ever found a cordial welcome for friend and stranger. Mr.
							Johnson is a man <pb id="VAC1000-796" n="736"/> of quiet manner, unassuming in every
							particular and a man who wins and holds a large number of friends through his innate
							kindliness and obliging manner. He is a busy man, but he finds time and opportunity to
							take in matters pertaining to the progress and growth of his community and county,
							keeping abreast of the times on all questions of vital interest and being regarded as
							a leading citizen in the locality long honored by his residence.</p>

						<p>The valuable man to any community is the man who does things; and, with this
							criterion, it is safe to say that James T. Leak is one of the most important men in
							Union township, this county. He is a splendid example of the progressive, self-made
							man who believes in doing well whatever is worth doing at all. He is a man of
							discernment and sound judgment, broad-minded and at the same time a follower of the
							principles embodied in the Golden Rule in all his relations with his fellow men. Daily
							contact with our fellow citizens so familiarizes us with their many virtues that we
							ordinarily overlook them, and commonly underestimate their possessor. Nevertheless,
							though the man may pass away, his deeds of virtue live on, and will, in time, do him
							the justice which he failed to receive during his life time. However, the many good
							qualities of Mr. Leak are fully recognized and appreciated by his fellow citizens, who
							long ago placed their stamp of approval upon his life.</p>

						<p>James Thomas Leak, a prosperous farmer and banker of Lizton, this county, was born
							February 14, 1857, in Union township. His parents were George W. and Sarah G. (Leach)
							Leak. George W. Leak was born October 17, 1828, in Bracken county, Kentucky, and came
							with his parents, William and Eliza (Kitch) Leak, to this county when he was about
							eight years of age. William Leak settled in Union township on a farm adjoining the
							present town of Lizton and farmed there until his death, September 11, 1845. George W.
							Leak grew to manhood in this county and was first married January 10, 1850, to Sarah
							Leach, who died February 30, 1868. To this first marriage were born six children:
							Matilda Jane, deceased; Mrs. Lucinda M. Hickman; James Thomas, whose career is
							portrayed in this connection; Elizabeth Ann, deceased; William E., deceased, and Enos
							Alonzo. After the death of his first wife, George W. Leak was married to Ann Burnett
							and to this second marriage were born five children: Mary E., deceased; Mrs. Hattie M.
							Dowden; Mrs. Georgia Lillian McHenry; Myrtle, deceased, and Bertha O.</p>

						<p>James T. Leak received his education in the schools of Union township and remained at
							home until his marriage, at the age of twenty-one, when he went to farming for
							himself. He devoted his attention to this vocation until 1902, when he retired from
							active farming and moved to Lizton. As an agriculturist he carried on general farming,
							raised all the crops common to this locality and gave a considerable share of his
							attention to the breeding and raising of live stock. His farm is well improved, he has
							a comfortable and attractive residence, well arranged barns and other features which
							show him to be a man of wise discrimination and good judgment. In 1900 Mr. Leak became
							interested in banking and when the Citizens Bank at Jamestown was organized in that
							year he became a stockholder and director in the same and has been officially

							1910, and is still filling that responsible position to the entire satisfaction of the
							board of directors of the bank.</p>

						<p>Mr. Leak was married October 17, 1878, to Susan D. Young, the daughter of Melton and
							Susan (Parrish) Young. Melton Young was born in Kentucky, his wife in South Carolina
							and they were married in Putnam county, Indiana. Upon their marriage they moved to
							Montgomery county, near Ladoga, and later to New Ross, in the same county. Some years
							before his death Mr. and Mrs. Young moved to Lebanon in Boone county, where Mrs. Young
							died August 9, 1890, and Mr. Young June 20, 1896. Mr. and Mrs. Young were the parents

							which indicates the man of solid worth; is quick to grasp the situation, alert to
							carry it out and persistent in following it to his final conclusion. He is a man who

						<head><hi rend="center">HENRY HUNT.</hi></head>

						<p>The United States has drawn its people from every corner of the globe and, while we
							have citizens in Indiana representing scores of different countries, it is
							nevertheless true that the bulk of our citizenship are of English descent. We always
							refer to England as our mother country, and it is true that she has furnished the
							great majority of our citizens of today. The Hunt family of Hendricks county are
							fortunate in having traced their family history through past generations, and in the
							history of Henry Hunt, who is here presented, his ancestry can be traced back to the
							middle of the eighteenth century directly. To state in biblical fashion, the first
							descendant whose history is accurately recorded is Eleazer, whose son was Asher, whose
							son was Ithamar, whose son was Henry, whose son was Olsen. The Hunt family trace their
							ancestry back to England, where they were an honorable and distinguished family in the
							colonial period. Eleazer Hunt was a farmer of North Carolina in the latter part of the
							eighteenth century and died in that state at the age of eighty. His son Asher was born
							in Guilford county, that state, and was reared a Quaker, marrying Jane Hunt, the
							daughter of Abner and Mary (Starley) Hunt, who was a very distant relative. Asher Hunt
							came to Sullivan county, Indiana, from North Carolina and entered two hundred acres of
							land on which he lived for the next sixteen years. He then came to Hendricks county
							where he bought a farm in the eastern part of Marion township, dying there in his
							eighty-fourth year. He and his wife, as well as the children, were Quakers.</p>

						<p>Asher Hunt was twice married; his first wife died and he then married Abigail Foster.
							He was a man of unimpeachable character, industrious, honorable and one who was
							universally respected by all who knew him. Ithamar Hunt, the son of Asher, was born in
							Sullivan county, Indiana, March 17, 1822, and came with his parents to Hendricks
							county when he was fourteen years of age. At the age of twenty-five he married Frances
							J. Bush, the daughter of John and Elizabeth (Norton) Bush. John Bush was a native of
							Kentucky, who came to Hendricks county and was one of <pb id="VAC1000-800" n="739"/>
							the early pioneers of the county, dying at the age of fifty-three. Ithamar Hunt was a
							farmer all of his life and at his death, on May 14, 1903, in New Winchester, he had
							over six hundred acres of fine farming land in the county. He was a birthright member
							of the Friends church for twenty-one years and then joined the Baptist church. He was
							a consistent and faithful member and a liberal contributor, not only to his own
							church, but to others and to all benevolent enterprises. He was a good man in every
							sense of the word, an honest man with himself and with others. He was a devoted
							husband, a loving and kind father, an accommodating and genial neighbor, a manly and
							devoted Christian, one without ostentation or hypocrisy. He was a man of peace, quiet
							and unobtrusive. He never swore, never used liquor, was never sued, never paid a cent
							of interest-all in all, he was one of nature's noblemen.</p>

						<p>Henry Hunt is a worthy son of a worthy father. He received his education in the
							schools of his neighborhood and remained under the parental roof until he was married
							at the age of twenty-five, although he had been farming for himself since he was
							twenty-one. After his marriage, he lived for the first year on the Rockville road and
							then built his present home in 1878 and has resided there continuously since that
							time. He is a farmer exclusively and no one in the county raises better crops than
							does he. He has always taken an active interest in public affairs and, as a
							Republican, was elected trustee of Marion township in 1894, rendering faithful and
							efficient service to his fellow citizens for nearly five years in that capacity. His
							farm of two hundred and sixty acres, together with his wife's farm of one hundred and
							sixty, is a fine example of an up-to-date farm in every respect. He takes a great deal
							of pride in keeping everything in good repair and his buildings are always neat and
							attractive in appearance.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hunt was married April 1, 1877, to Cassandra R. Higgins, the daughter of Michael
							and Elizabeth (Plaster) Higgins. She was born in Marion township and has lived most of
							her life there, spending four years at Ladoga before her marriage. They have one son,
							Olsen, who was born March 6, 1881. He married Jesse Underwood, the daughter of Obed
							Underwood, and has one daughter, Marvel. He lives on a farm in Marion township. Mr.
							and Mrs. Hunt are both devout members of the Christian church of New Winchester, and
							subscribe liberally to its support. Mr. Hunt is one of the best known men in his
							township, a man of excellent character, a good neighbor and one who has always stood
							for the best welfare of his community.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">ALEXANDER RAMSEY.</hi></head>

						<p>The importance that attaches to the lives, character and work of the early settlers
							of Hendricks county and the influence they have exerted upon the cause of humanity and
							civilization is one of the most absorbing themes that can possibly attract the
							attention of the local chronicler. The late Alexander Ramsey was a man whose great
							influence upon the early history of this county was an important factor in developing
							the part of the county in which he settled.</p>

						<p>Alexander Ramsey was born in Clark county, Kentucky, June 21, 1821, and died in
							Marion township, Hendricks county, Indiana, January 21, 1891. He was the son of Andrew
							and Jennie (Browning) Ramsey. Fate seems to play an important part in the lives of
							some people and in the cause of Alexander Ramsey it was the cause of his remaining in
							this county. When a young man he came to this county to visit his two sisters who were
							living in the county and while here he met a pretty little maid by the name of Martha
							Jane Flynn. It was a case of love at first sight and he who came merely to visit
							remained to marry and settle in this county. His wife was born October 14, 1838, in
							Marion township and on December 18, 1856, they were married, she being only eighteen
							years of age at the time of her marriage. This youthful bride of fifty-eight years ago
							is still living and enjoying good health. She is the daughter of James and Lucy
							(Miller) Flynn, her father being born in Clark county, Kentucky, in 1807. He was first
							married to Lucy Rigney and, after her death, to Lucy Miller in 1833. His second wife
							was born in Clark county, Kentucky, in 1816, the daughter of Michael and Mary Miller,
							who had come from Virginia to Kentucky. James Flynn lived in Kentucky until 1840 and
							then came to Marion township, this county. He and his wife made the trip overland on
							horseback, passing through the little village of Indianapolis and over the swamp which
							is now occupied by Danville. He became one of the earliest settlers and was one of the
							most prominent farmers of the county, having over five hundred acres of land at the
							time of his death, August 11, 1885. He paid one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre
							and the same land today could not be bought for one hundred and twenty-five dollars
							per acre. Mr. Flynn was a progressive farmer and owned the first threshing machine in
							this section of the state.</p>

						<p>After Mr. Ramsey and his young bride were first married they returned to Kentucky,
							where they lived on a farm of Mrs. Ramsey's uncle for <pb id="VAC1000-802" n="741"/>
							two years. They then returned to Hendricks county and bought a farm of one hundred and
							thirty acres near New Winchester for twenty-seven dollars per acre, and later they
							purchased seventy acres more, making a total of two hundred acres which is still owned
							by the family. Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey reared a family of six children: Mary Catherine,
							who married William J. Underwood; Samuel A., born February 27, 1859, who has never
							married, but has spent his whole life on the home farm. He and his mother have lived
							together on the old homestead since his father's death; John Allen, who lives in
							Danville, Indiana; Obie L., who lives at New Winchester, where he operates a saw-mill
							and runs a threshing machine in the summer; Anna May died March 2, 1881, at the age of
							ten as the result of an injury she received at school.</p>

						<p>Mr. Ramsey was a member of the Missionary Baptist church and was a faithful attendant
							upon all the services of the church. He was a man who was always very considerate of
							the rights of others and absolutely honest and straightforward in all of his dealings.
							He was held in high respect and esteem by everyone with whom he was associated and his
							life in every particular was above reproach. He was essentially a man of domestic
							tastes and lived for those who were nearest and dearest to him.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN S. RAGAN, M. D.</hi></head>

						<p>It is not always easy to discover and define the hidden forces that have moved a life
							of ceaseless activity and large professional success; little more can be done than to
							note their manifestation in the career of the individual under consideration. In view
							of this fact, the life of the physician and public-spirited man of affairs whose name
							appears above affords a striking example of well defined purpose, with the ability to
							make that purpose subserve not only his own ends but the good of his fellow men as
							well. Doctor Ragan has long held prestige in a calling which requires for its basis
							sound mentality and intellectual discipline of a high order, supplemented by rigid
							professional training and thorough mastery of technical knowledge with the skill to
							apply the same. In his chosen field Doctor Ragan has achieved a notable success, which
							has been duly recognized and appreciated throughout the section of the state where he
							lives.</p>

						<p>Dr. John S. Ragan, one of the oldest practicing physicians in Hendricks county, was
							born July 5, 1849, in Marion township, Hendricks county, <pb id="VAC1000-803" n="742"
							/> Indiana. His parents, James M. and Lucy A. (Smith) Ragan, were both natives of
							Kentucky and came to this county early in their lives with their parents. Abner Ragan,
							the father of James M., came from Kentucky first and settled in Putnam county, but
							soon moved over into Hendricks county, where he lived until his death in 1864. Abner
							Ragan was twice married, his first wife, Mary, and the mother of James, being of the
							MacCoun family. Zachariah Smith, the maternal grandfather of Doctor Ragan, was a
							native of Kentucky and came to Hendricks county early in its history, settling in
							Marion township. He married Agnes Dicken and they reared a family of seven children.
							James M. Ragan was a farmer and stock raiser all his life and he and his wife died in
							the faith of the Christian church. They both passed away in 1872, having reared a
							family of eight children: Mary, deceased; John S.; Abner, deceased; Zachariah, of
							North Salem, Indiana: Reuben Samuel, deceased; James, of Colorado; William H., of
							Plainfield. and Milton B., deceased.</p>

						<p>Doctor Ragan spent his boyhood days on the farm and attended the district schools of
							the neighborhood. After spending two years in the Ladoga Academy he began teaching and
							taught school for the next nine years, the last two years being principal of the North
							Salem schools. While still teaching he began the study of medicine and in 1887 took
							his first course of lectures in the Cincinnati Medical School. As was customary in
							those days, he began to practice before he had finished his medical course. He started
							to practice at Avon in Hendricks county and after his graduation in the spring of 1879
							from the Indiana Medical College at Indianapolis he returned to Avon and continued to
							practice there for the next seventeen years. After practicing a year at Denver,
							Colorado, where he had gone for his wife's health, he returned to Avon and remained
							two years. In 1895 he went to Plainfield and in 1904 became the physician at the Boys'
							School, having complete charge of all the medical work for the next four years, after
							which he devoted most of his time to his general practice in Plainfield and vicinity
							until 1913, when he was again given full charge as physician at the Boys' School
							having given up his practice entirely. Doctor Ragan has always taken an active
							interest in the various medical organizations with which he has been connected and has
							been president of the Hendricks County Medical Society. He also belongs to the Seventh
							District and Indiana medical societies.</p>

						<p>Doctor Ragan has been married twice, his first wife being Jennie L. Vickery, to whom
							he was married January 1, 1880. She was born in Hendricks county and was the daughter
							of Henry and Elizabeth Vickery. To this marriage there were born two children, Dr.
							Charles E. Ragan, of Clinton, and <pb id="VAC1000-804" n="743"/> Mrs. Ralph Bly, of
							Plainfield. Doctor Ragan's first wife died June 21, 1892, and on February 14, 1894, he
							was married to Mary E. (Huron) Cooper, the daughter of Abbott and Katherine Huron, of
							Hendricks county. There are no children by the second marriage, but his wife has one
							daughter by her former marriage, Katherine V. Cooper, who is a teacher in the public
							schools of Clearwater, Florida.</p>

						<p>In politics, Doctor Ragan has affiliated with the new Progressive party, but the
							nature of his profession precludes him from taking a very active part in politics. He
							is a loyal member of the Christian church and has been an elder for the past twenty
							years. He is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Doctor Ragan has a
							large number of friends throughout the county who esteem him for his many sterling
							qualities. He takes an intelligent interest in the civic life of the community and his
							influence can always be found on the right side for the welfare of the community
							honored by his residence.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">BENJAMIN W. ANDERSON.</hi></head>

						<p>It is not an easy task to describe adequately a man who has led an eminently active
							and busy life, and who has attained a place of relative distinction in the community
							with which his interests are identified. But biography finds its most perfect
							justification, nevertheless, in the tracing and recording of such a history. It is,
							then, with a full appreciation of all that is demanded and of the painstaking scrutiny
							that must be accorded each statement, and yet with a feeling of satisfaction, that the
							writer essays the task of touching briefly upon the details of the record of Benjamin
							W. Anderson, one of the most substantial farmers and business men of Plainfield.</p>

						<p>Benjamin W. Anderson, president of the First National Bank of Plainfield, was born in
							Washington township, Hendricks county, Indiana, on August 29. 1862. He is the son of
							Thomas T. and Anna (White) Anderson, his father being a native of Ohio and his mother
							of Wayne county, Indiana. Thomas Anderson was a farmer and brick mason and came to
							this county before the war, settling in Washington township, where he bought a quarter
							section of land. After living on it three years, he removed to Six Points, in the same
							county, where he farmed for the next nine years. He then moved to Iroquois county,
							Illinois, where he died in 1873. His widow died September 24, 1898. Mr. and Mrs.
							Thomas Anderson were the parents of four children, two of whom are living, Benjamin W.
							and Eli H., both of whom have lived all their lives in the county of their
							nativity.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-805" n="744"/>

						<p>Benjamin W. Anderson, the immediate subject of this sketch, was born in a log cabin
							in the clearing on his father's farm and received the limited education which the
							district schools of his time afforded. He then completed his schooling by attending
							the Central Academy at Plainfield. His whole life has been spent upon the farm and he
							is recognized as one of the most progressive farmers of the community. In addition to
							his crops of grain, he has always handled considerable live stock and no small part of
							his success has, come from that side of his business. That he has been successful is
							shown by the ,fact that he was one of the principal organizers and stockholders in the
							First National Bank of Plainfield. He became president of the institution on December
							24, 1903, and has held that important place up to the present time. In politics he has
							always taken an important part in the success of the Republican party and in the fall
							of 1998 was elected to the office of township trustee, an office which he is still
							holding. This is accounted for by the fact that the last Legislature extended the term
							of office to six years.</p>

						<p>Mr. Anderson was married on July 16, 1912, to Mrs. Minnie (Mills) Hadley, the
							daughter of Aaron and Hannah Mills, and to this uunion there has been born one son,
							Benjamin Eli. Mr. Anderson has been a lifelong member of the Friends church and is now
							one of the board of trustees of the Western Yearly Meeting. He is an elder in the
							church and is superintendent of the Sabbath school at Plainfield at the present time.
							He is one of the trustees of Central Academy and is very actively interested in all
							matters pertaining to education. He is a charter member of Plainfield Lodge No. 653,
							Free and Accepted Masons. In addition to his farming, stock-raising and banking
							interests, Mr. Anderson is interested in the mill and grain business with Hubert
							Brown, the firm name being the Plainfield Milling Company. Mr. Anderson has been one
							of the valued citizens of his community and has been a hearty supporter of all
							enterprises which seek to ameliorate the condition of his fellow citizens or better
							the conditions of the county where he has spent such a busy life.</p>

						<p>Among the farmers of Hendricks county whose careers extend over a period of more than
							three score years is Joseph Lane Wilson, who comes from one of the oldest pioneer
							families of the state. Such people are welcomed in any community, for they are the
							empire builders and as such have pushed the frontier of civilization ever westward and
							onward, leaving the <pb id="VAC1000-806" n="745"/> green, wide-reaching wilderness and
							the far-stretching plains populous with contented people and beautiful with green
							fields.</p>

						<p>Joseph Lane Wilson, the son of Peter and Delilia (Case) Wilson, was born March 31,
							1848, in Putnam county, Indiana. His father, who was born in Monroe county, Indiana,
							February 17, 1821, was the son of John C. and Frances (Wilson) Wilson, both natives of
							Kentucky who came to Putnam county in the early history of Indiana and settled near
							Greencastle. John C. Wilson, who was born in Kentucky September 2, 1795, and who died
							in 1870, was the son of Peter and <milestone unit="typography" n="-------"/> (Sears)
							Wilson, who were natives of Tennessee, but came to Kentucky, where they lived most of
							their lives. Frances Wilson also was a native of Kentucky, born July 29, 1797. John
							Wilson, the grandfather of Joseph Lane, entered land near where the town of Bainbridge
							stands and here Peter grew to manhood. In 1838, after Peter was grown, his father
							entered another tract in Putnam county about three miles southwest of New Winchester,
							and on this farm Peter made his home after marriage, which occurred on December 10,
							1840, and reared his family. His wife, Delilia Case, was born April 8, 1820, the
							daughter of John and Julia (Finney) Case, and died March 11, 1887. Peter Wilson died
							on July 14, 1893. John Case was born May 15, 1795, and his wife Julia was born May 30,
							1802.</p>

						<p>The children born to Peter and Delilia (Case) Wilson, with the dates of their births,

							Lewis C., June 13, 1853; Robert C., June 8, 1856; Amanda E., August 3, 1859.</p>

						<p>Joseph Lane Wilson grew up on the farm entered by his grandfather,. and received his
							meager schooling in the subscription schools of the period. He remained on the home
							farm until his marriage, which occurred in 1874. His wife was Mary J. Higgins, the
							daughter of Michael and Elizabeth (Plaster) Higgins, a sketch of whose family is given
							elsewhere in this volume. To this marriage there was born one son, Edgar, who now
							lives on the farm where his father was reared. Edgar was married in 1898 to Letha
							Thomas, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Page Thomas. Edgar and wife have two children,
							Mary and Nellie.</p>

						<p>The Case family, Mr. Wilson's mother's people, were among the earliest settlers of
							Putnam county, their ancestors having come from Connecticut in an early day and thence
							to Indiana. Two of the family, Leonard and Zachariah Case, recently died at Cleveland,
							Ohio, leaving a large estate <pb id="VAC1000-807" n="746"/> which has not yet been
							settled. They were unmarried and left no will disposing of their fortune.</p>

						<p>Mr. Wilson has lived more than forty years in Marion township and in that time has

							has commanded the confidence and respect of those with whom he has been brought into
							contact and a biographical history of this locality would not be complete without a
							record of his career.</p>

						<p>Toliver Worrell, the son of James and Elizabeth (Kenny) Worrell, was born in Carroll
							county, Virginia, on February 22, 1848. Both his parents were natives of Virginia and
							lived and died in that state. His father was a farmer and for many years was a justice
							of the peace in Carroll county. In Virginia at that time each county had three
							justices and these composed the county court. James Worrell was the presiding justice
							of this court for several years in his home county. Mr. and Mrs. James Worrell were
							the parents of eleven children, Toliver being the youngest. Four of these children are
							still living, William K., of Indianapolis; Robert L., of Tilden, this county; Mrs.
							Ellen H. Cook, of Indianapolis, and Toliver Worrell, the immediate subject of this
							sketch.</p>

						<p>Toliver Worrell was reared on his father's farm in Virginia and received a good
							common school education in his home schools. At the age of twenty-one he came to
							Indiana, locating near Avon, Hendricks county. He rented a farm and continued to
							manage it for about two years, after which <pb id="VAC1000-808" n="747"/> he moved to
							Middle township, near Pittsboro, this county, where he remained only one year,
							removing to Lincoln township at the end of that time, where he farmed for the next
							five years. He then settled permanently in Middle township, near Pittsboro, and
							remained there until 1902, when he removed to Danville, where he has continued to
							reside. Shortly after moving back to Middle township the last time he bought a farm
							there and has added to it from time to time. He still owns this tract and has now
							general supervision of the management of the farm.</p>

						<p>Toliver Worrell was married to Julia O. Parker, of Middle township, Hendricks county,
							in 1875. Two children by this marriage are living in this county, N. E. and J. O.
							Worrell. His first wife died January 5, 1881. in 1900 Mr. Worrell married for his
							second wife Katherine Miller, the daughter of John and Ann (Bartley) Miller, of
							Washington township.</p>

						<p>Mr. Worrell has been a Republican since reaching his majority and has always taken
							more or less of an active part in politics. For the past fifteen years he has been a
							member of the county council of Hendricks county, and has taken an active interest in
							the affairs of his home county. In private life he is broad-minded and liberal,
							keeping abreast of the times and in touch with current thought. He stands high in the
							esteem of those with whom he mingles and has many warm friends who esteem him for his
							many worthy qualities. Quiet and unostentatious, and seeking the sequestered ways of
							life rather than its tumult and strife, he has ever attended strictly to his own
							affairs and made better all who came within the range of his influence.</p>

						<p>The sixty years which Nicodemis Harris has spent in this county have brought him in
							close touch with a large number of people and the reputation which he holds for square
							dealing and upright conduct in all things stamps him as a man who has lived a life
							above reproach. It is a well-established fact that a man can not live unto himself,
							but must be a part of the society which makes up his particular community. Mr. Harris
							has always taken a conspicuous part in the various movements which have had to do with
							the welfare of his locality and is rightly regarded as one of the representative men
							of Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>Nicodemis Harris, the son of Nicodemis and Bedial J. (Davis) Harris, was born in
							Marion township, Hendricks county, March 4, 1851, and <pb id="VAC1000-809" n="748"/>
							has spent his whole life in the county of his nativity. His father was born September
							29, 1810, in Mercer county, Kentucky, and his mother was also born in the same county,
							January 12, 1814. His parents were married in Kentucky and came to Hendricks county
							shortly after their marriage, arriving in Marion township in 1833. The grandparents of
							Nicodemis, Jr., were Frederick and Nancy (Higgins) Harris, who came from their native
							state of Virginia to Kentucky by way of the Ohio river. They first settled at Fort
							Harrod and later entered land in the vicinity of the fort.</p>

						<p>Nicodemis Harris, Sr., applied for government land in 1833 and in 1834 he received a
							deed written on genuine sheep skin and signed by President Andrew Jackson. This deed
							is now a very highly prized document in the hands of Nicodemis, Jr. His deed called
							for one hundred and thirty-four acres in Marion township. Later he entered eighty
							acres in Putnam county, just across the township line to the west. He lived the life
							of a plain farmer all his life, and died in his seventy-ninth year, in 1889. His wife
							passed away in January, 1896. She was an ardent member of the Missionary Baptist

							Nicodemis Harris, Sr., were the parents of eight children: Frederick; Joseph, Thomas,
							Mary, John, Mrs. Virginia Flynn, Nicodemis, Jr., and William. All of the children are
							deceased except the last two, Nicodemis and William.</p>

						<p>Nicodemis Harris has spent all his life on the farm, doing all the work which falls
							to the lot of the average farmer. He received a good practical education in the

							lived with his parents until they both passed away and was very solicitous in his care
							of them. He and his brother William have always lived together and are very much
							attached to one another.</p>

						<p>Mr. Harris was married in 1893 to Rosa Edwards, the daughter of Joshua and Mary
							(Casey) Edwards. Joshua was a native of North Carolina, being born in that state in
							1820. He came to Indiana with his parents when he was a lad of ten. His father, John
							Edwards, entered government land near Coatesville, this county, and on this farm
							Joshua was reared to manhood. His wife was a native of Ireland and came to this county
							with her parents when a small child. Mr. Edwards died January 18, 1905, and his widow
							passed away on July 18, 1909.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Edwards reared a family of fourteen children, only four of whom are

						<p>There can be no more comprehensive history written of a city or county, or even of a
							state and its people, than that which deals with the life work of those who, by their
							own endeavor and indomitable energy, have placed them-selves where they may well
							deserve the title of "progressive," and in this sketch will be found the record of one
							who has outstripped the less active and less able plodders along the pathway of life.
							Canady H. Downard is one who has not been subdued by the many obstacles and failures
							that come to every one, but has made them stepping stones to higher things and at the
							same time that he was winning his way in material things of life gained a reputation
							for uprightness and probity.</p>

						<p>Canady H. Downard, the son of David M. and Cassandra (Morgan) Downard, was born in
							Marion township, Hendricks county, Indiana, on December 23, 1862. His parents were
							both natives of this county, his father being a farmer and stock raiser and one of the
							substantial men of the township. The grandfather of Canady H. Downard was Judge James
							Downard, who was one of the first probate judges of the Hendricks county court and had
							the honor of laying out the town of Danville in 1825. Judge Downard was a native of
							Pennsylvania, came to the Northwest territory about 1811, removed to Kentucky a few
							years later and settled near Brooklyn, Indiana, in 1818. He afterwards moved to
							Indianapolis and shortly afterwards permanently located in Plainfield, where he lived
							until his death in 1846. To the subject's father were born ten children: James A.;
							Mrs. Martha Hammond, of Danville; Mrs. Mary J. Anderson, of Anderson; Canady H.;
							William, of East St. Louis; Erie, deceased; Oliver, of Lynn, Indiana; Frank, of
							Danville, and two who died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Canadv H. Downard was reared on the farm and received his common school education in
							the Marion township schools. He then took a course in the Central Normal College at
							Danville, after which he returned to the farm, where he has continued to live until
							the present time. In 1889 he was <pb id="VAC1000-811" n="750"/> married to Nettie
							Hamrick, the daughter of William F. and Dicy (Blackburn) Hamrick. Mr. Hamrick was born
							in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, and came to this county in his boyhood with his parents,
							who settled in Marion township. He became one of the most successful farmers in the
							county and owned seventeen hundred acres at the time of his death. His wife was born
							in Madison county, Kentucky, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Blackburn. Mr. Hamrick
							was in the dry goods business for a time at Danville, but sold out and devoted his
							energies to the raising of Hambletonian horses and other fine stock. In his early life
							he was a Republican, but later in life he became a Prohibitionist. He and his wife
							were members of the Friends church. She died in 1898.</p>

						<p>After Mr. Downard was married he began farming in Marion township and has always
							lived in that township with the exception of five months when he lived in Danville. He
							now has a fine farm of three hundred and twenty-five acres which he keeps in a high
							state of cultivation and in excellent repair at all times. He pays particular
							attention to stock raising and has made a success of it. He is a man of more than
							ordinary business ability and is able to grasp a proposition and determine its value
							very accurately. He is a quiet, sociable and pleasant man to meet and makes a stranger
							feel at home in a short time. His career has in every way been commendable and
							accounts for the high esteem in which he is held in the community in which he
							lives.</p>

						<p>The success of men in business or any vocation depends upon character as well as upon
							knowledge, it being a self-evident proposition that honesty is the best policy.
							Business demands confidence and where that is lacking business ends. In every
							community some men are known for their upright lives, strong common sense and moral
							worth rather than for their wealth or political standing. Their neighbors and
							acquaintances respect them, the younger generations heed their example, and when they
							"wrap the drapery of their couches about them and lie down to pleasant dreams"
							posterity listens with reverence to the story of their quiet and useful lives. Among
							such men of a past generation in Indiana was the late James L. McCoun, of Danville,
							Hendricks county, who was not only a progressive man of affairs, successful in
							material pursuits, but a man of modest and unassuming demeanor, well educated, a fine
							type of the reliable, self-made American, a friend to the poor, <pb id="VAC1000-812"
								n="751"/> charitable to the faults of his neighbors and who always stood ready to
							unite with them in every good work and active in the support of laudable public
							enterprises. He was proud of Danville and of the grand state of Indiana and zealous of
							their progress and prosperity. He was a man who in every respect merited the high
							esteem in which he was universally held, for he was a man of public spirit,
							intellectual attainments and exemplary character.</p>

						<p>James L. McCoun, one of Danville's best known citizens, was born in Putnam county,
							this state, on November 7, 1844, and died at his home in Danville, December 25, 1909.
							He was the son of Ward McCoun, one of the early pioneer settlers of the state. For
							many years Mr. McCoun was in the dry goods business in Danville, having associated
							with him in the firm his sons, Charles and Raleigh, and his nephew, James McCoun. He
							had made a success in business ranks and was regarded as one of the most substantial
							citizens of the town.</p>

						<p>Mr. McCoun was married on August 12, 1863, to Fidelia McCoun, and to this union were
							born three sons, John S., who died February 18, 1880; Charles L. and Raleigh B., who
							are both now living in Danville. He was a loving and affectionate husband and father
							and was greatly interested in his domestic life. No father ever cared for his boys and
							looked after their welfare any more conscientiously than did he.</p>

						<p>Mr. McCoun was a man among men, always stood for the right and considered those
							around him and those with whom he came in contact, and was always willing that others
							should have their own views on any subject, although they might be different from his
							own. On the other hand, he would never compromise when he thought he would be doing
							something wrong. As a friend he was true in every respect and any one in considering
							him on any question for the good of the community, always knew he was to be found on
							the right side. As a member of the Christian church he was one of the most faithful
							and there is no place outside of his home relations where he will be more missed than
							in the Christian church of Danville, where he had been a member for many years and
							where he had been an elder, serving faithfully and conscientiously. He was faithful in
							his attendance, not only at the regular Lord's day services of the church, but when in
							health was seldom absent from the mid-week prayer meeting, and those who attended
							these mid-week meetings always said that the talks of Mr. McCoun were very
							inspirational.</p>

						<p>The funeral services were held in the church where he had so long been a devoted
							member, and were conducted by the Rev. Goodnight and Rev. Elvet E. Moorman and Rev.
							Edgar Fay Daugherty, a former pastor of the church, <pb id="VAC1000-813" n="752"/> who
							delivered a sermon which was a masterpiece. The funeral was one of the largest ever
							held in Danville and the church was filled with relatives and hundreds of sympathizing
							and sorrowing friends. Mr. McCoun was prominent in all that counts for the ideal man.
							He had character of the highest type and stood for the best things. He was a part and
							parcel of those thoughts which are pure and his actions squared with his thoughts. He
							had the faculty of becoming interested in the daily affairs of the people about him
							and when one met him he felt at once that Mr. McCoun was genuinely sympathetic and
							sympathetically genuine. Some way or other one felt that there was just a little more
							sunshine in the world after he met him. Any movement that had for its object the
							betterment of his home town met with his hearty support. It can be truly said that his
							faith, his conscience, his purity, his spiritual service have passed from this world
							to the better world to come.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN E. ENGLISH.</hi></head>

						<p>More than half a century has dissolved in the mists of the past since John E. English
							was born and during that momentous period he has witnessed and taken an active part in
							the general development of Hendricks county and is highly esteemed as one of its
							respected and worthy farmers, and during that time his integrity has never been
							questioned, nor has anything savoring in the least of dishonor ever attached to his
							name or reputation. He has ever tried to measure up to the standard of correct manhood
							and Hendricks county is proud to number him among its representative men.</p>

						<p>John E. English, the son of Myzeal and Malinda (Arnold) English, was born four and
							one-half miles north of Danville, Indiana, on March 30, 1856. Myzeal English was a
							native of New Jersey, as were his parents. He came to this county with them when he
							was about eight years of age. Jonathan English, the father of Myzeal, entered land
							near the town of Danville and here he lived until his death. Myzeal English received
							schooling in the subscription schools of that day, and from his boyhood up had an
							overwhelming thirst for knowledge. When a mere youth he decided that he wanted to
							become a physician and with that end in view "read" medicine, as was the custom in
							those days, with some of the local physicians of his neighborhood. Afterwards he
							practiced in Hamilton and Boone counties for a number of years and later taught school
							in Center township for several terms. He was a man of great force of character and was
							one of the most influential men in <pb id="VAC1000-814" n="[]"/>
							<figure>
								<p rend="center">JOHN E. ENGLISH</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-815" n="753"/> the community. In addition to being a practicing
							physician, school teacher and farmer, he was, for a long time, a justice of peace in
							Union township. Because of his reputation for honesty and uprightness, men with
							grievances preferred to have them tried before Doctor English. Doctor English had a
							farm a mile and a half south of Lizton, after his return from Boone county, and on
							this farm of ninety-seven and a half acres he spent his spare time. He was married in
							March, 1854, to Malinda Arnold. To this union were born six children: George, of
							Shelby county, Indiana; John, whose history is herein portrayed; Mrs. Mary E. Jane
							Rutledge; Mrs. Sarah Helen Hamilton, deceased; Mrs. Eva Ogle and Charles H. Doctor
							English was a Democrat his whole life, but never held any public office other than
							that of justice of peace. He died May 31, 1906, of paralysis on his farm south of
							Lizton. His wife died December 3, 1907.</p>

						<p>John E. English was given a good education by his worthy father and assisted on the
							home farm until his marriage. He was married October 25, 1882, to Florence Talbott,
							the daughter of Willis and Nancy (McCoun) Talbott. Willis Talbott was born in Bourbon
							county, Kentucky, and in that state married Nancy McCoun in November, 1840. In
							February, 1841, the young couple came to Hendricks county on horseback and settled
							first on a farm in the south part of Eel River township, where they lived a few years,
							then moved to the first farm south of the present home of Mr. English and here spent
							the remainder of their lives. Mr. Talbott was born in 1811i and died in 1881 and his
							wife died in 1898. There were eleven children in the Talbott family: Aria, deceased;
							Mrs. Rachel Griffes, deceased; John T., deceased; Dr. Robert C., of California;
							Nicholas L., deceased; Charles W., of California; Mrs. Mary L. Thomas, deceased;
							Nanny, deceased; Mrs. Scottie Sheets; Henry Clay, deceased, and Florence, the wife of
							Mr. English. Mr. and Mrs. English have two children, Mrs. Erie Inez Conn, deceased,
							and Willis M., who is salesman for the Stewart Talking Machine Company at
							Indianapolis. He married Helen Foore.</p>

						<p>Mr. English is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows at Danville and the
							Knights of Pythias at Lizton. He and his wife are members of the Daughters of the
							Rebekah at Danville. While he has been a stanch Democrat all his life, he has confined
							his party activities to the casting of his vote at election time. As a citizen of the
							community and as the head of the family, Mr. English has been true in every relation
							of life to his highest ideals, and in no situation has he fallen short of the full
							measure of <pb id="VAC1000-816" n="754"/> men. He has always been found on the right
							side of all questions affecting the public welfare and his life has been a credit to
							the county honored by his citizenship.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">RICHARD T. DORMAN.</hi></head>

						<p>The career of the well-known gentleman whose name forms the caption for this
							biographical memoir was a strenuous and varied one, entitling him to honorable mention
							among the representative citizens of his day and generation in the county with which
							his life was so closely identified for so many years. Although he passed to the great
							beyond March 22, 1914, yet his influence still pervades the lives of a wide circle of
							friends and acquaintances who delighted to honor him. As a private citizen, as a man
							of business, as a valiant soldier of the Civil War, he was always true to himself and
							his fellow men, and the tongue of calumny never touched him. Although he had been in
							this country but two short years when the Civil War opened, he went to the front and
							fought as bravely for his adopted country as any of her native sons.</p>

						<p>Richard T. Dorman, who lived a retired life in Indianapolis for about one year after
							a long and successful business career in Hendricks county, was born April 10, 1843, in
							Brighton, England. Both of his parents were natives of England, and his father,
							Richard, never came to America. After his father's death his mother, Ann (Kent)
							Dorman, came to this country with her five children, landing in New York in 1860.
							While Richard, the subject of this sketch, remained in New York for some time, his
							mother and the other children went on to Kansas, where the mother died several years
							ago. The five children are as follows: Richard T., the oldest one of the family;
							James, who is now living in Kansas; Alfred, deceased; John, now a resident of Kansas;
							and Henry, who lives in Washington.</p>

						<p>Richard T. Dorman was seventeen years of age when he first saw the shores of this
							country and for the first eight months of his life in the New World he worked in the
							city of New York. In 1861 he came west and finally stopped in Hendricks county,
							Indiana, where he found employment on the farm of Jack Parker, a farmer living south
							of Pittsboro. He continued to work for him until September, 1862, when he enlisted in
							Company H, Ninety-ninth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry. He served until the close
							of the war and participated in thirteen engagements, among which were the battles of
							Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain and all the battles which General Sherman fought in his
							famous campaign to the sea. At Dallas, Georgia, he <pb id="VAC1000-817" n="755"/> was
							shot in the head on June 13, 1863, but his heavy cap saved him from fatal injury.</p>

						<p>Mr. Dorman came back to Hendricks county after he was mustered out and at once
							enrolled as a student in the Northwestern Christian University at Indianapolis. After
							remaining in school for some time he was compelled to take up some occupation for a
							living and, getting an opportunity to learn the plasterer's trade, he took that up and
							followed it until 1875, when he started in the mercantile business at Pittsboro, in
							Hendricks county. He was very successful from the start and for the next thirty years
							he maintained a general store in that place. He was a worthy representative of that
							foreign-born element in our population which has played such an important part in the
							development of our state. During his long business career he not only gained the
							confidence of his fellow business men, but as a man of force of character, upright and
							honest in his dealings with his fellow citizens, he gained the esteem of a large
							circle of friends and acquaintances in Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>In 1902 Mr. Dorman sold his store at Pittsboro and removed to his farm in Putnam
							county, where he lived until 1911, but the call of the counter and the jingle of the
							cash register took him back into the business world again. He went to Elwood, Indiana,
							in 1911 and engaged in the mercantile business for eight months, but Father Time
							induced him to sell out and retire permanently from active business and he took his
							advice. He went to Indianapolis, where he lived until a few days before his death,
							when he moved to Brownsburg.</p>

						<p>Mr. Dorman was married in 1873 to Seralda J. Dillon, who was born in Pittsboro. They
							are the parents of a very interesting family of ten children, all of whom are living
							but one. The children, in the order of their birth, are as follows: Ivan, of
							Martinsville, Indiana; Earl, who is an officer in the Fourth United States Cavalry,
							and now stationed in Hawaii; Erwin, of Montana; Ulrey, who is connected with the
							government survey service in New Mexico: Hubert, who is a solicitor for the
							Metropolitan Business College of Chicago; Clifford, who is now studying to be an
							electrical engineer; and three who are still under the parental roof, Alma, Mina (now
							Mrs. I. C. Gharst) and Kent. Mr. and Mrs. Dorman had just pride in their children and
							gave them the best education obtainable. They are all making a success in life and
							reflect honor on their parents.</p>

						<p>Mr. Dorman was a life-long Republican, but was never a candidate for any public
							office, feeling that his business affairs demanded all of his time. However, he always
							kept in touch with the current issues of the day and 755 <pb id="VAC1000-818" n="756"
							/> discussed them intelligently. He was a consistent adherent of the Christian church
							and always contributed to the support of that denomination. Personally, Mr. Dorman was
							a man of clean character and ever exerted a wholesome and healthful influence in the
							community, giving his support to every movement which promised to advance the welfare
							of the localities in which he lived.</p>

						<p>Charles C. Clay, the son of John J. Crittenden Clay and Mattie (Walker) Clay, was
							born November 23, 1874, in Eel River township, this county. He was given a good common
							school education in the district schools of his home neighborhood, and early in life
							decided to devote his attention to agriculture and stock raising. His father had been
							a successful farmer and stock dealer and he worked with him until his marriage, and in
							this way received a practical education along those lines which he intended to make
							his life work. He continued to reside for two years after his marriage on his father's
							farm and then bought a farm one and one-half miles west of North Salem, which, with
							forty acres that he had inherited from his grandmother, gave him a fine tract of two
							hundred and fifty-five acres. Here he lived for seven years, and then moved into North
							Salem, where he has since resided. He still manages his farm, but puts most of his
							attention to the buying and shipping of live stock in car load lots. He keeps his farm
							well stocked at all times by buying the cattle in the city markets and placing them on
							his farm for fattening. In this way he makes use of all his own feed and grain which
							is raised on his land.</p>

						<p>Mr. Clay was married in October, 1897, to Adina Emmons, daughter of James M. and
							Elizabeth (Trotter) Emmons. Her father was born October 28, 1828, in Giles county,
							Virginia, the son of Jehu and Sarah (Henderson) Emmons. When James M. was about eight
							years of age his parents moved to this state and located in Marion township, this
							county. About three years later they permanently located in Eel River township, where
							they lived the remainder of their lives. James M. Emmons was married in January, 1853,
							to Elizabeth Trotter, a native of this county and the daughter of James and Sarah
							(Whitt) Trotter, early pioneers of Hendricks county. After his marriage, James M.
							lived at North Salem, where he followed the trade of a carpenter and became a
							prosperous contractor and builder, an occupation which he followed the remainder of
							his life except when holding <pb id="VAC1000-819" n="757"/> public office. In 1878 he
							was elected sheriff of Hendricks county and four years later was re-elected. Upon
							leaving the sheriff's office he bought a farm two miles south of North Salem, where he
							lived for ten years. He then sold his farm and moved to North Salem, where he has
							since lived. Mr. and Mrs. Emmons reared a family of eleven children, eight of whom are
							still living: Oscar, of North Salem; Jewel, of Indianapolis; Leonidas, of Texas:
							Eldred, of Nebraska; Sarah Catherine, the wife of Nathan Davis, of Denver, Colorado;
							Ida, the widow of Wilson Haynes; Gertrude, the wife of Thaddeus Banta, of Decatur,
							Illinois, and Adina, the wife of Mr. Clay. The mother of these children died September
							6, 1912. Mr. and Mrs. Emmons were both members of the Christian church.</p>

						<p>Mr. Clay is a member of the Knights of Pythias, and he and his wife are both
							consistent members of the Christian church of their town. They are the parents of four
							children, Mary. Emmons, Josephine and John J. C. Mr. Clay is one of the sterling and

						<p>It is not given to all men to do more than one thing and do it well, but in the case

							performs his duties properly. With his superior qualifications and with his attention
							to his business, it means that he will hold this office as long as he lives, or until
							he resigns. His life has been a busy one.</p>

						<p>Samuel Sherman Waters, son of Isaac B. and Elizabeth Ann (Watts) Waters, was born
							February 6, 1865, about three miles northeast of Brownsburg. The father, Isaac B.
							Waters, was born March 10, 1832, in Brown county, Ohio, and was the son of Philip and
							Lydia (Gardner) Waters. Philip Waters and his wife came to Hendricks county in 1834,
							when Isaac <pb id="VAC1000-820" n="758"/> B. was two years of age, and entered one
							hundred and twenty acres of land on November 3, 1834. Philip Waters died in 1851, at
							the age of fifty-one, having been born in Brown county, Ohio, in 1800. His wife died
							in 1863. Mr. and Mrs. Philip Waters were the parents of twelve children, Isaac being
							the only one who is living; the eleven deceased are as follows: Cary, Benjamin,
							Lucinda, Reynolds, Joseph, John, Raszilla, Matilda, and three who died in infancy.
							Isaac B. Waters was first married in 1858 to Elizabeth S. Walter, and to this union
							were born three children, two who died in infancy and Mrs, Fannie Williamson. Isaac B.
							Waters married his second wife, who was Elizabeth A. Watts, on November 19, 1863, and
							to this union were born five children, three dying in infancy, Samuel Sherman, whose
							history is herein given, and John T. Isaac Waters has lived in this county practically
							all of his life, spending two years, from 1865 to 1867, in Illinois. In addition to
							his farming, he was also a carpenter and cabinet-maker and in 1868 he went into the
							undertaking business. This he followed until 1904, when he transferred his business to
							his son John, who followed the same until 1913, when he sold out to W. C. Hicks. Isaac
							B. Waters was one of the progressive business men of Pittsboro. He built the block
							where he conducted his undertaking and furniture establishment, later selling this to
							Howard Stanley. He was very much interested in Masonry and had served seven terms as
							master of the Pittsboro lodge. He was justice of the peace for several years and was
							elected three times afterwards, but declined to serve. In addition to his career as a
							private citizen, he served a short time in the Civil War, enlisting October 1, 1864,
							in Company C, Twenty-fifth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and fought in the
							battles in North Carolina under Sherman in the spring of 1865. He was discharged June
							10, 1865, at Washington, D. C., and mustered out in July following.</p>

						<p>Samuel S. Waters has lived in this county all of his life with the exception of two
							years when his parents were in Illinois. After graduating from the common schools, he
							attended the Central Normal College at Danville and then began teaching school in this
							county. For the next twenty years he was engaged in teaching at and near Pittsboro,
							Lizton and North Salem and was regarded as one of the most successful teachers of the
							county. In 1906 he bought the <hi rend="i">North Salem Herald</hi> of B. M. Pace and
							continued as editor for the next seven years. In 1909 he was appointed postmaster of
							North Salem and later took the civil service examination and, the office being in the

							rural routes out of Pittsboro serve about three hundred rural patrons.</p>

						<p>Bert A. White, the son of Vincent and Cassandra (Black) White, was born August 8,
							1867, in the township where he has always made his home. Vincent White was a native of
							Kentucky, and when about six years of age came to Indiana with his parents. Asa and
							Margaret (Hunter) White, who settled in Hendricks county. Asa White was a wagon-maker
							by trade and first settled in Danville, where he operated a shop for a few years, but
							later purchased a farm and continued his wagon making on the farm for the rest of his
							life. He made the wagons at times when he was not able to work on the farm, and in
							this way added not a little to his annual income. Vincent White was reared on his
							father's farm and followed the occupation of a farmer all his life. After his marriage
							he lived on a farm near his father's place for a time and then moved to his wife's
							father's farm, where he lived twenty years. He is now living retired in Brownsburg.
							Cassandra Black, the wife of Vincent White, was born in Kentucky, coming here with her
							parents, John and Virginia (Campbell) Black, when she was a small child.</p>

						<p>Bert A. White grew up near Brownsburg and has lived in the town of <pb
								id="VAC1000-822" n="760"/> Brownsburg since he was twenty-one years of age. Most of
							his life he has been engaged in the meat business, and much of this time has conducted
							a meat shop in Brownsburg. He and his brother-in-law, Edgar Thompson, were in
							partnership for a time, and within ten years they sold and bought back their place of
							business several different times. From 1899 to 1903 Mr. White was a live-stock broker
							in the stock yards at Indianapolis, but again returned to Brownsburg, where he engaged
							in the meat business with his brother-in-law. Upon his return from Indianapolis he and
							his brother-in-law also operated a saw-mill for two years, afterwards selling the mill
							and engaging again in the meat business, which they continued until 1912, when Mr.
							White retired from this business altogether.</p>

						<p>In 1908 Mr. White was elected as trustee of Lincoln township, and since 1912, when he
							closed out his meat business, has given his entire attention to the duties of this
							important office. Since the 1913 Legislature extended his term of office two years, he
							is still holding the office and his term will not expire until the end of 1914. He
							attends strictly to the various duties connected with this position and is making a
							very competent and efficient official. There is no more important office in the United
							States than that of the humble trustee, and no other official handles as much real
							power as does he. He is both an administrative and legislative official and is
							practically the king within his own bailiwick.</p>

						<p>Mr. White was married June 16, 1889, to Mary E. Thompson, the daughter of Squire and
							Millicent (Griggs) Thompson, both of whom were born, reared and married near Richmond,
							Kentucky. Squire Thompson was the son of Jesse and Mary (Little) Thompson, both of
							whom lived and died in Kentucky, and his wife was the daughter of Martin and Eliza
							(Burgess) Griggs, who were also life-long residents of Kentucky. The Thompsons came to
							Indiana and settled in Hendricks county about 1870. Squire Thompson was a stock buyer
							and moved to Brownsburg about 1881, where he remained until his death, which occurred
							in 1906. He was an active Republican and he and his wife are loyal and consistent
							members of the Christian church. He was a member of the Independent Order of Odd
							Fellows and the Knights of Pythias and was known as a very industrious and progressive
							man in every way. He was a public-spirited citizen, who was always on the alert for
							the welfare of his community. His wife died in 1905. Mr. and Mrs. White are the
							parents of four children: Bessie A., the wife of William H. Cosby, of Indianapolis,
							has one son, Harold; Nellie, William Leslie and Herbert, the last three named being
							still under the parental roof.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-823" n="761"/>

						<p>Mr. White lends his support to the Democratic party at all times and has always been
							a prominent figure in the caucuses and conventions of his party. He is a member of the
							Knights of Pythias and the Tribe of Ben-Hur, taking an active interest in the workings
							of these fraternal orders, while he and his wife are both loyal and consistent members
							of the Christian church, to which they give their zealous support. He and his wife
							have worked hard for their success and they made what they have honestly and they can
							claim a wide circle of friends here who rejoice with them in their prosperity. They
							started out in life without much in the way of worldly goods, but have worked hard
							together, have been economical and managed well and for this reason they have the
							entire respect and esteem of all who know them, for their lives have been above
							reproach and they are regarded as good neighbors and obliging friends.</p>

						<p>The psalmist says that three score and ten years is the allotted span of man's life
							and yet there are scores of people living in Hendricks county who have passed that age
							and hundreds of others who are just approaching it. Among the latter is Phillip B.
							Herring, who was born in 1846 in Hendricks county, near Clayton. His parents were
							Azriah and Ellen (Beasley) Herring, both natives of Kentucky, who both came to this
							county in early days with their parents and were married at Belleville. Azriah Herring
							worked by the day at various kinds of employment for the first ten or twelve years
							after his marriage, when he purchased one hundred and twenty acres of land in the
							western part of Brown township. On this farm he lived for the next thirty years, when
							he sold it and bought another farm in the northwestern part of the same township,
							where he lived until his death. Mr. and Mrs. Azriah Herring reared a family of
							fourteen children.</p>

						<p>Phillip B. Herring lived under the parental roof until he was married in 1874 and
							often laughs because he was married at seven o'clock on the morning of January 1st,
							saying that for once he started the new year right. Previous to his marriage he had
							purchased thirty-three acres of land where he now resides, and since that time has
							added twenty-seven acres more until he is now owner of sixty acres of as fine farming
							land as can be found in the county. On this farm he has a good house and large and
							commodious barns and outbuildings, and has his farm well improved in every way.</p>

						<p>Mr. Herring was married to America Walker, the daughter of Robert <pb
								id="VAC1000-824" n="762"/> and Elizabeth Ann (Menefee) Walker, who were both natives
							of Kentucky, coming to this county after their marriage, settling in Washington
							township about 1862, but later buying forty acres of land in Brown township. America
							Walker was one of three children living at home when she was married. Mr. and Mrs.
							Herring are the parents of four children: Minnie Alice, who married Conrad Marker, the
							son of Amos and Laura Marker, and they live just across the road from Mr. Herring and
							have a family of four children, Lawrence, Cleo, Eula L. and Violet A.; Angie Belle is
							the wife of Virgil S. Watson, the editor of the <hi rend="i">Brownsburg Record</hi>,
							whose history is given elsewhere in this volume. Mr. and Mrs. Watson have one
							daughter, Hazel Bernice; Mary E., who lives at home, and Carl C., who married Sallie
							Funkhouser, the daughter of Lucien and Mira (Crane) Funkhouser. Carl is a farmer
							living in this township.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Herring are both loyal and faithful members of the Methodist Protestant
							church at Brownsburg and give it their zealous support, having always been interested
							in the activities of this denomination. Mr. Herring, in addition to his farming
							interests, made a specialty of breeding fine horses and has won several prizes at the
							county and state fairs with some of his best stock. In recent years he has retired
							from active work and at the present time is only supervising the management of his
							farm. He is a well preserved man, despite his sixty-eight years, and has a host of
							friends wherever he is known. Through his long residence in this county he has gained

						<p>There is nothing which stimulates a man to deeds of worth and a life of uprightness
							and rectitude more than the recollection of the strength of character and examples of
							right living which have been shown by his forbears. In this respect Mr. Davis is
							fortunate beyond the majority of men in being descended from a line of men who have
							been in their communities men of strength and influence, doing their duty well,
							whether in the peaceful pursuits of ordinary life or in positions of public trust. A
							heritage of such memory of the lives of one's forefathers is of more value than a
							heritage of material wealth. In the business affairs of North Salem the subject of
							this sketch occupies a position of importance and among those who are today conserving
								<pb id="VAC1000-825" n="763"/> the commercial and industrial prosperity of this
							community none occupy a higher standing among their associates than he whose name
							appears at the head of this sketch.</p>

						<p>George B. Davis, a banker of North Salem, was born April 14, 1869, near this town.
							His parents were Francis Marion and Sarah E. (Brown) Davis. Francis Marion Davis was
							born near North Salem in 1837, the son of Nathan and Nancy Davis, who came to this
							county about 1833 from Mount Sterling, Kentucky. Nathan and Nancy Davis spent the
							remainder of their lives in North Salem, dying here in the early history of the state.
							Francis Marion grew up to manhood in this county, farmed, operated a saw-mill,
							flour-mill, a planing-mill, dealt extensively in lumber in Indiana, Illinois and
							Kentucky, and was one of the most enterprising business men who ever managed a
							financial transaction in this county. He was active up until the time of his death in
							1887. He was a member of the Masonic order, active in the Christian church, a
							public-spirited citizen, who was very frank in his manner. His wife, Sarah E. Brown,
							was born near Cove Spring, Kentucky, and came to this county early in childhood with
							her parents, George M. and Martha Brown. Later her parents moved to Crawfordsville,
							where her father spent his last days. His mother still lives in North Salem.</p>

						<p>George B. Davis was given a common school and high school education in his home town
							and then attended Butler College for four years, after which he graduated from the
							State University at Bloomington in the spring of 1894. He received the degree of
							Bachelor of Arts from Butler College, and the degree of Bachelor of Laws from Indiana
							University. Before he had finished his course at Bloomington, he had become part owner
							of the North Salem Bank and to this financial institution he has devoted his time ever
							since leaving college.</p>

						<p>The North Salem Bank was organized in 1891 by Pritchard &amp; Son of Illinois. In
							1893 they sold it to C. W. Davis, G. B. Davis and Samuel R. Stewart. Soon after this,
							Mr. Stewart sold his interests to J. B. Fleece and the bank is now owned by C. W.
							Davis, G. B. Davis and Samuel R. Stewart. The deposits now average one hundred and
							fifty thousand dollars, and it is considered one of the strongest and safest private
							banks in central Indiana. It is well managed and is an institution which has won the
							confidence of the people of North Salem and vicinity, because all of the owners are
							upright men of excellent education.</p>

						<p>Mr. Davis was married in December, 1897, to Lulu C. Duncan, the daughter of George H.
							and Nancy (Davis) Duncan. She was born and reared in Eel River township, this county,
							near North Salem, and received <pb id="VAC1000-826" n="764"/> her education in the
							North Salem schools. Her parents were both born and reared in this county and have
							spent their whole life here. Mr. and Mrs. Davis have three children: Rollin, aged
							eleven; Mildred, aged nine, and Mary Eunice, aged six. The family are members of the
							Christian church and Mr. Davis is president of the board and treasurer of the church.
							Mr. Davis is a man of unassuming demeanor in his relations to his fellow men, among
							whom he enjoys a well deserved popularity, and has, without reserve, always been for
							the best things in life for the community honored by his residence and here his name
							has become known for his sterling character and worth.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">GRANDISON EATON.</hi></head>

						<p>If for no other reason, the life history of Grandison Eaton, well-known citizen of
							Brownsburg, Hendricks county, Indiana, should be contained in this work because he is
							one of the honored veterans of the great War of the Rebellion, who unhesitatingly gave
							up the pleasure of home associations and the opportunities of business and offered his
							services and his life, if need be. in order that the nation might be perpetuated and
							the Star and Stripes saved from treason and hishonor; but there are other reasons, one
							of which is that he has led a life of honesty and sobriety and another is that he has
							done much for the general good of his community here.</p>

						<p>Grandison Eaton, a distinguished veteran of the Civil War and public-spirited citizen
							of Brownsburg, was born in Hendricks county, September 13, 1837, and has spent his
							whole life within the county. His parents were Greenup and Mahala (Turpin) Eaton.
							Greenup Eaton was born in 1813 in Bourbon county, Kentucky, and came to this county in
							childhood with his parents, his father dying soon after their arrival in this county.
							Mahala Turpin was born in Scott county, Kentucky, in 1815, and reared to young woman-
							hood near Clermont, in Marion county, this state. She was the daughter of Jacob and
							Martha Turpin, who came from Kentucky among the early pioneers. Jacob Turpin was born
							in 1785 in the eastern part of Maryland and was a son of William and Nancy (Hanley)
							Turpin. William Turpin's father was a soldier of the Revolution and lived to the
							advanced age of over one hundred years. In 1786 William and Nancy Turpin left Maryland
							and went to Kentucky, and for the first few years were compelled to live in a block
							house with the other settlers of the community for safety, as at that time the Indians
							were on the war path and practically all of the settlers of Kentucky <pb
								id="VAC1000-827" n="765"/> were gathered in the block houses scattered throughout
							the state. Jacob Turpin married Martha Taylor in Bourbon county, Kentucky, in 1804.
							Martha Taylor was born in 1786, of Scotch ancestry. Jacob Turpin and his wife moved to
							Scott county, Kentucky, and in 1820 came to Indianapolis when it had not even yet
							reached the dignity of a village. In 1829 Jacob Turpin and his wife moved to the
							eastern part of Hendricks county, near Clermont. At that time there were no bridges
							nor roads and the farm on which they settled was a virgin wilderness in every respect.
							Jacob Turpin started in to clear the ground and make a home. He died in 1849 and she
							in 1855.</p>

						<p>Greenup Eaton, the father of Grandison, whose history is here presented, came from
							Marion county, Indiana, to Hendricks county while still a boy and hired out to the
							farmers in this county to work by the day. He married Mahala Turpin, and to them were
							born four children, James Samuel, William Harrison, Grandison and Ruann. When
							Grandison was about three years of age his mother died, and his father afterwards
							married Melinda Smith, and to this second marriage five children were born, Reuben,
							Thomas, Willard F., Fannie and Mahala J. The mother of these children died after
							Mahala was born, the latter being then reared by Moses Gwinn. Some time after the
							death of his second wife, Greenup Eaton married Cynthia Watson, and to his third
							marriage were born seven children: Marcelite, the wife of Joseph Jones; Luna, the wife
							of Oliver Parsons; Estella, who married William Ellis; Henry, who was at one time
							sheriff of Hendricks county, and Charles and Allen, both of whom died in infancy.</p>

						<p>Greenup Eaton made his home two miles north of Brownsburg, where he operated a brick
							yard and also followed the trade of a bricklayer. He was one of the first men to place
							brick on the ground for the erection of the present insane asylum at Indianapolis. He
							and two other brick men ran a race to see which one would be the first to get a load
							of brick on the ground and he was the winner. He was a man who was intensely devoted
							to his country and had a deep-seated hatred of slavery. When the Knights of the Golden
							Circle began their nefarious operations in Indiana, he waged incessant war against
							them, and did everything that he could to break up their organization in his county.
							Four of his sons, William Harrison, Grandison, Reuben and Thomas, went to the front
							and all of them made valiant soldiers for the Union. He died in 1866, a man
							universally honored and respected.</p>

						<p>Grandison Eaton, the son of Greenup Eaton by his first marriage, grew up on the home
							farm and in September, 1861, enlisted in Company B, Seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer
							Infantry. A large number of Hendricks county boys were in this same regiment, among
							whom was Judge <pb id="VAC1000-828" n="766"/> John V. Hadley, editor of the historical
							section of this volume. Mr. Eaton was at the front nearly four years and served in
							many of the most important battles of the Civil War, among which were the battles of
							Gettysburg, Antietam, Spotsylvania, Chancellorsville, second battle of Bull Run and
							many others of minor importance. After being mustered out, he returned to this county
							and resumed his trade of brick-making and brick-laying. This has been his life work
							until a few years ago when he retired from manual labor. He has built a majority of
							the brick structures in and around Brownsburg, his first experience being before the
							Civil War opened during the Lincoln campaign, when he laid the brick in the building
							which is now occupied by the Hunter Bank of Brownsburg. Mr. Eaton has prospered
							because of his industry and good business abilities and now owns the postoffice
							building, the two buildings across the street from the postoffice, the second building
							east of the postoffice, the property occupied by the telephone exchange and residence
							properties in the town. As a contractor he has always rendered good service and his
							buildings will remain for many years to come as monuments to his honest labor.</p>

						<p>Mr. Eaton was married January 8, 1865, to Mary S. Lawler, who was born in 1841, near
							Clayton, this county. Her parents were Nicholas and Ann (Buchanan) Lawler, natives of
							Kentucky, who came to Jennings county, Indiana, and from thence to this county in an
							early day. Nicholas Lawler was a life-long farmer.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Eaton has been a life-long Republican, and has always kept abreast
							of the times in political matters, although he has never been a candidate for any
							public office. He is a great reader of all kinds of literature and has always been
							deeply interested in the local history of his county. He is a loyal member of the
							Grand Army of the Republic, which was established in 1866 at Decatur, Illinois, and
							takes a prominent part in all the Memorial day services in his county. It is
							interesting to note in this connection that the Grand Army of the Republic reached its
							highest membership of four hundred thousand four hundred eighty-nine in 1890, and that
							today it has been reduced by death to less than one hundred and seventy-five thousand.
							The Grand Army of the Republic has held a national encampment every year since 1866
							excepting 1867, and has gathered in nearly every important city in the United States.
							It was the originator of May 30th as Memorial day, the first Memorial day being
							celebrated in the year 1868. Mr. Eaton is a public-spirited man who has been a
							prominent factor in the business life of Brownsburg. He is a sociable man, highly
							esteemed and one of those whole-souled, genial men whom every one likes to meet.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">CLARK H. SELLARS.</hi></head>

						<p>Self-assertion is believed by many people to be absolutely necessary to success in
							life, and there are good reasons for the entertainment of such belief. The modest man
							very rarely gets what is due him. The selfish, aggressive man elbows his way to the
							front, takes all that is in sight and it sometimes seems that modesty is a sin, with
							self-denial the penalty. There are, however, exceptions to all rules, and it is a
							matter greatly to be regretted that the exceptions to the conditions are not more
							numerous. One notable exception is the case of the honorable gentleman whose life
							history we here present, who possesses just a sufficient amount of modesty to be a
							gentleman at all times, and yet sufficient persistency to win in the business world
							and at the same time not appear overbold. As a result of these well and happily
							blended qualities, Mr. Sellars has won a host of friends in Guilford township,
							Hendricks county, where he is well known to all classes as a man of influence,
							integrity and business ability.</p>

						<p>Clark H. Sellars, one of the prominent farmers and stock raisers of Guilford
							township, this county, was born October 26, 1869, in the township where he has always
							resided. His parents were John and Adaline (Coble) Sellars. His father was one of the
							leading ministers of the Friends church and preached at Mooresville for the most of
							his life. The grandparents on both sides came from North Carolina, and originally from
							Germany. John Sellars was married twice and to his first marriage was born seven
							children. His first wife died in March, 1896, and a few years later he married Rebecca
							Doan. The seven children of the first marriage are as follows: Albert H., deceased,
							who married Ida Hight; William, of LaMar, Missouri, who married Rosa Fogleman and has
							five children living and two deceased; Dossie, of Morgan county, the wife of W. O.
							Latta, a farmer, who has six children living and two deceased; Charles, of
							Indianapolis, who married Violet Moore; Clark H., of whom we are writing; R. D., a
							farmer of Morgan county, who married Sallie Sumner and has three children living and
							one deceased: Addison, a merchant of Mooresville, who married Maud Scruggs and has two
							children. Mrs. John Sellars died in 1896 and her husband five years later, having
							lived on the same farm in Guilford township for thirty-one years previous to his
							death.</p>

						<p>Clark H. Sellars was married August 23, 1893, to Flora C. Thompson, the daughter of
							John S. and Martha E. (Latta) Thompson. John S. Thompson was a farmer of Morgan county
							and a veteran of the late Civil <pb id="VAC1000-830" n="768"/> War, dying in 1907. Mr.
							and Mrs. Clark H. Sellars are the parents of five children: Pearl Marie, born February
							7, 1894, who, after graduating from the Mooresville high school, began teaching school
							and has continued at that profession up to the present time; Claire J., born January
							27, 1896, who is a graduate of the Mooresville high school and the Indiana State
							Normal School at Terre Haute; Dorrett Laurene. born January 29, 1899, a graduate of
							the Mooresville high school; Grace Hildren, born January 19, 1901; Paul Lee, born
							January 13, 1904.</p>

						<p>Mr. Sellars and the members of his family are adherents of the Friends church and are
							generous supporters of all of the organizations of their church. Mr. Sellars has
							allied himself to the new Progressive party, because he feels that in the principles
							advocated by this party the welfare of the nation will be the best served.
							Fraternally, he is a member of the Knights of Pythias. Mr. and Mrs. Sellars have
							reared a very interesting family, and have had the pleasure of seeing their children
							rise to lives of honor and usefulness. They have given them the advantages of the best
							educational institutions in the state, and they have responded by doing their part in
							a very satisfactory manner. Mr. Sellars is one of the most substantial men of the
							county, and has helped very materially in the advancement of his community, giving his

						<p>An enumeration of those men of the present generation who have won honor and public
							recognition for themselves in Hendricks county, and at the same time have honored the
							locality to which they belong, would be incomplete were there failure to make specific
							mention of Marion Bailey, of Union township. The qualities which have made him one of
							the prominent and successful men of Hendricks county have also brought him the esteem
							of his fellow men, for his career has been one of well directed energy, strong
							determination and honorable methods. Yet he has not neglected to take his part in the
							public life of his community.</p>

						<p>Marion Bailey, the president of the Lizton Bank and vice-president of the Citizens
							State Bank at Jamestown, was born December 1, 1854, near St. Paul. His parents were
							John and Catherine (Emdy) Bailey. John Bailey was born in Butler county, Ohio,
							September 19, 1827, and came with his parents to Shelby county, Indiana, when a small
							boy. In 1861 John Bailey with his family, moved to this county and settled in Union
							township near <pb id="VAC1000-831" n="[]"/>
							<figure>
								<p rend="center">MR. AND MRS. MARION BAILEY</p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1000-832" n="769"/> Lizton, where he followed the life of a farmer and
							stock raiser until his death in 1902. The wife of John Bailey was a native of Shelby
							county, Indiana, and died in 1855, when Marion was only one year of age. John Bailey
							was the father of fourteen children: Mrs. Elizabeth Smith; Sarah, who died at the age
							of two; Mrs. Eva A. Campbell, and Marion, whose history is herein delineated, are the
							children of his first wife, Catherine Emdy. Mrs. Mary E. Dale; George W.; Peter N.;
							Mrs. Ellen Hall; Mrs. Nettie Hedge; Mrs. Nora E. Lee; Edgar; William, who died at the
							age of three; John T., and one child which died in infancy, are children by his second
							marriage, to Rebecca J. Reed.</p>

						<p>Marion Bailey was given a good education in the schools of Lizton and Jamestown and
							assisted his father on the farm until his marriage, at the age of twenty-three. He was
							married November 15, 1877, to Rachel C. Young, the daughter of Milton and Susan Young,
							and to this union have been born five children. The first died in early infancy: Harry
							E., who married Dora Brown; Harry is a farmer living near Lizton and has two children,
							Buford E. and Veletia; Artie M., a farmer of Boone county, who married Nora Coombs and
							has two children, Kenneth and Earl; Luna A., the wife of Stewart Pritchett, a farmer
							of Boone county, has two children, Thelma and Lorin; Goldie Vesper, a farmer of this
							township who married Ruth Keeney and has one child, Ranold Marion.</p>

						<p>Immediately after his marriage, Mr. Bailey began farming in Union township and has
							been a successful farmer from the beginning and now owns three hundred and
							eighty-seven and a half acres in this county and Boone county. In 1903 he made his
							first venture in the banking business and upon the organization of the Citizens Bank
							at Jamestown, in Boone county, he became vice-president and has continued in that
							capacity up to the present time. Pre-eminent among his many good qualities is that of
							sound financial judgment and an ability to grasp facts and infer their practical
							significance with almost unerring certainty. After once engaging in the banking
							business he became interested in it and began to make a study of practical banking. In
							1910 he helped to organize the Lizton Bank and has been president of that financial
							institution ever since its organization. Both of the banks with which he is connected
							are in a flourishing condition and have gained the confidence of the community which
							they serve.</p>

						<p>However, Mr. Bailey's life has not always been devoted to business, for he has taken
							a prominent part in the public affairs of his community and state and for the past
							thirty years has been one of the prominent figures in <pb id="VAC1000-833" n="770"/>
							Democratic politics in his county and for the last ten years a conspicuous figure in
							state politics. His first official position was trustee of his township. an office
							which he held from 1888 to 1895; he then served as a member of the county advisory
							board, getting his appointment through the governor, then served three years on the
							state board of charities and correction, this board being composed of three citizens
							of the state selected by the governor. Mr. Bailey's first entry into state politics
							was in 190o6, when he was nominated by the Democratic state convention for state
							auditor, and, although the whole Republican ticket was elected in that year, he was
							defeated by only thirty-two votes. In 1908 the Democratic state convention recognized
							in him a man of great ability and a man who would make an effective appeal to the
							voters of the. state, and they again placed him before the Democrats of the state on
							the ticket for state auditor. Again, however, the fortunes of politics were against
							him and this time he was defeated by a vote of only one hundred and twenty-eight out
							of a total of nearly six hundred and fifty thousand votes. It will be seen from what
							has been said of Mr. Bailey that he is a man of marked ability along many lines. As a
							political leader his convictions of right and wrong have been sharply separated and he
							has always taken a positive stand for clean politics and better political conditions

						<p>No citizen is better or more favorably known in Hendricks county today than Millard
							Tyra Hunter, the president of the Hunter Bank, of Brownsburg. He has witnessed the
							wonderful development of this locality and played no inconspicuous role in the growth
							of the same, for he has had its <pb id="VAC1000-834" n="771"/> interest at heart and
							was ever ready to do his full share in the work of progress. As a farmer he was one of
							the most successful in the county, and as a merchant he was no less successful, while
							as a banker he has shown those business qualities which mark him as a man of more than
							ordinary ability.</p>

						<p>Millard Tyra Hunter, a banker of Brownsburg, was born April 14, 1851, in Middle
							township, this county. His parents were Lewis S. and Elizabeth A. (Parker) Hunter.
							Lewis S. Hunter was born in 1813 in Fleming county, Kentucky. His father died when he
							was only three months old and when he became of age his mother came from Kentucky and
							settled in Middle township. There Lewis Hunter married and afterwards lived the life
							of a farmer until 1852, when he came to Brownsburg and engaged in the general
							mercantile business, in which he continued until the opening of the Civil War, when he
							sold out and resumed farming. He owned a farm one mile east of Brownsburg, but lived
							in the town. Lewis S. Hunter was an active Republican and in the early days was
							appointed county tax collector. He, with his wife, were members of the Christian
							church and he was a man who was highly respected by his neighbors. He died in January,
							1892, and his widow survived him five years.</p>

						<p>Millard Tyra Huunter received his education in the Brownsburg schools and after his
							graduation from the high school attended Butler College. After leaving college he
							returned to the farm and later clerked for Cope &amp; Hunt in their store in
							Brownsburg. After his marriage Mr. Hunter went to farming for himself east of
							Brownsburg and remained on the farm about twelve years. He then moved into Brownsburg
							and engaged in the dry goods business, although he still managed his farm, and has
							never entirely relinquished his agricultural interests. He continued in the dry goods
							business until 1907, when he discontinued this line of endeavor and opened the Hunter
							Bank at Brownsburg, of which he has been president since its organization. This bank
							has had a remarkably successful career since the date of its organization, and the
							following statement, which was issued at the close of its business on October 21,
							1913, shows the remarkable progress which it has made in seven years: Resources--
							Loans and discounts, $160,422.87; over-drafts, $530.81; furniture and fixtures,
							$1,400.00; due from banks and trust companies, $47,478.93; cash on hand. $4,484.08;
							cash items, $1,276.35; current expenses, $2,082.00; total, $217,675.04. Liabilities--
							Capital stock paid in, $10,000.00; surplus, $2,500.00; demand deposits. $159,121.34;
							demand certificates, $42.o53.oo00; exchange, discounts, etc., $4,000.00; total,
							$217,675.04.</p>

						<p>The bank seeks to serve the town of Brownsburg and vicinity and is <pb
								id="VAC1000-835" n="772"/> doing an ever-increasing business, which is a tribute to
							the business ability of Mr. Hunter and the confidence which the people of the
							community have in him.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hunter was married in the fall of 1879 to Mary Larsh, who was born in Clermont,
							Indiana, and came to Brownsburg when she was about twelve years of age with her
							parents. Mr. Hunter is a Republican in politics and has served as trustee of Lincoln
							township, although he is not active in politics at the present time. He and his wife
							are loyal members of the Christian church of Brownsburg, and give it their zealous
							support. Mr. Hunter is a man who has shown rare business qualities, and in all of his
							financial dealings he has so conducted himself that he has won the hearty approbation
							of his fellow men. He is a worthy scion of one of the old and influential pioneer
							families of this locality, and has kept untarnished the good name which his ancestors
							ever bore unsullied.</p>

							forth the individual and specific accomplishments of which generic history is ever
							engendered.</p>

						<p>Cleo L. Hunt, the cashier of the Hunter Bank of Brownsburg, was born in Brownsburg,
							April 15, 1880. His parents were Cyrus N. and Julia A. (Hunter) Hunt. Cyrus N. Hunt,
							the son of Cyrus Hunt, Sr., was born at Belleville, this county, and was a merchant in
							Brownsburg from about 1867 until his death in January, 1891. He was a member of the
							Christian church, and was prominent in local public affairs of his community. Cleo L.
							Hunt was the only child of Mr. and Mrs. Cyrus Hunt.</p>

						<p>Cleo L. Hunt was first educated in the common schools, and graduated <pb
								id="VAC1000-836" n="773"/> from Shortridge high school at Indianapolis in 1899,
							after which he entered Butler College and graduated from that institution in 1904.
							While in college he took a prominent part in college activities and was a member of
							the Greek-letter fraternity of Phi Delta Theta. After graduating from college he
							returned to Brownsburg, and when the Hunter Bank was organized in 1907 he was elected
							cashier and has continued in that capacity until the present time. He has shown
							ability to grasp financial matters in a comprehensive manner and his usefulness to the
							bank is increasing year by year.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hunt was married in 1908 to Lura Harold, the daughter of Dr. Cyrus N. and Ella
							(Spencer) Harold, of Indianapolis. Doctor Harold is a practicing physician in
							Indianapolis, and was born near Carmel, Indiana, his wife being a native of Henry
							county, this state. Mr. and Mrs: Hunt are both devout church members, he belonging to
							the Christian church, while she holds her membership in the Friends church. Mr. Hunt
							is a man of strong intelligence and good judgment and with the qualities of business
							management which he has developed he will become increasingly useful to society as he
							grows older. He is a man of pleasing personality who easily makes friends, and because
							of his splendid qualities of head and heart his friends are as numerous as his

						<head><hi rend="center">JAMES NELSON LOCKHART.</hi></head>

						<p>In the removal of James N. Lockhart from this mundane sphere on the last day of 1912,
							there was removed another of those prominent farmers of this county who have made
							their way in life by force of their own merit and industry from small beginnings to
							great success and his memory will long be revered and his influence felt for good in
							this section of our commonwealth. He was of a turn to win the confidence and good will
							of those with whom he came into contact, and to retain their esteem and friendship
							without effort. He was a man of absolute honesty, always on the advance and managed
							his agricultural interests with a skill and prudence which came of a practical
							knowledge of every branch of the business.</p>

						<p>James Nelson Lockhart was born near Martinsville, in Morgan county, this state, in
							1848, and died at his home in Eel River township, this county, December 31, 1912. He
							was the son of Jarman and Leah (Robbins) Lockhart, and a brother of Jacob Lockhart,
							whose history is found elsewhere in this volume and contains the ancestry of the
							Lockhart family. John Lockhart died when James was a small boy and the widow and her
							four <pb id="VAC1000-837" n="774"/> children moved from Morgan county to Marion
							township, in this county, on her father's farm. Here James grew to manhood and as soon
							as he was old enough to do a day's work he started to work for his uncle, William
							Robbins, for whom he worked several years, saved his money and rented a farm, to which
							he took his mother and some of his brothers and sisters.</p>

						<p>James M. Lockhart was naturally a man of keen discernment and good business
							qualities, and saved his money with the intention of investing in land. In 1888 he
							bought a farm, but four years later sold it and bought one hundred and eighty-four
							acres one mile south of North Salem. This farm he improved and brought to a state
							where it is the equal of any in the county in productivity. He is an excellent and
							capable farmer, because he really loves his occupation, and for this reason has been
							able to live a contented and at the same time successful life.</p>

						<p>Mr. Lockhart was married in February, 1895, to Mrs. Anna (Rook) Weakley, who was born
							at Phillipsburg, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Amos D. and Margery (Currey) Rook. Her
							parents came to Hendricks county after the close of the Civil War, and after a
							temporary stop in Putnam county, near Roachdale, this state, they permanently located
							in this county near Montclair. The Rook family moved to Kansas some years after they
							came to this county, where they lived for a short time, and while in that state, in
							1884, Anna Rook married Thomas Weakley. Mrs. Rook died in 1870 and Mr. Rook survived
							her many years, his death occurring in 1912. Thomas Weakley, the first husband of Mrs.
							Lockhart, was born near Pittsboro, this county, and was a son of Perry and Arthusa
							(Smith) Weakley. When he was nine years of age his parents moved to LaBette county,
							Kansas, when there were only twenty-six white settlers in that county. In 1888, five
							years after he and Anna Rook were married, he came back to this county and died a year
							later, leaving his widow and two sons. Claude and Paul. Claude married Pearl Baggs, of
							Edelstein. Illinois, and lives on the old Lockhart farm one mile south of North Salem.
							Paul is living with his mother in North Salem at the present time. To Mr. and Mrs.
							Lockhart was born a daughter, Bertha Clare, who was born near North Salem, and who
							remains at home and is attending school.</p>

						<p>After Mr. Lockhart was married in 1891, they lived on a farm near Montclair until
							1903, when they moved to a farm one mile south of North Salem, which he had previously
							purchased. In 1907 Mr. Lockhart purchased a home in North Salem, where he lived until
							his death. Mr. Lockhart was a life-long Republican, althought he never aspired to any
							office at the hands of his party. He and his wife were both members of the Christian
							church <pb id="VAC1000-838" n="775"/> and gave it their earnest and consistent
							support. At the time of his death Mr. Lockhart owned one hundred and eighty-four acres
							of land and three acres in North Salem.</p>

						<p>The community lost one of its best citizens when Mr. Lockhart passed away. He was a
							man of essentially domestic tastes and was usually to be found at home with his
							family. He was a man who was honest and upright in all of his dealings and one who was
							highly respected by all with whom he came into contact. He was a man of modest and
							unassuming demeanor, a fine type of the reliable, self-made American, a friend to the
							poor, and a man who united with his neighbors in every good work.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">HON. SAMUEL H. ELROD.</hi></head>

						<p>True biography has a more noble purpose than mere fulsome eulogy. The historic
							spirit, faithful to the record; the discerning judgment, unmoved by prejudice and
							uncolored by enthusiasm, are as essential in giving the life of the individual as in
							writing the history of a people. Indeed, the ingenuousness of the former picture is
							even more vital, because the individual is the national unit, and if the unit be
							justly estimated the complex organism will become correspondingly intelligible. The
							world today is what its leading men have made it. This is especially true of those
							whose influence has passed beyond the confines of locality and permeated the larger
							life of a state.</p>

						<p>Indiana has been the birthplace and early home of many men who have gained honor and
							distinction in the newer states of our great West. Of this number, notable mention is
							due Hon. Samuel H. Elrod, former governor of South Dakota, recognized today as one of
							the strong and noble characters of that great commonwealth. A man of superior ability
							and great usefulness, a citizen representative of the utmost loyalty to every
							obligation of citizenship, he has given much to aid and sustain the civic and material
							prosperity of his adopted state, and his name is enshrined in the hearts of the people
							of South Dakota as one who has always given of his best.</p>

						<p>Samuel H. Elrod was born in Clay township, Hendricks county, Indiana, May I, 1856, a
							son of Jesse F. and Lydia (Pursel) Elrod. Jesse F. Elrod was born in Stokes county,
							North Carolina, from which county came many of the early settlers of Hendricks county,
							Indiana, and about 1836 he came to Indiana, settling in Clay township, this county.
							Lydia Pursel was a native of <pb id="VAC1000-839" n="776"/> Marion county, Indiana,
							born on Fall creek, now almost within the limits of Indianapolis. Both parents are now
							deceased.</p>

						<p>Samuel H. Elrod was born on the farm, his father being a pioneer farmer. As a boy he
							was inured to hard work and had little opportunities for acquiring an education. At
							the age of twenty, however, he entered DePauw University at Greencastle, and "worked
							his way" through the university course, earning the necessary money by doing janitor
							and other work. He also studied law while at DePauw. He graduated from the university
							in 1882, and went to South Dakota the same year. He went to Clark, that state, on a
							construction train, to make his home there when there was not a dwelling on the town
							site. He was admitted to practice law in South Dakota by Judge Kidder, one of the
							pioneer jurists of the state, at Watertown in 1882. He did a large land and law
							business from the outset.</p>

						<p>Taking an active interest in politics, Mr. Elrod was not long in attaining a
							prominent place in the councils of his party, and his fine abilities soon won notable
							recognition from the body politic. He was a member of the first South Dakota
							constitutional convention, and has served five terms as state's attorney for Clark
							county. He also held the office of county judge for one term during territorial days.
							In 1898 he was a candidate at the Republican state convention at Mitchell for the
							nomination for Congress, but was defeated. In 1904 he was nominated by the Republican
							party for governor of South Dakota, and he was triumphantly elected at the ensuing
							election. During this campaign he won the sobriquet, "Honest Sam," an endearing title
							by which he is now known all over the state, and the public prints often speak of him
							as the "Abe Lincoln of South Dakota."</p>

						<p>As chief executive, Governor Elrod measured up to the stature of any predecessor in
							all that concerned purity and strength of administration. There was never a period in
							his illustrious career when his mental equipment was not recognized by friend and foe
							alike as of a superior order. None ever failed to credit him with high moral purpose,
							true nobility of character, sterling sense of justice, able and comprehensive
							statesmanship and firm adherence to the loftiest of political, social and business
							ideals. The almost unanimous concession to his worth disarmed the temporary
							determination due to partisan exigency, for there was none who could debauch his
							integrity or swerve his independence. His judgments found respect without reference to
							party predilections. Reared as a farmer boy, it was but natural that his sympathies
							should be with the agricultural interests of his state, and no executive perhaps did
							more for the farmers of South Dakota than Governor Elrod. The <hi rend="i">Dakota
								Farmer</hi> pays this splendid tribute to him: <pb id="VAC1000-840" n="777"/>
							<q>"From the moment Governor S. H. Elrod was sworn in as the chief executive of South
								Dakota, in season and out of season, he has stood by every measure that would
								possibly benefit the agriculturists of his state. Before in these columns we have
								enumerated not less than half a dozen distinctively agricultural and live stock
								measures that had his constant support during the last session of the Legislature, a
								number of which, we believe, could never have become laws without it, and now we
								must record one more, and in our estimation, among his crowning achievements in this
								line. We refer to the securing of what was known as the 'Fishback quarter' of one
								hundred and sixty acres of splendid land for the agricultural college and experiment
								station at Brookings. This splendid piece of land, as many know, was literally
								located in the very heart of the farm school grounds. It came up to the very doors
								of the college buildings on two sides, and was not only in every way perfectly
								adapted to the work and needs of the school, but was fast advancing in price and
								being clamored for by many far-sighted investors to be laid out in building lots.
								Much more than the price given could have been had for it for this purpose. The
								troubles relating to getting title to this land are too complicated to explain. It
								is enough to say that repeatedly, during the long-drawn-out time, this title was in
								jeopardy, the timely and personal interference of the governor saved it from going
								from the state forever."</q></p>

						<p>Governor Elrod did not disappoint any intelligent opinion of his exceptional
							qualities of head and heart by retirement from public life, but, on the contrary, has
							continued to add to acquired esteem by a constant display of ability and usefulness
							which is continually recognized and appreciated. He returned to the practice of his
							profession. and is now actively engaged therein at Clark, South Dakota. In the
							practice of law he has achieved an enviable reputation. Years of conscientious work
							have brought with them not only increase of patronage, but also that growth in legal
							knowledge and that wise and accurate judgment the possession of which constitutes
							marked excellence in the profession.</p>

						<p>Samuel H. Elrod is a plain man, a man of that plain and noble class that constitutes
							the creative capacity and the true manliness and worth of a community. He loves South
							Dakota, and is very optimistic regarding the future of his adopted state. In his
							little home city of Clark he is peculiarly active in every movement having for its
							object the moral and material betterment of the community, and here it is that he is
							revered with a sentiment akin to idolatry. He has been a member of the Methodist
							Episcopal church for many years, and is a member of the official board of this
							denomination at Clark. He has never used liquor or tobacco in any form.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-841" n="778"/>

						<p>Mr. Elrod married Mary Ellen Masten, who also was a native of Hendricks county,
							Indiana, being born near Coatesville. They have two children, Barbara and Arthur, the
							latter named for ex-Governor Arthur C. Mellette, who was always a warm friend and
							patron of Mr. Elrod.</p>

						<p>Fealty to facts in the analyzation of the character of a citizen of the type of

							those who have at heart the good name of the community, because it is the honorable
							reputation of the man of standing and affairs, more than any other consideration, that
							gives character and stability to the body politic and makes the true glory of a city
							or state revered at home and respected abroad. In the broad light which things of good
							repute ever invite, the name and character of Mr. Carter stand revealed and secure
							and, though of modest demeanor, with no ambition to distinguish himself in public
							position or as a leader of men, his career has been signally honorable and it may be
							studied with profit by the youth entering upon his life work.</p>

						<p>Eleazar B. Carter, one amongst the oldest farmers of the county, was born fifth month
							30, 1844, in the county where he has spent his entire life. His parents were Samuel
							and Susanna (Bales) Carter, his father being a native of North Carolina, his birth
							having occurred ninth month 26, 1817, while his mother was a native of this county,
							born second month 18, 1822. Samuel Carter came to this state from Carolina when he was
							a lad of six years, his parents locating on a farm south of Plainfield. On his farm,
							which his father entered from the government, Samuel Carter was reared and received
							his meager education in the subscription schools of that period. Upon his marriage,
							tenth month 22, 1840, he moved to Liberty township on a farm of eighty acres which has
							father gave him and remained there until his death, which occurred twelfth month 15,
							1876, his wife surviving him several years, her death occurring on fourth month 4,
							1885. Samuel Carter married Susanna Bales, the daughter of Eleazar and Ann (Millikan)
							Bale. on tenth month 22, 1840, and to this union there were born nine children: Ira,
							born second month 7, 1842, died seventh month 15, 1864; Eleazar B., born fifth month
							30, 1844; Asenath, born eleventh month 7, 1845, who married Cuthbert Osborn; Jonathan,
							born seventh-month 8, 1848, who first married Sybil Osborne, and after her death,
							Levina Coffin, and for his third wife, <pb id="VAC1000-842" n="779"/> he married
							Sidney Sacre; Evan, born first month 29, 1851, who married Sarah J. Weasner; Alvin,
							born seventh month 13, 1854, died eleventh month 5, 1862; Nathan S., born ninth month
							22, 1857, married Martha Hodson; Dayton H., born eighth month 19, 1861, died fifth
							month 31, 1906; Elva, born first month 14, 1866, married Louis Stokes.</p>

						<p>Eleazar B. Carter received the best education which was accorded by the old-fashioned
							subscription schools of his day, and at an early age began to help his father on the
							home farm. He remained on the home farm until his marriage, which occurred ninth month
							18, 1869, and then rented a farm for the first five years of his married life. At the
							end of that time he had saved enough money to buy the farm on which he is now living.
							As a farmer he is wide-awake and thoroughly up-to-date in all the latest improved
							methods of agriculture. He keeps himself well informed on the best ideas pertaining to
							scientific farming and is recognized as a farmer of more than ordinary ability. He
							divides his attention judiciously between grain and stock raising and has been
							uniformly successful as a stock breeder and raiser.</p>

						<p>Mr. Carter was married ninth month 18, 1869, to Mary Ellen Nichols, the daughter of
							Erasmus and Elizabeth (Stanley) Nichols, and to this union there has been born one
							child, Luella, who married William B. Newlin. Mrs. Carter's parents were old settlers
							in Hendricks county, her father, Erasmus Nichols, being born in Pennsylvania, but came
							to Nelson county, Kentucky, when he was about three years of age with his parents,
							where he remained until 1821, when his parents removed to Indiana and located in
							Hendricks county. As a young man Erasmus helped to clear the ground which is now
							occupied by the county court house at Danville. He was married ninth month 8, 1825, to
							Elizabeth Stanley, whose birth occurred in Virginia, but who emigrated to this state
							with her parents when a small child. To Mr. and Mrs. Erasmus Nichols were born
							fourteen children: Thomas, born fifth month 26, 1826, who married Jane Brown. deceased

							and died fourth month 4, 1885.</p>

						<p>Eleazar B. Carter has been a Republican since reaching his majority and has never
							seen any valid reason why he should leave his party for that of any other. He remained
							true to the old party in 1912, when thousands saw fit to change their allegiance to
							the new Progressive party. In his church relations he has been a life-long member of
							the Friends church. He is financially interested in the First National Bank, of Amo,
							and is now a director in that institution. Mr. Carter has lived a simple, honest and
							unostentatious life, doing good wherever he could, speaking kindly of his neighbors,
							charitable to the faults of others, and his whole career has been of such a nature as

						<head><hi rend="section">WILLIAM W. GORE.</hi></head>

						<p>Dependent very largely upon his own resources from his early youth, William W. Gore,
							of Brown township, has attained no insignificant success, and though he may have, like
							most men of affairs, encountered obstacles and met with reverses, he has pressed
							steadily forward, ever willing to work for the end he has in view. His tenacity and
							fortitude are due, no doubt, in a large measure to the worthy traits inherited from
							his sterling ancestors, whose high ideals and worthy principles he has ever sought to
							perpetuate in all the relations of life.</p>

						<p>William W. Gore was born near Shelbyville, Shebly county, Indiana, October 10, 1864,
							the son of Silas and Sarah (Barnes) Gore, both natives of Virginia, being brought by
							their parents to Indiana while still quite small. Sarah Barnes' parents entered land
							from the government in Shelby county and lived there the remainder of their lives.
							Silas Gore's parents died while he was still quite young and as he grew older he took
							up the carpenter's trade and was the leading carpenter in Shelby and Rush counties
							until about 1874. Building a house or barn was in those days a far more laborious task
							than it is today and when he took a contract for a building, it meant that he had to
								<pb id="VAC1000-844" n="781"/> prepare the timbers used in same. As saw-mills were
							not then in use, he would go out into the woods, select his trees, fell them and hew
							out all of the required boards, rafters, sills, etc. This was naturally a very slow
							process and he considered he had done well when he built two buildings a year. He was
							married when twenty-five years old and to him and his wife were born fourteen
							children. In 1874 he moved to North Manchester, Indiana, and established a tile
							manufacturing business. At the end of five years he sold this factory and moved to
							Howard county, this state, where he built another tile factory near Greentown. This he
							operated for some four years, when he came to Hendricks county and built another
							factory about a mile and a half east of Brownsburg. While the family resided in this
							county the mother died, and three years after coming here Mr. Gore took his family
							back to Howard county, where he purchased a small piece of land and retired from
							active business. There he passed the remainder of his life.</p>

						<p>William W. Gore remained under the parental roof until the time of his marriage, on
							November 7, 1884, to Rosie Moore, who was born December 8, 1861, near Avon, Indiana.
							She was a daughter of George W. and Sarah Jane (Williams) Moore, both of whom were
							originally from Chillicothe, Ohio, being brought here by their respective parents
							while they were still young, unmarried people. Both families settled near Avon. Rosie
							Moore was one of a family of fourteen children and remained at home until the time of
							her marriage to the subject. Sarah Jane Williams, mother of Mrs. Gore, was a daughter
							of Ezekiel and Sally Williams.</p>

						<p>After his marriage, for eight years Mr. Gore worked on a farm by the day. Six years
							of this time was for one man. He then rented an eighty-acre farm four miles northeast
							of Brownsburg and lived there three years. He later rented seventy-two acres north of
							Brownsburg, where he lived one year and then contracted for the renting of a
							hundred-acre tract about five miles northeast of Brownsburg. Here he resided for
							eleven years. He then was able to purchase a ninety-two-acre tract directly across the
							public highway from the Lawler school house, where the family now lives. To Mr. and
							Mrs. Gore have been born three sons, Oscar, Atlas and Roy, all of whom are still at
							home. Mr. Gore is considered one of the up-to-date farmers of the township and, while
							he raises excellent crops, he does not specialize in any particular line nor raise any
							fancy stock for selling, yet he always has quite a quantity for marketing. By his own
							unfailing energy and determination to succeed, Mr. Gore has mastered the obstacles
							that confronted him and has won an excellent degree of success, at the same time so
							ordering his life as to win <pb id="VAC1000-845" n="782"/> the confidence and respect
							of all who know him. He is a stanch supporter of the Democratic party and takes an
							active interest in that party's affairs, having served as road supervisor for two

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN WESLEY HUNT.</hi></head>

						<p>The late John Wesley Hunt, of Eel River township, this county, who, many years ago,
							passed on to the silent land, was a man whose name is enrolled very high on the list
							of honored and worthy citizens of a past generaton in this county. He was a man who
							made a persistent effort to lead a life in every respect in harmony with the higher
							rules of ethics and established morality, and, being industrious and public spirited,
							he did a great deal for the general good of the community honored by his citizenship.
							When he passed away he left what is much more to be desired, a good name and an
							untarnished reputation. He was one of the many gallant boys in blue who went from
							Hendricks county to fight for the country's flag, and in that struggle he contracted a
							disease which ultimately caused his death. It is a pleasure to record the life history
							of a man such as Mr. Hunt, a man whose fine character and generous qualities of mind
							and heart won for him a high place among the men of his generation.</p>

						<p>John Wesley Hunt was born near North Salem, Hendricks county, in 1838, and died in
							1892 on the farm where he was born. His parents were Johnson and Louisa (Davis) Hunt.
							Johnson Hunt was born in 1816 in Kentucky, near Mt. Sterling, and came to this county
							when he was sixteen years of age. The Johnsons in Kentucky were slave owners and up to
							the time when he came to this county Johnson had never performed any manual labor.
							However. upon coming here, he at once became imbued with the spirit of work, and
							during his long life in this county there was no man who was more industrious and
							attended more strictly to his own duties than Johnson Hunt. Shortly after coming to
							this county he married Louisa Davis, the daughter of Nathan Davis, and his first wife,
							whose genealogy is presented elsewhere in this volume in the sketch of Quincy A.
							Davis. Upon his marriage Johnson Hunt bought a farm north of North Salem and started
							in to <pb id="VAC1000-846" n="783"/> carve out his fortune in the virgin wilderness.
							He added to his holdings from time to time, until at his death, on September 15, 1876,
							he was the owner of three hundred and twenty acres of land in this township. His wife
							died June 25, 1866.</p>

						<p>John Wesley Hunt grew to manhood on the home farm and upon the outbreak of the Civil
							war he enlisted in 1861 in the Fifty-first Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and in
							six months after his enlistment he was taken sick and for a long time was unable to be
							on duty, being finally honorably discharged because of total disability. He returned
							to this county and in 1866 married Nancy Davis, a native of this county and the
							daughter of Jesse and Minerva (Zimmerman) Davis.</p>

						<p>Jesse Davis was born near Mt. Sterling, Kentucky, the son of Enoch and Nancy (Hart)
							Davis. Enoch Davis and his family came to Hendricks county, Indiana, in pioneer times
							and settled two miles northwest of North Salem. Their first home was nothing but a
							rude log cabin, with dirt floor, pole bed and a stick-and-mud chimney, and their
							household possessions consisted of one skillet and one kettle. Practically everything
							they used they made themselves. They ground their own meal, spun the cloth and made
							their own clothes, were their own doctors, teachers, nurses and, in fact, were
							practically a community unto themselves for some years. Minerva Zimmerman was born in
							Montgomery county, Kentucky, and was the daughter of John and Nancy (Myers) Zimmerman.
							John and Nancy Zimmerman were the parents of fifteen children and were among the first
							settlers in Eel River township, where they entered government land. Each one of the
							children received a farm on which to start a home and all of them became the heads of
							families whose descendants are still among the best known people in the county. Jesse
							Davis was a life-long farmer and a man who was well worthy the respect of his
							nieghbors. He and his wife were both devout members of the Christian church.</p>

						<p>After the marriage of John W. Hunt, he operated a saw-mill for three years in the
							northeastern part of Eel River township, on land which Jesse Davis had entered, after
							which time he discontinued the operation of the mill and sold the land and moved to
							the farm now occupied by Grant Sellers, west of North Salem. About 1887 he built a
							beautiful and attractive residence there and remained on that farm until late in life.
							For the last ten years of his life he was in poor health, but still remained on the
							farm until his death, in 1892.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hunt were the parents of four children: Ada Catherine, the wife of Grant
							Sellers, who now lives on the old home farm in the house <pb id="VAC1000-847" n="784"
							/> built by her father, and they have two children, Benjamin Franklin and Rhoda
							Catherine; Ewell Emmett, born January 24, 1875, has lived on the home place all his
							life and now owns sixty-seven acres of the home place. He and his mother have lived
							together since the death of his father. He is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons
							and is also an earnest member of the Christian church. He has allied himself with the
							new Progressive party. The other two children are deceased, one being a twin brother
							of Ewell E., who died in infancy, while Lena Ann died at the age of seventeen
							years.</p>

						<p>Politically, Mr. Hunt was a stanch Republican and was always active in the councils
							of his party, although he never held any office. He was a member of the Free and
							Accepted Masons, and he and his wife were both devout members of the Christian church.
							The people of this county of a past generation remember John W. Hunt as a man of
							irreproachable character and one who was always ready to accommodate anyone and ready
							to help those who were in need and distress. He was the architect of his own fortune
							and upon his entire career there rests no blemish, for he was true to the highest
							ideals and principles in life. He lived and labored to worthy ends and as one of the
							sterling citizens and representative men of Hendricks county in the generations that
							are now numbered with the irrevocable past his memory merits a tribute of honor on
							these pages.</p>

						<p>Success in this life most always comes to the deserving. It is an axiom demonstrated
							by all human experience that a man gets out of this life what he puts into it, plus a
							reasonable interest on the investment. The present age is essentially utilitarian and
							the life of every successful man carries a lesson which, told in contemporary
							narrative, is productive of much good in shaping the destiny of others. There is,
							therefore, a due measure of satisfaction in presenting, even in brief resume, the life
							and achievements of such men and in preparing the following sketch of the well-known
							dentist of Brownsburg the biographer is sensible of the pleasure of his task,
							especially in view of the fact that the subject has given some of the best years of
							his life to his love of country and has received from a grateful nation a tribute of
							acknowledgment of services rendered.</p>

							L. (Baker) Hill. John C. Hill was a farmer in LaGrange county for many years and was
							following this vocation at the time of his death, which occurred April 4, 1907. His
							wife died April 30, 1914. Doctor Hill lived on the home farm when a boy, attending the
							district schools of their locality and later attended the high school at LaGrange. The
							last two years of his high school course he studied at a town in Illinois where he had
							a brother-in-law instructor in the school. After finishing his high school course he
							returned to his home and enlisted in the United States navy, where he spent four
							years, serving on seven or eight different ships, and in this way travelled to all
							parts of the world. He was with the United States Ship "Bennington" in 1905 when, in
							the harbor at San Diego, California, her boilers exploded and seventy-seven men, more
							than half of her crew, were killed outright. Sixty-six of the victims were buried in
							one grave. At the time of the explosion, Mr. Hill was connected with the commissary
							department and was himself on the sick list. At the very instant the explosion
							occurred, he was in the act of coming up the stairs from the sick bay and as a result
							of escaping steam and flying debris his eyes were injured so as to seriously impair
							his sight for some time. He also had two toes so badly scalded that it was necessary
							to amputate them, but, despite his injuries, he immediately returned to the hold and
							assisted in rescuing injured men from alley-ways, engine rooms and compartments, right
							in the midst of the scalding steam. Two men fell dead right at his feet and today,
							after the lapse of so many years, he still suffers from the nervous shock of that
							trying ordeal. On two occasions on regaining the deck with injured men he fell in a
							dead faint, resuming his labors as soon as consciousness returned and keeping at his
							task as long as it was necessary. In recognition of the endurance and bravery he
							displayed on that occasion, the government has awarded him a medal, which takes the
							form of a bronze star pendant and was made at a United States mint. On the reverse
							side is the following inscription: "For extraordinary heroism displayed at the time of
							the explosion of a boiler of the U. S. S. 'Bennington' at San Diego, California, July
							21, 1905." Doctor Hill, in addition to the medal above mentioned, was also given one
							hundred dollars in money and a button of the Legion of Honor, the latter being awarded
							only for the saving of human life. During his service in the navy, he accumulated many
							curios and mementoes from foreign lands and has many interesting and thrilling
							experiences to relate. On many occasions he displayed marked bravery and inasmuch as
							he is the son of a veteran of the Civil War, this trait may be unusually strong in
							him. His father served <pb id="VAC1000-850" n="786"/> for three years and ten months
							as sergeant of Company H, Forty-fourth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, passing
							through many serious conflicts, the evidences of which he bore on his body to his
							dying day. He was an active member of the Grand Army of the Republic.</p>

						<p>A short time after the explosion at San Diego, Doctor Hill's term of enlistment in
							the navy expired and he returned to his home. In 1906 he matriculated at the Indiana
							Dental College at Indianapolis, from which he was graduated in 1909. He immediately
							after graduation came to Brownsburg where he engaged in the practice of his chosen
							profession and has resided here since. In 1908 he was united in marriage with Lulu C.
							Wilson, who was born at Bloomington, Indiana, a daughter of Samuel S. and Serepta
							Wilson. Her parents now reside near Center Point, Clay county, this state, where her
							father is engaged in farming.</p>

						<p>Doctor Hill has made rapid strides in his profession and has the distinction of being
							the only dentist in Brownsburg and vicinity. He holds his fraternal affiliations with
							the time-honored body of Free and Accepted Masons, in which he has attained the fifth
							degree. He is also a member of the Knights of Pythias and the Knights of the Macabees.
							While he is not a member of any church, Mrs. Hill belongs to the Christian church and
							in the welfare of that church Doctor Hill is interested. In the public life of the
							community where he resides, Doctor Hill takes an intelligent interest. He is a man of
							strong character and marked ability and because of these elements and his genuine
							personal worth, he enjoys a marked popularity in the locality honored by his
							residence.</p>

						<p>The life of John Milton Smith has been characterized by public-spirited and generous
							acts. Honesty and steadfastness of purpose have marked his career throughout and his
							many friends regard him as one of the most intelligent and progressive citizens of
							Hendricks county. He has always exercised an influence for the general good of his
							community, and, although meeting with many discouragements and obstacles along his
							pathway, his optimistic nature has never forsaken him. He was not favored by inherited
							wealth or the assistance of influential friends, but in spite of this he has, by his
							perseverance, industry and wise economy, attained a comfortable station in life.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-851" n="787"/>

						<p>John Milton Smith, the son of Jacob and Margaret (Cooper) Smith, was born in Boone
							county, Indiana, October 20, 1867. Jacob Smith was born in Hendricks county in 1840
							and was the son of Reuben and Melinda (Turpin) Smith. Reuben Smith was one of the
							earliest settlers of Boone county, but at the time when Jacob was born he was living
							in Hendricks county. Melinda Turpin was born in this county southeast of Brownsburg
							and was the daughter of Jacob Turpin, who was among the earliest pioneers of the
							county. The Turpins came to this county from Scott county, Kentucky. When Jacob Smith
							was three years of age his parents settled southeast of Lebanon, in Boone county, and
							there the family home was maintained until the death of Jacob Smith, on October 19,
							1913. Margaret Cooper, the wife of Jacob Smith, was born and reared in Marion county,
							the daughter of Samuel and Elizabeth (Moore) Cooper. Samuel Cooper and his wife came
							to Marion county from Ohio, making the overland trip on horseback and carrying one
							small child with them. Samuel Cooper became one of the first settlers of Marion
							county. For some years after settling there they were greatly annoyed by the thieving
							of the Indians. One day Mr. Cooper took his gun and threatened to shoot the first
							Indian he saw around his house, and the result was that there was no more thieving on
							his property.</p>

						<p>Jacob Smith, father of him whose history is here recorded, was a worthy man in every
							respect; a soldier of the Civil War, serving in the Seventy-ninth Regiment Indiana
							Volunteer Infantry, as a fifer; an active member of the Baptist church, and a man who
							was highly respected by every one who knew him. His widow is still living in Boone
							county, this state.</p>

						<p>John Milton Smith received his education in the schools of Boone county and remained
							on the home farm until 1889. He then came to North Salem, this county, and engaged in
							the dry goods and grocery business in partnership with Elijah Shirley. Two years later
							he sold out his interest in this store and spent a year in Terre Haute, Indiana, and
							Vandalia, Illinois, after which he returned to North Salem and worked for two years in
							a grocery store. He and his brother-in-law, John W. Lackey, then formed a partnership
							and engaged in the grocery business again in North Salem for the next four years. Mr.
							Smith then sold out his interests and for the next five years engaged in agricultural
							pursuits in this township. He then bought one hundred and seventy-three acres of land
							northeast of North Salem, and three years later sold that farm and bought another
							tract of one hundred and fifty acres northwest of North Salem. His last farm adjoins
							the corporation line of the town.</p>

						<p>Mr. Smith was married on March 3, 1891, to Ona Smith, a native of <pb
								id="VAC1000-852" n="788"/> this county and the daughter of Samuel and Elizabeth
							(Rogers) Smith. Samuel Smith was a native of this county and his wife of Kentucky.
							Samuel Smith was a carpenter by trade and also owned a farm northwest of North Salem;
							his death occurred when Ona, the wife of John M. Smith, was a small girl. Mr. and Mrs.
							John M. Smith are the parents of four children, Fred, Kenneth, Lucile and Nellie, all
							still at home.</p>

						<p>Fraternally, Mr. Smith is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons and takes an
							active interest in the lodge at North Salem. where he is now serving his third term as
							master of the lodge. He and his wife are both devout and faithful members of the

						<p>The commercial world has come to recognize the farmer's importance and has surrounded
							him with many conveniences not thought of fifty or one hundred years ago. The inventor
							has given him the self-binder, the riding plow, the steam thresher and many other
							labor-saving devices. And the tiller of the soil has not been slow to take advantage
							of the improvements thus invented and offered. Among the up-to-date farmers of
							Hendricks county is George Edgar Davenport, of Eel River township, who was born
							February 7, 1874, in the township where he is now residing. the son of George Russell
							and Drusilla (Pennington) Davenport.</p>

						<p>George Davenport's father was a native of this county, and his parents, William and
							Nancy (Dotson) Davenport, were natives of Virginia, who came from that state to
							Indiana shortly after their marriage on horseback and entered land southeast of North
							Salem, in this township. William Davenport died while George R. was a small boy. On
							reaching manhood he married Drusilla Pennington, who was born in this township about
							one and one-half miles northwest of North Salem, the daughter of Hampton and Nancy
							(Dent) Pennington. The Pennington family came from Virginia and entered land in this
							township. Mr. Pennington dying at the early age of forty-two and leaving a large
							family. When the family arrived in this county there were very few settlers here, and
							they had to blaze a trail through the woods in order to get to the land which they had
							entered. He and his good wife built a rude hut around a big rock, and used the rock to
							cook upon. An <pb id="VAC1000-853" n="789"/> interesting instance happened when they
							built their first fire on the rock. It was cool weather and the rattlesnakes had
							collected under the rock, and when the rock became heated they crawled out from
							underneath the stone and Mr. and Mrs. Pennington killed them one by one as they
							emerged from underneath the rock. The widow of Hampton Pennington never remarried, but
							reared her children and lived to the good old age of eighty years.</p>

						<p>After his marriage, George R. Davenport made his home southeast of North Salem, on
							what is known as the Alexander Williams farm. He and his young bride started in
							housekeeping under conditions which would discourage any but the most courageous of
							young couples. They lived in a rude log cabin and their bedstead was made by boring
							holes in the wall and supporting the outer corner by a stake driven in the ground. The
							cooking was all done in the fireplace, of course, and with the rudest of cooking
							utensils. Under such conditions they began their married life and no doubt they were
							just as happy as the young married couples of today, who start under the most
							auspicious circumstances. During the war Mr. Davenport met with severe losses, one of
							the most severe being the paying of a note on which he had gone security. They lived
							west of North Salem until the death of Mrs. Davenport, in 1898, when they moved to
							Putnam county, this state, and bought the farm near Barnard. There were six children
							by Mr. Davenport's first marriage, five of whom are now living. Some time after the
							death of his first wife, he married again, but the second wife died two years
							later.</p>

						<p>George Edgar Davenport received a good common school education and at the age of
							twenty was married and began to farm with his father. A year later he bought a small
							farm about three miles northwest of North Salem, on which he lived for four or five
							years. He then moved to his father-in-law's farm, where he remained for the next two
							years, and then spent the two following years in the creamery business in Mulberry
							Grove, Bond county, Illinois, after which he returned to Hendricks county and bought
							forty-six acres west of North Salem and, in 1909, bought his present farm of eighty
							acres two and one-half miles south of North Salem. He now has eighty acres in this
							township. He has very valuable and desirable land and his farm is one of the most
							attractive farms in the township, the improvements embracing everything modern,
							convenient and suitable for up-to-date farming. He has paid particular attention to
							the raising of cattle and hogs and has met with encouraging success in this line of
							agriculture.</p>

						<p>Mr. Davenport was married November 9, 1894, to Cora Page, the daughter of Jeremiah J.
							Page, whose family history is recorded elsewhere in this volume. Mr. and Mrs.

						<p>Though no land is richer in opportunities or offers greater advantages to its
							citizens than America, success is not to be attained through desire, but must be
							persistently sought. In this country "labor is king," and the man who resolutely sets
							to work to accomplish a given purpose is certain of success if he has but the
							qualities of perseverance, untiring energy and practical common sense. One of the
							worthy citizens of Hendricks county who, through diligence and persistent efforts, has
							attained definite success and has won the respect of all who know him through his fair
							dealing with his fellow men is Joseph Lamb, who has spent his whole life in this
							county.</p>

						<p>Joseph Lamb, the son of Joel and Eunice (Lamb) Lamb, was born in 1846 in Marion
							township, this county. His parents were both natives of North Carolina, where they
							were married, and shortly after this event they put all their possessions in a
							one-horse wagon and made the long overland trip from North Carolina to this county.
							They located in Marion township, where they entered forty acres of land from the
							government, but after a year they became discouraged and went to Ohio; but Ohio
							offered no better opportunities, so they returned to Hendricks county, mortgaged their
							forty acres and purchased forty acres more, then, with the thrift and frugality which
							characterized our pioneer forefathers, they started to work to clear the farm and pay
							off their debts. Joel Lamb was a life-long farmer and as the years went by his efforts
							were increasingly successful until at his death he was the owner of two hundred and
							forty acres. Mr. and Mrs. Joel Lamb were the parents of fourteen children, of whom
							seven died in childhood and seven reached maturity. The mother of these children died
							about 1870, and afterward the father went to Kansas. where his death occurred in
							1883.</p>

						<p>Joseph Lamb, one of the seven children of his parents who grew to maturity, remained
							on the home farm until his marriage, at the age of twenty-five, <pb id="VAC1000-855"
								n="791"/> at which time he married Ella Montgomery, a native of Union township, this
							county, and the daughter of James and Rebecca (Tharp) Montgomery. The Montgomery
							family came from Pennsylvania to this county early in its history, settling near
							Lizton.</p>

						<p>Upon his marriage Mr. Lamb began farming on the old home farm, but two years later he
							moved to the eastern part of Eel River township, where he bought eighty acres of land
							where he is now living. In 1886 his house, with all of its contents, was destroyed by
							fire, after which he built the residence in which he is now living. In 1888 his wife
							died, and in the same year his barn, with all of its contents, was destroyed by
							fire.</p>

						<p>Mr. Lamb was married the second time on July 8, 1891, to Carrie E. Gossett, a native
							of Brown township, this county, and the daughter of Thomas A. and Nettie M. (Combs)
							Gossett. Thomas Gossett was born near Plainfield, the son of Nathaniel W. and Mary G.
							Gossett, who were natives of North Carolina. Thomas Gossett was born December 21,
							1841, and was the eldest of a family of five brothers and seven sisters. He began
							teaching in the public schools in 1860 and, with the exception of the four years which
							he spent in the Civil War, he was engaged in public school work until February, 1899.
							Six years of this time he spent as county superintendent of the Hendricks county
							schools.</p>

						<p>Mr. Gossett had a very interesting and at the same time a most harrowing experience
							during his four years' service in the Civil War. He enlisted in August, 1861, in
							Company I, Seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and during fifteen months of
							the four years he was incarcerated in five different prisons, Lynchburg, Belle Isle,
							Richmond, Virginia, Andersonville and Milan, Georgia. In the latter prison he
							contracted scurvy and his legs had to buried in the ground up to the trunk of his body
							in order to give him relief and to keep them from rotting off. The disease never left
							him until his death, and he was a constant sufferer from it. In May, 1898, one of his
							feet had to be amputated, and in April, 1899, he finally died, having made a life-long
							fight against the disease. He was a good man in every sense of the word and was
							responsive to all of the Christian virtues. He was a good soldier, both physically and
							spiritually, and fought a brave fight for over fifty years.</p>

						<p>The second wife of Mr. Lamb is a woman of great refinement and culture and before her
							marriage she attended the State Normal School at Terre Haute and was a teacher for
							three years. Mr. and Mrs. Lamb are the parents of four children, Loren W., Roy R.,

							age of nine with his parents and lived in a fort at Harrodsburg for a year or so
							because of the Indian troubles. Mary M. Fields was descended from Irish ancestry, her
							grandfather coming from Ireland to this country in an early day. John and Mary Durham
							came from Kentucky to Montgomery county, Indiana, in 1835, locating near Waveland. The
							grandfather of John Durham came also and entered a large amount of government land and
							gave a farm to each one of his children, on which to start in life.</p>

						<p>John Durham grew up in this new environment and lived at home until his marriage,
							which occurred on December 22, 1865, to Lee A. Tucker, a native of this county and the
							daughter of Lee and Miranda (Durham) Tucker. His wife is a grandmother of Nathan and
							David Tucker, whose history may be found elsewhere in this volume. Miranda Durham was
							born in Boyle county, Kentucky, the daughter of Thomas Durham, her father being a
							distant relative of John Durham.</p>

						<p>After Mr. Durham's marriage, in 1865, he came to Eel River township, <pb
								id="VAC1000-857" n="793"/> this county, and began farming about half-way between
							Jamestown and North Salem, where he remained from December, 1865, until the fall of
							1913, a period of forty-eight years. During his long career as a farmer he has seen
							many ups and downs and has encountered obstacles of all kinds, and yet has maintained
							his cheerful disposition through it all. Success has crowned his efforts and today he
							is the owner of five hundred and twenty acres of fine farming land in this township.
							However, recently he has given away all of this land but one hundred and eighty acres,
							dividing it among his children.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Durham were the parents of seven children: Charles Omer, physician and
							now coroner of Marion county, Indiana, who married Mary Maley, and has one daughter,
							Frances; Frank C., deceased, who was a lawyer in Indianapolis for a time and later in
							Chicago, and died in the latter city in 1909; John L., who is on the old home farm
							north of North Salem, is married to Adeline Clark and they have two children, Glenn
							and Walter; Clarence S. is in Missouri; Harry C. and Thomas G. both live at North
							Salem and are engaged in farming, while Mary F. is at home with her father. The mother
							of these children died in 1911.</p>

						<p>Mr. Durham has been a life-long Democrat and has always taken an intelligent interest
							in public affairs. He has twice been elected as trustee of Eel River township, his
							last term ending in 1883. He has always kept in touch with the times and the trend of
							current thought, and has always discharged the duties of citizenship in the
							intelligent manner becoming the level-headed American citizen of today. He has taken a
							deep interest in whatever makes for the material advancement of the community and
							endorses all worthy enterprises whereby his fellow men will be benefited and made
							better.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">OLIVER PERRY OWEN.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the thriving agriculturists and stock men of Hendricks county, Indiana, Oliver
							Perry Owen has been especially conspicuous for many years. Few men of his experience
							have achieved such marked results, none occupy a more prominent place in the
							confidence and esteem of his fellow men, and it is safe to presume that his example
							and influence have done as much to promote the general interests of the locality as
							any other agency in the vicinity of North Salem, where he maintains his beautiful
							home.</p>

						<p>Oliver Perry Owen, a stock man and farmer living one and one-half miles northwest of
							North Salem, was born December 23, 1855, in the <pb id="VAC1000-858" n="794"/>
							north-western part of Eel River township, in this county. His parents, Horatio and
							Margaret( Sears) Owen, were both natives of Clark county, Kentucky, where they lived
							until after their marriage and removal to this county in 1833, when they entered one
							hundred and sixty acres of government land in the north-western part of Eel River
							township, where they lived until 1867. They made the trip from their native state to
							this county in a wagon and began life under truly pioneer conditions. Horatio Owen
							sold his farm and moved about one and one-half miles northwest of North Salem, where
							he bought another tract of one hundred and sixty acres. Being a man of thrift and
							economy, he was enabled a few years later to add eighty acres more to this farm and at
							the time of his death, April 4, 1881, he was the owner of two hundred and forty acres
							of well-improved land in this township. His wife died February 11, 1888. Mr. and Mrs.
							Horatio Owen were the parents of nine children, two of whom died in infancy; Hamilton
							died in 1867, at the age of twenty-two years; William died at the age of thirty-two,
							leaving a widow and one son: Elizabeth, who died in the seventies, was the wife of
							James McCloud; Rebecca was the wife of Joseph Camplin and died in September, 1881;
							Keziah died in 1906 and was unmarried. The other two are James M. and Oliver P., and
							these are the only two of the original nine children who are living at the present
							time.</p>

						<p>Oliver Perry Owen remained on the home farm until his marriage, which occurred on
							November 21, 1880, when he was united to Florence M. Duckworth, a native of this
							township and the daughter of James J. and Mary E. (Mark) Duckworth. James J. Duckworth
							was a native of Kentucky and, after his father's death in that state, came with his
							mother to Indiana, settling near North Salem, this county. Here he married Mary E.
							Mark, and engaged in farming until about 1879, when he moved into North Salem, but
							continued to manage his farm. His wife died in 1877, and his death occurred on January
							3, 1911. He was a Mason and a devout Methodist, while his wife belonged to the
							Christian church.</p>

						<p>After his marriage, Oliver P. Owen began farming on the place where he now lives,
							about one and one-half miles northwest of North Salem, and has continued to reside
							here until the present time. He started in life with one hundred and thirty acres of
							land and has since added ninety-seven acres more to his homestead, which is a very
							productive and desirable farm, on which stands an attractive and comfortable home and
							substantial and convenient outbuildings. In connection with general farming he raises
							various kinds of live stock, in which he has been very succcessful, and is deserving
							of a great deal of credit for what he has accomplished, for it has been done in an
							honest manner, through hard work and skillful management.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-859" n="795"/>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Owen are the parents of four children: Taylor W., who married Edna Clay,
							lives in North Salem; Logan married Jennie Tucker and lives on a farm one mile north
							of North Salem; Maggie died at the age of eleven months; Ruth is at home with her
							parents. Mr. Owen is a hard worker, a man of rare foresight and business ability, and
							has prospered from year to year and thus developed one of the best farms in the
							township. He has been instrumental in the upbuilding of his community and is well
							known and highly respected throughout this part of the county.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">PLEASANT A. HACKLEMAN.</hi></head>

						<p>The Hackleman family is one of the pioneer families of Indiana, the first
							representative of the family who came to Indiana being Abram Hackleman, who came to
							Indiana before it was admitted to the Union in 1816. The first members of the family
							lived in Rush county, Indiana, and later in Hancock county. The various members of the
							family have taken an active part in the community life wherever they have settled and
							have always been numbered among the substantial citizens of their respective
							communities.</p>

						<p>Pleasant Alvie Hackleman, the son of Abram and Martha (Manwaring) Hackleman, was born
							October 30, 1873, in Rush county, Indiana. Abram Hackleman was born in Rush county,
							Indiana, September 6, 1835, the son of Richard and Hannah (McCune) Hackleman. Richard
							Hackleman was a native of South Carolina, the son of Abram Hackleman, and came with
							his parents to Rush county, this state, when a small boy, and when he was grown
							Rushville contained only three houses. He was a tax collector in the early history of
							the state, and rode on horseback from house to house collecting the taxes. He was a
							lifelong farmer and in the early history of the state ran a small grist-mill in the
							central part of Rush county. In the latter part of the thirties Richard Hackleman
							moved to Hancock county, Indiana, and bought a farm, living there the remainder of his
							life. He took a great interest in public affairs and served twenty-one years as
							justice of the peace, retiring from that office against the wishes of his neighbors.
							Hannah McCune, the wife of Richard Hackleman, was born in Pennsylvania, and came to
							Franklin county, Indiana, with her parents, where she lived until her marriage.</p>

						<p>Abram Hackleman lived in Hancock county with his parents until he was of age and then
							moved to Rush county, where he followed farming for a few years. Later hie moved back
							to Hancock county and upon his father's <pb id="VAC1000-860" n="796"/> death he bought
							out the heirs of the estate and remained on the old home farm several years. About
							twenty years ago Abram Hackleman moved to Boone county and located two miles west of
							Jamestown, buying two hundred acres in one place and over three hundred in another,
							and is now the owner of over five hundred acres of highly improved land in Hendricks
							and Boone counties.</p>

						<p>Abram Hackleman was married in 1858 to Martha Ann Manwaring, the daughter of Solomon
							Manwaring and his first wife, and was a native of Sullivan county, Indiana. Solomon
							Manwaring was born in Franklin county, Indiana, but lived the most of his life in
							Sullivan county, his first wife dying when Martha was an infant. Three children were
							born to Mr. and Mrs. Abram Hackleman; Rosa Belle, who married Thomas Trotter and died
							in 1908, leaving two children, Lena and Fred; Pleasant A., whose history is here
							recorded, and James Harlan, who lives on his father's farm in Boone county, this
							state, and was married in 1900 to May Burns, of Decatur county, Indiana, and they have
							four children, Velma, Wayne, Grace and Ward. Mrs. Abram Hackleman died in 1902.</p>

						<p>Pleasant A. Hackleman spent the earlier part of his boyhood in Rush county, and later
							removed to Hancock county with his parents, who afterwards moved to Marion county,
							where they remained for a short time, and when he was about twelve years old the
							family moved to the southern part of Boone county, about two miles west of Jamestown,
							where his father has since resided.</p>

						<p>Pleasant A. Hackleman grew to maturity on the home farm and received his education in
							the schools of Rush, Marion and Boone counties, and upon reaching the age of
							twenty-one he was married, on March 2, 1895, to Catherine Robbins, the daughter of
							Benjamin and Dora (Davidson) Robbins. Benjamin S. B. P. Robbins was born in Marion
							township, this county, on December 11, 1836, and was the son of Benjamin and Ruth
							(Parker) Robbins. Benjamin Robbins was born in North Carolina, the son of William and
							Leah (Lamb) Robbins. Ruth Parker was born in North Carolina in 1812, and in that state
							she was married to Benjamin Robbins. After two children were born to them in that
							state, they moved, about 1830, to Ohio, and a year later came to Indiana and entered
							land in Putnam county. Benjamin Robbins was a carpenter by trade, and when he came to
							Putnam county he selected land on which there was water power, and he at once built a
							large mill five stories in height on Eel river, a mile south of Barnard, and after a
							time he hired a miller to operate the mill and he himself went to New Winchester and
							erected a steam saw-mill, living at the latter place from about <pb id="VAC1000-861"
								n="797"/> 1850 until his death in 1858, at the age of forty-seven. His death was
							caused by paralysis. Ruth Parker, the wife of Benjamin Robbins, was the daughter of
							John and Katherine (Parsons) Parker. John Parker was a physician and lived his whole
							life in his native state of North Carolina. Mrs. Ruth (Parker) Robbins died in 1877.
							Benjamin Robbins, Jr., grew up under the parental roof and assisted his father in the
							saw-mill at New Winchester in early life. In 1874 he married Dora Davidson, the
							daughter of Samuel and Rena (Parsons) Davidson, of North Salem. Samuel Davidson was
							born in Kentucky, and came to this state with his parents early in life. His wife was
							a native of North Carolina, who came here with the Robbins family, to whom she was
							related. For a time before his marriage, Benjamin S. B. P. Robbins clerked in a store
							at North Salem, part of the time in a hardware store and the remainder of the time in
							a drug store. After his marriage he farmed for four years, then he and John Fleece
							built a store room and engaged in the hardware business. He managed the store for some
							years and then Mr. Fleece sold out his interest and Mr. Robbins put in a grocery stock
							and conducted a store for about three years, when he sold the building and built a new
							business block. However, he did not engage in business again, but re-entered the
							carpenter trade and has since that time put up a large number of residences and many
							large barns in and around North Salem. He has also farmed to some extent, owning a
							small farm southeast of North Salem. Mr. and Mrs. Robbins are the parents of three
							children, Katherine, Barton and Thomas. Barton is a carpenter and builder of North
							Salem and married Jennie Pace, and has one son, Jack; Thomas lives in Indianapolis and
							is a barber and carpenter. Mrs. Robbins died July 1, 1911, and about three months
							later Mr. Robbins went to live with his son, Barton, at North Salem.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Robbins were both life-long members of the Christian church. After Mr.
							Hackleman was married he went to farming on eighty acres which his father had given
							him on the county line between Boone and Hendricks counties. He has been very
							successful as a farmer and has acquired additional land from time to time and is now
							the owner of over two hundred acres of as fine land as can be found in the state. When
							he went on the farm it was almost bare of improvements, but he has spent a great deal
							of money in making it a model farm. He has built a splendid and attractive home, good
							barns and other outbuildings, ditched and drained it and made it one of the most
							attractive farms in the county.</p>

						<p>Mr. Hackleman has allied himself with the Republican party and takes a deep interest
							in all the political questions of the day. His success in life has not. come about
							without earnest effort on his part and his perseverance and <pb id="VAC1000-862"
								n="798"/> industry have been handsomely rewarded. In addition to his landed
							interests, he holds stock in the Citizens State Bank, of Jamestown. He and his wife
							are members of the Christian church at Jamestown, and he is a deacon in this
							denomination. Mr. and Mrs. Hackleman have two children, Ona Gladys and Nellie
							Marie.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">HORACE GREELEY COOK.</hi></head>

						<p>Life is pleasant to live when you know how to make the most of it. Some people start
							in life as if they had weights on their souls or were afraid to make the necessary
							effort to live up to a high standard. Others, by not making the proper study of the
							conditions of existence, or by not having that blessed trainer, a good and intelligent
							mother, are side-tracked at the outset and never seem thereafter able to get back on
							the main track. Much depends on the start, just as it does in a race. It would seem
							from the large success that has attended the efforts of Horace Greeley Cook, farmer
							and stock man of Hendricks county, that he not only got a proper start on the highway
							of life, but that he has been able to maintain the proper course all the while; but
							those who know him, his methods and innate characteristics, are not at all surprised
							that this is so.</p>

						<p>Horace Greeley Cook, a native of this township, was born November 5, 1853, and is the
							son of Henderson and Nancy J. (Banta) Cook. Henderson Cook was born near Mt. Airy,
							North Carolina, and was the son of <milestone unit="typography" n="-------"/> and
							Edith (Jackson) Cook. Henderson Cook grew to manhood in North Carolina, and when a
							young man came to this county on horseback, and for a short time managed a hotel at
							Belleville. While living at Belleville, he was married to Nancy J. Banta, the daughter
							of Cornelius and Rebecca (Eccles) Banta. Mrs. Cook was a native of Indiana and was
							reared in Hendricks and Ripley counties. After his marriage, Henderson Cook traded in
							live stock and during the Civil War bought horses and mules and sold them to the
							government. In 1872 he moved to a farm northwest of North Salem, which he already
							owned, and lived there until two or three years before his death, when he moved into
							North Salem, where he died in September, 1884. He was a staunch Republican all his
							life and was once nominated by his party for the office of sheriff, but did not care
							enough for the office to make a canvass. His widow now lives at Los Angeles,
							California. Mr. and Mrs. Henderson Cook were the parents of seven children, five of
							whom are living: Mrs. Luella Myers, whose husband is city auditor of Los Angeles,
							California; Mrs. Edith <pb id="VAC1000-863" n="799"/> R. Jones, of San Francisco;
							Edward and Charles M., both of whom live in Los Angeles, California, and Horace
							Greeley, whose history is here presented.</p>

						<p>Horace Greeley Cook remained on the home farm until he was nearly twenty-eight years
							of age. He received a good common school education and later attended the academy at
							Belleville. Upon his marriage, in 1881, he bought forty acres in the northern part of
							Marion township and lived there with his wife's mother for three years. After his
							father's death he moved to his father's farm and remained there until 1900. He then
							bought the farm of one hundred and sixty-three acres which he now owns, three miles
							north of North Salem.</p>

						<p>Mr. Cook was married August 28, 1881, to Hattie Walker, the daughter of David and
							Mary (Robbins) Walker, of Eel River township. David Walker was born June 4, 1828, in
							Virginia and came to this county with his parents when a small boy, they settling on
							what is now the Michael Higgins farm. The parents of David Walker were Goodloe and
							Rebecca (Henderson) Walker. Upon reaching his majority, David Walker married Mary
							Robbins, who was born in Randolph county, North Carolina, and is the daughter of John
							and Lydia (Parsons) Robbins. Lydia (Parsons) Robbins lived to be ninety-five years of
							age. Mary Walker came, with her parents, in early childhood to Ohio and three years
							later came to Indiana, her father entering one hundred and sixty acres of government
							land in Marion township, this county, about 1835, and lived there the remainder of his
							life. After David Walker was married he followed carpentering and contracting and
							lived the most of his life in the southern part of Eel River township. He enlisted in
							Company B, Seventh Regiment of Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and died in a military
							prison in Florence, South Carolina, December 4, 1864, leaving a widow and three
							children living. Mrs. Walker remained on the farm until her children were grown and
							married and in 1872 she married David Jones, an ex-soldier of the Civil War, who died
							less than a year later. Mrs. David Walker Jones now lives with her daughter, Mrs.
							Cook.</p>

						<p>Mr. Cook was allied with the Republican party until 1912, when he united with
							Progressive party, believing that the principles advocated by this new party were
							better suited to the modern conditions of the country. Mr. and Mrs. Cook are the
							parents of two children, Nellie and Edith. Nellie is the wife of Roy M. Sharp and
							lives four miles east of Ladoga on a farm; she has one daughter, Hariett Catherine.
							Edith is still at home with her parents. The one son born to Mr. and Mrs. Cook died in
							early infancy. Mr. Cook and all the members of his family have been adherents of the
							Christian church and give to it their earnest support. Mr. Cook has long <pb
								id="VAC1000-864" n="800"/> taken an interest in the affairs of his vicinity and
							county and identifies himself with all worthy measures of a public nature. For the
							exercise of grit, economy, perseverance and honesty, Mr. Cook has not only won
							material success but, what is still better, he has the esteem of all with whom he has
							come into contact.</p>

						<p>He whose career now comes up for review has for many years been a citizen of this
							county and a brief sketch of his life will show what any young man can hope to
							accomplish who has in his mind a definite aim and steadfastly pushes toward that goal.
							His career has been a most commendable one in every respect. Beginning life under none
							too favorable auspices, he allowed nothing to deter him, and by persistent industry
							and the exercise of sound sense in his operations, he has gained the rewards for which
							he labored and is today numbered among the substantial and influential men of his
							community.</p>

						<p>Alfred Cox is a native of the Buckeye state, born on February 27, 1853, in the
							suburbs of Cincinnati. He is the son of William and Ann (Reeves) Cox, the former born
							in Londonshire, near the city of London, England, and there grew to manhood. He was
							twice married, his first wife being a native of his county and when they came to
							America they had a family of two daughters and one son. The wife died while they
							resided near Cincinnati, and there some time later he was united in marriage with Ann
							Reeves. She, too, was a native of England, having been born in Yorkshire, and was
							brought by her parents to America when a small child of three years. To this union
							were born three children, among them being the immediate subject of this sketch. All
							the children were born while the family lived in Cincinnati, where the father was a
							gardener and florist and also interested in fruit growing. He was also a landscape
							gardener of no mean ability and it was he who laid out Spring Grove cemetery on the
							north side of Cincinnati. Later he removed to a place near Chicago, but only stayed
							there three years when he came to Marion county, this state, and located his family
							about three miles south of the city of Indianapolis. There his death occurred in 1866,
							at the time the subject of this sketch was fourteen years old. Young as he was, Alfred
							Cox assumed his position as "man of the family" and, under the guidance of a wise
							mother, carried on the business his father had left. The mother lived a widow for a
							good many years, passing away in 1892. In <pb id="VAC1000-865" n="[]"/>

							<pb id="VAC1000-866" n="801"/> October, 1882, the subject, together with his mother
							and her brothers and sisters, purchased an eighty-acre tract in the southeast portion
							of Lincoln township, Hendricks county, and there resided for some time. Later on,
							however, the subject purchased the interests of the others and held the land under his
							own title. When the family purchased the tract in question, there were but twelve
							acres cleared of timber and fit for cultivation. The subject has cleared the balance
							of it and set out a large orchard numbering some two thousand trees. These are mostly
							apple, but there are a few specimens of pears and cherries. He also carries on general
							farming on a tract of one hundred and sixty acres which he owns and which lays partly
							in Lincoln and partly in Washington townships. He also owns a farm of two hundred and
							five acres north of Clermont, Marion county. In his earlier days he did considerable
							gardening and has attended the city market of Indianapolis from the time he was eight
							years old and has the distinction of being the oldest attendant on market in point of
							years of service. At one time he handled cut and potted flowers, also live and dressed
							poultry, but now confines his efforts mostly to fruits, having made for himself an
							enviable reputation among the patrons of the market.</p>

						<p>In June, 1888, Alfred Cox was united in marriage with Anna Anderson, who was born at
							Milk Creek in Huntingdon county, Pennsylvania. She was a daughter of Abner and
							Catherine (Householder) Anderson, the former of whom was of excellent Scotch-English
							ancestry and the latter of sterling German strain. They came to Indiana in the year
							1870 and located at Knightstown, where they remained for a year and then moved to
							Indianapolis where the father passed the remainder of his life, his death occurring
							about 1873. In early life he had been a farmer, but later took up carpentry. His widow
							still resides in Indianapolis on Beville avenue and is enjoying good health and clear
							faculties at the advanced age of seventy-eight.</p>

						<p>Mr. Cox's religious affiliation is with the Methodist Episcopal church, of which he
							is a consistent member, giving of his time and means to further its good works. His
							fraternal affiliation is with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, of which he has
							been a member for a number of years in the local lodge at Brownsburg. Mr. and Mrs. Cox
							have an attractive and comfortable home in Lincoln township, the excellent condition
							of the farm land attesting the thoroughness of the owner, while the air of the home is
							that of genuine hospitality. Throughout his life, Mr. Cox has shown himself entirely
							worthy of the high esteem in which he is held. His life has been filled with activity
							and usefulness, while his untiring energy and ability have secured him a <pb
								id="VAC1000-867" n="802"/> conspicuous place among the citizens of his community. In
							1911 Mr. Cox agitated the proposition of good roads in Lincoln township and secured a
							successful petition for an improved road running two and a half miles south from
							Brownsburg, thence two and a half miles east; also three miles on the county line,
							running north from the Crawfordsville road. When it was decided to build the roads, he
							was made superintendent of the work. His strict integrity and unpretending bearing
							have elevated him in the confidence of his fellow citizens and his influence has
							always been exerted in the interests of those things which help to elevate his
							fellowmen in any way.</p>

							service of his country during that terrible conflict. The Harper family came
							originally from Virginia in the early history of the state and have numbered many
							worthy descendants since crossing the Alleghanies. William Forrest Harper, the first
							one of the family to be born in this county, was born near New Winchester, March 4,
							1836, and died July 22, 1865. in Pulaski, Tennessee. The father of W. F. Harper was a

							no relation to his parents or the family. The young couple came from Kentucky to this
							county on horseback and about eight years after settling in this county the father of
							W. F. Harper died, leaving his widow and seven sens. The widow never remarried, but
							remained on the farm with her children, where all seven of whom grew to manhood. In

							united with the Cumberland and Presbyterian church near New Winchester. Afterward she
							became a member of the Baptist church at Bethel. She died June 13, 1905, at the

							joined the Methodist Episcopal church and in 1848 united with the Missionary Baptist
							church at Bethel in Putnam county, after which he decided to enter the ministry and
							was ordained in 1870 and continued to be an active minister until his death.</p>

						<p>After William F. Harper married in 1858, he started farming on his wife's father's
							farm southwest of Coatesville, and remained there until he enlisted in the Civil War

							25, 1867, and made their home four miles northeast of North Salem, the place now
							occupied by Melvin C. and his sister Eva. To this second marriage have been born four
							children, only one of whom is living, Orville Storm. Mrs. Storm, the mother of Melvin
							C. Harper and his sister, died April 28, 1912, at the age of seventy-three. Some years
							after her marriage to Mr. Storm, she left the Baptist church, since there was none
							near her home, and united with the Christian church and remained an earnest member of
							that denomination until her death.</p>

						<p>Melvin Carey Harper. the son of William F. Harper and Sarah Elizabeth Christy, was
							born August 14, 1862, near New Winchester in this county. When he was five years of
							age his mother remarried and she and her family then moved to his present farm. At the
							age of eleven his stepfather was elected treasurer of Hendricks county and for the
							next five years Melvin C. and his sister lived in Danville, where they attended
							school. After finishing the high school at Danville, Melvin entered DePauw University
							at Green- castle. At the age of twenty-two he went to Kansas and entered a government
							claim in Comanche county, forty-five miles from a railroad, and started in to improve
							his claim. When he went to Kansas, his sister Eva went with him and they lived there
							together on his claim for seven and one-half years. <pb id="VAC1000-869" n="804"/>
							They then came back to North Salem and lived upon the farm where they are now
							residing. Neither brother or sister has ever married, but have lived for each other
							through all these years, since the death of their father in the Civil War.</p>

						<p>Melvina Eva, the sister of Melvin, is a finely educated woman. She attended the State
							Normal School at Terre Haute for two years and has spent several years in teaching.
							She taught five years before going to Kansas with her brother and taught seven years
							while they were living in Kansas. When they returned to this county she taught three
							years more, but several years ago retired from teaching and is now living with her
							brother on the farm. They have one hundred and fifty-five acres of fine farming land
							and Mr. Harper owns eighty acres in Marion township. He was a Republican up until the
							fall of 1912, when he allied himself with the new Progressive party. Mr. Harper is a
							member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows at North Salem and he and his sister
							both belong to the Daughters of Rebekah and the Christian church. She is also a member
							of the Woman's Relief Corps at Lizton. She is also a member of the "Lawrence School
							Girls," an organization of ladies who attended the Danville public school during the
							years of 1873-1875. This worthy couple have lived lives of usefulness in this county
							and their influence has always been found on the right side of all public questions
							which affected the welfare of their community in any way. They have many warm friends
							in the township, who esteem them for their many good qualities.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">CHARLES F. MARTIN.</hi></head>

						<p>Realizing that every day is a fresh beginning and that every morning the world is
							made new, Charles F. Martin, of Jamestown and Eel River township, is too well known to
							the people of Hendricks and surrounding counties as a financier and farmer to need any
							formal introduction here. He forged his way to the front, from a beginning none too
							auspicious, by courageously removing, one by one, the obstacles he found in life's
							pathway, for he was well aware that clearly defined purpose and consecutive effort in
							the affairs of life will inevitably result in the attainment of a due measure of
							success. In following out the career of one who has achieved the coveted goal by his
							own efforts there comes into view the intrinsic individuality which made such
							accomplishment possible, and thus there is gained an incentive and inspiration, while
							at the same time there is enkindled a feeling of <pb id="VAC1000-870" n="805"/>
							respect and admiration. The qualities which have made Mr. Martin one of the prominent
							and successful men of this locality have also brought him the esteem of his fellow
							men, for his career has been one of well-directed energy, strong determination and
							honorable methods.</p>

						<p>Charles F. Martin, president of the Citizens State Bank of Jamestown, and prosperous
							farmer of Eel River township, was born on August 20, 1851, in this township, on the
							farm where he is now residing. His parents were Levi and Emmeline (Fullen) Martin.
							Levi Martin was born in Union county, Indiana, on March 10, 1826, and was the son of
							James and Mary (Hendricks) Martin. Levi Martin came to Hendricks county in 1833 with
							his parents, who purchased land near where Charles F. is now living and remained there
							until their deaths, James Martin's death occurring in 1849. Levi Martin grew to
							manhood on the home farm and married Emmeline Fullen, who was born in this county and
							was the daughter of Charles and Sarah (Lawson) Fullen, early settlers in this
							locality.</p>

						<p>Charles F. Martin grew up on the farm and enjoyed such educational advantages as were
							afforded by his home schools and later was given an academic and commercial course at
							Indianapolis. Returning to this county, he taught school for three years and then
							engaged in farming, and has lived the life of a farmer ever since. He has been very
							successful as an agriculturist and is now the owner of three hundred and fifty acres
							of land which he has improved and brought to a high state of productivity. In addition
							to his landed interests, he is one of the stockholders and organizers of the Citizens
							State Bank of Jamestown, which bank was organized in June, 1903, with a capital stock
							of thirty thousand dollars. In 1913 the net profits of the bank were ten thousand
							dollars, with deposits amounting to nearly two hundred thousand dollars. Mr. Martin
							has been president of the bank from the time of its organization and has had the
							satisfaction of seeing it grow in strength and enlarge its usefulness to the
							community. While Mr. Martin has been busy with his financial and agricultural
							interests he has not neglected his duty as a citizen of the township. In 1888 he was
							elected on the Republican ticket to the office of trustee of his home township and
							filled this responsible office to the entire satisfaction of his fellow citizens,
							irrespective of party.</p>

						<p>Mr. Martin was married in 1880 to Miranda Frances Tucker, of Eel River township, the
							daughter of Dandridge Tucker and a sister to Nathan and David Tucker, whose
							biographies are given elsewhere in this volume. Mr. and Mrs. Martin are the parents of
							five children, Paul, Levi Lawson, Charles Russell, Maude and Emma Catherine. Paul,
							Maude and Emma have been students of Butler College at Indianapolis and Emma graduated
							in 1911. <pb id="VAC1000-871" n="806"/> Lawson graduated from Purdue University in
							1910, and Russell graduated from the agricultural department of that institution in
							1914. Paul is now assisting his father on the farm. Lawson is principal of the schools
							at Darlington, Indiana. Maude has charge of the musical department of Hazel Green
							Academy, at Hazel Green, Kentucky; Emma is principal of the public schools at Mace,
							Indiana. Mr. and Mrs. Martin are justly proud of their children, who have been given
							the advantages of the best educational institutions of the state and are filling
							useful places in society.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Martin have a beautiful country home one mile east of Jamestown, on the
							interurban line between Indianapolis and Crawfordsville. Mr. Martin is equally at home
							on the farm, in the bank and in all the activities of his community. He is an
							obliging, courteous, public-spirited and progressive man, who has performed useful
							service to his community and is rightly regarded as one of the most progressive men of
							his township.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">REV. WALTER M. BENSON.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the men of Hendricks county who have been potent factors for good, there is no
							one who occupies a more prominent position than Rev. W. M. Benson. For more than a
							score of years he was a public school teacher in various counties in the state and for
							the past thirty-five years has been in charge of the Baptist church of North Salem and
							other Baptist churches in this section of the state. In addition to his teaching and
							ministerial work, he has also found time to engage in farming. It would be impossible
							to estimate the beneficent influence which has followed his work in all of these lines
							of activity. For more than forty years he has been a resident of this county and in
							all that time he has never neglected an opportunity to serve his fellow men.</p>

						<p>Rev. Walter M. Benson, the son of John Harley and Mary Ellen (Minor) Benson, was born
							in 1833 in Pendleton county, Kentucky. He was two years of age when his parents moved
							to this state, where his father entered land in Rush county and lived there the
							remainder of his life. Walter Benson lived on the home farm until he was twenty years
							of age and then taught school in Rush county for three years. He secured his education
							in the subscription schools and then attended Fairview College, an institution of
							learning on the line of Rush and Fayette counties, which was presided over by A. R.
							Benton and Rev. Van Buskirk, the two famous educators of early Indiana. <pb
								id="VAC1000-872" n="807"/> In 1856 Walter Benson moved to the southern part of
							Marion county, near the Johnson county line, and for the next twelve years taught in
							Marion county, and followed this with six years of teaching in Johnson county. Five
							years of the time he was teaching in Marion county he had to teach in a log school
							house and only recently Rev. Benson had the pleasure of giving a lecture in that
							locality and met a number of the old people of the neighborhood who were his pupils
							fifty years ago. While teaching in Marion county, he also served as county trustee for
							two terms, while at the same time he managed a farm of his own.</p>

						<p>Rev. Benson came to Hendricks county in October, 1869, and bought a farm a short
							distance southeast of North Salem in Eel River township. He finished clearing the
							land, ditched, fenced and otherwise improved it. Up to the time that Rev. Benson came
							to Hendricks county, he had been preaching and farming, although he had for years been
							taking an active interest in church work. A year after coming to this county, he
							definitely decided to enter the ministry and was ordained as a regular minister in the
							Baptist church. For the next thirty-five years he was in charge of the Baptist church
							at North Salem, and for twenty-five years had charge of three other churches at the
							same time. He has the gift of natural oratory and is a man of great fluency of speech.
							During the thirty-five years in which he was in the active ministry, he not only
							served his charges faithfully and well, but also found time to take part in public
							affairs, was twice elected trustee of Eel River township and served both terms to the
							entire satisfaction of his constituents. He has also been able to keep his farm in
							operation and, due to the fact that he is a man of wonderful physique, he has never
							shirked manual labor, but has always been able to do his part in the field. He is
							proud of the fact that he is one of the best corn huskers in the county and from the
							age of sixteen has been able, until a few years ago, to husk three rows while the
							ordinary man was husking two.</p>

						<p>In 1857 Rev. Benson was married to Mary Jane Vandever, who was born and reared in
							Marion county, the daughter of James and Sarah (Tucker) Vandever. She was one of his
							pupils when he taught in the old log school house in Marion county, and the romance
							which begun in that rude building continued through more than fifty years. She lived
							to celebrate her golden wedding anniversary in 1907 and did not pass away until three
							years later, dying March 16, 1910. She was a wonderful woman in many ways, well versed
							in the Scriptures, clear and keen of intellect and helpful to her husband in his
							understanding of the Bible. Four children were born to bless this union: Homer A., a
							life insurance man of Indianapolis, who married Jennie <pb id="VAC1000-873" n="808"/>
							Miller, of Fayette county, and has one son, Neal; Mary E., the wife of J. S. Davis, of
							Gosport, has two children, Minor and Clarence; Hattie E., the wife of A. B. Davenport,
							a farmer of this county, has eight children, Herschel, Alberta, Edith, Maurice, Mary,
							Thelma, Frank and Beatrice; Eva Gertrude, the youngest child of Mr. and Mrs. Benson,
							is the wife of Everett Gregory, of Gosport, and has two children, Honor and
							Marion.</p>

						<p>This biography is but a feeble tribute to the wonderful amount of good which has been
							accomplished by Rev. Benson. He is a typical man of wonderful strength and energy, who
							can do many things, and do them all well. As a teacher, as a minister of the gospel,
							as a public official and as a private citizen, he has taken his share of the burdens
							of the community. He is a man who has always been trying to serve his fellow men. As a
							student of the Bible, he has few equals, has a wonderful memory and knows a large part
							of the Bible by heart and can repeat chapter after chapter without the slightest
							hesitation. He is a man of imposing appearance, tall, well built and with a
							personality which endears him to all who come in touch with him.</p>

						<p>William F. Page remained on the home farm until his marriage. He received a good
							common school education, and from his father learned all the finer points in
							agriculture. On October 10, 1893, Mr. Page married Ora Carpenter, the daughter of
							Fielding J. and Eline (Smith) Carpenter. Fielding J. Carpenter was born February 1,
							1854, in Morgan county, Indiana, the son of Felden and Sally (Leathers) Carpenter.
							Felden Carpenter came to Indiana in boyhood and settled in Morgan county among the
							first settlers of the county. Sally Leathers also came from the same part of Kentucky
							and settled with her parents in Morgan county. Felden Carpenter farmed all of his life
							as did his father, Daniel. before him. Fielding J. Carpenter grew up <pb
								id="VAC1000-874" n="809"/> on the home farm in Morgan county and in 1875 married
							Eline Smith, who was born and reared in Wabash county, Indiana, the daughter of
							Benjamin and Sally Smith. In 1876 Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter moved to Hendricks county and
							lived here ever since except two years' residence in Montgomery county. Mr.
							Carpenter's first wife died January 21, 1891, leaving six children, Cora, Ora, Edgar,
							Cleveland, Alta Opal and an infant, deceased. Mr. Carpenter was married on October 18,
							1891, to Ella Soots, daughter of John and Mary Adeline (Newman) Soots, of Eel River
							township. Her parents were both reared in this county. To this second marriage of Mr.
							Carpenter have been born six children: Verley Esther, deceased; Hazel Fern; Edith
							Marie; Cecil Dewey, deceased; Herndon and Victor Hugo.</p>

						<p>Before his marriage Mr. Page had been farming the land where he now lives and after
							his marriage he built a home and has since resided there. He has one hundred and
							twenty-five acres of excellent farming land which he has brought to a high state of
							cultivation. While he carries on a general farming, he has made a specialty of raising
							Poland China hogs and has been very successful on this line.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Page are the parents of two living children, Estal, born February 18,
							1903, and Dorothy May, born November 22, 1911, while Nina Esther and an infant are
							deceased. Mr. and Mrs. Page are both members of the Christian church and give it
							earnest support. Mr. Page is a man who is respected by everyone because of his quaint
							and wholesome life. He and his wife number their friends everywhere throughout the

						<p>There are certain characteristics which are always prominent in successful men, and
							among these perseverance and sterling worth are always to be found. William H. Robbins
							affords a fine example of the successful, self-made man, who has the necessary talents
							and forcefulness which have made him successful as a man of the world. His career
							shows that he has a versatility which is not possessed by every one. During the course
							of a long and busy career he has been a farmer, a carpenter, a stone mason, a merchant
							and an undertaker, and, what is more remarkable, he has made a success at each
							calling. However, his career has been pre-eminently that of a farmer, and in this
							vocation he has made his greatest success. He is a man of strong fiber and vigorous
							mentality and has earned high words of commendation from <pb id="VAC1000-875" n="810"
							/>HENDRICKS COUNTY, INDIANA. those competent to form a correct estimate of the man and
							his accomplishments.</p>

						<p>William H. Robbins, the son of Lamech and Emily (Blanton) Robbins, was born December
							5, 1849, in Eel River township, this county. His father was born in North Carolina in
							1820, the son of Jacob Robbins. Jacob Robbins, with his family, came to this county
							when Lamech was a small boy, settling on a farm in the southern part of Eel River
							township. Here Jacob Robbins purchased a farm and here he continued to reside the rest
							of his life, and here his son, Lamech, grew to manhood. Upon reaching his majority he
							married Emily Blanton, who was born near Crab Orchard, Kentucky, and came to this
							county with her parents when a small girl. After his marriage, Lamech Robbins bought
							forty acres of land east of Montclair, this state, and following that lived four years
							in Iowa. Upon his return to this county he bought a farm three miles east of North
							Salem, but later sold this tract and, in 1894, bought one hundred and sixty acres two
							miles west of North Salem. His first wife died during the latter part of the eighties,
							and some time later he married Delilah Blanton, the widow of John Blanton, who was a
							brother of his first wife, and after his second marriage he moved one-half mile east
							of North Salem, where he lived until three years before his death. He was compelled to
							retire from the farm on account of a severe stroke of paralysis and spent his
							remaining days in North Salem. Mr. and Mrs. Lamech Robbins were the parents of eleven
							children, eight of whom grew to maturity, although there are only four of them now
							living: Frances, the wife of David Henry, of Jamestown; William H.; James, of
							Roachdale, Indiana, and Jacob, a farmer of this township.</p>

						<p>William H. Robbins lived on the home farm until his marriage, and in 1873 married
							Mary Page, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Jeremiah Page, whose family history appears
							elsewhere in this volume. She was born in Jackson township, Putnam county, Indiana,
							and her parents are still living in this township. After his marriage Mr. Robbins
							began farming on a place adjoining his father's farm, his father having given him
							twenty acres upon his marriage and from time to time has added to this until he is now
							the owner of eighty-three acres. While he has been a farmer the most of his life, he
							has also, as the opportunity presented itself, been a carpenter and stone mason. Since
							1903 he has lived in North Salem, where he has been engaged in mercantile
							pursuits.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Robbins are the parents of four children: Lillie, who died in childhood;
							Oliver, who married Clara Barnard, and lives one mile west of Maysville, where he owns
							a farm of one hundred acres; Frank is married to <pb id="VAC1000-876" n="811"/> Iva

							farm of one hundred and ten acres; they have four children, Verle, Nina, Ruby and
							Irene; Myrtle is the wife of Samuel Kent, a grocer of North Salem, and has one
							daughter, Inez.</p>

						<p>Mr. Robbins was a Republican until the fall of 1912, when he cast his political lot
							with the Progressive party. He and his wife are members of the Christian church and
							give to it their earnest support. Mr. Robbins has a wide acquaintance throughout the

						<p>The best history of a state or county is the one that deals most with the lives and
							activities of its people, especially of those who, by their own endeavors and
							indomitable energy, have forged to the front and placed themselves where they deserve
							the title of progressive men. In this brief review will be found the record of one who
							has outstripped the less active plodders on the highway of life and among his
							contemporaries has achieved marked success in the business world, the name of Oliver
							W. Trotter being honored by all owing to his upright life and habits of thrift and
							industry.</p>

						<p>Oliver W. Trotter, of the firm of Trotter Brothers, of North Salem, was born in Eel
							River township. this county, in 1865, the son of William W. and Nancy E. (Keith)
							Trotter, who are represented elsewhere in this work.</p>

						<p>Oliver W. Trotter was given a good, common-school education and lived on the home
							farm until 1898. He then began working in the dry goods store of Moore &amp; Fleece,
							of North Salem, where he was employed for some years. He then entered the employ of J.
							W. Sparks, remaining with him until 1907, when he and his brother, Silas B., bought
							the store of Bymaster &amp; Company, which they have continued to operate since that
							time.</p>

						<p>Mr. Trotter was married in 1903 to Mamie Conover, the daughter of John D. and Ellen
							(Weible) Conover. Mrs. Trotter's mother was born in Cape May county, New Jersey, in
							1831, the daughter of Thomas and Mary <pb id="VAC1000-877" n="812"/> Ann (Heritage)
							Weible. In 1840 her parents moved to New Albany, in this state, where they lived until
							1870. Her father was a boat-builder in the ship yards there. In 1853 Mrs. Trotter's
							mother was married to Samuel Conover, the son of J. D. and Soffronia Conover. Samuel
							Conover was engaged in clerical and commercial work at New Albany, and his death
							occurred there in 1861, leaving his widow with three small children, William, Walter
							and Lydia. William lives in Indianapolis; Walter died in his seventeenth year and Mrs.
							Lydia Walker lives in North Salem. Some years after her husband's death, Mrs. Conover
							married John Conover, of Ohio, a steamboat man on the river. In 1870 they established
							their home at North Salem, in this county, and Mr. Conover continued to work on the
							river as captain of a steamboat until several years later, when he retired from active
							work and permanently settled at North Salem, where he lived until his death in 1882.
							To the second marriage of Mrs. Conover there was one daughter born, Mamie E., now the
							wife of Oliver Trotter. In 1887 Mrs. Conover married John W. Clements, a native of
							Kentucky and long a resident of North Salem. He was a soldier in the Civil War in
							Company C, Seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and served three full years in
							the war, after which he lived the life of a farmer in this county until his death,
							which occurred in North Salem, March 24, 1905. Since her husband's death, Mrs.
							Clements has continued to reside in North Salem, and now enjoys good health, despite
							her advanced age of eighty-two years.</p>

						<p>Mr. Trotter has made his way in life by force of his own merit and industry from a
							small beginning to a place of comparative success. He is a man of absolute honesty,
							always on the advance and has managed his share of business with a skill and prudence
							which comes of a practical knowledge of the various branches of the business.</p>

						<p>Judging from the success that has attended the efforts of Thomas C. Davis, one of
							Hendricks county's leading farmers, he got a proper start in life and, although he has
							made some mistakes, yet he is today one of the splendid examples of our modern
							farmers. Much, if not all, depends upon the start in the battle of life, just as in
							the beginning of a race. The horse that gets the best start, all other things being
							equal, will almost invariably win. Realizing at the outset of his career that it took
							indomitable courage, <pb id="VAC1000-878" n="813"/> unfaltering integrity and
							unfailing industry to achieve the best results, Mr. Davis began shaping his course
							gauged by proper ideals and is today eminently deserving of the reward that has so
							lavishly attended his efforts.</p>

						<p>Thomas C. Davis; the son of Walter and Mary (Scott) Davis, was born June 15, 1871,
							about two miles east of North Salem, in this county. The history of the Davis family
							is fully portrayed in the sketch of Quincy A. Davis, which will be found elsewhere in
							this work.</p>

						<p>Thomas C. Davis grew to manhood on the farm where he was born and received his
							education in the schools of his home township. He was married on February 28, 1892, to
							Ella C. Leach, the daughter of James M. and Elizabeth (Hamilton) Leach. James M. Leach
							was born in Hendricks county, February 9, 1834, the son of Enos and Elizabeth Leach,
							who were both natives of Kentucky. Enos Leach and his wife came to Indiana from
							Kentucky in 1831 and entered two hundred acres of government land in Union township,
							this county. James M. was one of seven children born to his parents, and grew to
							manhood in this county. He married Elizabeth Hamilton, March 17, 1859. She was the
							daughter of Abraham Hamilton, of this county. James M. Leach is one of the leading
							farmers of the county. He and his wife are loyal members of the Christian church and
							Mr. Leach has served as an elder in that denomination for many years.</p>

						<p>After Mr. Davis was married he engaged in farming for himself on eighty acres which
							he had bought south of Montclair, in Union township. In 1893 he moved to his present
							home, two miles east of North Salem, where he bought one hundred and sixty acres of
							land. He has within the past twenty years made extensive improvements on his farm in
							the way of rebuilding his house, erecting a new barn, outbuildings and fencing of
							various kinds. Success has come to him as a reward of his efforts and from time to
							time has been able to add to his holdings until he is now the owner of two hundred and
							seventy-seven and one-half acres in this township.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Davis are the parents of two children, Jewel, born April 28, 1893, who
							died when she was about six months of age, and Mamie L., who was born February 27,
							1895, who is still at home with her parents. All the family are members of the
							Methodist Episcopal church of North Salem and earnest in their support of that
							denomination. Mr. Davis is a Republican and takes an intelligent interest in the
							affairs of his party. He has served several years on the advisory board of his
							township, a place of honor and trust which carries with it a salary of only five
							dollars per year. This position was a tribute to him as a public-spirited ccitizen,
							since it came to him unsought and shows the confidence which his fellow citizens had
							in his ability <pb id="VAC1000-879" n="814"/> and integrity. He has one of the finest
							sugar camps in the township. He carries on general mixed farming, giving attention to
							both live stock and grain.</p>

							justification, nevertheless, in the tracing and recording of such a career. It is,

							that must be accorded each statement, and yet with a feeling of satisfaction, that the
							writer essays the task of touching briefly upon the details of such a record as has
							been that of the respected subject whose life now comes under review.</p>

						<p>Michael Felix Hession, who in many respects is one of the most prominent citizens of
							Brown township, Hendricks county, Indiana, was born on a farm in Boone county, this
							state, on September 15, 1868, the son of Michael and Catherine (Hogan) Hession, both

							their lives. Michael Hession died January 1, 1903, his wife having preceded him in
							June, 1891. They reared a family of eight children, among them being the subject of

						<p>Michael F. Hession remained under the parental roof until the time of his marriage in
							1894 to Sarah Mullin, daughter of Patrick and Mary (Tarpy) Mullin, both of whom

							After their marriage, they purchased a tract of forty acres in the eastern part of
							Brown township, this county, where they made their home for some fifteen or twenty
							years, and here it was that their daughter Sarah, wife of the subject of this sketch,
							was born. In 1879, Mr. Mullin bought eighty acres of land in Middle township, on the
							Hendricks-Boone county line, retaining the original forty <pb id="VAC1000-880" n="815"

						<p>Among those men of sterling attributes of character who have impressed their
							personality upon the community of their residence and have borne their full share in
							the upbuilding and development of Hendricks county, mention must not be omitted of Dr.
							Oscar H. Wiseheart, of North Salem, where he has long maintained his home and where he
							has exerted a strong influence for good on the entire community, being a man of
							upright principles and desirous to see the advancement of the community along moral,
							educational and material lines. Professionally, he is a man of recognized ability, who
							has in his chosen sphere of effort met with a large degree of success, winning the
							commendation and the confidence of all who have knowledge of the great value of the
							competent physician to any community.</p>

						<p>Dr. Oscar H. Wiseheart, of North Salem, the son of John Douglas and Eliza (Clemmons)
							Wiseheart, was born at Groveland, Putnam county, <pb id="VAC1000-881" n="816"/>
							Indiana, September 24, 1874. His father, John D. Wiseheart, of North Salem, was born
							in 1840 in Putnam county, the son of John D., Sr., and Mary E. (Ryner) Wiseheart. John
							D. Wiseheart, Sr., was born in Nelson county, Kentucky, and in childhood came with his
							parents, Jacob and Mary Elizabeth Wiseheart, to Putnam county, this state, where they
							entered government land near Groveland in the early history of that county and lived
							and died there. Mary E. Ryner was a native of Ohio, the daughter of Adam and Martha
							Ryner, and came with her parents to Putnam county, Indiana, where they also entered
							land from the government and lived there the remainder of their lives. John D.
							Wiseheart, Sr., grew to manhood in Putnam county, and in 186i married Eliza Jane
							Clemmons, the daughter of Joseph N. and Caroline (Garrett) Clemmons. Joseph Clemmons
							was born in Maryland, near Hagerstown, and after the death of his parents in that
							state he came to Center township and followed the occupation of a farmer for the rest
							of his life. Caroline Garrett was born in Randolph county, North Carolina, the
							daughter of Caleb and Mary Garrett. Caleb Garrett was a physician who came to Salem,
							Indiana, and moved from there to Danville, in this county, where his death occurred.
							His daughter, Caroline, lived in Danville until her marriage to Joseph Clemmons.</p>

						<p>After his marriage John D. Wiseheart, Jr., lived for a short time on his father's
							farm and in 1862 volunteered as a soldier, but was refused because of physical
							disability. A year later he again volunteered and because there was a dearth of men he
							was accepted as a member of Company H. Eleventh Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry.
							The company was sent to Baltimore, where they were stationed in the forts surrounding
							that city. Here he served one year and then mustered out, immediately after which he
							returned to Indiana, and he and his wife moved to Iowa, where they lived for a year
							and a half. They then sold their farm and returned to Indiana, purchasing a farm four
							and one-half miles from North Salem, and on this farm of one hundred and fifty acres
							they lived until the fall of 1904, when they moved into North Salem and retired from
							active life. Mr. and Mrs. Wiseheart are both active members of the Presbyterian church
							in New Winchester. They have reared a family of five children: William H., a physician
							of Colfax, Indiana, who married Lillian Crose, and has one daughter, Nina; Effie, who
							died on reaching womanhood: Dr. Oscar H., whose history follows; Letitia is the wife
							of L. A. Whitenack, of Portland, Oregon, and she has one son. Clifford, and Victor H.,
							who died in 1911, at the age of twenty-six. His wife, Catherine Cameron, died four
							months after their marriage.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-882" n="817"/>

						<p>Dr. Oscar H. Wiseheart grew up on his father's farm in Marion township, and after
							completing the course in the common schools he entered the Central Normal College at
							Danville, and later the Kentucky School of Medicine at Louisville, Kentucky,
							graduating in 1898. Immediately after his graduation, he began the active practice of
							his profession at North Salem and has continued in the practice there for the past
							sixteen years. Doctor Wiseheart has built up a very lucrative and satisfactory
							practice in his town and vicinity and has been very successful as a general
							practitioner.</p>

						<p>Doctor Wiseheart was married in 1899 to Eva Morton Hadley, the daughter of Gillam and
							Harriett (Kissler) Hadley, of Eel River township, this county, and to this union have
							been born two children, Harriett Louise and Robert Hadley. Doctor Wiseheart and his
							wife are members of the Presbyterian church and he is a member of the Free and
							Accepted Masons in North Salem. He is the oldest physician in years of practice at
							North Salem and has succeeded in building up an enviable reputation as a physician who
							keeps fully abreast of the times in every particular. Doctor Wiseheart is a man whose
							heart is in his profession and never fails to respond to the call of the sick and
							suffering. He is a man of character, of stern honesty and one who inspires that
							confidence which is as necessary to the patient as are the medicines which are given
							by the physician. His personality is pleasing and the deep sympathy which he feels for
							his patients endears him to them and thus renders him the more efficient in his
							services. He and his wife move in the best social circles of the town and vicinity and
							are deservedly popular among all classes.</p>

						<p>The Stout family have been in Hendricks county for the past threescore and seven
							years. Samuel Stout, the grandfather of Calvin Stout, whose history is portrayed in
							this sketch, was born in North Carolina in the year 1800, the same year in which
							Indiana territory was carved out of the Northwest territory. Samuel Stout married in
							North Carolina and came to this county in 1837, with his family, consisting of his
							wife and two sons, William H., the father of Calvin and Luther. William H. was born
							September 15, 1849, in this county and died in 1896, his father, Samuel, the
							grandfather of Calvin, dying on October 4, 1875, in this county. William H. Stout was
							married on March 21, 1872, to Martha M. Curtis, who was born March 28, 1853, <pb
								id="VAC1000-883" n="818"/> in Morgan county, Indiana. She was the daughter of Calvin
							and Rosa (York) Curtis. Martha, the wife of William H. Stout, died June 8, 1910, on

						<head><hi rend="center">JAMES S. DODDS.</hi></head>

						<p>Although the biography of the substantial citizen which is here presented is only the
							plain story of a farmer, yet it contains many incidents which will be interesting to
							the general public and especially to the many descendants of the honored subject.
							While James S. Dodds has been a resident of Hendricks county only a very short time,
							nevertheless his interests have been closely identified with this county and with the
							town of North Salem, where he has been doing much of his business for a long time.</p>

						<p>James S. Dodds was born in Garrett county, Kentucky, on January 17, 1845, and is now
							living a retired life in North Salem, Hendricks county, Indiana, having moved there
							min the fall of 1913. He is the son of Samuel and Margaret E. (Ramsey) Dodds, both of
							whom were natives of Kentucky and who came to Putnam county, Indiana, when he was a
							child of five years, and located in Jackson township, where his father bought a farm
							and spent the remainder of his life.</p>

						<p>James S. Dodds grew to manhood on his father's farm and when he was eighteen years of
							age he enlisted, in July, 1863, in Company I, One Hundred Fifteenth Regiment Indiana
							Volunteer Infantry, for service in the Union army. His company was attached to the
							Army of the Cumberland, under General Wilcox, and performed guard duty along the
							Cumberland river in Tennessee during all his service. Upon his discharge in February,
							1864, he returned to his father's farm in Putnam county, where he remained <pb
								id="VAC1000-884" n="819"/> until his marriage, which occurred in 1867, when he was
							united to Lizzie Case, a native of Putnam county and the daughter of Joseph and Louisa
							A. (Perkins) Case. She died in 1875, leaving one daughter, Ida G., who married John
							Wilson and whose death occurred in September, 1903. In March, 1880, Mr. Dodds married
							Sarah E. Rust, a native of Kentucky and the daughter of Matthew and Eliza Ann
							(Troutman) Rust. She came with her parents to Jackson township, Putnam county,
							Indiana, when she was six years of age and lived there until her marriage. To this
							second marriage were born three children, Iva C., the wife of Frank Robbins, a farmer
							of Montgomery county, and they have four children, Verlie, Nina, Marie Ruby and Irene;
							Eliza E. is the wife of Lona Page, a farmer of Putnam county, who has one daughter,
							Lottie; Vela V., the wife of Elza Page, who is a brother of Eliza's husband and a
							farmer of Putnam county, and he and his wife are the parents of two children living,
							James J. and Hazel, one of their children dying in infancy.</p>

						<p>Mr. Dodds began farming on rented land in 1867, at the time of his first marriage,
							and six years later bought forty acres of land in his home township, where he lived
							until he moved to North Salem in 1913. Being a man of thrifty and frugal habits and
							assisted by an economical wife, he was able to add to his farm from time to time until
							he is now the owner of one hundred and thirty-four, acres of fine farming land in
							Jackson township, Putnam county. He has been a life-long farmer and early learned the
							secrets of successful agriculture. He raises all the crops common to this locality and
							has also given a due share of time and attention to the raising and breeding of live
							stock, in the handling of which he has met with splendid success. He is a practical,
							methodical man in all he does and his efforts have been rewarded by a due meed of
							success.</p>

						<p>Mr. Dodds has been a member of the Baptist church at North Salem for many years, and
							is now serving as trustee and deacon in that denomination. He was a member of the
							building committee which repaired the old church at North Salem, making it modern in
							every way. An interesting incident in Mr. Dodds' career was his short career in
							Indianapolis. In 1873 he moved to Indianapolis, believing that he was able to live a
							life more suited to his liking in the city, but the panic of that year swept over the
							country and within a very few months he was back on the home farm again and never left
							it until he moved to North Salem last year. He has hosts of friends in North Salem and
							in the township in which he lived for so many years in Putnam county. While he has
							been successful in his private affairs, he has also interested <pb id="VAC1000-885"
								n="820"/> himself in the welfare of the community, and there is no one in the town
							of his residence who enjoys a greater degree of respect and esteem than does Mr.
							Dodds.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">ARTHUR M. DAVIS.</hi></head>

						<p>The history of the branch of the Davis family which is represented in Hendricks
							county goes back to a period which antedates the organization of Indiana territory in
							1800. Before the name Indiana was ever coined and while George Washington was still in
							his prime, Evan Davis was born June 8, 1796, near Raleigh, North Carolina. In that
							same state, on June 17, 1797, was born a girl by the name of Rebecca Marshall and in
							the historic state of North Carolina these two children grew to young manhood and
							young womanhood. They were married when very young and shortly after their marriage
							made the long overland trip from North Carolina to Indiana, and settled in Hendricks
							county a year before the county was organized, in 1822. Evan Davis entered six hundred
							and forty acres of land in this county as soon as the land was opened by the
							government for sale, and added to this from time to time until, at his death, he was
							the owner of about two thousand acres of excellent land in this county. He died on
							November 9, 1854, and his wife in the year following. Evan Davis and two of his
							neighbors founded the first Methodist church in this county, the Salem Camp-meeting
							church, and contributed both spiritually and financially to its success. He was a
							large raiser of stock, principally hogs and cattle, and drove his stock overland to
							Madison, on the Ohio river. He brought the first shorthorned bull into this state and
							introduced this excellent breed of cattle to the farmer. He also raised sheep and the
							wool from his own sheep made the clothing for the family. In North Carolina Evan Davis
							owned slaves, but the girl he married was a Quaker and she was very much opposed to
							slavery. When they were married he promised to free all of his slaves, and before they
							left North Carolina for Indiana he gave them their freedom. Evan Davis built the first
							grist-mill in this county and later built two others, but none of them are now
							standing. He laid out the first graveyard in the county on his own farm and called it
							the Davis graveyard. At first it was devoted to the immediate family and relatives,
							but later charity bodies were allowed to be placed in the graveyard, through the
							courtesy of Mr. Davis. He was a Democrat in politics, but never held office; he was a
							power spiritually in his community, and never seemed to weary of doing good for his
							fellow men.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1000-886" n="821"/>

						<p>David Wesley Davis, the father of Arthur M. Davis, whose history is here portrayed,
							received his education in the schools of his township and later attended Antioch
							College, in New York state, where he took a literary course, specializing in mental
							psychology and general literary subjects. He also attended DePauw University at
							Greencastle, Indiana, and pursued literary subjects. David Davis was married September
							9, 1858, to Amanda E. Newby, and to this marriage were born six children: Alva E.,
							Arthur M., Emmett T., Evan B., and two who died in infancy. Upon the outbreak of the
							Civil War, David W. Davis enlisted in Company I, Ninety-ninth Regiment of Indiana
							Volunteer Infantry, and served under Sherman and Thomas, participating in the famous
							march to the sea in the summer of 1864. He served through the Rebellion with much
							courage and loyalty and was mustered out of the service, without being wounded or
							having himself impaired. He was a charter member of the Independent Order of Odd
							Fellows at Belleville, Indiana, and a member of the Grand Army post at Danville. He is
							a charter member of the Methodist church at Belleville and has helped to build two or
							three churches in the county. In 1911 Mr. and Mrs. David W. Davis moved to Fairhope,
							Alabama, near Mobile, where they are now making their home. They celebrated their
							golden wedding anniversary September 9, 1913, at the home of Arthur M. Davis, their
							son.</p>

						<p>Arthur M. Davis has lived on the old homestead farm all his life with the exception
							of ten years which he spent in Mexico as a mining engineer. While in Mexico, he was
							chosen as general manager of a group of silver mines at Parral, and learned the
							business by hard knocks and practical experience. He is an authority on the subject of
							silver mining, and has a great capacity for the detail work which naturally
							accompanies work of this nature. He" received a common school education in his home
							schools and later spent one year of study in Germany. This was followed by six years
							of practical study in the mines of this country and Mexico. He came back from Mexico
							and settled on his farm on June 30, 1908, where he is now living the quiet life of a
							farmer. He now farms three hundred and twenty acres, the farm being a part of the same
							which his grandfather entered in 1822. Everything about his farm is kept in a very
							attractive manner, showing that its owner is a man of discriminating taste and good
							judgment. He raises a great deal of stock and specializes in Duroc hogs and Guernsey
							cattle, and ships much of his stock to distant points. He also raises shorthorn cattle
							and is considered a good judge of all kinds of live stock.</p>

						<p>Mr. Davis was married August 9, 1905, to Minnie F. Little, the daughter of Thomas H.
							and Louisa A. (Parsons) Little, and to this marriage has been <pb id="VAC1000-887"
								n="822"/> born one son, Arthur Marshall, Jr. Mr. Davis is a member of the Masonic
							fraternity at Plainfield and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows at same place. In
							politics, he is a stanch and active Republican and has lent his influence to the
							support of the candidates of that party. The nature of his business has kept him from
							taking any active part in politics, or aspiring to any public position. Mr. Davis is a
							conservative business man who has proved as successful in the farming business as he
							did in his mining business. He has built up a name for himself in the county and
							township as a man who does things. He is well liked by all his neighbors and there is
							no one in the county who is quicker to lend a helping hand in time of trouble than he,
							and for this reason he is justly regarded as one of the representative men of his
							county.</p>

							has enabled him to stand among the front rank of his profession in central
							Indiana.</p>

						<p>Dr. Herbert C. Sears, the son of R. B. and Sarah F. (Cash) Sears, was born in
							Carrollton, Missouri, January 6, 1878. His parents were both natives of Danville,

							permanently in 1884, and continued in the practice of his profession until his death,
							which occurred June 13, 1909, he and his son practicing the last few years together.
							He was a member of the Presbyterian church and also a member of the Masonic order. He
							was a veteran of the Civil War, having served for four years in the Fourth Indiana
							Cavalry. The paternal grandfather of Dr. H. C. Sears, who was Wesley B. Sears, came to

							Hendricks county.</p>

						<p>Dr. H. C. Sears received his elementary education in the Danville schools and took

						<p>Among the citizens of Brown township, Hendricks county, Indiana, who are engaged in
							rural pursuits and who believe in following twentieth-century methods, is Elmer B.
							Arbuckle, farmer and stock raiser. He comes of a splendid family, one that has always
							been strong for right living and industrious habits, for education and morality, and
							for all that contributes to the welfare of the community. Such people are welcomed
							anywhere, for they are empire builders and as such have pushed the frontier of
							civilization ever westward and onward, leaving the green, wide-reaching wilderness and
							the far-stretching plains populous with contented people and beautiful with green
							fields; they have constituted that sterling horde which caused the great Bishop
							Whipple to write the memorable line "Westward the course of empire takes its way."</p>

						<p>The subject of this sketch was born in Indianapolis, this state, on March 13, 1875,
							being the son of Marion and Eliza (Halloway) Arbuckle, the former of whom was also a
							Hoosier by birth and was the son of John and <pb id="VAC1000-889" n="824"/> Elizabeth
							Arbuckle. Eliza Holloway was a daughter of Joseph and Elizabeth Holloway and was
							united in marriage with Marion Arbuckle on December 10, 1871. They took up their
							residence in Indianapolis, where they continued to live for some time, when they came
							to Hendricks county and purchased a small tract of thirteen acres in Brown township.
							There Marion Arbuckle passed the remainder of his life, his death occurring on
							December 2, 1879. Mrs. Eliza Arbuckle is still living, residing in Lebanon, Indiana,
							where she owns her home and lives in comfort. She also possesses a tract of some sixty
							acres in this county, it being just across the highway from the holdings of the
							subject of this sketch. Marion Arbuckle was one of the patriotic sons of the Union who
							went to the front during the dark days of the sixties, having been a member of the
							Fifty-first Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry.</p>

						<p>Elmer B. Arbuckle was one of a family of three children and remained at home until
							the time of his marriage, November 26, 1898, to Naomi Huddleston, daughter of Fielding
							and Elizabeth (Patterson) Huddleston, the former of whom was a native of Kentucky, the
							son of William and Susan (Phillips) Huddleston. The family were prominent in their
							community, being prosperous slave holders, with a large plantation. Fielding
							Huddleston came to Indiana when he was about thirty years old and located in Hendricks
							county, where he purchased land in the northwestern part of Lincoln township.
							Elizabeth Patterson, mother of Mrs. Elmer B. Arbuckle, was a daughter of Daniel and
							Sarah (McDaniel) Patterson and the mother of seven children. Mr. and Mrs. Arbuckle
							have two children living and one, Annis Hester, died when eight years old. Clarence
							William and Edith Irene are the two remaining, both of whom are with the parents. Mr.
							Arbuckle has associated with him his son, now twelve years of age, and, despite his
							extreme youth, the lad shows remarkable intelligence in acquiring information
							regarding the origin, care, etc., of the different classes of high-grade live stock on
							the farm, giving particular attention to the hogs. Mr. Arbuckle makes a specialty of
							spotted Poland China hogs and exhibits at all the state fairs in the Central West and
							East. He comes in contact and competition with the very best breeders of this class of
							live stock and prides himself on the fact that he always gets a generous share of the
							ribbons. He has the distinction of being the originator of the improved spotted Poland
							China breed and was instrumental in having a history of the hog written, which proves
							interesting to the layman as well as fancier. In this history the hog was traced to
							its origin and developments and improvements noted from time to time. Mr. <pb
								id="VAC1000-890" n="825"/> Arbuckle also has a thoroughbred Percheron stallion, but
							has not had him on exhibit for about three years. He is also interested in poultry,
							having many fine birds and specializing on single comb buff Orpingtons. These he
							exhibits at all the big poultry shows of the world and has an enviable record for his
							pens. Mr. Arbuckle has attained merited distinction in his chosen field of endeavor,
							due in no small measure to his excellent business ability and the untiring energy and
							unfailing determination to win out. He stands today well to the front of those engaged
							in this class of work and has in training his capable young son, who is in a fair way
							to accomplish still greater things.</p>

						<p>Mr. Arbuckle's fraternal affiliations are with the Knights of Pythias, the Modern
							Woodmen of America and the Improved Order of Red Men, and in the workings of these
							various societies he takes an interest. While not a member of any church society, his
							sympathies are with the Baptist church, of which Mrs. Arbuckle is an active member. In
							every avenue of life's activities he has performed his part to the best of his
							ability, believing that anything worth doing at all is worth doing well, the result
							being that he has won and retains to a notable degree the sincere respect and
							confidence of all who know him. He has a vast number of acquaintances, among whom are
							many loyal, stanch and devoted friends, and wherever he goes he receives a hearty
							welcome. His life has been filled with activity and usefulness, while his sincere
							interest in the moral and material welfare of the community has gained for him a

						<p>William N. Lakin, the son of William H. and Lucinda (Sargeant) Lakin, was born in
							Shelby county, Illinois, on February 9, 1845. His father was born near Cincinnati,
							Ohio, March 22, 1814, and his mother was a native of Virginia, her birth having
							occurred on September 17, 1816. His grandfather, Joseph Lakin, came from Maryland and
							settled in Indiana, dying in Hamilton county in 1838. His wife, Margaret Simmons, died
							in 1850. The maternal grandparents of Mr. Lakin were John and Mary Sargeant, he a
							native of Virginia and she of Kentucky. They moved to Illinois in an early day, and
							there his wife's death occurred in 1821, while he died in 1840. Joseph and Margaret
							(Simmons) Lakin reared a family of fourteen children, the father of William N. Lakin
							being the eleventh child in order of birth.</p>

						<p>William H. Lakin, the father of William N. Lakin, moved from Illinois to Boone
							county, Indiana, in 1846, when the subject of this sketch was about one year old, and
							continued to reside there until 1859, when he permanently settled in Hendricks county,
							at Plainfield. Here he continued in the blacksmithing business until his death, in
							1900, at the advanced age of eighty-six years, his wife having preceded him in death
							about two years previous, in 1898. Mr. and Mrs. William H. Lakin were the parents of
							ten children, William N. being the fifth child in order of birth. Five of these
							children are still living in 1913.</p>

						<p>William N. Lakin spent his boyhood days in Boone county, coming to Plainfield with
							his parents in 1859 when he was fifteen years of age. He started in as a small boy in
							his father's blacksmith shop, and before he joined the army, at the age of eighteen,
							he was an expert smith. In 1863 he enlisted in Company H, Fifty-fourth Regiment
							Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and served three months, the term of his enlistment.
							Immediately after the expiration of his three-months service he enlisted in Company A,
							One Hundred Seventeenth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry. His second enlistment was
							for six months, but he served eight months before he was mustered out. During this
							time he saw service in eastern Tennessee. At the expiration of his second enlistment
							in February, 1864, he was mustered out and returned to his home, but immediately
							re-enlisted in the Second Indiana Battery of heavy artillery, and was sent with his
							command to Nashville, <pb id="VAC1000-892" n="827"/> Tennessee. He took part in the
							battle of Nashville and after that performed guard duty until the close of the war.
							Immediately after being mustered out of the service he returned to his home county and
							established a blacksmith shop in Plainfield, which he conducted until 1868, when he
							moved to Danville, where he continued to follow his trade as a blacksmith for a few
							years, after which he removed to Coatesville, this county, where he opened a
							blacksmith shop and later went into the buggy, implement and harness business, which
							he still continues. He has been very successful in his line of endeavor and has built
							up a large and lucrative trade in Coatesville and the surrounding community.</p>

						<p>Mr. Lakin was married in September, 1867, to Betty J. Cooke, of Hamilton county, this
							state, the daughter of Joshua and Hannah Cooke, and she died in 1870, leaving no
							children. In 1872 Mr. Lakin was married to Louisa C. Gamble, the daughter of Mr. and
							Mrs. John Gamble, of Coatesville, and to this second marriage there has been born one
							child, Otto. Mr. Lakin has been a life-long Republican and has always taken an active
							interest in local politics. An indication of his popularity and the respect with which
							he is regarded in the county is shown in the fact that he was elected as treasurer of
							Hendricks county in 1898. He filled this responsible position to the entire
							satisfaction of the citizens of the county. He is financially interested in the First
							National Bank, of Coatesville, being a director in that institution. Fraternally, he
							is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and
							the Grand Army of the Republic. He and his wife are consistent members of the

							members of society and have a wide circle of friends and acquaintances who esteem them
							for their many good qualities.</p>

						<p>Otto F. Lakin, son of W. N. Lakin, was born in Coatesville, October 23, 1872, and
							spent his boyhood in that town. After graduating front the Coatesville high school he

						<p>Among the prosperous farmers of Hendricks county, Indiana, who have descended from
							distinguished ancestry is Daniel Sigler Hazlewood. His grandfather was one of the
							first pioneers to settle in this county. Daniel S. Hazlewood was born September 9,
							1873, near Hazlewood, Liberty township, Hendricks county, Indiana, his birth occurring
							in a log cabin on the old home farm which was erected by his father. His parents were
							James B. and Jane (Stout) Carter Hazlewood.</p>

						<p>James B. Hazlewood was also born near Hazlewood on August 16, 1837, and was the son
							of Daniel Hazlewood, who was a native of Virginia, and when a young man came to
							Kentucky, where he married, and soon after his marriage he came to Liberty township,
							this county, with his two children, James and Benjamin. He entered land from the
							government and later added to his first entry until he was the owner of one hundred
							and sixty acres of good land in the township. He was a skillful mechanic and followed
							this trade at his home and in the town of Hazlewood. He and his family were all
							members of the Missionary Baptist church. Mary Alspaugh, the mother of James B.
							Hazlewood, was a daughter of Isaac Alspaugh, who was a native of Kentucky.</p>

						<p>James B. Hazlewood was married in 1865 to Elizabeth Jane (Stout) Carter, the daughter
							of Jonathan and Elizabeth (Ruston) Stout. Jonathan Stout was a native of North
							Carolina and came to this county in an early day with his parents. Mr. and Mrs. James
							Hazlewood were the parents of three children: Logan, deceased; Mrs. Addie Kivitt,
							deceased, and Daniel Sigler, whose history is here presented. Daniel Hazlewood, the
							grandfather of Daniel Sigler, whose history is here presented, had a family of six
							children: Benjamin; Joseph; James, the father of the subject; Mary, deceased: Jane,
							who died in early youth, and one who died at the age of nine years. James Hazlewood
							spent his boyhood days in this county and his whole life was spent on the farm where
							he was born. He was a member of the Masonic fraternity and the Grangers organization
							which arose in this state in the seventies. <pb id="VAC1000-894" n="829"/> He was a
							life-long Democrat and always took an active part in politics. Religiously, he was a
							member of the Missionary Baptist church at Hazlewood and was a clerk in the church for
							many years. He died in 1897 on the home place near Hazlewood. He was a progressive
							farmer in every sense of the word and was a hardworking man all his life. He was a man
							of liberal ideas and always took an active interest in all public enterprises. The
							town of Hazlewood was named after his father, Daniel Hazlewood.</p>

						<p>Daniel Sigler Hazlewood spent his boyhood days in the township schools of Liberty
							township, and at the same time assisted his father on the home farm. He has lived his
							entire life upon the farm where he was born, raising all the crops indigenous to this
							latitude and putting a part of his attention to the raising of live stock. Mr.
							Hazlewood was married on March 22, 1899, to Cordelia Maud Wooden, the daughter of
							Robert S. and Cordelia Jane (Wilhite) Wooden.</p>

						<p>Robert Sanford Wooden, the oldest son of Joshua and Penelope Wooden, was born in
							Oldham county, Kentucky, August 4, 1845, and died at his home, three miles west of
							Hall, Indiana, August 30, 1913, at the age of sixty-eight years. He, with his parents,
							came to Indiana in 1851, where they lived for three years on the Samuel Hadley farm
							south of Monrovia, after which they moved to the old Wooden homestead in Adams
							township, Morgan county, where Robert S. grew to manhood. He united with the Methodist
							Episcopal church at Mount Zion in 1865, and in 1866 went to Everett, Cass county,
							Missouri, where he engaged in teaching. Four years later he returned to Morgan county,
							Indiana, and taught in Adams, Ashland, Gregg and Jefferson townships, that county.
							While in the West he had united with the Christian church, but upon his return home he
							reclaimed his membership with the Methodist Episcopal church at Mount. Zion and
							continued a faithful member of that congregation until his death. On July 16, 1871,
							Mr. Wooden was married to Cordelia Wilhite, and to this union were born six children,
							Attie, Leslie, Guy, Maud, Hugh and Charles. On June 5, 1885, two angels visited their
							home. One was the angel of life, who brought with him the gift of the baby son,
							Charles, and the other was the angel of death, who took their mother home to God. For
							three years he struggled on alone, caring as best he could for the family of little
							children, and then, on January I, 1888, he was married to Sarah Ellen Fisher, thus
							bringing into the home one who has been to the children a devoted mother, counsellor
							and friend, and who has never tired in her efforts to make home what it should be. Mr.
							Wooden was a member of the Free and Accepted Masons and was <pb id="VAC1000-895"
								n="830"/> worshipful master of the local lodge at the time of his death. In the fall
							of 1901, Leslie, the oldest son, went west and has not been heard from since, so it is
							supposed by the family that he is dead. "Uncle Bob," as he was familiarly called, was
							a friend to everyone, and because of his jolly, loving disposition, he was always
							cheerful, and if he ever had troubles or disappointments he never discussed them with
							his friends.</p>

						<p>Daniel S. Hazlewood is a member of the Free and Accepted Masons at Hall, Indiana, and
							the Improved Order of Red Men at Hazlewood. He is also a member of the Order of the
							Eastern Star and the Pocahontas lodge.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hazlewood are the parents of three children, Gladys, Roy and Geneva. He
							and the members of his family are members of the Missionary Baptist church at
							Hazlewood and take a zealous interest in all of its activities. Mr. Hazlewood is a
							trustee of the church. Politically, he is a Democrat, but has never taken a very
							active part in the game of politics.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">EARL DUNCAN.</hi></head>

						<p>The men who till the soil are the men who stand at the foundation of the prosperity
							of our country. The profession of farming is one which antedates all others, and the
							only one which can exist independently of any other, and for this reason the farmer is
							the backbone of the nation. It is the product of his hands which fills the banks,
							turns the wheels of the factory and directs all the industries of the country. Farming
							is really the basic industry, and he who causes two blades of grass to grow where one
							formerly grew, is performing as useful a mission in life as the man who builds a
							flying machine, constructs a battle ship or digs the Panama canal.</p>

						<p>Earl Duncan, the son of William G. and Matilda (Barnes) Duncan, was born in Liberty
							township, Hendricks county, Indiana, November 11, 1878. William G. Duncan was one of
							the early pioneers of this county, and the history of the Duncan family may be
							considered typical of the history of many of the older families of this county, and it
							may be found elsewhere in this volume in the sketch of Charles P. Duncan, a brother of
							the subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>Earl Duncan spent his boyhood days on the home farm and received a good, practical
							education in the district schools of his home township. Marrying at the age of
							twenty-three, he immediately engaged in farming south of Amo, this county, and a year
							later moved to his father-in-law's farm <pb id="VAC1000-896" n="831"/> of one hundred
							and seventeen acres which he is now managing. In addition to raising all the crops of
							this locality, he makes a specialty of feeding hogs for the market, and he has gained
							the reputation of being one of the best hog raisers of the county, this branch of
							agriculture adding very materially to his annual income. He is a progressive farmer
							and does not hesitate to take advantage of the latest developments of machinery and
							the newest ideas in the culture of crops.</p>

						<p>Mr. Duncan was married on October 9, 1901, to Ada Reitzel, the daughter of George W.
							and Elizabeth (Norton) Reitzel, and to this marriage have been born three sons,
							Wendell, Russell and Ralph.</p>

						<p>George Washington Reitzel was born August 29, 1847, in Hendricks county, Indiana, and
							is the son of Daniel and Melvina (Burks) Reitzel. Daniel Reitzel was born in North
							Carolina, and came to Hendricks county, Indiana, with his brother, David, and
							brother-in-law, Joshua Pickett, when he was twenty-one years of age. Here Daniel
							Reitzel entered one hundred and sixty acres of land from the government, and two years
							later sold one hundred acres of his farm to Israel Jackson and sixty acres to David
							Reitzel, and he then returned to North Carolina, but shortly afterwards returned to
							this county and bought land in Clay township. Later he went into Hamilton county, but
							again returned to Hendricks county and bought a farm in Liberty township. He
							afterwards sold this and purchased a farm in Clay township and in the fall of 1869
							went west, where he bought a farm and died in 1873. Melvina Burks was born in
							Kentucky, and came to Putnam county, Indiana, with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Allen
							Burks, when a babe in arms. She died in 1878. Daniel Reitzel helped to build the first
							Lutheran church about one and three-fourths miles south of Pecksburg, this county,
							which was a rude log structure. Mr. Reitzel was very highly respected and esteemed in
							this county. He was twice married, and by his first marriage he had one daughter,
							Rachel Appleby, who lives east of Avon, Indiana. By Mr. Reitzel's second marriage
							there were nine children: Allen, who lives in Pecksburg, this county; George, the
							father of Mrs. Duncan; Ambrose, also a resident of Pecksburg; William, of Peru,
							Indiana; John, of Franklin township; Marcus, of Indianapolis, and three daughters who
							died in infancy. George W. Reitzel was married in 1883 to Lizzie Norton, daughter of
							Thomas and Rebecca (Harlan) Norton, and her death occurred in 1895. To this marriage
							there were born two children, Mrs. Ada Duncan, and Mrs. Hazel Patterson, of Hazelwood,
							Indiana. In 1907 George W. Reitzel was married to Julia Henderson and to this marriage
							were born two children, Helen <pb id="VAC1000-897" n="832"/> and William Allen. Mr.
							Reitzel has been a prosperous farmer in the county and is now the owner of two hundred
							and sixty-nine acres of good farming land in Liberty and Franklin townships. He is a
							member of the Masonic order at Clayton and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows at
							Monrovia. Mr. Reitzel is a Republican in politics and a loyal member of the Lutheran

						<p>Mr. Duncan is a Republican in politics and takes an active interest in the affairs of
							his party. He has been road superintendent for the past six years, his last term
							expiring January 1, 1914. He is a member of the Improved Order of Red Men at
							Hazelwood. Mr. and Mrs. Duncan are both members of the Christian church at Hazelwood

						<head><hi rend="center">CHARLES R. REED.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the honorable and influential citizens of Hendricks county, Indiana, is the
							subject of this review, who has here maintained his home for many years, winning a
							definite success by means of the agricultural industry, to which he has devoted his
							attention during the years of an active business life. His career has been without
							shadow of wrong or suspicion of evil, and thus he has ever commanded the confidence
							and respect of his fellow men.</p>

						<p>Charles R. Reed is a native of the old Hoosier state, having been born in Marion
							county about two miles south of Clermont, near the Hendricks county line, on January
							11, 1860, being the son of Thomas J. and Lucy (Hamilton) Reed, both of whom were
							natives of Ohio. Both came to Indiana in the early forties with their respective
							parents, while they were still small children. Thomas J. Reed was a son of Jediah and
							Catherine (Negelie) Reed, the former being of Scotch-Irish descent, while the latter
							was of German origin. From her native state of Pennsylvania she came to Ohio, where
							she and Jediah Reed were married. Jediah Reed was a tanner and carpenter by trade and
							after his marriage he came to Indiana and settled near Indianapolis, which was at that
							time but a thriving village. He often told of how he had hunted on the ground where
							the Marion county court house now stands. After residing in Indianapolis for a time,
							he removed to <pb id="VAC1000-898" n="833"/> near Clermont, where he worked for David
							McCurdy for several years. He then came to Hendricks county, where he operated a tan
							yard for Thornton Gorham in Lincoln township. About 1858 or 1859 he purchased land in
							Lincoln township near Clermont and lived in that vicinity until his death. Thomas J.
							Reed, father of the subject of this sketch, purchased a tract of forty acres south of
							Clermont about 180o or 1861. He later sold that and moved to Hamilton county, and it
							was while residing there that his wife (mother of the immediate subject of this
							sketch) died. After the death of his wife, Thomas J. Reed sold his farm in Hamilton
							county and came back to Hendricks county, where he bought forty acres in the
							southeastern part of Brown township and resided in that vicinity until his death. He
							was one of the prominent men of the community in his day, a man much honored and
							respected, and served the township as justice of the peace for a great many years.</p>

						<p>Charles R. Reed was one of a family of six children and remained with his parents
							until some fifteen or sixteen years of age, when he secured his first work as
							apprentice to the tile-makers' trade. On August 20, 1885, he was united in marriage
							with Sarah Ettie Ballard. After his marriage, he purchased fifty acres of land in the
							southeastern part of Brown township and has resided there ever since. Mrs. Reed was
							born just across the public highway from her present home, on August 28, 1863, being
							the daughter of James and Sarah (Corbly) Ballard, the former from Scott county,
							Kentucky, and the latter a native of Maryland. Both came to Indiana when quite young.
							Sarah Corbly's oldest brother, Richard by name, enjoyed the distinction of being the
							first white child born in Marion county. After James B. Reed and Sarah Corbly were
							married, they entered the one hundred and sixty acres where Sarah Ettie was born and
							lived there the remainder of their lives, rearing an interesting family of thirteen
							children.</p>

						<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Reed has been born one son, Earl Chester, who married Flo Erie Smith,
							daughter of Henry and Allie (Hilton) Smith. Earl Chester Reed lives about one-half
							mile north of Tilden, Indiana, on a farm belonging to his father-in-law. He entered
							Wabash College, but was forced to abandon his idea of completing his course, owing to
							ill health. He has one child, Reuel Irvin.</p>

						<p>While Mr. Reed is not a member of any church, he is interested in the Christian
							church, of which his wife and son are both members and are deeply interested in the
							affairs of that society. Fraternally, Mr. Reed is a member of the time-honored body of
							Free and Accepted Masons, and both he and his <pb id="VAC1000-899" n="834"/> wife are
							members of the Order of the Eastern Star. His career thus far has been a consistent
							and honorable one and, because of his stanch integrity and his accomplishments, he is
							entitled to hold the sincere confidence and good will of all who know him. He has been
							one of those solid men of brain and substance so essential to the material growth and
							prosperity of a community and whose influence has been willingly extended in behalf of
							every deserving enterprise that has for its object the advancement of the moral or
							material welfare of the community.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN RAYMOND MILES.</hi></head>

						<p>Hendricks county is able to boast of many old and prominent families, men and women
							whose ancestors for several generations have written their names upon the pages of the
							history of the county. Among these, the names of Miles and Brady are well known, and
							in our present article we wish to speak of both.</p>

						<p>John Raymond Miles, one of the prominent young farmers of the locality, first saw the
							light of day upon the farm where he now resides, a trifle less than two miles
							northeast of Clayton, on the 21st day of May, 1883. He is the son of Thomas J. Miles,
							a prominent and influential farmer of this locality. This gentleman, of whom we have
							spoken elsewhere in this volume, was born in 1842 near Belleville, a son of John and
							Martha Miles. Here he spent his youth and received his schooling, and here, later, he
							met and married Tabitha Tudor, whose birth occurred in Morgan county, in 1852.</p>

						<p>The immediate subject of this article, John Raymond Miles, spent his childhood and
							youth upon the homestead farm, receiving his schooling in the township schools, and as
							he grew to manhood and assisted his father with the various activities of the place,
							he was taught the best agricultural methods of the time, and to this wise training his
							present success is largely due.</p>

						<p>In the year 1905 was solemnized Mr. Miles' marriage to Lela Brady, whose birth also
							occurred in Hendricks county. In fact her ancestry dates back to many generations of
							Hendricks county citizens. Her parents, Wesley and Catherine (Riggins) Brady, were
							also born in Center township, and here, after their marriage, their homestead was
							established. Mr. Brady was a most successful farmer, aggressive and intelligent, but
							his greatest business successes have been in the breeding and sale of fine live stock,
							in which department he is an authority. In the year 1904 he disposed of his farm and
								<pb id="VAC1000-900" n="835"/> moved into Danville, engaging there in the livery
							business and dealing largely in fine horses.</p>

						<p>Mrs. Miles remained in the home of her parents until her marriage, receiving her
							schooling in the neighboring schools, but when, in 1905, she was married to Mr. Miles,
							the young people established their home in Clayton and for two years they resided here
							while Mr. Miles continued his agricultural pursuits upon the farm of his father, the
							homestead where he was born. As time elapsed, however, it seemed advisable for the
							young people to take up their abode also upon the farm, and here they have remained.
							Mr. Miles is now the owner of this beautiful estate, including three hundred and
							ninety acres of land. A successful farmer he has proven, combining industry and energy
							with modern methods and sound judgment, and, although a young man, he is already
							widely known and highly esteemed as a successful business man and also for his
							sterling qualities. A little daughter, May Geraldine, came to bless their home on the
							5th day of January, 1906, and is now her mother's able assistant. Their home is noted
							for its genial hospitality, and the charming social graces of the hostess and the
							warmth of welcome extended by the host have endeared the family and their home to the
							many friends who surround them.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">WILLIAM BAXTER VESTAL.</hi></head>

						<p>The gentleman of whom this chronicle speaks is one of the honored pioneers of
							Hendricks county, Indiana, and for over a half century he has been a valued factor in
							the development of the same, prominently identified with the varied interests of his
							community. His well-directed energies in the practical affairs of life, his capable
							management of his own business interests and his sound judgment have demonstrated what
							may be accomplished by the man of energy and ambition, who, persevering often in the
							face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles, proves that he is the possessor of those
							innate qualities that never fail to bring success if properly directed, as they have
							evidently been in the case of Mr. Vestal.</p>

						<p>William Baxter Vestal, a son of Gabin and Catherine (Richards) Vestal, was born in
							Guilford township, this county, October 29, 1849. The early education of Mr. Vestal
							was received in the subscription schools of his township of that day and when a young
							man of twenty he went to Indianapolis and took employment with the George Merritt
							Company, manufacturers <pb id="VAC1000-901" n="836"/> of woolens, with which firm he
							remained for twenty-five years, being advanced from time to time to positions of
							additional responsibility until, when he left there in 1894, he was the general
							manager of the company. In the latter year he purchased a farm of one hundred and
							sixty acres in Guilford township, this county, on which he has been living for the
							past twenty years.</p>

						<p>Mr. Vestal was married March 12, 1874, to Emma McCall, the daughter of James and
							Susan McCall, of Lancaster, Ohio. Her father was a carriage maker of that place. Her
							mother is a second cousin of Gen. William T. Sherman of Civil-war fame. Mrs. Vestal
							was one of six children born to her parents, and Mr. and Mrs. Vestal have a family of
							four children: Frank J., of Anderson, Indiana, is now chief engineer of the Union
							Traction Company; he married Esther Moore, the daughter of John S. Moore, of
							Plainfield. He was born October 5, 1875, and was educated in the academy at the latter
							place. He and his wife are the parents of one daughter, born in June, 1903. Catherine
							May, born April 2, 1878, is the wife of Halstead H. Mills, of Detroit, Michigan, who
							is a boiler inspector for the Hartford Insurance Company, and they have two children,
							Jeannette, born November 25, 1906, and Georgia B., born February 4, 1909. Georgia
							Emma, born August 24, 1881, is the wife of Wilbur Sherfy, of Billings, Montana, a
							civil engineer, a graduate of Purdue University, and now in the employ of the United
							States reclamation service. William Baxter, Jr., the youngest one of the children, was
							born September 13, 1887, and received his education at the Montana State College. He
							is now the assistant engineer of the city of Bozeman, Montana, and has charge of the
							special train which makes an annual tour through the state of Montana, advertising his
							city.</p>

						<p>Mr. and Mrs. Vestal are both consistent and faithful members of the Methodist
							Episcopal church of Bridgeport, and contribute liberally of their substance to its
							support. In his fraternal relations Mr. Vestal is a member of the blue lodge, council
							and chapter of Masons, and also holds membership in the Knights of Pythias. Mr. Vestal
							has always been a Republican in politics and has been very active in the councils of
							his party, and in 1901 he was elected to the lower house of the Legislature from
							Hendricks county and served in that law-making body with distinction to himself and
							satisfaction to his constituents. The Legislature passed a law organizing advisory
							boards in each township in the state, and Mr. Vestal became the chairman of the first
							advisory board of his home township. In fact, he has always been interested in the
							public welfare of his community and has never forgotten the obligations <pb
								id="VAC1000-902" n="837"/> which he owes to the public. His support of such measures
							and movements which make for the general good can always be depended upon and he is,
							in the full sense of the term, a representative and self-made American and thoroughly
							in harmony with the spirit of the advanced age in which he lives. He has not permitted
							the accumulation of wealth to affect in any way his actions toward those less

						<head><hi rend="center">CHARLES W. MILLS.</hi></head>

						<p>Among the men of Hendricks county who have wandered far from their native heath and
							won success in foreign fields is Charles W. Wills. When a young man he enlisted in the
							regular army and for three years was under the command of the President of the United
							States. He was shifted hither and thither over the extensive territory of our nation
							from Puerto Rico to the far Philippines on the west. During all of his service he
							conducted himself as a genuine American soldier and upon the expiration of his
							enlistment he became a general contractor of Indianapolis. Still later he engaged in
							the manufacture of automobiles, but the call of the farm was not to be disobeyed and
							several years ago he moved onto the old homestead farm, where he is now living the
							life of the plain and unostentatious farmer.</p>

						<p>Charles W. Mills, one of the distinguished sons of Hendricks county, was born in
							Guilford township, October 24, 1870. His parents were William P. and Olive (Mattem)
							Mills, his father being born in Ohio September 17, 1846. William P. Mills came to
							Indiana when a youth with his parents and settled in Guilford township, and on the
							home farm which his father left him he lived all of his life until he retired at
							Plainfield a few years ago, with the exception of a few years when he was in the
							general merchandise business at West Newton, Marion county. The wife of William P.
							Mills was born at Bridgeport in Marion county in 1849. Her ancestors came from
							Pennsylvania and Ohio respectively. Her father was a blacksmith by trade and died in
							1893, her mother having passed away in February, 1873. Mr. and Mrs. William P. Mills
							were the parents of three children: Charles W., whose career is herein presented to
							the reader; Pearl C., born March 10, 1876, and a widow of Elbin C. Hadley; Henry
							Halstead, born October 26, 1880, who is at present a boiler inspector for the Hartford
							Insurance Company of Detroit. Henry married Catherine Vestal, of Plainfield, and has
							two children, Jeanette and Georgia.</p>

						<p>Mr. Mills received his education in the common schools of Guilford township <pb
								id="VAC1000-903" n="838"/> and later graduated from the academy at Plainfield. He
							then took a complete course in the Indianapolis Business College, after which he
							enlisted for three years as a soldier in the United States regular army. After his
							enlistment had expired he settled in Indianapolis, where he went into the contracting
							and building business for a number of years, after which he disposed of his business
							and entered into the automobile manufacturing business and continued at that for seven
							years in Indianapolis. Upon his father's retirement from the farm, he took charge of
							the old home place and has been no less successful in the farming profession than he
							was as a manufacturer and contractor. In the time he has been on the old home place he
							has improved it in various ways and is rapidly bringing the farm to a higher state of
							productivity.</p>

						<p>Mr. Mills was married October 12, 1902, to Levada O'Mullane, of Owen county, Indiana,
							the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James O'Mullane. To Mr. and Mrs. Mills have been born
							five children, all of whom are still at home: Dorothy Pearl, Charles Julian, Beverly
							O'Mullane, Max Owen and Sherman Eugene.</p>

						<p>Mr. Mills and his family are members of the Methodist Episcopal church at Bridgeport.
							He lent his support to the Democratic party and is in hearty sympathy with the
							Bryan-Wilson movement in Indiana at the present time. Mr. Mills' life has been one of
							action and persistence and the systematic and honorable methods which he has followed
							have resulted in not only gaining the confidence of those with whom he has had
							dealings, but also in elevating him in the esteem of his fellowmen. He is a man of
							pleasing address and is noted for his hospitality and kindliness.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">ELI H. ANDERSON.</hi></head>

						<p>The agricultural interests of Guilford township, Hendricks county, have an able
							representative in Eli H. Anderson, a man who has succeeded in his chosen life work
							because he has worked persistently along such lines as cannot well fail in bringing
							success. He never lets the grass grow under his feet, but is always busy, and he
							believes in doing well whatever he attempts; thus, by having system in all his work,
							he has forged to the front and is in every way deserving of the respect in which he is
							held by all who know him.</p>

						<p>Eli H. Anderson, one of the most extensive land holders of Hendricks county, was born
							March 18, 1865, in the town of Mooresville. His parents were Thomas C. and Anna
							(White) Anderson, his father being a native <pb id="VAC1000-904" n="839"/> of Ohio and
							his mother of Wayne county, Indiana. Thomas Anderson, a farmer and brick mason, came
							to Hendricks county before the war and settled in Washington township, where he bought
							a quarter of a section of land. After three years' residence on this farm, he moved to
							Six Points, in this county, where he farmed for the next nine years. The remainder of
							his life was spent in Iroquois county, Illinois, where he died in 1873, his wife dying
							September 24, 1898. To Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Anderson were born four children, only two
							of whom are living, Benjamin W., whose history is set forth in this volume, and Eli
							H.</p>

						<p>Eli H. Anderson is proud of the fact that he was born in a rude log cabin in the
							midst of a little clearing which his father had made on their farm. In this little
							cabin, surrounded by very primitive conditions, he and his brothers and sisters grew
							up. Their parents were ambitious for their children and gave them the best schooling
							which the neighborhood afforded. Hard work was the portion that was deeded out to the
							children of the Anderson family and what they profited by this is shown in the success
							that has attended the two living children, Eli and Benjamin. The whole life of Eli H.
							Anderson has been spent upon the farm and there is no feature of farming life that he
							does not thoroughly understand; he has made it his life study, and now, in the present
							day when the teaching of agriculture is becoming general throughout the country, it
							seems that farming is to be raised to the dignity of a profession.</p>

						<p>Mr. Anderson was married February 27, 1901, to Lucille Nysewander, daughter of Mr.
							and Mrs. Jasper Nysewander. Mrs. Anderson was born near Plainfield and is one of a
							family of eight children, both of her parents being deceased. Mr. and Mrs. Anderson
							have two sons, Benjamin Rufus, born September 2, 1903, and Clifford Eli, born March 9,
							1905. Mr. Anderson is a member of the Knights of Pythias and is interested in the
							activities of the lodge. He lends his strong support to the Republican party.
							Religiously, he is a member of the Friends church, and may always be found in hearty
							co-operation with those who are advancing the welfare of his community. Mr. Anderson
							has been a life-long farmer and has been living on his present farm of four hundred
							and forty acres for the past fourteen years, where he does general farming which is
							peculiar to this locality. He has made a specialty of stock raising and finds this a
							valuable addition to his yearly income from the farm. In all the relations of life he
							has proved a man among men and because of his sterling qualities and stanch integrity
							he is well deserving of the confidence which has been placed in him by his fellow
							citizens.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">JOHN L. PORTWOOD.</hi></head>

						<p>Agriculture has been an honored vocation from the earliest ages and, as a usual
							thing, men of honorable and humane impulses, as well as those of energy and thrift,
							have been patrons of husbandry. The free, outdoor life of the farm has a tendency to
							foster and develop that independence of mind and self-reliance which characterize true
							manhood and no greater blessing cart befall a boy than to be reared in close touch
							with nature in the healthful, life-inspiring labor of the fields. It has always been
							the fruitful soil from which have sprung the moral bone and sinew of the country, and
							the majority of our nation's scholars and distinguished man of letters were born on
							the farm and are indebted to its early influence for the distinction which they have
							attained.</p>

						<p>John L. Portwood was born in Estill county, Kentucky, on January 17, 1867, the son of
							Leonard and Martha (Portwood) Portwood, both of whom were natives of that state.
							Martha Portwood was a daughter of Joseph and Susan (Gentry) Portwood. The family were
							slave holders, as were most Kentuckians of that day who were at all blessed with this
							world's goods. Leonard Portwood, father of the immediate subject of this sketch, was
							also an owner of slaves, having three at the time of the opening of the late
							rebellion. John L. Portwood was a child of but twenty-two months of age when his
							father, Leonard, departed this life, and the widow continued to operate the plantation
							with the assistance of her older sons. The subject lived with his mother until the
							time of his marriage, when he came to Indiana, locating in Hendricks county, where he
							engaged in agricultural work, hiring out by the month to farmers in the community. He
							continued in this way for four years, saving as best he could and at that time he was
							able to purchase one acre of ground about a mile and a half east of Brownsburg. He put
							this acre into an excellent state of cultivation, raising small garden truck thereon
							and also rented a larger tract of land close by, where he carried on general farming.
							He was in a way to prosper and at the end of four years had earned and saved
							sufficient money to purchase forty acres of land, located something over two miles
							northeast of Brownsburg. There he lived for two years, when he sold it and bought a
							forty-acre tract four miles northeast of Danville. There he lived for two years, and
							in 1906 sold it and purchased the seventy acres where he now resides, some three miles
							north of Brownsburg. Mr. Portwood has never specialized on any particular line of
							crops or stock, simply carrying on general farming, but this he has made <pb
								id="VAC1000-906" n="841"/> pay him well, owing to his unfailing energy, untiring
							effort and excellent business ability. In his youth he received but a limited
							education, but has endeavored to overcome this handicap in every possible way and has
							won out through his pluck and determination. When Mr. Portwood arrived in Brownsburg
							from Kentucky he had but fifty cents in his pocket and through his own judicious
							management and effort he has made for himself his comfortable home and well cultivated
							acres.</p>

						<p>In 1894 Mr. Portwood was united in marriage with Rhoda Richardson, who was born
							December 10, 1877, the daughter of Basil and Amy (Thompson) Richardson. All were
							natives of Kentucky. Amy Thompson was a daughter of Jesse and Elizabeth (Riddle)
							Thompson and Basil Richardson was a son of David and Polly (White) Richardson. To the
							subject and wife have been born nine children, namely: Avery L., John, Nora, Bertha,
							Chester, Herman, Hazel, Martha and Lucile, all of whom are with the parents. The
							family is highly respected and considered among the leading citizens of the community.
							Both Mr. and Mrs. Thompson are members of the Christian church and give of time and
							means to further the cause of that society in their community. Mr. Portwood is a man
							whom to know is to admire, for he has led a most exemplary life and has sought to do
							his duty in all relations with his fellow men, being a man of honor, unswerving
							integrity and enterprise, consequently he is eminently deserving of mention in a
							history of his county, along with other well-known and representative citizens.</p>

						<p>The present age is essentially utilitarian and the life of every successful man
							carries a lesson which, told in contemporary narrative, is productive of much good in
							shaping the destiny of others. There is, therefore, a due measure of satisfaction in
							presenting, even in brief resume, the life and achievements of such men, and in
							preparing the following history of the progressive farmer and dairyman whose name
							appears above, it is with the hope that it may prove not only interesting and
							instructive, but also serve as an incentive to those who contemplate making
							agriculture their life work.</p>

						<p>John Hadley Almond, the son of Pleasant and Minerva J. (Hadley) Almond, was born near
							Plainfield, Indiana, October 12, 1865. His parents were both natives of Hendricks
							county, his father dying December 10, 1907, <pb id="VAC1000-907" n="842"/> on the farm
							which he bought in 1857; his wife died on the old home farm on October 26, 1873. Mr.
							and Mrs. Pleasant Almond were the parents of four children: Theophilus, who died in
							April, 1893; Roscoe; John Hadley; and Sarah C., who died October 8, 1873.</p>

						<p>John H. Almond received his education in the district schools and completed his
							course in the Plainfield Academy. Until his marriage he worked on his father's farm
							and immediately after his marriage he went onto a farm of his own, where he has
							continued with uniform success up to the present time as a farmer and stock raiser.
							Though he has not neglected his general farming, he has paid special attention to his
							live stock business. At present he is conducting an extensive dairy and has had
							remarkable success in this line of business.</p>

						<p>Mr. Almond was married March 13, 1889, to Emma J. Hadley, of Morgan county, the
							daughter of Zimri and Luretha Hadley, and to their union have been born four children:
							Luretha M., born February 28, 1892, and died August 27, 1913; Eliza O., born June 10,
							1895; Laura L., born April 21, 1896; Earl C., born September 23, 1898. Eliza and Laura
							have both graduated from the Central Academy and the youngest child is now in the
							academy. Mr. and Mrs. Almond are giving their children the advantages of an education
							and have assisted them in every way to prepare themselves for their teacher's
							career.</p>

						<p>Mr. Almond has been a stanch supporter of the Republican ticket and has taken a part
							in the local conventions of his party, although he has never been a candidate for any
							office at the hands of his party. He and the rest of his family are loyal members of
							the Friends church and are interested in all of the activities of that denomination.
							Mr. Almond is one of those men who has a splendid personality and has always been an
							energetic and enterprising citizen who has attained a definite success because he
							worked for it. For this reason he justly merits the respect and esteem which has been
							so willingly accorded him by his fellow citizens.</p>

						<head><hi rend="center">COL. JOHN T. BARNETT.</hi></head>

						<p>There is one profession which has enrolled very few men from Hendricks county and
							that is the military service of the United States. Col. John T. Barnett was the first
							man of the county to graduate from West Point Military Academy, and the second man
							from the county to command a <pb id="VAC1000-908" n="843"/> regiment during a war. He
							has had a long and varied career in the service of his country, and since his
							retirement, on account of disability, he has been no less active in civil life.</p>

						<p>Col. John T. Barnett, who is now living at No. 2001 North Delaware street,
							Indianapolis, Indiana, was born three miles west of Danville, September 2, 1851, on
							the same farm which his father entered from the government. His parents were William
							and Nancy (Buchanan) Barnett. His father was a native of Fluvanna county, old
							Virginia. William Barnett, with his parents, came west and settled in Shelby county,
							Kentucky, in 1808. About 1832 William Barnett came to Hendricks county, Indiana, and
							bought and settled on the farm where he lived the rest of his life.</p>

						<p>Nancy Buchanan Barnett was a direct descendant of the famous Scottish scholar,
							historian and poet, George Buchanan, of the Scottish clan of Buchanan. Her
							grandfather, Alexander Buchanan, came direct from Scotland to this country about 1760.
							She was born and raised near Versailles in Woodford county, Kentucky. With her father
							she came to Hendricks county, Indiana, as a young woman and settled near old
							Belleville. She was united in marriage to William Barnett about 1840.</p>

						<p>William and Nancy Barnett were prominent and active members of the Missionary Baptist
							church throughout their lives, he being clerk of the church from the time he came to
							Hendricks county till his death. He died in 1875, at the age of seventy-one years. His
							widow, Nancy Barnett, lived on said farm till her death in 1899 in the seventy-ninth
							year of her life.</p>

						<p>To William and Nancy Barnett were born seven children, five of whom are still living:
							Levi A. Barnett, of Danville, Indiana; Mrs. Harriet Ellen McKitrick, of Indianapolis,
							Indiana; Dr. Eli S. Barnett, of Salt Lake City, Utah; Mrs. Nancy A. Whatley, whose
							husband is an eminent physician of Parral, old Mexico; and Col. John T. Barnett, the
							immediate subject of this sketch.</p>

						<p>Col. John T. Barnett received his early education in the district schools of his
							township and the old Danville Academy. After teaching school about one year he entered
							Asbury (De Pauw) University in the fall of 1871, and he completed the freshman year
							with the class of 1875. Receiving an appointment to the United States Military Academy
							at West Point, New York, upon the recommendation of Gen. John Coburn, the then
							congressman, he entered said academy in June, 1873. He graduated from the Military
							Academy in June, 1878. number fourteen in his class. He stood specially well in his
							class in mathematics and allied subjects. Colonel Barnett was obliged to remain out
								<pb id="VAC1000-909" n="844"/> of the academy one year on account of severe illness
							from typhoid fever. He was assigned to the Fifth United States Cavalry as second
							lieutenant United States Army.</p>

						<p>After the customary graduating leave of absence, he joined the Fifth United States
							Cavalry October 1, 1878, at Fort D. A. Russell, near Cheyenne, Wyoming. He was in
							active service during the next eight years, and served at various posts with his
							regiment and on detached duty in Wyoming and Texas. In 1886, he was compelled to
							retire from active service on account of disability incurred in line of duty, since
							which time he has been on the retired list of the United States Army. After his
							retirement he settled in Danville for awhile, but his health still remained very
							precarious. He suffered from nervous prostration, and spinal anemia which was largely
							brought on by mountain fever and the high altitude in which he served during his
							active service.</p>

						<p>In 1893 Colonel Barnett moved to Indianapolis and settled on Meridian street, where
							he lived for about one year. His health having somewhat improved, he removed to Piqua,
							Ohio, in the spring of 1894 and engaged in the hardware business. He became principal
							owner, president and manager of the Barnett Hardware Company at Piqua and remained as
							such till 1899, when he disposed of his interests and returned to Indianapolis, where
							he now lives at the corner of Twentieth and Delaware streets. Upon his return to
							Indianapolis he engaged in the manufacturing pharmaceutical business for a short time
							till a return of his old disease caused him to give it up. When he again became
							improved in health he engaged in his present real estate, loan and insurance business.
							His office is now at No. 50 North Delaware street, Indianapolis.</p>

						<p>In 1893 Colonel Barnett was appointed by Governor Matthews, assistant inspector
							general of the Indiana National Guard, with the rank of major, which position he held
							till about 1895, when he resigned on account of absence from the state. At the
							beginning of the Spanish-American war, Colonel Barnett offered his services to the
							secretary of war and to the governors of Ohio and Indiana.</p>

						<p>The Governor of Indiana availed himself of his valuable services and he was appointed
							colonel and commander of the One Hundred and Fifty-ninth Regiment Indiana Volunteer
							Infantry in May, 1898, and he at once took his regiment to Camp Alger, Virginia. The
							regiment was stationed at Camp Alger, Thoroughfare Gap, Virginia, Camp Meade.
							Pennsylvania, and was mustered out of the service at Camp Mount, Indianapolis, about
							the middle <pb id="VAC1000-910" n="845"/> of November, 1898. While at Camp Alger,
							Colonel Barnett commanded the Second Division of the Second Army Corps for a short
							time, and his brigade for about one-half of the time he was in the service.</p>

						<p>On the 18th of December, 1879, Colonel Barnett was married to Emma Charlotte Peirsol,
							the only daughter of Isaac and Elizabeth J. Peirsol, a prominent family of Hendricks
							county, Isaac Peirsol being a successful merchant and banker of Danville. To Colonel
							and Emma C. Barnett two children were born: William P., who died at birth, February
							14, 1881, and Chester P., born January 14, 1887. Emma C. Barnett died in May, 1892,
							and in the following year Colonel Barnett married Cora C. Campbell, the daughter of L.
							M. Campbell, a prominent lawyer of Danville, Ind. No children were born of this second
							marriage.</p>

						<p>Chester P. Barnett, the only child of Colonel Barnett, graduated from Manual Training
							high school at Indianapolis and immediately entered West Point Military Academy, from
							which he graduated in 1910. He was attached to the Fifteenth United States Cavalry and
							stationed at Fort Meyer, Virginia, until September, 1913, when he was transferred with
							his regiment to Fort Bliss, Texas. He is now in the midst of the stirring events which
							are taking place there every day. Chester was married, in June, 1911, to Katherine
							Davis Brown, the granddaughter of ex-Senator Henry Gassaway Davis, of West Virginia,
							and to this happy union there has been born one son, Davis Peirsol Barnett. Colonel
							Barnett can be justly proud of the fine record his son is now making. Chester P.
							Barnett has an estate in Hendricks county valued at sixty thousand dollars.</p>

						<p>Colonel Barnett was a member of the Sigma Chi Greek-letter fraternity while in.
							DePauw University and is a member of the alumni chapter at Indianapolis, being
							president of the same for one year. He is a member of the Sons of the Revolution and
							served as its president, and has been on its board of managers since 1899. He has
							always been interested in Masonry and has belonged to the fraternity since he was
							twenty-one years of age. As a member of the Chamber of Commerce, he is chairman of its
							military committee. He is a member of the Military Order of Foreign Wars, Spanish War
							Veterans, and Spanish War Camp, of all of which he has been commander. In politics the
							Colonel has always been identified with the Democratic party and is a member of the
							Indiana Democratic Club. He is a member of the Christian church and contributes to its
							support. Colonel Barnett has led a very busy and useful career and has made a name for
							himself in his profession.</p>
