            <p>Albert Jeremiah Beveridge, author, lecturer, <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator and historian, was born in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Hiighland
                        County</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, October 6, 1862.
                    Before the Civil War his father migrated from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> to this county where he bought a farm. The four half-brothers as well as the father saw
                    service in the Union armies. Following the War, the family suffered business reverses, the farm was
                    lost, and the family then moved to Sullivan, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The early education of Albert was meagre. As he grew older, he was able, by working
                    early and late, to acquire the rudiments of a high school course.</p>
            <p>The early occupations of the boy were of a strenuous nature. He was first employed on a farm at the
                    age of twelve. He worked on a railroad as a section hand for the next two years. He then spent a
                    year as a logger and a teamster. The following summer, at the age of sixteen, he was placed in
                    charge of a lumber camp, due to the fact that he was industrious and had a natural aptitude for
                    commanding men. It was here that he learned the "art of profanity." This habit
                    stayed with him, for the rough speech of this crude early environment <pb n="140" id="VAA4025-024-3-002"/> became rooted in him; however, it was merely a superficial habit.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1882, this slender, rugged young man, keen and alert of face, with a powerful jaw, gray-blue eyes,
                    and a perfect mop of long hair, secured fifty dollars and entered DePauw University, at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>, <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>. He registered in the classical course, one of those offered at
                    that time.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Beveridge was a vigorous student from the beginning of his college
                    life to the end of his varied career. He was methodical in his study, had a great mount of
                    perseverance, and was almost incapable of either mental or physical fatigue. Greek and Latin were
                    required subjects in the classical course. The first year he took both languages. He had never
                    studied Latin so he had to start at the beginning in this as well as in Greek. At the end of the
                    first year he asked Dr. Edwin Post to give him an examination over the first two years of work in
                    Latin. It was an absurd request, in the opinion of Dr. Post, but he reluctantly consented. To his
                    utter amazement Beveridge passed the test making an excellent grade.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In
                    addition to this extra work he competed in all academic contests open to him. In this field he was
                    unusually successful, winning every contest he entered the first year and every year thereafter with
                    but one exception.</p>
            <p>His assiduity as a student was exceptional. His varied activities were made possible by his scheme of
                    budgeting his time. He made out a daily program and adhered to it rigidly. In fact, he was so
                    diligent in living up to it that a fellow student states that, "There was not a minute of
                    the day that he did not know where Beveridge was if he had his schedule".<hi rend="sup">âˆ—</hi> His rigid economy or conservation of time is exemplified by his allowing
                    himself only fifteen minutes for the general session at Langdon Hall after the evening meal, while
                    most of the students lingered an hour or more. On the campus he always walked as fast as possible
                    with his characteristic springy step, as if the next thing to be done could not wait another minute.
                    He was usually quite irritated if some one stopped him on the <list type="footnotes">

                    allowed himself only four hours of sleep, as his schedule of work for the early morning hours was
                    very heavy.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> His studies came first, while his pleasure and even his sleep were
                    of secondary importance.</p>
            <p>The Chief extra-curricular activity at the University was the Literary Club, commonly known by the
                    boys as "Old Plato". Interest in the organization lagged, in a way, except at
                    election times when politics was indulged in to a great extent. The opposing factions were led by
                    Beveridge on the one hand and by James E. Watson on the other. Such elections were excellent schools
                    for the application of practical politics. Between election days, the scheduled meetings usually
                    consisted of debates on a variety of subjects. It was a usual practice, after the regular business
                    was over, for someone to move that the regular order be dispensed with and that extemporaneous
                    debate be substituted. That usually meant a joint discussion between Beveridge and Charles Henry
                    Mc-Anny, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>

            </p>
            <p>Oratory at DePauw was one of the outstanding fields of endeavor. The student who could give an
                    excellent oration was admired as our college football star is to-day. Students interested in public
                    speaking put in as much time and effort in attaining skill as the modern athlete does. Speeches not
                    only had to be conceived and memorized but the voice had to be cultivated as well. Long before
                    sunrise, even in the winter months, Beveridge would set out across the fields to the woods to
                    practice his voice exercises, returning an hour or so before breakfast to study the classics or to
                    read the great orations.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> He purchased a book on elocution and studied it. As he
                    wrote out his first speeches, he would indicate here and there that certain gestures should be made.
                    He practiced these speeches and gestures before the mirror until he had the art fully mastered. In
                    later years his gestures came as a natural reaction</p>

            <p>The student who won the oratorical prize at DePauw earned one of the highest honors attainable. The
                    first year Beveridge was in school he won prizes in philosophy, science, and oratory. As a
                    sopohomore he won many oratorical prizes. While a junior he continued to take first place in every
                    oratorical contest, his efforts reaching a climax when he won the State oratorical contest. This
                    entitled him to compete with the representatives of all the colleges and universities in the West
                    and Northwest the following year. The great contest was held in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, May 7,
                    1885. By winning this interstate contest, he reached the highest point of his college oratorical
                    career. On his return to the University, President Alexander Martin, the faculty, the band, the
                    student body, and townspeople escorted him through the streets to Meharry Hall where a large
                    audience had assembled to celebrate his victory. President Martin representing the faculty and the
                    administration gave a short speech of welcome, while James E. Watson represented the student
                        body.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While in the University Beveridge worked as steward of a boarding club to help pay his expenses.
                    During the summer months he sold books in a western State. His first year in this occupation was so
                    successful that the company, for which he worked, had him train a group of students to carry out the
                    work more extensively. After three months of preparation and practice on the townspeople of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he led his band of super-salesmen into the State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> to sell a book entitled <hi rend="i">Errors Chains</hi>, a history of religions. They
                    were so successful in fastening those "Chains" on the State that David Graham
                    Phillips remarks: "I do not think any other body of book sellers ever made so much money in
                    so short a time."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>After graduating from the University, he went West and worked on a ranch to build up his health. On
                    his return, he was admitted to the law office of McDonald and <placeName>

                    lack of legal ability he ought to be able to accept. He finally accepted and stayed with them
                    approximately three years. He assited them ably in several important cases. One of the most noted,
                    and his first case before a jury, was that of the Massillon Bridge Company vs. the Commissioners of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lawrence County</region>
                    </placeName>. It was fiercely contested throughout with Benjamin Harrison and associates on the one
                    side and McDonald and associates on the other.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beveridge began the practice of law for himself in 1889. He found it difficult to get started, but he
                    soon attracted the attention of Governor Alvin P. Hovey and others in the famous State
                    Officer's case. From this time on he was more successful.</p>
            <p>Early in his practice, Beveridge forsook the tedious, technical, and detailed side of the practice,
                    as well as the ordinary petty cases that consume the time of many lawyers. He confined himself to
                    those cases of greater importance where fundamental principles and questions relating to the
                    construction of our National and State Constitutions were involved. Whenever a case came up, in
                    which he was concerned, however trivial, it was tried upon issues of constitutional law, if any
                    possible relation thereto could be found.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> It was in this way, that he became
                    known in legal circles as a constitutional lawyer.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>

            <p>The language that Beveridge used in his arguments and the manner in which this accomplished orator
                    presented and pleaded his cases were unusually convincing. Judge Baker relates the following court
                    incident, which is a sample of the powers of Beveridge in this respect. He brought a damage suit for
                    a man who had been wrongfully ejected from a train, by the conductor, in the belief that his
                    thousand-mile ticket did not belong to him. The case was tried twice. As a result of the first
                    trial, Mr. Beveridge recovered for his client a verdict of one thousand dollars. The verdict was set
                    aside. On the second trial, he saw the interested jurymen, who heard the case, with elbows on their
                    knees, drinking in the eloquence, pathos, and wit of the orator with the same eagerness that a young
                    robin watches the return of the mother bird with its morning meal. He swept the jury off its feet as
                    he described the awful anguish which this client had suffered by being put off the train. The jury
                    awarded the client $2,500. One of the most eminent lawyers of the city made a motion for
                    a new trial on the ground that the award was far too large. Judge Baker observed with dry humor that
                    the verdict awarded by the jury was indeed two or three times what it should be, but added that he
                    feared to set it aside lest if Mr. Beveridge be given a chance to take the case a third time, he
                    should persuade the jury to give his client a verdict of $5,000.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Noel also avers that Beveridge secured an acquittal from a jury in a hopeless case by making an
                    argument upon State comity, with a peroration upon the American Flag.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beveridge's success in law was unusual. He obtained a high place in his profession largely
                    because of his natural ability, his industry, his versatility, his fine power of analysis, and his
                    quick resistance to sophistry.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first important connection that Beveridge had with politics in Indiana was in 1884 at which time
                    he started on his "stumping" tours of the State for the Republican party. He made
                    his first speech in a rural blacksmith shop in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Parke County</region>
                    </placeName> and the next in a barn in the same county. Soon afterward he was scheduled to speak at

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. When the members of the committee saw this raw-boned, white faced college lad step
                    from the train and answer to the name of Beveridge, they were astounded. A feeling of disgust took
                    possession of all who had gathered there, and it soon looked as if he were to be without an
                    audience. It was necessary, then, that he lose no time. He was introduced and began his speech at
                    once. His oratory and his fluent use of English soon won him the attention and sympathy of the
                    audience. He talked for three hours and made such an impression that he was asked by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Republicans to speak in every subsequent campaign.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His speeches were well prepared and well delivered. His broad, sweeping, terse statements at the
                    beginning of each topic of discussion and then the expanding of these statements in a logical way
                    made it possible for him to greatly influence his audience and convince waverers. He appealed to the
                    intellect and to the reason of his audience as well as to the emotions.</p>
            <p>In those days oratory counted a great deal in getting votes, and in this respect Beveridge had no
                    peer. He adapted his discourses to his audiences in order to make his pleas more effective. He also
                    knew how to take care of local elections; and after each speech, as a rule, he privately instructed
                    the local politicians on election procedure.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Needless to say the party often
                    gained votes in localities in which he spoke.</p>
            <p>In subsequent campaigns Beveridge toured the State, in his characteristic way, in the interests of
                    the Republican party. He had large and enthusiastic audiences at every meeting for he was one of the
                    most popular political speakers of the time. While on these tours he made many friends; and,
                    although he did not organize them for personal benefit, he found them to be loyal supporters when he
                    sought his first political office.</p>
            <p>Not only did the Republican party in Indiana use this orator to further its interests, but the party
                    in other States frequently called upon him to speak for them in campaign years. <list type="footnotes">

            <p rend="center">ELECTION TO THE SENATE</p>
            <p>Between 1888 and 1892, the Republican party declined to the extent that the Democrats were able to
                    elect a President, and, in Indiana, to send enough men to the State Legislature to elect a
                    Democratic Senator, David Turpie. Soon thereafter the Republican party was reorganized and new life
                    was infused into its ranks. This, together with various other factors, especially the economic

                    The Democrats were overwhelmingly defeated in the congressional elections of 1894. In 1896, a
                    Republican President was elected, together with enough Republican members of the State Legislature

                    Albert J. Beveridge, Indiana's best campaigners, were sent throughout the State in the

            <p>The chief controversial point of the campaign was the money question. Congressman Overstreet of the
                    Seventh district was sponsoring the Gold Standard bill that had been drafted and recommended by the
                    Monetary Commission of the <placeName>

                    Overstreet for by so doing they would, in a way, be dealing a death blow to the gold standard. On
                    the whole, the Republicans appealed to the people to uphold the Administration in its prosecution of
                    the war by electing a Republican ticket, and stressed the return of prosperity, that had set in with
                    the election of McKinley, and the Republican pledge for the gold standard and sound money.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The election on November 8, was the more keenly anticipated, because the outcome would determine the

                    Republican landslide; and when the final count was made, Union B. Hunt, as Secretary of State,
                    received a plurality of 16,336. This was more than a thousand votes above the State Republican
                    plurality of 1896, and was indicative of the election as a whole. Nine Republican Congressmen were
                    elected, fifty-nine Republicans were sent to the lower house in the State Legislature and, in the
                    State Senate, including the holdovers, the Republicans had <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The next political question for Indiana to settle was, "Who shall be the next
                    Senator?" Several well-known men were considered as senatorial possibilities, among whom

                    </placeName>, reputed to be the "poor man's friend"; Albert J. Beveridge,
                    the lawyer and orator; Benjamin Harrison, ex-President; James A. Mount, Governor of Indiana; Hugh H.
                    Hanna, the "sound money" advocate who had helped draft the Overstreet financial
                    bill; General Lew Wallace of Civil War and "Ben Hur" fame; and Addison C. Harris,
                    prominent lawyer of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    </placeName> Senator.</p>
            <p>Early developments brought out the fact that five of the above named men were actively engaged in the
                    race, and had chances of getting the coveted Senatorial toga. From the first it seemed that J. Frank
                    Hanly, as the leader of the younger and more progressive group in the Republican party, had the lead
                    and would ultimately be successful. He was experienced in politics; had been a member of the State
                    legislature and the National House; and had a personal machine working for him. He also had the
                    advantage of an early start. His candidacy for the Senate was brought about by the fact that he was
                    defeated by one-half of a vote in the tenth district primary convention for the nomination to
                    Congress by Edward D. Crumpacker of <placeName>

                    defeat him in the fall election by throwing his support to the opponent. To get Hanly's
                    support the friends of Crumpacker approached Hanly on the Senate proposition, promising him the
                    tenth district vote if he would support Crumpacker. When Hanly was assured of the ten votes of this
                    district, he definitely decided to enter the race.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> From that <list type="footnotes">

                    Legislature while Frederick A. Joss was to be a candidate for the State Senate. Frank Littleton, the
                    other member present, had been in the legislature before and had already decided to try for
                    reelection. These men were all successful in securing nominations and were elected in November. Thus

            <p>Beveridge's candidacy for the Senate was a surprise to many Indiana politicians, and it
                    caused much speculation in regard to his probable success. Men who were best acquainted with
                    politics in Indiana regarded his candidacy as a mere joke because of his tender years and his
                    inexperience in political life.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Some people thought that he had an equal
                    chance with the other candidates,<hi rend="sup">16</hi> though seasoned leaders viewed his candidacy
                    as a device to get himself before the public, as well as to test his political strength, and that
                    his real desire was the governorship two years later." Whatever the result of this attempt
                    for his election to the Senate might be, his friends considered that the battle would be worth the
                        effort.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>The Democratic members of the Legislature held a caucus on December 19 to consider what part they
                    should or could play in the coming senatorial election. They were well aware of their situation as a
                    minority party and some were opposed to giving Senator Turpie a complimentary vote. They also fully
                    understood the situation in the Republican camp. With conflict within their own ranks and with so
                    many Republican candidates in the field, the Democrats decided that it would be for the benefit of
                    all to propose that if the Republicans would agree to give up their favorites and offer Harrison the
                    nomination, they would support him and thus make his election unanimous.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> This
                    proposal was not accepted. Some of the Republicans favored it, while others viewed it with
                    suspicion, seeing in it an attempt to get them "in a hole" and to shelve the
                    candidates already in the field.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> The plan failed not because Harrison was
                    unacceptable, but because of too much "politics" and because there were too many
                    interested candidates in the field.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> The five active candidates soon
                    established their headquarters at the Denison Hotel and endeavoured to perfect their organizations

                    a conference was held, at which time Beveridge was told by his managers that the hat would not do at
                    all and would have to be discarded. Beveridge finally consented, and from then on wore a soft black
                        hat.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

                    the candidacy of Beveridge. It was, at first, a local organization; but seeing that it was something
                    that had been overlooked by the other candidates, and believing in it as a great source of
                    influence, it was decided to form a State-wide organization of the same nature. One hundred

                    necessary expenses of office rent, postage, stationery, etc. Before adjourning, they unanimously
                    resolved to support Beveridge for the Senate, because they held that he would best serve their
                    interests. They were Beveridge men who took this method to impress the public and the members of the
                    Legislature. They decided to open headquarters at the Denison hotel on January 4 and do all that

            <p>The increased activity of the Hanly men during the latter part of December was a source of much alarm

                    only come into the lobby of the hotel, wherethe politicians gathered, for a short time after his
                    evening meal, and then return to his room at the first opportunity. After one of these

            <p>Major Steele was the avowed leader of the attack on Hanly. He was especially embittered toward Hanly,

                    </placeName> was now working for him. The preceding summer Steele had called on McCulloch, and, in
                    the course of their conference, McCulloch had promised his support to Steele, together with the nine
                    votes of the eighth congressional district, if Steele would aid him in securing the appointment of
                    Lee Coffeen, a civil war veteran, as postmaster of <placeName>

                    went over to Hanly talking the vote of his district with him. When Steele learned of this he burst
                    into a passion swearing to obtain vengeance if a chance should ever come.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

            <p>This turn of events almost ruined Steele's chances for the Senate, but he would not concede
                    Hanly the victory without a strenuous fight. He began his attack by causing Robert <placeName>

                    </placeName>, former Secretary of the Republican State Committee, to publish a letter which revealed
                    the fact that Hanly had charged seventy-five dollars a week in addition to his travelling expenses
                    for his services in the campaign of 1896. Others, the letter asserted, had given their time freely,
                    and in some cases had paid their own expenses.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> In addition to this Hanly and
                    his former associates in Congress were charged with having organized a "Congressional
                    Syndicate"â€”an offensive and defensive alliance to stand against all comers and
                    to see that those turned down by the exigencies of politics should secure places.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> To substantiate this assertion they pointed out that R. J. Trace-well, Representative from
                    the third district in the fifty-fourth Congress, had been made Comptroller of the Treasury; J. D.
                    Leighty, Representative from the twelfth district in the same Congress, had been appointed Pension
                    Agent for Indiana. The latter was now at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> working for Hanly and against Beveridge. Congressmen Hemenway and Crumpacker were also
                    for Hanly. The evidence tended to prove rather conclusively that it was now the aim of the
                    organization to place Hanly into the Senate.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Steele also began to spread the
                    rumor that the business interests of the country were contributing heavily to Hanly's
                    campaign funds. Hanly had started his campaign with the slogan, "The poor man's
                    candidate", and now he seemed to be spending more money than any of the other candidates.
                    He had engaged fourteen rooms at the Denison, and was entertaining his friends in style. Paying
                    hotel bills, Steele contended, was a polite way of buying votes.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> These things

                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> were the chief contenders. Steele was fully aware of the sectional feeling in the
                    State, and he knew that if Shideler should be elected to the speakership, that this would be a
                    stumbling block in his own way to the Senate, because the eleventh district, in the opinion of many,
                    would then have its share of the patronage. On the other hand, if Littleton could be elected this
                    would be a direct thrust at Beveridge's chance for securing the nomination.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Hanly, too, realized the importance of the Speakership. He at first intimated that he
                    would support Willoughby in return for caucus votes from the "pocket". When he
                    found out that Posey had these votes definitely pledged, and that Willoughby could give him very
                    little actual support, he turned to the support of Littleton as a means of heading off Beveridge.

                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> would be the surest way to "kill" the young candidate of <placeName>

            <p>The friends of Beveridge knew the exact meaning of this move, and they often talked to him about it.
                    A group of his friends came to him one day to insist that he should ask Littleton to renounce his
                    candidacy, for they thought it impossible to bring about the election of a Speaker of the House and
                    a second <placeName>

                    </placeName>. They got no further than the mere suggestion, for Beveridge, springing to his feet,
                    exclaimed: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>On January 1, Shideler formally withdrew from the race for the speakership on assurance that he would
                    be named chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> This aided
                    Steele's chances for the Senate. When the General Assembly met on January 5, the House
                    proceeded to elect Littleton to the speakership. In the organization of both houses the Hanly forces
                    were so strong that the supporters of the other candidates had to bow to their dictation in order to
                    secure any of the patronage that was to be given out.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> This was the first
                    actual test of strength, and it definitely proved that the Hanly<hi rend="sup">1</hi> forces were
                    strong and practically in control of the situation. Hanly and his men were now confident of success
                    in the contest for the senatorship.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The four candidates who were competing with Hanly agreed to hold a caucus on January 5 to compare
                    notes and to decide, if possible, on some one man to support. They were unable to decide who should
                    withdraw from the race. They reasoned that if one or more should withdraw that pledged votes would
                    be released, and that enough would probably go over to Hanly to elect him. Therefore, they decided
                    to "sit tight", hold their pledged votes until the caucus on January 10, and then
                    let the Republican members of the two houses unite of their own accord, in a natural way, on the
                    strongest candidate. This plan would not permit Hanly to do any extra electioneering at the time
                    when combinations were taking place.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The survey showed that Taylor had seventeen votes pledged; Beveridge, thirteen; Posey, thirteen;
                    Steele, ten; and Harris, one. They thus controlled fifty-four votes. They conceded thirty-one votes
                    to Hanly, while four of the regular Republican members remained unpledged.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> If
                    each could actually hold those pledged him, Hanly could not be elected. For the next five days, the
                    four candidates went about getting their followers to reaffirm their pledges. At the same time they
                    urged them, under no consideration, to vote for Hanly. However, none stipulated which one of the
                    four candidates his delegates should ultimately vote for.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Under these

                    the greatest number of the Republican legislators would be nominated.</p>
            <p>While Major Steele and his friends were bringing forth their charges against Hanly, Beveridge and his
                    friends were seemingly inactive. Now and then a legislator would announce himself for Beveridge
                    without any apparent solicitation.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Several such announcements were made from
                    December 28 to January 6, on which date, Francis T. Roots, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a prominent member of the House, emphatically announced that he was in favor of
                        Beveridge.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> His announcement seemed to inaugurate a Beveridge boom.</p>
            <p>The "Business Men's Association," a political organization formed by
                    friends of Beveridge for the purpose of pushing his candidacy, then began activities by inviting
                    prominent business men from all over the State to call on them at the Denison. They also became
                    active for Beveridge among the various legislators. A large number of telegrams signed by business
                    men asking for Beveridge's election were sent in.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Petitions that had
                    been passed around and signed by leading business firms were received.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> Straw
                    votes were taken at railroad shops and manufacturing establishments, and all of them favored
                    Beveridge. McCormick of the Labor Commission and one hundred laboring men came to the hotel and
                    emphatically announced themselves for him. Lawyers of the city began to talk in his favor, and, in
                    fact nothing had been overlooked that would in any possible way contribute to his success.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was so much activity in the Beveridge camp that the other candidates were almost bewildered.
                    They thought that in the deal for the speakership they had side-tracked Beveridge, and therefore,
                    they had not given him much consideration since Littleton had been made Speaker. But because of this
                    increased activity, Beveridge was becoming the strongest of the four candidates who were opposing
                    Hanly. This prepared boom came late, as his managers had planned, in order that the <list type="footnotes">

                    10. The Hanly men went into the caucus with the intentions of voting their full strength from the
                    first. By so doing they would demonstrate their power and pull enough "band wagon"
                    votes to elect their man.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> Taylor and Steele were determined that Hanly should
                    not win. It did not matter to them who won just so he did not. <list type="footnotes">

                    stick together until the end. They held the balance of power between the two factionsâ€”the
                    young progressives and the conservativesâ€”in their hands, and could elect Hanly if they so
                    desired; while their votes, if given to either one of the other candidates, would provide the
                    impetus to elect him. They also knew that if they could hold out until the break came, it would, in
                    all probability, come their way, for they had promises of second choice votes from nearly every
                        legislator.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> The caucus was organized and regular procedure was followed.
                    No nominating speeches were made. As the name of each legislator was called, he walked up, and
                    dropped his ticket into the ballot box. The first ballot revealed that the pre-caucus estimate was
                    almost correct. Great cheers arose from Hanly's friends who had gathered in the corridors
                    of the State Hause, when the vote was announced, for Hanly had received 32; Taylor, 19; Posey, 14;
                    Beveridge, 13; and Steele, 11.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the consternation of the Beveridge men he had received only thirteen votes on the first ballot,
                    though they had been sure of fifteen.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> Beveridge had always been superstitious
                    of the number thirteen, and when he heard that he had received that number of votes he feared that
                    he was gone.<hi rend="sup">69</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the result of the second ballot was announced, Hanly's friends, and they were numerous,
                    sent up greater cheers than before. It was evident that they were trying to stampede him into the
                    Senate. The vote stood: Hanly, 31; Taylor, 16; Posey, 12; Steele, 11; Beveridge, 19.</p>
            <p>The results of the next several ballots were practically the same as the second, but on the eighth
                    correct ballot (the fifth was thrown out, because too many votes were cast), the break came, Hanly
                    had received 37 votes, This was two more votes than Taylor and Steele had thought it was possible
                    for him to get. Only 45 were needed to make him the choice of the caucus. They saw at once that it
                    was time to act if they were to defeat Hanly. Beveridge with twenty votes seemed to be the strongest
                    anti-Hanly candidate. On the next ballot the younger men from the northern part of the State, who
                    had been supporting Taylor, voted for Beveridge. The count then stood: <list type="footnotes">

                    The tenth ballot was also thrown out, because too many votes were cast.</p>
            <p>It was possible that on the next ballot the remaining Taylor votes would go to Beveridge thus giving
                    him thirty-seven against Hanly's thirty-six. In that event neither would yet be a victor.
                    Steele's men knew that they now had the power to elect either man. They remembered the <placeName>

                    </placeName> post-office episode and Steele's oath to get even with McCulloch for his
                    betrayal. Their chance had come. The Posey men could have voted for Hanly and further delayed the
                    election, but they had promised to stick by Posey until the very last, and most of them intended to
                    abide by their pledges. It all hinged on the votes of Steele's men. The entire Steele vote
                    was given to Beveridge on the next ballot, together with three of Posey's votes and one
                    from the Hanly group. The final count was: Beveridge, 49, four more than necessary to elect; Hanly,
                    35; and Posey, 5.</p>
            <p>Beveridge had been in his office on <placeName>

                    was informed of his election he said, "Thank God", and then shook hands with his
                        friends.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus a man whose candidacy was regarded as little more than a joke at the beginning was chosen by the
                    Republican caucus. He was hindered by the almost unsurmountable obstacles of his residence, age, and
                    determined opposition at home. In addition to this, the speakership of the House and many of the
                    offices in the organization of the General Assembly had been given to <placeName>

            <p>Beveridge's triumph in the caucus was received with satisfaction throughout the State and

                    flooded his office for weeks afterward, and it seemed that the Nation at large, now in the throes of

            </p>
            <p>The following day at 12:00, the Senate adjourned to meet with the House in a Joint Assembly to
                    compare the votes cast the previous day and to inform the candidate, in an official way, of his
                    election. The total number of votes cast for Beveridge was 87; for Turpie, 56; and for Burkhart, 1.
                    A committee composed of three members from each House informed Beveridge of his election and
                    escorted him to the Speaker's chair. He was introduced by Lieutenant-Governor Haggard to
                    the throng of people that had crowded into the room. In his characteristic manner Beveridge made his
                    speech of acceptance, in which he outlined, in a way, the principles which were to guide him while
                    in the Senate.</p>

            <p>Expansion was not a new thing for the American people. In fact it had been their most outstanding and

                    After a lapse of half a century caused by secession and Civil War, the American people again began
                    to expand, but this time in an industrial and commercial way. This expansion was not confined to the

                    Economic development had caught up with and gone far beyond American territorial expansion. As an
                    outgrowth of the Spanish American War, the American government was trying to follow up, protect, and
                    aid American commercial expansion. Porto Rico and <placeName>

            <p>From the very first, Beveridge challenged the established order of things. He had been in the Senate
                    scarcely a month when he disregarded an old precedentâ€”that Senators during their first
                    session should be seen little and heard lessâ€”by making his first set speech.</p>
            <p>Beveridge was not a believer in a half-hearted and apologetic defense of programs and policies which
                    he believed to be entirely right and beneficial. He did not believe in talking around a point, or in
                    the use of vague terms. Therefore some of his speeches were considered as unusually bold and rather
                    undiplomatic.</p>
            <p>On January 9, his first speech, delivered in such a way that Mr. Dooley remarked, "

                    and after sketching the great commercial possibilities in the Far East, as well as our duty in

            <p>From this time until the latter part of March, he remained relatively quiet; but when this buoyant
                    young Senator, handsome of face and figure, spoke to the Senate again on March 29, it was too much
                    for the old Senators to endure. The next day Edmund W. Pettus of <placeName>

                    "haze" him. With his quaint old fashioned eloquence he was as complete an
                    antithesis of the highly modern Indiana orator as could be imagined. Buttoning the top button of his
                    coat as he rose, he proceeded to speak in his characteristic southern drawl with all seriousness. He
                    mentioned no names, but the slight oscillations of his shoulders and the gentle movement of his
                    chest conveyed such an idea of pomposity without losing any dignity that Senators completely lost
                    control of themselves. His chief point of attack was the "Or-a-tory" of the young
                    Senator, and he drawled this word out with such an effect that the Senators roared, and screamed,
                    and pounded their desks, while the galleries shrieked and yelled without a single admonition from

                    the world outside. His fresh and bubbling enthusiasm caused him to be liked by everyone. They

                    the committee rooms than on the floor of the Senate; and that speeches were made largely for home
                    consumption and not to influence Senators.</p>

                        <country reg="ph">Philippines</country>
                    </placeName>, Beveridge was always an advocate of the Administration policies as well as a defender
                    of them against the attacks of Democrats and anti-imperial Republicans. Usually these discussions
                    were in the nature of running debates and in this repartee Beveridge had few superiors. He once
                    tackled Senator Farnifold M. Simmons of <placeName>

                    mortified the North Carolinian that he actually took to his bed and was ill for a week. On one
                    occasion, he so exasperated Senator Joseph W. Bailey by his queries, that the Texan lost all control
                    of himself, and when Beveridge and Senator Matthew S. Quay "locked horns" over the
                    statehood bill at a later session, men neglected their business to hear the argument.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the bill providing for civil government in Porto Rico was up for consideration, Beveridge spoke
                    in favor of it; however, he did not believe that it should be a permanent form of government; for
                    when changes came as a result of American occupation and supervision, then the government should be
                    modified to suit the new conditions. Beveridge's speech, given on March 29, 1900, was for
                    the most part, a constitutional argument for free trade with insular possessions. He viewed the
                    situation in this light: if under this measure Porto Rico should be considered by the Supreme Court
                    as domestic territory, then free trade ought to be required under the constitutional provision
                    "that all duties, imposts, and excises shall be <list type="footnotes">

                    foreign territory, then Congress should overstep the Constitution as it so often had done and
                    establish free trade, because it would be expedient and helpful to both countries. In the course of
                    his arguments, he pointed out that institutional law is older, deeper, and more vital than
                    constitutional law; for our Constitution, like Magna Carta, is only a manifestation of our
                    institutions. Institutions change and alter the Constitution as the case demands. Therefore, since
                    the Constitution had given away before exigencies so many times, it was altogether fitting and
                    proper that it should allow a free hand in dealing with reciprocity or free trade with Porto Rico.
                    He emphatically stated his position on constitutional interpretation and application when he
                    remarked: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I have no respect for constitutional learning which deals alone with the written words of the

                            of that great instrument. The Constitution did not give us free institutions. Free
                            institutions gave us the Constitution. All the progress toward liberty and popular
                            government made since the adoption of the Constitution worked out its sure results, through

                    failed to produce the desired results, he asked Roosevelt for aid, because he did not have a
                    sufficient force to quell the rebellion. Roosevelt was reluctant to intervene because of the dangers
                    involved in such action. However, when Palma threatened to resign, he sent William H. Taft,
                    Secretary of War, and Robert Bacon, Assistant Secretary of State, to Havana to try to settle the

                    and attended to other similar but rather unimportant matters. However, this committee now became an
                    important one due to the fact that some of the people in the territories of the Southwest began to
                    clamor for statehood. These local demands were augmented by those of people in the East who had
                    special interests in the region concerned. With local governments in complete control of finances it
                    would be much easier for them to influence the legislatures to pass laws which would be more
                    favorable to their interests. As long as the territorial status continued bond issues were limited
                    and had to be approved by Congress. Thus it was more difficult as well as expensive for the moneyed
                    interests to get legislation passed which would be of special benefit to them.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>On December 10,1902, Senator Quay, who considered himself a political orphan on the Territories
                    Committee, made a report of his own regarding these territories.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> He favored
                    the immediate admission of three states in obedience to the pledge set forth in the Republican
                    platform of 1900. At the conclusion of Quay's speech Beveridge submitted the majority
                    report.</p>
            <p>In making out this report the committee took into consideration the interests of the people of the
                    proposed new States as well as the interests of the remainder of the Republic. Each territory was
                    judged according to the following points: (1) the number of people; (2) condition of these people
                    educationally, morally, and other qualities of citizens; (3) the extent of territory occupied by
                    them; (4) the extent to which they had developed their resources; and (5) the extent and character
                    of all natural resources both developed and undeveloped.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> On these points the
                    committee based their recommendations.</p>
            <p>It was recommended that admission be denied these States, because they could not qualify on a single
                    one of the named points. The population was small; their resources were not developed sufficiently
                    to support a State government; they were such heterogeneous groups that no solidarity whatever
                    existed in race, language, customs, and political ideas; and they were too illiterate as a whole to
                    operate a local government. Furthermore, if it were a mistake not to admit them, it could be
                    remedied in the future; but if it were a mistake to admit them, that mistake once consummated could
                    never be undone.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The bill for admission was made unfinished business and was therefore called up each day for
                    consideration. Quay repeatedly tried to get the Senate to agree on a date to vote on the bill; but
                    Beveridge, or someone, always objected, and unanimous consent was necessary. From December 10, 1902,
                    until February 4, 1903, the bill was discussed. Five set speeches were delivered while the remainder
                    of the time was taken up in running debate. Beveridge was usually one of the debators. Quay finally
                    abandoned his attempt to get a vote on the bill. The filibuster was successful and the statehood

            <p>On February 6, Beveridge made a long speech in defense of the bill basing his arguments for the most
                    part, on the natural, geographic factors of the Territories. <placeName>

            <p>The bill went into conference when the House failed to concur in the Senate amendments. No agreement
                    could be reached, beacause each house insisted on its own amendments. Consequently, the bill was
                    defeated. This disagreement in the conference committee was undoubtedly a pre-arranged affair. Since
                    the Senate was so evenly divided on the question, as shown by the votes on the amendments, the
                    conferees no doubt thought it best to play safe by postponing admission.</p>

                            the four Territories above mentioned, and after careful consideration of all that has been
                            developed in the discussions of the question I recommend that they be immediately admitted
                            as two States. There is no justification for delay; and the advisability of making the four

            <p>In pursuance of this recommendation, Beveridge, on December 7, 1905, introduced a statehood bill
                    embodying the same provisions as the one which had been considered in the third session of the

                    Patterson, leaders of the Democratic opponents of the bill, objected to it for two reasons: (1) they
                    believed that the people of the Territories should have the right to determine whether or not they
                    should come into the Union as a one or two States; (2) they contended that the government had a
                    moral obligation and a pledge to admit <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="azu">Arizona</region>
                    </placeName> as a State and should live up to it. This contention was based on the peculiar
                    provision of the Act of Congress of February 24, 1863, creating the territory of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="azu">Arizona</region>
                    </placeName>. This territorial act declared: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Beveridge was the chief defender of the bill in the Senate. He maintained that the question of
                    statehood was not entirely a local matter as Foraker and others were contending. It was as much a
                    national question as a local question and should be thus considered. In addition, local opinion and
                    sentiment was neither a true nor an intelligent guide for the admission of States, because the
                    people who reside in the territories see only their local needs, for the most part. On the other
                    hand, Congress, representing the whole nation, was able to view the question in its entirety and to
                    consider the problem as it affected the whole Republic. The people of the Territories should, of
                    course, be consulted, but in the last analysis, Congress was the sole arbiter.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Senator John C. Spooner was no less emphatic in stating his views on this statehood bill. He did not
                    believe that New <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> nor <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="azu">Arizona</region>
                    </placeName> were in a condition to be admitted by any test that one should wish to apply. However,
                    if they were to be admitted, he would not vote for Foraker's plan because it was not up to
                    the people entirely to decide on single or double statehood. Neither could he appreciate the merits
                    of omnibus statehood bills, for the cases of each were different and should be treated separately.
                    In his opinion, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> and Indian Territory had been qualified for statehood for nearly two years, but as a
                    result of this policy of linking separate problems, they had been denied admission and forced to
                    wait. If the problems relating to the two different areas were not considered separately admission
                    would be denied them again. "That", he stated, "is a proposition so
                    destitute of justice and statesmanship and patriotism as to be inexplicable."<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

                    executive power might be established; that this council might elect as president one of its members

            <p>A bill providing for an Alaskan legislative council, to govern and legislate for the district was
                    submitted by Beveridge on January 24, 1910.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> In explanation, he stated that
                    President Taft had recommended a change in the form of government for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aku">Alaska</region>
                    </placeName> and that this bill was drafted in accordance with his recommendations.<hi rend="sup">77</hi> A change was necessary because of the inefficiency of the present scheme of government
                    which permitted all kinds of special legislation about which Congress actually knew very little;
                    some of the laws that had been passed were applicable and very good while many others were very
                    incongruous. It was therefore expedient to create a council, the members of which were to be
                    appointed by the President, by and with the consent of the Senate, to legislate for this <hi rend="i">territory</hi>, as the bill called it.<hi rend="sup">78</hi> The representatives from
                    the several districts in <placeName>

                    this was too undemocratic. They also objected because Beveridge did not submit a formal, printed
                    report to substantiate the proposed bill but in lieu thereof simply made an extensive statement of
                    conditions. They would not accept this as a true, accurate account nor as conclusive evidence.<hi rend="sup">80</hi>

                    </placeName> than by a local legislative council?" The opinion of the Senate had not
                    crystallized on the subject, and it appears that the above stated arguments were used to prevent
                    hasty action rather than as reasons for opposing the bill. After the bill had been called up in the
                    Senate for consideration each day for nearly a month, it was moved that the bill "go
                    over" not to be called up each morning as unfinished business. The motion was agreed to,
                    because it was seemingly impossible to reach an agreement on the bill at this time.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>

            <p>To recapituate, Beveridge went to the Senate willing and ready to work and lost no time in getting
                    started. He at first had an imperfect idea of the rights of seniority in the Senate, while his
                    evaluation of the probable influence of oratory was rather erroneous. He had no doubt evolved this
                    idea of oratory by reading the famous speeches made by noted Senators of a former day; but procedure
                    in the Senate had changed; and he soon became aware of the fact that legislation was now
                    accomplished, for the most part, in the committee rooms while the Senate chamber was more of a
                    personal advertising device. His knowledge of constitutional law was very valuable to him in dealing
                    with matters relating to the forming of governments for the newly acquired insular possessions, as
                    well as when the constitutionality of proposed legislation was in question. He was no blind
                    worshipper of the Constitution, believing in the theory that there was no constitutional restriction
                    on acts which would be beneficial to all concerned. To him the Constitution was not a mere
                    compilation of wordsâ€”a dead letterâ€” but it was full of life and vitality,
                    applicable to any and all conditions which might arise. He was a bold imperialist, a firm beliver in
                    his country and its work; and since he believed the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to be in the right, there was no need for any quibbling nor for an apologetic attitude.
                    He was ever concerned as States was defeated by a filibuster; and the third by was eager, perhaps
                    even unduly anxious at times, to extend her power and influence.</p>

                    the admission of States. He readily detected the capitalistic influences behind the early movements
                    for statehood. To offset these and to prevent State government from being a financial burden on the
                    population because of undeveloped natural resources, as well as to give more time for the
                    Americanization of the people, Beveridge first recommended postponement of statehood. The next
                    attempt to bring in the territories concerned as States was defeated by a filibuster; and the third
                    by a conference disagreement. In 1906, <placeName>

                    Union as separate States in 1910. In the latter case, it was best that statehood was denied for so

            <p>Ephraim Samuel Frazee, son of Dr. Ephraim Frazee and Susan Mountjoy Doniphan Frazee, was born at
                    Mayslick, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, Oct. 4, 1824, and died at <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Orange</region>, <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>, June 14, 1896. The father died when Ephraim Samuel
                    was but three days old, leaving the young wife, only twenty eight years of age, with four little
                    sons to rear, the eldest, Joseph Samuel, then by his years of age. For several years after the
                    father's death, the widowed mother made her home at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Germantown</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>.
                    Here, in partnership with his youngest brother, Joseph Frazee, her husband had owned a general
                    store. Joseph was appointed guardian for his four little nephews and executor of their
                    father's estate, which, beside the interest in the store at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Germantown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, consisted of lands in Indiana located in Rush, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion Counties</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Several years after the death of Dr. Frazee, the widow and her two older sons, Joseph Samuel and
                    Lewis Jacob, came to the farm in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Rush County</region>, <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>, which the widow adopted as a permanent home. The
                    older boys often returned and spent much time in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, until they became real southerners at heart. Lewis, returning there for his education,
                    never lived for any long period in Indiana.</p>
            <p>The two younger sons, William Doniphan and Ephraim Samuel, remained for several years after their
                    mother came to Indiana, with their guardian, Uncle Joseph Frazee, near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Germantown</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. They atended school and helped in the store.</p>
            <p>It was a delight to me, when a young married woman, living in Brooksville, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, to visit my cousin Susan, the only daughter of Uncle Joseph Frazee. She married John
                    Harvey Walton, and with her husband was living on the Walton farm <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-024-3-049"/> north of the old Frazee farm which was situated north and east of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Germantown</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was pleasant to have her tell me in most tender and admirable language of the great
                    esteem which Uncle Joseph had for my father, who, she said, was always "so dutiful, so
                    respectful, so apperciative, and so clean of mind, and a real brother" to her.</p>
            <p>At the age of fourteen years my father left his uncle's home to live with his mother in
                    Indiana. He made the long trip from Germantowns to his mother's home alone and on
                    horseback. When he reached <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Laurel</settlement>, <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>, upon inquiry he was told the way to the home of the
                    Widow Frazee in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush County</region>
                    </placeName>. Late in the evening, having gone too far on the road before turning, and realizing
                    that he must have missed his way, he stopped at the home of a family named Grey and asked for a
                    night's lodging. It was not convenient for the Greys to accommodate the strange young
                    traveler. He was told that if he would go a little farther on to the home of "Deacon
                    Austen" he could probably find lodging. Darkness had fallen but the weary boy started on
                    once more, and reached the Austen home. Here he did not ask in vain, and when the family learned
                    that he was the son of the "rich Widow Frazee" a friend of the Austens, he was
                    most warmly welcomed, given a good supper, allowed to "toast" his feet by the
                    blazing fireside and given a night's rest in a good clean bed. Incidentally he made the
                    acquaintance of little Frances Austen, a miss of twelve years, destined eight years later to become
                    his bride.</p>
            <p>On their <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush County</region>
                    </placeName> farm of 640 acres of black fertile soil, this blue-eyed, fair-skinned, tow-headed,
                    slender lad grew to young manhood among all the vicissitudes, adventures, hardships, and pleasures
                    of Indiana's pioneer life. At this time there were only trails and mud roads for the
                    traveler. The land was covered with heavy forests, many of the large poplar, oak and walnut trees
                    having trunks from ten to fifteen feet in circumference. The land was full of swamps that were
                    dangerous to the health of the inhabitants. It was many years before the country was well drained.
                    This improvement was still in process during my childhood days. As late as when my brother, Austen,
                    was in his 'teens', I can remember him being ill with ague, or as many called it,
                    "chills and fever." I can still see him wrapped in a big bed comfort, sitting in
                    an arm chair, chilling until it seemed to me he shook the house.</p>
            <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-024-3-050"/>
            <p>My father's mother, a woman who belonged to a family, that for many generations had been
                    accustomed to education, did not neglect the schooling of her four sons. She saw to it that they all
                    became college-trained men. I have in my possession the diploma of my father who was graduated from
                    Bethany College, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. It is dated July 4, 1846, and signed by that noted American divine, Alexander <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Another signature is that of R. Richardson, Professor of Chemistry.</p>
            <p>My father, having been left without a father in infancy, and, having had the example of his Uncle
                    Joseph Frazee as his guardian, was always considerate and solicitious for widows and orphans. Many
                    estates did he settle as executor, never once charging for his services. During his active life, the
                    Circuit Court of Rush and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette Counties</region>
                    </placeName> never convened without his having some report to make or some cause to plead. Naturally
                    fitted intellectually for the law, with a judicial mind, he was a success in court and knew more law
                    than some who made law their profession. Twice he was honored by Rush and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur Counties</region>
                    </placeName>, being sent as their joint-representative to the State legislature. He was urgently
                    requested to accept a third term, but since he never approved of the acceptance of a third term by
                    anyone, he declined. He had many disappointments, many heartaches, was more than once treacherously
                    betrayed by men whom he thought friends, but he never wavered. He never lost heart and always kept
                    his wonderful faith in the Heavenly Father, believing beyond any doubt that "whom the Lord
                    loveth he chasteneth," and that eventually all things work together for good for those who
                    love, serve, and trust in God.</p>
            <p>My father was in his thirty-seventh year when the Civil War began. At this age, besides being a
                    preacher with ten children, he was not expected to go to war. His duty was rather to care for the
                    country-side during this great national upheaval. His brothers, all older than he, had passed the
                    age of enlistment. The family burden in this respect fell upon the younger generation, on his
                    nephews, the sons of his oldest brother, Joseph Samuel. Father and his next older brother, William
                    Doniphan, were for the Union. Their two older brothers were in sympathy with the Confederacy. His
                    mother, a southener, was very bitter against the Government for waging war <pb n="189" id="VAA4025-024-3-051"/> on the South. Father's older children were girls. He had no
                    son old enough to enter the service. The two nephews who volunteered were sons of Joseph Samuel. The
                    eldest, John Paul, fought for the Union, while Louis, the next son, fought for the Confederacy. My
                    cousin, John Paul, told me in later years that he and his brother met once during the war. The two
                    armies were encamped within close range and the brothers were able to meet at a dividing fence and
                    talk together.</p>
            <p>When the four years of horror had passed and the wonderful news came that General Lee had
                    surrendered, joy was un-confined through the North. Often have I heard my mother relate that when
                    the glad tidings came the word was passed from mouth to mouth. Heralds hurried on their fastest
                    horses to shout the news to all who were within hearing distance. Every farmer had a dinner bell,
                    and, when the news was shouted out, each bell was set to ringing. My father stood for three hours
                    and rang our bell, pealing out the tidings as far as the tones would carry, when joy and peace were
                    heralded to the countryside.</p>
            <p>Father was one of the patrons and founders of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> College. As long as he was physically able, he attended the Board meetings. He took
                    great pride in the College, as a school of the Christian Church, and raised a large portion of the
                    funds to establish it. He gave liberally of his own means, expecting the new institution to become a
                    second Bethany. For my part, I am thankful that he did not live to see an agnostic fill a chair of
                    instruction nor to see the school pass from its original paramount purpose, that of educating young
                    men and young women in the simple gospel of the New Testament, an object so dear to his heart. In
                    other things he needs would have submitted to the inevitable changes of progress.</p>
            <p>My father lived the life of a pioneer leader in Indiana, and was one of the builders of civilization
                    in the new State. He was a born leader and many-sided in his vision of life. As our forefathers
                    would have said, "He was a man of parts." He led his community in its educational,
                    religious and social development. In moral courage, in civic pride, in the cultivation of farms and
                    in the raising of live stock he was at the front.</p>
            <p>In addition to being a preacher, teacher, politician and executor of estates, he was a successful
                    breeder of registered cattle and of Percheron <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Norman</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Clydesdale horses. His reputation <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-024-3-052"/> as such
                    reached far beyond the borders of our own State. Men from all sections of Indiana and elsewhere
                    purchased from him valuable and beautiful registered stock. He was a real benefactor to the State in
                    this capacity. Coming to Indiana when the State was comparatively new, when it needed men of force,
                    wisdom, and discretion, he became a responsible and most valuable citizen.</p>
            <p>About the year 1875, he possessed his first show-herd of short-horn cattle, which was the forerunner
                    of the show-herds extending over all the remaining years of his active life. During the last few
                    years of his activities in this line, he owned two marvelous show-herds of short-horn cattle which
                    he exhibited far and wide at the County and State fairs, not only in Indiana but in adjoining
                    States. He brought home many "ribbons," but the number cannot be estimated at this
                    late day.</p>
            <p>He was the force and guiding influence in organizing the first Live Stock Association of America. He
                    assisted in publishing the <hi rend="i">Short-Horn-Herd-Book</hi>, in which all his own and all
                    other blooded-stock were registered. Many volumes of this <hi rend="i">Herd-Book</hi> accumulated,
                    until they completely filled one of his bookcases.</p>
            <p>The breeding of fine Percheron and Clydesdale horses was as much a hobby with him as the production
                    of blooded cattle. The great draft horses that he owned were very like those that one sees to-day on
                    the streets of the cities of <placeName>
                  <country reg="enk">England</country>, <country reg="fr">France</country>, <country reg="be">Belgium</country>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>â€”large, powerful, beautiful, gentle, just such as are portrayed in that
                    famous picture by Rosa Bonheur, "The Horse Fair," which hangs in the Metropolitan
                    Museum of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>When a little more than twenty-two years of age, on March 9, 1847, he was married to Frances Austen
                    who was two years his junior. To this union were born twelve children, eight of whom, four sons and
                    four daughters, lived to maturity. Seven of the eight married and reared families.</p>
            <p>The Reverand Ephraim Samuel Frazee was a remarkable father. His demeanor, his conversation and
                    influence in the home were always ennobling and of the highest order. His conversation was cheerful,
                    clean, wholesome and witty. Our home was in no sense a "common" one. Neighborhood
                    gossip and the meddling in the affairs of others were things not tolerated, nor was immodesty or
                    vulgarity of either word or action. <pb n="191" id="VAA4025-024-3-053"/> He gave his children a
                    college education, and was always liberal and generous with them in the things necessary to their
                    development and welfare. He desired to lead them into lives of usefulness and responsibility. His
                    children have lived to appreciate their heritage and honor his memory.</p>
            <p>In all his struggles and joys he had a sympathetic partner in his loyal wife. A woman of rare
                    intellect and education, she was a help to him in his literary pursuits as much as in his every day
                    walk of life. She was an ever present and necessary help to him as a critic of his sermons and other
                    public addresses. She could, with a quick discernment, see the strong points and errors in his
                    composition. He relied much on her judgment as to the proper language through which to express
                    himself clearly and to the point. Few people knew this of our mother; she was so modest, so timid
                    and so retiring in her disposition. Nevertheless, her mind was of a high order and her mental
                    perception was keen. She thoroughly understood her husband's mentality, his work, and his
                    usefullnes. She was a true and helpful companion, who never failed him in sickness, nor in health.</p>
            <p>He was the power that caused the gravel road to be built from Fayetteville [<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange</region>
                    </placeName>] to Falmouth, a distance of seven miles, a big undertaking in the period of
                    father's active life. He also had built the gravel road leading from Fayetteville to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, intercepting the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Glenwood (then <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vienna</settlement>
                    </placeName>) gravel road at the old <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush County</region>
                    </placeName> Fair-grounds. This pike was also seven miles in length. After six miles of this road
                    had been completed, reaching within one mile of Fayetteville, and to the west boundary of our home
                    farm, the funds were exhausted. The neighbors had donated to the extent of their means and despair
                    almost possessed them. My father would not give up. He, with the assistance of James Davis, a
                    neighbor and brother in our church, strained their own resources and paid for the last mile out of
                    their own funds, dividing the expense between them, each paying the sum of $1,000. These
                    were large gifts for those days, especially after each had originally given liberally of both labor
                    and money.</p>
            <p>Years went by and the country advanced. Public sentiment resented the toll-gates on the pikes. People
                    began to imagine that my father was financially benefited by the toll receipts, <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-024-3-054"/> though he seldom received sufficient funds for the annual repair for
                    years.</p>
            <p>A generation grew up who knew little of my father's early struggles, nor of the civic work
                    he had accomplished, nor of the condition of the community before he became the helper and leader.
                    It was this generation that resented the toll-gates. One seldom wins in combating public sentiment
                    when once a wrong notion is in the minds of the people, so my father was a loser in this. It nearly
                    broke his heart to hear his efforts and achievements for the public good spoken of as personal
                    aggrandizment. It caused him much grief and was a bitter disappointment to him to realize that his
                    work was not appreciated. He was grieved to see, a few years later, these roads became free to the
                    public, especially to the teamsters who hauled to nearby sawmills heavy loads of logs. It required
                    from four to six horses to pull these loads and deep ruts were made in the roads. Repair work was
                    neglected, the pikes became full of mud-holes and a part of father's work seemed in vain.
                    Were he living to-day he could see that his efforts were in time followed by greater achievements.
                    Such are the disappointments and trials of progress. Now, though we have no toll-gates in Indiana,
                    the people willingly pay automobile license fees and road taxes. Money for highway construction and
                    upkeep is paid for by every purchaser of gasoline. Now, not only in Rush and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette Counties</region>
                    </placeName>, but checkering our whole nation are wonderful concrete roads, and the people must pay
                    for them. Such are the inevitable epoch making changes that have come.</p>
            <p>My father little realized in his last years that his period was just closing, and that a new, very
                    different, very much more advanced period was just beginning. He never saw nor heard of an
                    automobile, but my mother, who survived him fourteen years, lived both to see and ride in a
                    "nineteen-ten" Packard car.</p>
            <p>My father manufactured the tile with which to drain his land. He always had the first piece in the
                    community of any new type of farm machinery. He owned the first reaper, the first carriage, the
                    first buggy, the first double-plow, the first harrow, and the first wheat-binder. He bought mother
                    the first sewing machine in the community, the first washing machine and the first clothes wringer.
                    I still remember the first <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-024-3-055"/> window screens made of mosquito-bar,
                    which were a marvel to every one who saw them. We had never seen nor heard of window screens until
                    one day a visitor in our home, President Otis A. Burgess of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, told my mother about having seen them in use. He described them to her and she
                    at once resolved to install them. No sooner said than doneâ€”the next day we had a
                    carpenter, Mr. John George, making frames for screens. Not long after we had the real thing. This
                    was in the summer of 1875.</p>
            <p>From boyhood my father was deeply religious and ever took an active part in the church. When yet a
                    young man, he gave land from his inheritance for a church lot and a cemetery for the Little Flat
                    Rock Church in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush County</region>
                    </placeName> where he and his mother held their membership. In this cemetery, he and mother, both,
                    lie buried.</p>
            <p>In our home my father always conducted daily family worship, after the manner and example of the man
                    who was his model in many things, Alexander <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Before breakfast the family was assembled. Father led in the reading of the
                    Scriptures, while we read alternately a verse each through the chapter. No child who could spell out
                    the words was ever excused, and father never lost his patience with the slow efforts of the child
                    just learning to read. After a chapter in the New Testament was read, we all knelt in front of our
                    chairs and father offered prayer, in which he never failed to express a desire that each of his
                    children should be led into lives of usefulness, in whatever community fate might place them. After
                    prayer, a chapter was read in the Old Testament, then we had our breakfast. It seems fair to mention
                    that mother would place the newly made biscuits in the oven just before worship began, and, with a
                    well-regulated wood fire, they would be ready for the table by the time the service was over.</p>
            <p>I do not know how many times the Bible was read through by the family in this manner. I do know that
                    all the children learned how to pronounce all biblical names and seemed to know more about the Bible
                    than any of their associates in the neighborhood.</p>
            <p>Father was not especially educated for the ministry, but at Bethany College, under the teaching of
                    Alexander <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he had good religious training and liberal instruction in the Bible. <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-024-3-056"/> When a student at Bethany he followed the bent of his family for
                    medicine and graduated in the school of Chemistry.</p>
            <p>Religiously inclined and having the family intuition for public speaking, he made such an impression
                    as an exhorter, that he was early called upon to lead the prayer-meeting, to serve at the
                    "Lord's Table" and to fill the pulpit at times of vacancies. In the
                    Christian Church, the communion is observed every "Lord's Day." His
                    assistance eventually led to regular preaching, which resulted in forty years of continuous
                    activity. During these forty years, besides filling the pulpiit at Fayetteville, he was often called
                    upon to preach at neighboring churches. He frequently supplied at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Laurel</settlement>
               </placeName>,
                    Andersonville, Fairview, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Ben Davis Creek, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Clarksburg</settlement>,
                            <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
               </placeName>, and other
                    places. He preached somewhere every Sunday, or "Lord's Day" as he called
                    it. When a member of the State Legislature he performed the duties of Chaplain.</p>
            <p>He was popular and gifted as the deliverer of funeral discourses, and was called far and wide for
                    that purpose. He performed many marriage ceremonies. Divorces then were rare, but he never consented
                    to perform the marriage ceremony for a divorced person. Only once was he not given a fee for
                    officiating at a wedding. According to the early custom in the Christian Church, he never required
                    nor accepted a fee for preaching a sermon or delivering a funeral discourse, but he accepted fees
                    for performing marriage ceremonies, two dollars being by custom the minimum fee. Always fond of fun
                    and clean jokes he used to tell of an experience where he performed the ceremony for a rather
                    penurious man who was being married a second time. After the ceremony the groom asked my father what
                    fee he charged. His reply was: "Well, it depends upon the kind of woman a man marries. If
                    he marries a very fine lady he usually pays a pretty good fee but if he marries an ordinary woman
                    the fee is not so large." The happy groom handed him fifty cents.</p>
            <p>For forty years my father preached for the village church in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange</region>
                    </placeName>, or Fayetteville as it was formerly called. Usually, he preached three
                    "Lord's Days" each month. The other Sunday, the pulpit was filled by some
                    one of our preachers from a distance. My own memory goes back to the days of Daniel <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Brother Houshour and Samuel Matthews, who sometimes <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-024-3-057"/> preached for us. Later we had paid ministers for one Sunday each month. President Otis A. Burgess
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> College served us two years at $300 a year for the one
                    "Lord's Day" out of each month. My father paid most of the salary. Love
                    Jameson, Allen R. Benton, a later President of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, James W. Connor, D. R. VanBuskirk, Walter S. Campbell and David Matthews, were others
                    from the outside who were employed at intervals. Henry R. Pritchard, James P. Orr, and Harvey W.
                    Everest preached for us. On those Sundays when the local pulpit was filled by a visiting minister,
                    my father was free to preach at one of the other churches. He usually had several appointments
                    ahead. He had many more requests from the outlaying congregations than he could fill.</p>
            <p>As a preacher, my father was a near-bishop for our section of the State. While the Christian Church
                    has no bishops, his functions were much the same as those of a Bishop in other church organizations.
                    He was a natural peace-maker. Living as he did during the days of denominational antogonisms and
                    hatred, he was kept busy pouring oil on troubled waters. Many times he was called in to arbitrate
                    ugly disputes, and I remember no occasion when his advice was heeded that affairs were not settled
                    amicably. He could discern with unerring judgment the good and the bad on both sides of a dispute.
                    He always said that the good was never all on one side, nor all the bad on the other. He knew how to
                    show such things up without giving offense. He could generally succeed in making the members of each
                    party feel their own shortcomings and errors and could then obtain forgiveness from one group for
                    the other. Much good did he do in his part of the State in this capacity.</p>
            <p>He lived a clean, moral, religious, sympathetic and generous life. His example was surely seldom
                    equalled in any community of this State or any other. My father died at this home near <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange</region>
                    </placeName> in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Rush County</region>, <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>, on June 4, 1896, from cancer of the eye. His funeral discourse
                    was preached by Allen R. Benton, then President of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, a life long friend, and an old classmate at Bethany. When a young man
                    struggling to get a start as a teacher, President Benton lived at my father's house. The
                    text of the funeral discouse was: "Know ye not that a great man and Prince in <placeName>
                        <country reg="is">Israel</country>
                    </placeName> is fallen this day?" President Benton put his whole heart and soul into the
                    full meaning of his text and with trembling voice and deep sincerity <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-024-3-058"/> pronounced a touching eulogy, showing how keenly he felt the loss of
                    his old classmate, who had befrended him at the time when as a young man he had needed a
                    friendâ€”when it meant so much to him to be befriended.</p>
            <p>Attending father's funeral there was the greatest concourse of people ever gathered together
                    in that community for such a purpose. Laborers who had served him on his farm drove with horse and
                    buggy as far as twenty miles to pay him tribute and to recount tales of his goodness to them while
                    in his service.</p>
            <p>One of my sisters, Catharine, married Vachel Thomas Lindsay and became the mother of Vachel Lindsay.
                    My father did not live to know the fame of this grandson. It would have been to him a source of
                    pride to have known of the enthusiastic welcome accorded to Mr. Lindsay in 1919, when lecturing and
                    reciting at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                    </placeName> Universities. He would have been delighted to have read and to have heard the poet
                    recite "The Proud Farmer." This poem was written in honor of my father, Ephraim
                    Samuel Frazee. It presents a clearer idea of his life and work than this sketch and will serve as a
                    fitting close to my effort.</p>

            <p>In the purple and gold of the summerâ€”with the cone-flower and the helianthus in full
                    bloom, Jesse Birch passesâ€” passes forever from the great prairies, the pleasant groves,
                    the places made sacred by the memories of the past. He loved them allâ€”the vast
                    perspective of sky and plainâ€”the fields of corn rustling in the sunshineâ€”the
                    songs of the birds and the beauty of the flowers.</p>
            <p>To live wholly in the pastâ€”to search out every nook and cranny for some fact of historic
                    interestâ€”to walk in the footsteps and record the experiences of men and women long since
                    dustâ€”may not arouse the enthusiasm or engage the attention of the present age, but the
                    day will come in this community when future generations will have cause to revere the memory of a
                    man who for a quarter of a centry assidiously scrutinized every tradition, unraveled every tale,
                    pored over every ancient document and dusty tome, to preserve to the people of this locality and of
                    the whole State, the story of their pioneer forbears. There was not a single ancient landmark, a
                    cluster of oak trees, an old rock by the wayside, that did not hold for him an absorbing interest.
                    To a mind such as his, the one element of life above all others was loyaltyâ€”loyalty to
                    all the sorrows and struggles of the pastâ€”loyalty to tradition, tribe and clan
                    â€”loyalty above all to one's own hearthstone and family fireside. To him the
                    little village that sprang up on the edge of the grand prairieâ€”that became and was the
                    parent and mother of all the civilization that followedâ€”was a hallowed place. The old
                    paths that reached out into the plains beyondâ€”the places where the children played about
                    the old academyâ€”the quiet cemeteries with their flat slabs of stoneâ€”were all
                    sacrosanct. To wander too far away from these old associations and <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-024-3-061"/> scenesâ€”to cast aside as worthless all the lessons of the
                    pastâ€”were, perhaps, fraught with danger.</p>
            <p>A nation of people being made up of its component parts, the foremost workman in the temple is the
                    town or country chroniclerâ€”the man who takes us into the homes, and teaches us the
                    manners and customs of the every day folkâ€”the common men and women who have always made
                    up the great preponderating body of America's citizenship. To understand these people the
                    faithful annalist records their sacrifices. Did they seek out new lands? It was but to build up a
                    home in the wilderness for their coming children. Did they erect rude frontier churches and log
                    schools? It was but to enlighten and educate those children. Did they establish the court house and
                    the seat of justice? It was but to bring about the rule or right in the affairs of men.
                    Enlightenment, intelligence, decorumâ€”these are always the marks of true greatness. It was
                    given to Birch to vividly portray all the struggles, the pains, the adversities and the heroic
                    sacrifices of the early settlers of this county. He did it faithfully and well, without any possible
                    hope of reward, and the children of the future who read his narratives will have a loftier
                    conception of those stalwart souls who blazed the trail. To work, to strive, to arduously endeavor
                    for the good of others, is the highest conception yet attained of man's duty to his Creator
                    and to his fellow beings.</p>
            <p>Birch commenced his investigations at the time when he first began to edit the old <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                        </placeName> Tribune.</hi> A few still survived who had been young men at the time of the
                    establishment of the town in 1843. Many remembered distinctly the stirring scenes of ante-bellum
                    daysâ€”the call for volunteersâ€”the going forth of the Tenth and Fifteenth
                    Indiana Regiments. From these original characters, from old family letters and papers, from the
                    records in the public archives and other sources, he began the construction of a series of short
                    tales and accounts, which, as time passed, and the correlation of facts and events became apparent,
                    gradually evolved into a connected whole. Never was a tale more interesting or dramatic! The
                    migration of the Potawatomi Tribes, the coming of the prairie schooner that boldly struck out from
                    the banks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> into the great prairiesâ€”the building of the cabin and the breaking up of the
                    sodâ€” the fight with fevers and malariaâ€”the struggles with prairie fires in the
                    autumn and with the terrible blizzards <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-024-3-062"/> of the
                    winterâ€”the opening of the Civil Warâ€”the bugle call to arms and the marching
                    away of the hostsâ€”are all in the picture. Out of these gradually emerges the gigantic
                    form of the Republic.</p>
            <p>The days of reconstruction that followed the Warâ€”the herds that roamed through the
                    bull-grass and the blue-stemâ€”the yokes of oxen that plowed up the plains and furrowed out
                    the first drainsâ€”the laying out of the primitive roads and highways, and eventually the
                    construction of the long lines of iron rails that connected the fields of corn and droves of cattle
                    with the marts of the great cities, are all accurately and sedulously set forth, and all at once you
                    percieve that he whom you had rated as the village annalist, is in truth and in fact one of the
                    historians of the Nation, setting forth in detail and for the permanent advantage of the people the
                    story of one of those typical communities which go to make up the body of the empire.</p>
            <p>Nor has Mr. Birch neglected those finer things of lifeâ€”the eager reaching out of the
                    people for art and story, for song and poesy, for the higher and nobler sentiments and emotions,
                    that make the weary toil for existence lighter and happier. One of the proud moments of his life was
                    the occasion when he was able to present the charming tale of the Carey Sisters, of their long
                    residence in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and of their first efforts in that field of literature and song in which they
                    afterwards became so justly famous. For years he was a contributor to historical
                    magazinesâ€”took pleasure and delight in preparing articles on family history and church
                    affairs, and closed up a long and useful career by preparing and compiling for the American Legion a
                    painstaking list of all the soldiers living and dead who had entered the World War from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton County</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>His was an unostentatious life. For years he was a sufferer from physical ills that gave him endless
                    distress and misery. That he was a true lover of his fellow men is evidenced by his long and patient
                    toil in their behalf, and in and about the preservation of the traditions which have made their
                    history illustrious. The only fitting monument to his endeavors would be the publication of his many
                    and interesting writings for the edification of that public which he so faithfully served.</p>

               </placeName>. They
                    were written by Democrats who were loyal to Stephen A. Douglas in the period of his contest with
                    President Buchanan. They reveal something of what was going on in the minds of local Democratic
                    leaders of Indiana, in regard to the Lecompton controversy. In the warfare between the anti-Douglas
                    forces of the State, who were led by Senator Jesse Bright, and the champions of Douglas, the victory
                    went almost entirely to the latter. Senator Graham N. Fitch, like Bright, was hostile to Douglas.
                    John G. Davis, member of the House from a western Indiana congressional district from 1851 to 1855
                    and again from 1857-1861, was devoted to Douglas. He was a friend and adviser of local Democrats who
                    were enlisted in the cause of the Little Giant. Letters that Davis received were preserved by him,
                    but he seems not to have retained copies of the letters written by himself.</p>

                                    to rely upon them yet as a safe currency. In the past 50 years the American people
                                    has lost by state paper money enough, to wind up the rotton dishonest concerns. I do

                                    and a half, and except when he was applauded you could have heard a pin fall, so
                                    deep and intense was the interest they took in the subject &amp; speaker.</p>

                                    He handled Bright without Gloves and showed him up as a tool of the South &amp;

                                    true to their pledges he would have been President. He treated with scorn the idea
                                    of reading Douglas and his friends, out of the party. He said they would have to
                                    read the whole North West out of the party and when that was done they would be read
                                    into a most contemptible minority, that the party could not live a moment without
                                    Douglas. It was just the <hi rend="i">speech</hi> for the time and occasion. Linder

                        <p>I have no doubt, but that your time is fully occupied, without being troubled with
                                    suggestions from me Yet feeling confident, as I do, that you and I concur in
                                    political sentiment, I feel at liberty to address you a few lines. Our County
                                    Convention has not yet been held Brother Charles, and I, with other Douglass men
                                    intend to make an effort to control our convention We want to make a last effort to
                                    place the democratic party in Indiana on a platform that will enable us to secure a
                                    triumph in 1860 In order to accomplish that purpose, we must declare unequivocally
                                    in our State platform, that. If a majority of the people of a Territory are opposed
                                    to slavery they have a right to make laws to exclude it and if in favor of slavery
                                    they have a right to make laws for its protection and that it is no part of the duty
                                    of Congress to Legislate neither for the protection nor the exclusion of Slavery in
                                    the Territories; without this declaration in our platform we may as well quit and
                                    save our credit; and let the election go by default; and appropriate the time and
                                    expense usually devoted to electioneering to a more improved and perfect system of
                                    farming.</p>

                        <p>The regular Democratic Convention was held in this (Jefferson) County on Tuesday,
                                    which resulted in a complete overthrow of the Bright faction. We endorsed S. A.
                                    Douglas by nearly an unanimous vote, appointed delegates to the State Convention all
                                    out and out enthusiastic Douglas men, and instructed them to vote for no man as
                                    delegate to the <placeName>

                                    your principles. Remember Jefferson said "Measures not men". Names
                                    are nothing, Principles are eternal and the Democratic party must turn over a new
                                    leaf, in favor of economy, honesty in public affairs, and vindicate the right of the
                                    People, and not legalize slavery as national, with Supreme Court decisions, or
                                    defeat is certain and deserved. I think the South, after Gov. Wm Keist [?],

                                    as you may deem of interest to a politician; that may be for

                        <p>I have not heard from you for a long while.</p>
                        <p>I have opinions in reference to the Presidential issue differing somewhat from our

                                    </placeName> in such an event will carry every Northern State except <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, and be elected. Douglas will not cause [carry] a state uless it be <placeName>

                                    </placeName> will get the <hi rend="i">whole</hi> Republican vote, two thirds of the
                                        American<hi rend="sup">25</hi> vote, and three thousand German democratic votes.
                                    The secessionists, will have a separate electoral ticket and it will get some 7,000
                                    or 8,000 votes. The Bell ticket will get about 5,000 or 7,000 votes, and a large
                                    portion of them will be the votes of the old line Whigs who joined the Democratic
                                    party in 1854.</p>
                        <p>Knowing as I do that seccessionists truly represent the feelings of a large majority
                                    of the Southern democrats I rather hope that <placeName>

                                    </placeName> may be elected. It may have the effect to learn them some sense.</p>
                        <p>I presume if Douglas be nominated at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                                    </placeName> that it will be done in such a way as not to giive satisfaction or as
                                    to impress the public mind in his favor.</p>
                        <p>If I were Douglas I should not hesitate to withdraw as his defeat by the people would
                                    do him no good. The man who might be nominated instead would be disgracefully beaten

            <p>When the late Senator Beveridge began his work as a historian, his notable experience as public man,
                    his splendid powers of expression, and his willingness to search long and patiently were valuable
                    assets. During his period as a writer of history, he added the passion to deal impartially with men
                    and events. When preparing his life of Marshall, he was unwearied in his labors to find and study
                    the sources for himself. He employed his rare literary skill in the production of the four
                    fascinating volumes dealing with the life and times of the great jurist, but he had not then
                    attained that spirit of detachment so essential to the very best results. The volumes under review
                    reveal a splendid success in dealing fairly with the contemporaries of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Readers familiar with volumes on the great War President will hardly recognize James
                    Shields, Roger B. Taney, James Buchanan and Stephen A. Douglas as portrayed by the impartial pen of
                    Senator Beveridge.</p>

                    </placeName> is set forth as a leader slowly evolving his gifts, his powers, and his convictions in
                    regard to public questions. His rivals are not pictured as the villains of the dramaâ€”mere
                    demagogues and weaklings used to show up the virtues of the hero. There is a recognition of the fact

                    disagreed with him could be, and often were, right. It is especially true that the greatness of
                    Douglas stands out. In every chapter after the two leaders came into contact, there is evidence of
                    the strength of the man who was <placeName>

                    of 1858, just where the gifted author received his summons, is a fresh and appealing narrative.
                    Senator Beveridge sought aid from a number of persons. He asked and received much counsel, which he
                    readily and generously considered, but he went directly to the sources and made his own
                    interpretations. No previous author has written adequately of <placeName>

                    however, that, without the slightest wavering, he ignores long established views and analyzes the

                    (p. 129) as "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Ordinance of Secession". He writes also that newspapers read by <placeName>

                    </placeName> "had printed news of the secession movement before the convention
                    met." This is unfortunate. The terms "nullification" and
                    "secession" should not be used as if interchangeable. There was no secession
                    movement in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>

                    expects that this biography will go far toward exploding standardized but false notions about the

                    </placeName> and Douglas. He believes with the late Senator Beveridge that Lincoln did not demolish
                    the arguments of Douglas but rather that he eventually accepted as his own the fundamental principle
                    of Douglasâ€”that the primary object was the saving of the Union. The truth about the great
                    rivals is not that they were poles apart but that their paths converged from 1854 to 1861.</p>

                    </placeName> who will be disappointed in the new work by Senator Beveridge, at first. All lovers of
                    truth and fair play, however, will be later, if not at once, struck with the rare impartiality of
                    the volumes. It required unusual independence, an uncommon passion to set forth the unbiased facts,
                    and real courage, to write the story as presented. It is a great work, though but half completed,
                    and it will live.</p>

            <p>"A Labor of Love" would be a well deserved description of the brochure entitled <hi rend="i">The Northern Boundary of Indiana</hi> recently made available by the interesting pen of
                    Mrs. Frank J. Sheehan.</p>
            <p>Even though she gives credit for the painstaking, diligent searches and friendly cooperation, it was
                    her sense of "news value", her appreciation of the dramatic and challenging, that
                    gave direction to these searches and later, out of their fruits, made possible this interesting
                    review of the events that moved so quickly and with such startling potentiality upon the stage of
                    early Indiana history.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the fact that she almost as much, if not more than any other individual, by her enthusiasm
                    and indomitable courage, marshalled friends and resources which finally resulted in that generous
                    investment by the public and the state of Indiana, now known as the Dunes State Park of Indiana,
                    gives her an unique background out of which to know these values and to portray the figures that
                    hurry with such long range influences across that early State.</p>
            <p>"54'40 or Fight" while nationally of tremendous potentiality was not more
                    so than this ten mile strip of Indiana, as we discover easily in the pages so carefully limned for
                    our review of the changing scenes.</p>
            <p>The interplay of adventure, of greed, of stragetic moves for personal advantage or political
                    prestige, are brought out in bold relief as the author's intimate knowledge of our state,
                    her institutions, her people and her industries, the work, the <pb n="217" id="VAA4025-024-3-079"/>
                    schools and the play of the people enable the striking scenes of the narrative to be presented with
                    bold strokes.</p>
            <p>An appreciation of the importance of original sources, of the proper relation of contemporaneous
                    events and characters with sources indicated, the citing of authorities and the arrangement of these
                    in orderly fashion, all serve to give the "feel" of skill and an air of inherent
                    capacity that add to our appreciation of this delightful contribution.</p>

               </placeName>, 1928. Pp. 45.</head>
            <p>This pamphlet narrates some of the experiences of the pioneers of Southern Indiana with Indians in
                    the period from 1810 to 1815. It is a reprint of a series of letters written for <hi rend="i">The <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Brownstown</settlement>
                        </placeName> Banner</hi> in 1877. The writer of the letters obtained most of his material from
                    David Sturgeon who participated in the events and scenes of the years before and during the War of
                    1812 and described them to Mr. Chadwick.</p>
            <p>When a young man Mr. Sturgeon made flat-boat trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This was prior to the War of 1812. It was on one of these trips that he had his first
                    encounter with hostile Indians, in which he narrowly escaped death. A short time afterward, he
                    joined a company of rangers, recruited to patrol the district in which he lived. As a member of this
                    organization, he had many hazardous contacts with red men, and saw much destruction of property and
                    considerable loss of life.</p>
            <p>In the latter part of the story, the writer takes up various phases of life during and after the War
                    of 1812. He gives an account of the wedding of David Sturgeon and Nancy Hutchinson and describes a
                    log-rolling along with other incidents of the pioneer life of the time. He discusses the beginnings
                    of civilization in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson County</region>
                    </placeName> where he lived. The booklet is interesting. It reveals the strong conviction of the
                    early settlers that the Indians should be exterminated. The accounts of fights and massacres are
                    particularly vivid. The descriptions of customs and habits are valuable to students of the history
                    of the frontier period. The chronological sequence of events cannot be depended upon. Some of the
                    statements in this connection are clearly inaccurate.</p>

            <head>Comment and News</head>
            <p>With the present number, the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> passes into the hands of a
                    new Editor, who fully understands that he assumes a task which has been well performed for many
                    years by Dr. Logan Esarey. The present Editor undertakes his new responsibility in a proper spirit
                    of humility. He indulges a hope that the standard of the Magazine may not be lowered. If he shall
                    succeed in maintaining the level of the past, it must be through the cooperation and generous aid of
                    all who are interested in the study of the sources of Indiana history, and in the writing of papers
                    in that field.</p>
            <p>The work of an editor is neither a simple nor an easy task. He must read critically such papers as
                    are submitted for publication, in order to discover as far as possible errors of fact, of
                    composition, and of form. He must assume the responsibility of deciding whether the quality of
                    articles submitted is such as to justify publication. He must reject papers that are not up to a
                    fair level of merit, or that are not adapted to the purpose of the Magazine. He should, at times,
                    advise those willing to prepare articles, and point out to them ways in which their work may be
                    improved. He must somehow discover unpublished documents of value, and persons who have the capacity
                    to write. At the best, he may, occasionally, find his barrel as barren of matter suitable for
                    publication, as Mother Hubbard found her cupboard of bones for her dog. The Magazine will be due,
                    nevertheless, in March, June, September and December of each year.</p>
            <pb n="219" id="VAA4025-024-3-081"/>
            <p>The following from the "Introduction" of the ably edited first volume of the <hi rend="i">John Askin Papers</hi> (see review in this Magazine for June, 1928), is from the pen of
                    Dr. M. M. Quaife, and it should prove suggestive to those who may prepare documents for publication
                    and to those who may quote from sources when preparing historical papers: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>To some extent every piece of historical editing presents problems peculiar to itself, to
                            whose solution the editor devotes whatever measure of scholarly skill and judgment he may
                            command. A statement of certain problems encountered in the editing of the <hi rend="i">Askin Papers</hi>, together with the solution hit upon, may prove advantageous to the
                            reader who shall have occasion to consult the volumes. In general the printed document aims
                            to present a scrupulously accurate copy of the original manuscript. But since it is
                            impossible to represent in print numerous idiosyncracies of longhand manuscripts, the Editor
                            has steadily endevored to reproduce the evident intent of the writer, but to escape a
                            slavish adherence to mere pedanticism. In the matter of punctuation, for example, it becomes
                            frequently a matter for editorial interpretation whether a given mark of the penman shall be
                            printed as a comma or as a period. Such interpretation we have not hesitated to supply. Of
                            similar import, the penman of a century ago often distributed dashes in liberal measure
                            across his page in a fashion which finds no precise equivalent in modern typography. We have
                            made no prtense of reproducing these except in cases where their representation has some
                            discoverable significance; and where the penman's dash has seemed to signify the
                            equivalent of the comma or period as employed in modern printing, we have reproduced it as
                            such. So to with words underscored in the manuscripts. The equivalent in print of this usage
                            is the employment of italics, and all publishing houses have established rules governing the
                            resort to such usage. But the underscoring of the penman, like his employment of dashes,
                            commonly prossesses no discoverable significance, and when such significance has seemed
                            lacking we have not transferred the underscoring into print.</p>

            <p>Documents that are printed and passages that are quoted from the sources often refer to individuals
                    about whom most readers can not be expected to have a knowledge. Doctor Quaife believes in a policy
                    of footnote annotation that furnishes biographical information concerning the personages who figure
                    in the documents. In regard to this practice, he writes: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Probably few readers will ever realize how greatly this conception of the editorial task has
                            served to increase its arduousness. A footnote that may be read in the fraction of a minute
                            may have cost (and frequently has) many hours of toil to prepare. Frequently too, with the
                            acquirement of additional pertinent information, it has been resived again and again before
                            reaching the form it finally assumes in print.</p>

            <p>The <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> has had a loyal group of supporters in the past.
                    Many of these have contributed to its columns a number of times, and may be counted on for articles
                    in the future. Undobutedly, there are many others who have ability to prepare historical papers, who
                    have as yet submitted nothing. Some of these possible contributors have lived through important
                    experiences, witnessed important events, or have access to valuable documents. It is hoped that such
                    persons will acquire an interest in the work of the Magazine, and that they will become contributors
                    of reminiscences, articles based on research, or documents, in order that the history of Indiana may

                            described. In the first line, "Pleasant tp." should read "Craig
                            tp." In the second line, "Jefferson co." should be followed by
                            "Craig tp." All the land described is located in <placeName>
